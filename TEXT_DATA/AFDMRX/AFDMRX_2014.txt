.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MID LEVEL MOISTURE HAS 
REMAINED ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA LONGER THAN EXPECTED. HOWEVER...CURRENT
VIS SAT DOES SHOW CLOUDS STARTING TO THIN. CLOUDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO
SLOWLY THIN INTO EARLY EVENING WHERE CLEAR SKIES WILL EVENTUALLY
TAKE OVER TONIGHT. CLEARING SKIES WILL ALLOW FOR A COLD NIGHT WITH
LOWS ANYWHERE FROM 6 TO 8 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.
GENERALLY...TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER TEENS TO LOW AND MID 20S ARE
EXPECTED. TOMORROW STARTS OUT AS A NICE DAY BUT CLOUDS WILL ONCE
AGAIN BE ON THE INCREASE BY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON. LOOK FOR CLOUDS
TO SLOWLY INCREASE FROM SW TO NE AS THE DAY PROGRESSES AS OUR NEXT
WEATHER SYSTEM APPROACHES.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...RAINY WEEKEND 
STILL ON TAP AS A PROLONGED SW TAP OUT OF THE GULF WILL KEEP 
MOISTURE FLOW OVER AREA FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. PEAK PRECIP PERIODS 
LOOK TO BE SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT IN WHICH THE HEAVIEST RAIN 
WILL FALL. ROUGHLY ONE TO ONE-AND-A-HALF INCHES OF RAIN WILL FALL 
THROUGH THE ENTIRE EVENT. 

AT THE ONSET THOUGH...LATE THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY MORNING...THERE MAY 
BE SOME TIME WHEN FREEZING RAIN OR SLEET WILL TEMPORARILY 
OCCUR...BUT WE WILL FIND OURSELVES IN A WARMING ENVIRONMENT OVERALL 
BEGINNING ON FRIDAY...THUS ACCUMULATIONS OF ANY ICE SHOULD BE LIGHT 
AND TEMPORARY.
 
A WEAK DISTURBANCE MID WEEK WILL BRING A FEW SNOW SHOWERS TO THE 
NORTHERN VALLEY AND MOUNTAINS. BELOW NORMAL TEMPS WILL DOMINATE THE 
LATTER PORTION OF THE EXTENDED...MON-WED.

WINDS AND COLD TEMPERATURES NOTED EARLY THIS MORNING. 

A WEAK TROUGH WILL TRANSLATE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES BY TONIGHT

OVERNIGHT THE THIN CLOUDS WILL GIVE WAY TO MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS.
GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING EXPECTED TO DROP TEMPERATURES INTO THE
TEENS AND LOWER 20S FOR MOST LOCATIONS IN E TN...SW VA AND SW NC.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MAIN WEATHER OF INTEREST IS 
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY FRIDAY MORNING...WITH MODELS TRENDING 
TOWARD LESS LIKELY CHANCES OF FREEZING RAIN. THE NAM MOS POPS ARE 
HIGHER THAN GFS...BUT NAM ISENTROPIC LIFT FOR LATE THURSDAY NIGHT IS 
MORE FOCUSED TO OUR W AND SW THROUGH 12Z FRIDAY. NAM MODEL FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS ALSO SHOW A SUFFICIENT WARM NOSE ABOVE THE SURFACE TO 
INHIBIT WINTRY MIX FOR SMOKIES...AND FINALLY QPF FROM EVEN THE SREF 
AND/OR ENSEMBLES IS BARELY 0.01 OF AN INCH. 

MODEL CONSENSUS IS SUGGESTING NO PRECIPITATION ANYWHERE NORTH OF I-
40 UNTIL AROUND 15Z FRIDAY. MIN TEMPS MAY STILL DIP BELOW 32 DEGREES 
OVER NE TN AND SW VA...SO KEPT IN A BRIEF MENTION OF POSSIBLE ZR- IN 
THOSE AREAS THRU 15Z FRIDAY.

SATURDAY WITH A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS ON SATURDAY FOR ALL BUT NE 
TN AND SW VA. NUDGED POPS UP TO CATEGORICAL ACROSS THE BOARD BY

.SHORT TERM... (TODAY THROUGH TOMORROW NIGHT) CLOUDS ARE STUBBORN TO 
GET OUT OF THE AREA TODAY WHICH HAS LED TO TEMPS NOT BEING AS HIGH 
AS PREVIOUSLY FORECASTED. STILL THINK THAT THE CLOUDS SHOULD STILL 
CONTINUE TO SLOWLY MOVE OUT THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT. WITH THESE 
CLOUDS STICKING AROUND MOISTURE IS STILL PRESENT WHICH IS LEADING TO 
VERY ISOLATED LOCATIONS OF LIGHT RAIN ALONG AND NEAR THE EASTERN 
BORDER. OTHERWISE NOT EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF WEATHER AS WE 
MOVE TOWARDS MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES FOR TOMORROW.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...WEAK RIDGING SURFACE 
AND ALOFT WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY WILL GIVE WAY TO INCREASING 
SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AS AN UPPER TROUGH OVER SOUTHWEST UNITED STATES 
BEGINS TO EJECT EAST INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. BY LATE THURSDAY 
NIGHT AND FRIDAY...CLOUDS WILL INCREASE AND ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL 
SPREAD PRECIPITATION INTO MAINLY THE SOUTHERN HALF OF TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. SURFACE TEMPERATURES MAY BE COLD ENOUGH TO 
BEGIN THE PRECIPITATION AS LIGHT FREEZING RAIN. WILL NEED TO WATCH 
THIS DEVELOP FOR POSSIBLE DRIVING PROBLEMS.

SOUTHWEST UPPER TROUGH LIFTS EAST NORTHEAST AND PHASES WITH A 
NORTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE ACROSS THE MID-WEST/GREAT LAKES AREA. 
STRONG CYCLO-GENESIS DEVELOPS OVER THE GREAT LAKES WITH ASSOCIATED 
FRONTAL PASSAGE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY SATURDAY/SATURDAY 
EVENING. THE STRENGTHENING BOUNDARY LAYER JET ASSOCIATED WITH 
CYCLOGENESIS MAY PRODUCE STRONG/GUSTS WINDS OVER THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS SATURDAY. A BAND OF RAIN IS ANTICIPATED SATURDAY/SATURDAY 
NIGHT. LATEST FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW LIMITED INSTABILITY ALOFT...
SO WILL KEEP THUNDER OUT OF THE FORECAST.

FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL (WEST-NORTHWEST 
FLOW) ACROSS THE NATION WITH LARGE SURFACE RIDGE BUILDING INTO THE 
NATION. BESIDES SOME SHOWERS OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE EARLY SUNDAY...A RETURN OF MOSTLY DRY CONDITIONS 
ANTICIPATED THROUGH THE REST OF THE FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LAST AREA OF LIGHT RAIN OR
DRIZZLE LINGERS OVER MAINLY NE TN AND SW VA THIS MORNING. TEMPS
HAVE CHILLED ENOUGH FOR PATCHY LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES OVER WISE AND
RUSSELL COUNTIES IN SW VA. HOWEVER...LOOKING AT FORECAST SOUNDINGS
FOR THE NRN AND SMOKY MTNS OF EAST TN...APPEARS THE MOISTURE IS TOO
SHALLOW FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT SNOW IN THOSE AREAS.

NORTHERLY FLOW IN THE LOWER LEVELS SHOULD LEAD TO DECREASING CLOUDS
WITH NAM MODEL SHOWING A STEADY DECREASE IN RH IN THE 900 TO 800
MB LAYER TODAY. ZONAL FLOW ALOFT MAY BRING SOME PATCHY MID AND HIGH
CLOUDS BACK INTO THE REGION TONIGHT.

FOR TEMPS...EVEN WITH BREAKS OF SUNSHINE THE COLD AIR ADVECTION
SHOULD KEEP MAXES A FEW DEGREES BELOW CLIMO...AND IN LINE WITH GFS
MOS. LIGHT NORTH WINDS TONIGHT COULD AFFECT MINS MORE SO THAN THE
FEW PASSING MID-HI CLOUDS...CLOSE TO A MOS BLEND LOOKED GOOD.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTINUE TO BUILD ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY THROUGH THURSDAY UNDER 
ZONAL FLOW. COLD AND MOSTLY CLEAR NIGHTS WITH COOL DAYTIME 
TEMPERATURES CAN BE EXPECTED. 

THE NEXT SYSTEM TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA WILL DIG INTO THE FOUR 
CORNERS BY THURSDAY. RETURN SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL COMMENCE OVER THE SE 
U.S. BY THURSDAY NIGHT. PRECIPITATION WILL SPREAD NORTHEAST AND INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA BY FRIDAY. THE TROUGH AND THE ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT WILL TAKE ITS TIME MOVING EAST...THUS THE FIRST HALF OF THE 
WEEKEND WILL LIKELY BE WET WITH DIMINISHING RAIN CHANCES BY SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURE PROFILES INDICATE A SMALL WINDOW OF SNOW 
AND/OR ICE PELLETS THURSDAY NIGHT AND EARLY FRIDAY MORNING. HOWEVER 
THE SURGE OF LOW LEVEL WARM AIR MAY OVERCOME THE COOL AIR. THIS WILL 
BE SOMETHING TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE NEXT FEW DAYS. SATURDAY AND 
SATURDAY NIGHT THERE MAY BE A RUMBLE OF THUNDER WITH SOME OF THE 
HEAVIER SHOWERS. COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL FILTER IN SUNDAY AND 
SUNDAY NIGHT WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST FULL 
WEEK OF THE NEW YEAR.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TOMORROW NIGHT)... THICK CLOUDS UP TO
AROUND 700MB ARE STICKING AROUND THE AREA AND I EXPECT THEM TO
CONTINUE TO REMAIN SO THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. OUR TEMPS TODAY
HAVE NOT CHANGED MUCH FROM THE OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPS THIS MORNING,
ONLY A HANDFUL OF DEGREES IN MOST SPOTS. THERE IS A CHANCE FOR SOME
FOG OVERNIGHT, BUT AT THIS TIME DON'T THINK IT WILL BE AS BAD AS
LAST NIGHT SINCE THE NORTH WINDS WE'VE SEEN ALL DAY SHOULD CONTINUE
INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AND ADVECT IN SOME LOWER DEWPOINTS. THIS
COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT CLOUDS SHOULD STICK AROUND OVERNIGHT
MEANS THAT HOPEFULLY TEMPS WON'T DROP DOWN AND MEET DEW POINTS
OVERNIGHT. TOMORROW SOME PLACES SHOULD FINALLY SEE SUNSHINE AS THE
LAST BIT OF MOISTURE MOVES OUT OF THE AREA AND WE START TO CLEAR
OUT FROM WEST TO EAST. STILL A CHANCE THAT REMNANT MOISTURE COULD
CAUSE SOME LIGHT RAIN AND VERY LIGHT SNOW IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS
BEFORE IT MOVES OUT, BUT NOT EXPECTING MUCH, IF ANY,IN THE WAY OF
ACCUMULATIONS.


.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...WANTED A NICE 
WEEKEND COMING UP? NOT IN LUCK AGAIN. NEXT WEATHER MAKER WILL MOVE 
INTO AREA LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...AND BRING GOOD CHANCES OF 
PRECIPITATION...MOSTLY RAIN...FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. 
IN FACT...EXPECT LIKELY POPS FRI NIGHT THROUGH SAT NIGHT. NOTE THAT 
SUBFREEZING TEMPERATURES FRIDAY MORNING MAY LET THE ONSET OF LIGHT 
PRECIP BEGIN A LITTLE ON THE WINTRY SIDE... BUT I REPEAT IT SHOULD 
BE LIGHT ON INTENSITY. TEMPS WILL WARM ABOVE FREEZING MOSTLY BY LATE 
MORNING FRI AND SWITCH OVER TO RAIN. LINGERING PRECIP ON SUNDAY 
TAPERS OFF FOR MONDAY WITH ONLY SLIGHT CHANCES IN SW VA...THEN NO

LAYER SLIGHTLY. HOWEVER...STILL AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF LIGHT RAIN OR 
DRIZZLE NOTED UPSTREAM ON AREA RADARS. BROAD AREA OF ISENTROPIC LIFT

ESPECIALLY OVER ERN AREAS...NE TN AND SW VA.

MOISTURE UP TO AT LEAST 700 MBS LINGERS UP TO AROUND MIDNIGHT...THEN

LOW RAIN CHANCES IN THROUGH 12Z TUESDAY...

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...LINGERING LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE EARLY TUESDAY COULD SQUEEZE OUT A LITTLE RAIN OR SNOW
ACROSS EXTREME EASTERN PARTS OF NE TN AND SW VA TUESDAY
MORNING...OTHERWISE DRY AND COLD AIR MASS FROM THE NORTHERN ROCKIES
AND PLAINS TO MOVE SOUTHEAST INTO THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY
TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. SKIES WILL BEGIN CLEARING BY EARLY
TUESDAY FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR TUESDAY EVENING.
TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR AVERAGE TUESDAY. BUT TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY NIGHTS AS WELL AS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY DAYS WILL BE BE
BELOW NORMAL AS COLD ARCTIC AIR MASS MOVES INTO THE REGION FROM THE
NW. MODELS STILL NOT SURE ON TIMING WITH NEXT SYSTEM. GFS AND
CANADIAN WANTS TO BRING MOISTURE IN LATE THURSDAY NIGHT WITH ECMWF
SLOWING SYSTEM TO MOISTEN ATMOSPHERE FRIDAY. SOME SNOW OR LIGHT
FREEZING RAIN COULD AFFECT THE AREA LATE THURSDAY NIGHT OR EARLY
FRIDAY. THE SLOWER ECMWF WOULD LIKELY START PRECIPITATION LATER
FRIDAY WHICH WOULD LIKELY ALLOW ENOUGH WARMING FOR IT TO BEGIN AS
RAIN. STRONG SW FLOW TO GET GOING FRIDAY OR FRIDAY NIGHT AS LOW
PRESSURE FROM THE TX GULF COAST MOVES NE TOWARDS THE TN VALLEY.
MOISTURE MOVING OVER THE FRONT WILL KEEP CLOUDS AND RAIN OVER THE
TN VALLEY SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY AS THE FRONT MOVES SLOWLY EAST
ACROSS THE SE STATES. TEMPERATURES STAY COOL FRIDAY AS SKIES BECOME
CLOUDY AND THEN WARM INTO THE 50S FOR THE WEEKEND AS WARMER AIR
MOVES UP FROM THE GULF COAST WITH THE FRONT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...WEAK COLD FRONT ALONG CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE AREA THIS EVENING AND 
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS OVERNIGHT. AREA OF RAIN HAS WAINED 
ACROSS THE AREA AS MID LEVEL SPEED MAX HAS MOVED OFF TO THE NE. 
ENTRANCE REGION OF UPPER LEVEL JET WILL KEEP RAIN GOING BEHIND COLD 
FRONT THROUGH TONIGHT. PRECIPITATION WILL WEAKEN SOME OVERNIGHT. 
POST FRONTAL COLD AIR VERY SHALLOW. BOUNDARY LAYER WILL REMAIN 
SATURATED THROUGH MONDAY MORNING. AREAS OF FOG WILL CONTINUE 
OVERNIGHT AND COULD BECOME DENSE WITH WEAK SURFACE FLOW. MID LEVEL 
DRIES OUT ON MONDAY WHILE LOW LEVELS REMAIN VERY HUMID. LIGHT RAIN 
OR DRIZZLE POSSIBLE INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS. TEMPERATURES WILL 
REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL. 
 
.LONG TERM... SHOULD BE SOME REMNANT MOISTURE IN THE AREA OVERNIGHT 
MONDAY INTO TUESDAY AS SOME UPPER LEVEL ENERGY MOVES ACROSS NORTH OF 
THE AREA THAT COULD LEAD TO SOME ADDITIONAL LIGHT SHOWERS. WITH THE 
SECONDARY COLD FRONT TEMPS WILL DEFINITELY COOL DOWN ACROSS THE 
AREA. AFTER THE FRONT IS THROUGH THE AREA WE DRY OUT FOR A COUPLE OF 
DAYS WITH VERY LITTLE WARMING THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. 

NEXT SYSTEM TO FOCUS ON WILL COME AFTER NEW YEARS DAY AS A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS NEW MEXICO BEFORE THE MODELS START TO 
DIVERGE IN WHAT TO DO WITH THE SYSTEM. GFS WANTS TO KICK OUT THE 
SYSTEM AS THE TROUGH GOES NEGATIVELY TILTED WEST OF US LEADING TO 
WARMER TEMPS AND A LATER ONSET OF PRECIP. WHILE THE ECMWF WANTS TO 
BE MUCH SLOWER AND FURTHER SOUTH WITH THE SYSTEM, HAVING THE CENTER 
OF THE LOW MOVE JUST NORTH OF THE AREA. TEMPS WILL BE COLD ENOUGH 
OVERNIGHT FRIDAY THAT THE SYSTEM COULD HAVE SOME SNOW MIXED IN WITH 
IT AS WELL. OF NOTE TO WATCH WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL BE A LOW LEVEL 
JET FROM THE SOUTH/SOUTHWEST ON FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY WHICH WILL 
BRING IN A VERY WARM LAYER OF AIR JUST ABOVE THE SURFACE. RIGHT NOW 
ALL THE MODELS AND GUIDANCE ARE COMING IN WITH TEMPS ABOVE FREEZING 
OVERNIGHT FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY...HOWEVER IF SYSTEM COMES IN STRONGER 
THAN ANTICIPATED, LEADING TO COLDER SURFACE TEMPS, AND THE LOW LEVEL 
JET IS STILL CRANKING, CAUSING A VERY WARM LAYER ABOVE THE SURFACE, 
THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME FREEZING RAIN WILL BE PRESENT. AT THIS POINT

TODAY IS NOT THAT COLD SO HIGHS MONDAY TO BE IN THE 50S. MONDAY
NIGHT AND TUESDAY SECONDARY FRONT WITH COLDER AIR MASS MOVES IN
WITH A CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE IN THE SW VA MOUNTAINS...BUT
MOSTLY RAIN SHOWERS ELSEWHERE. LARGE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WITH COLD

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...LOW LEVEL RIDGE AXIS 
EXTENDS WEST INTO E TN VALLEY THIS EVENING. RELATIVELY DRY LOWER 
LAYERS HOLDING ON THIS AFTERNOON. PROLONGED AND GOOD ISENTROPIC IN 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL ERODE LOWER DRY LAYER THIS EVENING. 
WIDESPREAD RAIN WILL OVERTAKE THE AREA AND CONTINUE THROUGH SUNDAY 
NIGHT. WARM CLOUD LAYER BECOMES VERY DEEP. PWAT VALUES RISE ABOVE 
1.00 TO NEAR 1.35 WHICH IS 2 STANDARD DEVIATIONS ABOVE NORMAL FOR 
THIS TIME OF YEAR. RAINFALL AMOUNTS THROUGH MONDAY MORNING WILL 
RANGE FROM NEAR ONE INCH IN THE NORTH TO NEAR TWO AND ONE HALF 
INCHES IN THE SOUTH. RAINFALL RATES WILL BECOME MODERATE AT TIMES 
BUT RATES SHOULD BE LIGHT ENOUGH TO AVOID AREAL FLOODING. LOCALIZED 
MINOR FLOODING IS POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY ACROSS WESTERN AND SOUTHERN 
AREAS. WINDS WILL BE LIGHT IN ADVANCE OF APPROACHING COLD FRONT. 
COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON FOLLOWED BY UPPER 
SPEED MAX AXIS SUNDAY NIGHT WHICH WILL KEEP SOME POST FRONTAL 
PRECIPITATION GOING OVERNIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL BE RELATIVELY MILD 
BUFFERED BY CLOUDS AND RAIN.  
 

.LONG TERM...MOST OF THE HEAVIEST PRECIP SHOULD BE OUT OF THE AREA 
BY MONDAY EVENING INTO MONDAY NIGHT. ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH DURING THE DAY/EVENING ON TUESDAY, COULD MAKE TEMPS A BIT 
TRICKY DEPENDING ON WHEN THE FRONT ACTUALLY MOVES THROUGH. BUT 
REGARDLESS OF WHEN IT MOVES THROUGH TEMPS ACROSS THE AREA WILL BE ON 
AVERAGE 10 DEGREES COOLER ON OVERNIGHT TUESDAY AND DURING THE DAY ON 
WEDNESDAY. IF THERE IS ENOUGH MOISTURE LEFT OVER FROM WEEKEND STORMS 
THE FRONT COULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO TRIGGER SOME LINGERING LIGHT 
SHOWERS, AND MAYBE EVEN A FEW BRIEF LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA.

AFTER THIS SYSTEM AND THE SECONDARY COLD FRONT HAVE MOVED EAST OF 
THE AREA NEARLY ZONAL FLOW SETS UP FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. NEXT SYSTEM 
LOOKS TO BE A UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN U.S. BUT 
THE MODELS ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT AT ALL WITH THE PATH AND SPEED OF 
THIS SYSTEM. ECMWF WANTS TO BRING IT FURTHER SOUTH AND SLOW IT DOWN 
ALLOWING A GOOD PORTION OF THE ENERGY AND PRECIP TO MOVE OVER OUR 
AREA LEADING TO ANOTHER ROUND OF MULTIPLE DAYS OF STEADY MODERATE 
PRECIP. WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND THE GFS WANTS TO MOVE IT SHALLOWER 
AND FASTER THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES REGION AND LEADING TO A QUICKER 
SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T BRING AS MUCH PRECIP. IT DOES LOOK LIKE A GOOD 
PORTION OF THE AREA WILL BE COLD ENOUGH TO SEE SOME SNOW MIXED IN 
WITH THE RAIN DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AS THIS SYSTEM MOVES 
THROUGH.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SOME ENHANCED RADAR RETURNS 
PASSING NE ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA EARLY THIS MORNING...BUT TEMP DEW 
POINT TEMP DEPRESSIONS REMAIN LARGE. THUS...LOOKS SAFE TO CARRY NO 
RAIN CHANCES UNTIL LATER TODAY FOR MAINLY THE WRN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. ISENTROPIC LIFT ON THE 295K LEVEL DOES REACH NE TN BY 
21Z TO 00Z...BUT MOS POPS ARE VERY LOW FOR NE TN AND SW VA WITH A 
FEW SPRINKLES AT BEST.

THE MID AND HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD ONLY GRADUALLY THICKEN TODAY...SO NE 
AREAS SHOULD HAVE POTENTIAL TO REACH AT LEAST A MOS BLEND. WRN AREAS 
STARTING OUT QUITE MILD THIS MORNING...SO 55 TO 60 FOR MAXES LOOKS 
REASONABLE. ACTUALLY HAD TO RAISE 07Z TEMPS IN THE GRIDS BY 3 TO 7 
DEGREES ACROSS THE BOARD DUE TO THE PASSING CLOUD COVER. 

OTHERWISE...NUDGED RAIN CHANCES UP TO THE HIGHER GFS MOS POPS AND 
ADDED SOME MODERATE RAINS FOR LATER TONIGHT. GFS MOS MINS WERE 
FAVORED OVER THE NAM MINS.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...STEADY RAIN SUNDAY AS COLD
FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST. ONLY EXPECT ABOUT A
10 DEGREE RISE FROM MORNING LOWS. RAINFALL AMOUNTS COULD REACH
ABOUT ONE INCH FOR THE 24 HOUR PERIOD ENDING MONDAY MORNING AT 12Z.
ISOLATED LOCATIONS IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY...PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS
COULD HAVE OVER 2 INCHES IN THE 48 HOUR PERIOD WHICH COULD CAUSE
ISOLATED FLOODING. COLD FRONT SHOULD BE EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA
BY SUNDAY EVENING. NAM IS FASTER WITH ENDING PRECIPITATION BUT GFS
AND ECMWF KEEP SOME WRAPAROUND PRECIPITATION BEHIND THE FRONT
MONDAY. GFS HAS SECONDARY LOW MOVE NE ALONG FRONT MONDAY WHICH
SLOWS IT DOWN. POPS MONDAY HOWEVER WILL BE LOWER THAN GUIDANCE
MAINLY IN THE LOW CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE DECREASING TO A
SLIGHT CHANCE MONDAY NIGHT. DRIER AIR MASS MOVES IN TUESDAY WITH
HIGH PRESSURE. WEAK DRY COLD FRONT WEDNESDAY SHIFTS UPPER FLOW TO
NW AND COLDER TEMPERATURES. HIGHER PRESSURE SHIFTS EAST THURSDAY
NIGHT WITH MOISTURE RAPIDLY INCREASING FROM THE WEST. PRECIPITATION
TO MOVE IN OVERNIGHT AND INCREASE FRIDAY. THE PRECIPITATION WILL
LIKELY MIX WITH SNOW UNTIL TEMPERATURES WARM ENOUGH FRIDAY.

310 PM EST FRI DEC 26 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
REMAIN OVER THE AREA TONIGHT THEN SLIDE EAST AND WEAKEN ON SATURDAY. 
HIGH CLOUDS WILL STREAM NORTHEAST ACROSS THE REGION TONIGHT. CLOUD 
DECKS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND LOWER ON SATURDAY. ISENTROPIC 
LIFT INCREASES INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS. LOWER LAYERS REMAIN FAIRLY 
DRY EARLY. LIGHT RAIN WILL EVENTUALLY WORK DOWN TO THE SURFACE 
ACROSS SW AREAS BY THE AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOVE 
NORMAL...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NE WHERE EVAPORATIVE COOLING WILL BE 
LIMITED. 

.LONG TERM...RAIN WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE IN FROM THE WEST AND SOUTH 
SATURDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT. STILL A VERY OUTSIDE CHANCE 
FOR A RUMBLE OF THUNDER NEAR CHATTANOOGA, BUT THINK THAT MOST, IF 
NOT ALL OF IT, SHOULD REMAIN CONFINED TO NEAR THE GULF OF MEXICO, 
AND AWAY FROM US SO WILL NOT MENTION IT IN THE FORECAST. RAIN SHOULD 
CONTINUE PRETTY STEADILY THROUGH EARLY MONDAY. GFS IS STILL AN 
OUTLIER AT THIS POINT AS IT PUSHES THE MOISTURE SOUTH OF THE AREA 
AND CLEARS OUT PRECIP MUCH FASTER THAN SOME OF THE OTHER MODELS. 
THINK THAT IT IS A LITTLE TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH THIS SLOW MOVING FRONT 
SO HAVE TRENDED TOWARDS THE WETTER EURO/CANADIAN/NAM. AS THE SYSTEM 
EXITS THERE IS A CHANCE FOR SOME VERY LIGHT SNOW IN THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS IN THE NORTH, AND AT THIS TIME LOOKS LIKE ACCUMULATIONS 
WILL BE VERY MINIMAL.

AS SOON AS THIS SYSTEM LEAVES A COLD FRONT WILL BE KNOCKING ON THE 
DOOR WHICH SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE AREA ON TUESDAY AND CAUSE HIGHS 
TO BE ABOUT 10 DEGREES COOLER. AFTER THAT NEARLY ZONAL FLOW SETS UP 
UNTIL A UPPER LEVEL LOW WANTS TO KICK OUT WEST OF THE AREA. 
TIMING/STRENGTH/LOCATION IS STILL DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN AT THE TIME, 
BUT WITH TEMPS STILL COLD AFTER THE FRONT ON TUESDAY MORE OF THE 
AREA COULD SEE SOME SNOW WITH THIS SYSTEM AS IT MOVES THROUGH.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SKIES MOSTLY CLEAR THIS MORNING
EXCEPT FOR PASSING PATCHY HIGH CLOUDS. THE MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER
WITH NEAR CALM WINDS WAS ALLOWING PATCHY AREAS OF FOG TO FORM...
AS FREEZING FOG IN THE FEW SPOTS NOTED THROUGH 08Z. OTHERWISE...
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE ON TAP WITH WARMER MAX TEMPS EXPECTED AS THE
SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE HOLD. NAM MOS MAXES LOOKED TOO COOL...
SO KEPT CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS MAX TEMP GRID.

FOR TONIGHT...THE SURFACE RIDGE ONLY SHIFTS SLIGHTLY EASTWARD TO
POSSIBLY ALLOW A LIGHT SOUTHERLY FLOW ACROSS OUR WRN MOST COUNTIES.
GFS AND NAM DIFFER SLIGHTLY ON THE AMOUNT OF MID TO HIGH CLOUDS
LATE WITH BOTH INDICATING LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS. BLENDED THE
DIFFERING MOS MINS...FAVORING THE COLDER GFS MINS WHERE SKIES STAY
MOSTLY CLEAR OVERNIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...RIDGING MOVES EAST 
SATURDAY WITH CLOUDS INCREASING AND RAIN SPREADING IN FROM SOUTHWEST 
TO NORTHEAST BY SATURDAY EVENING AHEAD OF COLD FRONT MOVING INTO MS 
AND TN VALLEYS SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. THE FRONT IS FAIRLY SLOW 
WITH SURFACE LOW MOVING UP ALONG IT ON SUNDAY. BEST INSTABILITY 
STAYS SOUTH OF TN SUNDAY SO THINK THUNDER CHANCES TOO LOW TO MENTION 
SOUTH. STILL GOING WITH NAM/ECMWF HAVING A TRAILING LOW FROM THE SW 
RIDE UP ALONG THE FRONT LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY WITH RAIN 
CONTINUEING THROUGH MONDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE MILD SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY IN THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S AND 50S TO NEAR 60 SUNDAY. A 
COOLING TREND THEN MONDAY INTO TUESDAY BEHIND COLD FRONT. AS 
PRECIPITATION MOVES OUT MONDAY EVENING IN THE NORTHEAST THERE COULD 
BE A LITTLE SNOW MIXED IN BUT AMOUNTS WILL NOT BE SIGNIFICANT. AIR 
MASSS DRIES OUT AS HIGH PRESSURE AND WEST TO EAST FLOW TAKES OVER 
TUESDAY. TUESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY A WEAK FRONT PASSES 
THROUGH BRINGING IN MUCH COLDER AIR MASS AS FLOW SWITCHES TO THE NW. 
HIGHS WILL BE BELOW NORMAL WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY IN THE UPPER 30S 
TO MID 40S WITH LOWS IN THE 20S.

THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. LAYER HUMIDITIES WILL CONTINUE TO LOWER. 
LIGHT WINDS WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES TONIGHT. A MILD WARM UP ON 
FRIDAY. 
 

.LONG TERM...LONG TERM STARTS UNDER SLIGHT RIDGING BEFORE MOISTURE 
IS DRAWN UP FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO AHEAD OF A INCOMING COLD FRONT. 
LOOKS LIKE PRECIP SHOULD START IN THE SOUTHWEST PARTS OF THE AREA 
OVERNIGHT SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. CAN'T RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SOME LIGHTNING IN THE FAR SOUTHWEST, BUT AT THIS TIME THINK THE 
CHANCE IS LOW AND NO SEVERE WEATHER IS EXPECTED. MODELS REALLY START 
TO DIVERGE AT THIS POINT WITH WHAT TO DO WITH THE TAIL END OF THE 
SYSTEM. THE GFS WANTS TO CUT OFF THE MOISTURE OVERNIGHT LATE SUNDAY, 
WHILE THE GFS/CANADIAN/AND LIKELY NAM WANT TO KEEP THE MOISTURE AND 
PRECIPITATION AROUND THROUGH MONDAY EVENING. HAVE TRENDED TOWARDS 
THE MAJORITY HERE AND KEPT AT LEAST CHANCE POPS THROUGH MONDAY 
EVENING ACROSS THE AREA.

AFTER THAT NEARLY ZONAL FLOW SETS UP LEADING TO HIGHS IN THE 40'S 
AND LOWS IN THE 30'S TO UPPER 20'S. THEN LOOKS LIKE THE NEXT BEST 
CHANCE OF PRECIP COMES JUST BEYOND THE 7 DAY FORECAST AS A LOW

.DISCUSSION...
COLD AIR PUSHING INTO THE AREA NOW...AND SURFACE TEMPS ARE RUNNING
ABOUT 3-4 DEGREES AHEAD OF SCHEDULE COOLING RIGHT NOW. LOOKS LIKE
TEMPS WILL LEVEL OFF...SO HAVE DECIDED NOT TO UPDATE MIN TEMPS. FOR
THE SKY COVER...MODELS ARE STILL SHOWING MOVING OVER THE TOP OF
THE SURFACE COOL/MOIST AIR MASS. THINK THIS WILL RESULT IN STUBBORN
CLOUDS INTO THE AFTERNOON FOR CHRISTMAS DAY...SO HAVE BUMPED UP SKY
COVER ACCORDINGLY. STILL LOOKING LIKE MINIMAL SNOW AMOUNTS FOR THIS
EVENT AND CONFINED TO THE MOUNTAINS.

.AVIATION...
COLD FRONT NOW PUSHING THROUGH THE REGION...HEAVIER SHOWERS LOOK TO
BE LIFTING NORTHWARD OUT OF THE AREA. STILL SOME TRAILIING LIGHT
SHOWERS MIGHT LOWER THE VSBY A BIT THROUGH ABOUT 05Z. THINKING
THERE WILL BE ENOUGH OF A BREEZE AND MIXING TO PREVENT MUCH FOG
FORMING TONIGHT. HOWEVER...THE LOW CIGS LOOK TO BE STICKING
AROUND...AS A MATTER OF FACT...WITH WARM AIR RUNNING OVER THE
COOL/MOIST AIR AT THE SURFACE...THE WARM AIR WILL TRACK THE COOL
AIR AND KEEP THE LOW CIGS IN PLACE...WOULD EXPECT THE LOW CIGS TO
HANG AROUND INTO THE AFTERNOON ON CHRISTMAS DAY AT ALL 3
LOCATIONS.

.SHORT TERM (CHRISTMAS EVE NIGHT AND CHRISTMAS)...STRENGTHENING SW 
TO NE JET CORE IN ADVANCE OF APPROACHING UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE 
THROUGH E TN VALLEY THIS EVENING. SURFACE COLD FRONT CLOSELY 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE. SCATTERED AND WEAKENING RAIN SHOWERS 
WILL MOVE THIS EVENING. WEST WINDS WILL BECOME BREEZY THIS EVENING 
BEHIND THE FRONT. LIGHT POST FRONTAL SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE OVERNIGHT 
ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS OF MRX CWA. SOME UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE 
LATE TONIGHT WITH LIMITED MOISTURE. LOW LEVEL CAP WILL KEEP CLOUD 
COVER IN PLACE OVERNIGHT. CLOUDS WILL BE SLOW TO ERODE FROM THE SW 
ON CHRISTMAS DAY. POST FRONTAL TEMPERATURE ADVECTION NOT VERY 
STRONG. 

.LONG TERM (CHRISTMAS NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...NEXT RAIN CHANCES 
MOVE IN THIS WEEKEND...WITH THE BEST POPS AND AMOUNTS EXPECTED ON 
SUNDAY. WE WILL REMAIN BENEATH A DISTURBED AND FAIRLY MOIST 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT...RESULTING IN CHANCE OR SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. MEANWHILE...COLDER AIR WILL SLOWLY SAG 
INTO AREA FROM NORTH SUCH THAT BY TUESDAY WE WILL START SEEING RAIN 
OR SNOW MIXES TUESDAY MORNING OVER THE NORTHERNMOST SECTIONS OF CWA 
AND THE MOUNTAINS...WITH COVERAGE OF SNOW EXPANDING FURTHER SOUTH BY 
WEDNESDAY MORNING TO COVER MUCH OF AREA. SAME FOR WED NIGHT. THIS 
PRECIP IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE OF NOTEWORTHY INTENSITY AT THIS 
TIME...AS POPS WILL BE ON THE ORDER OF 20-30 PCT...BUT INTERMITTENT 
LIGHT SNOWS MAY FLUTTER IN THE AIR FOR MUCH OF THE TUES-MORNING-TO-
WED-NIGHT TIME FRAME.

FORTUNATELY NONE OF THE PRECIP IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD LOOKS TO BE 
HEAVY AT THIS TIME...MAYBE AVERAGING HALF AN INCH ON SUNDAY...SO THE 
RIVERS ELEVATED BY LAST NIGHT/S RAIN SHOULD HAVE A STRETCH OF TIME 
TO RECEDE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WINDS HAVE DIMINISHED OVER THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS TONIGHT BUT STILL SEE A FEW GUSTS INTO THE 30 TO 
35 MPH RANGE SO WILL KEEP THE ADVISORY IN EFFECT FOR NOW.  WINDS ARE 
ONCE AGAIN EXPECTED TO INCREASE THIS AFTERNOON AS A COLD FRONT MOVES 
THROUGH THE AREA.  WINDS MAY INCREASE TO NEAR BORDERLINE WIND 
ADVISORY LEVELS BUT EXPECT THEY WILL REMAIN BELOW CRITERIA...SO FOR 
NOW... WILL NOT ISSUE AN ADDITIONAL ADVISORY FOR THE AFTERNOON BUT 
WILL MONITOR CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE MORNING.  OTHERWISE...THE 
MAIN BAND OF RAIN HAS MOVED OUT OF THE AREA BUT WILL CONTINUE TO SEE 
SCATTERED SHOWERS DEVELOP AND MOVE THROUGH...ESPECIALLY DURING THE 
MORNING HOURS.  WILL THEREFORE KEEP POPS AT LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL 
FOR THE MORNING...AND LOWING POPS THROUGH THE DAY.  THE COLD FRONT 
WILL MOVE THROUGH MID DAY.  TONIGHT...AN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE IN 
BEHIND THE EXITING FRONT.  THIS WILL BRING IN COOLER AIR AS WELL AS 
BRIEF UPSLOPE CONDITIONS.  ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL LINGER OVER THE 
REGION...ESPECIALLY OVER NORTHERN LOCATIONS.  ANY RESIDUAL SHOWERS 
WILL TRANSITION TO LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES.  THE NORTHERN VALLEY MAY 
SEE A FEW FLURRIES BY SUNRISE CHRISTMAS MORNING BUT NO ACCUMULATIONS 
ARE EXPECTED.  NORTHWEST FACING SLOPES OF THE APPALACHIANS COULD SEE 
MINOR SNOWFALL OF LESS THAN AN INCH. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...THERE MAY BE A FEW LINGERING 
SNOW SHOWERS OR RAIN SHOWERS SW VA AND NORTHEAST/CENTRAL MOUNTAINS 
EARLY THURSDAY...BUT UPPER RIDGING AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILD 
IN QUICKLY AND BRIEF SHOT OF COLD ADVECTION ENDS SO ANY PRECIP 
SHOULD DISSIPATE IN THE MORNING. CLOUDS MAY BE A BIT SLOWER TO CLEAR 
HOWEVER. SHOULD BE DRY THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...THEN 
MOISTURE IS FORECAST TO BEGIN INCREASING BY SATURDAY. MODELS NOT IN 
GREAT AGREEMENT ON THE DETAILS FOR THE LATTER PART OF THE PERIOD SO 
FORECAST CONFIDENCE NOT OVERLY HIGH. THERE IS FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT THE WEEKEND WILL BE WET AS BROAD UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES AND 
FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL BE IN THE VICINITY.  APPEARS THIS PRECIP WILL BE 
ALL LIQUID.  ONCE THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH MONDAY...COLDER AIR 
IS FORECAST TO MOVE IN WHICH COULD ALLOW FOR RAIN SHOWERS TO MIX 
WITH OR CHANGE TO SNOW SHOWERS MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY.

LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING...BREEZY WINDS...THUNDERSTORMS...PSBL
LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. NEAR 100 PCT CHANCE OF RAIN TONIGHT...THEN RAIN
ENDING FROM WEST TO EAST DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY. NOT EXPECTING
FLOODING BUT ISOLATED FLASH FLOODING OR SMALL STREAM ADVISORY TYPE
OCCURRENCES UNDER LOCALIZED TRAINING OF RAINFALL. NOT EXPECTING
CONDITIONS TO BE FAVORABLE FOR MOUNTAIN WAVE WINDS...BUT STILL WILL
HAVE BREEZY CONDITIONS OF 15-25 MPH IN THE MOUNTAINS TONIGHT AND
WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE WEDNESDAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THIS PERIOD...THE COLD FRONT HAS JUST CLEARED THE AREA...AND THE 
UPPER TROUGH IS PASSING THROUGH THE AREA.  BY CHRISTMAS MORNING AT 
12Z...THE UPPER TROUGH HAS PASSED...AND RATHER THAN A SUPPORTING 
CLIPPER AS SO OFTEN HAPPENS...A SHORTWAVE RIDGE STARTS TO BUILD 
QUICKLY DURING THE DAY.  SO THINK THAT THE POST-FRONTAL INSTABILITY 
AND PRECIP WILL BE VERY LIMITED...WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO CHRISTMAS 
DAY.  WITH THAT BEING SAID...IT LOOKS LIKE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL 
BE TRAPPED FOR MUCH OF CHRISTMAS DAY...SO PLANNING TO GO ABOVE 
GUIDANCE ON SKY COVER.  NOT PLANNING TO BRING DOWN MAX TEMPS VERY 
MUCH...AS CLEARING IS POSSIBLE LATE IN THE DAY...BUT WILL DELAY 
WARMUP IN HOURLY TEMPERATURES.  

ALONG WITH THE QUICK RIDGING...MOISTURE SURGES BACK TOWARD THE AREA 
BY SATURDAY AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL HAVE SOME POPS ACROSS AT LEAST 
PARTS OF THE AREA THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST...AS THE 
RIDGE MAINTAINS THIS PATTERN THROUGH MONDAY...THEN LIFT FROM THE 
NEXT APPROACHING TROUGH KEEPS ELEVATES POPS AGAIN.  THIS PRECIP 
LOOKS MOSTLY LIQUID...BUT POST-FRONTAL TEMPS TOWARD THE END OF THE 
FORECAST TREND TOWARD A MIX OF LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS FROM A CLIPPER.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL TRACK 
OUT OF THE WESTERN GULF TOWARD OUR AREA AS AN AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH 
DIGS INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND MISSISSIPPI VALLEY DURING THE 
SHORT TERM PERIOD.  STRONG SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL JET WILL FEED PLENTY 
OF MOISTURE INTO THE REGION...AND LIFT WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE FROM 
SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  MODELS INDICATE 
THERE WILL BE SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY...SO WILL MENTION THUNDER 
FOR SOUTH AND INTO CENTRAL AREAS. WILL CARRY CAT POPS BOTH TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. RAIN MAY BE HEAVY AT TIMES ESPECIALLY SOUTH...BUT WITH 6 
AND 12 HOUR FFG VALUES GENERALLY CLOSE TO OR HIGHER THAN 3 INCHES NO 
FLOOD WATCH APPEARS WARRANTED AT THIS TIME.  OTHER CONCERN IS WIND 
IN THE MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS.  DEPTH OF STABLE LAYER LOOKS TOO 
SHALLOW TO FAVOR MOUNTAIN WAVES...AND WIND DIRECTION IS MARGINAL.  
MAY AT LEAST SEE WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA MET TONIGHT...BUT CONFIDENCE 
STILL NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO ISSUE SECOND PERIOD ADVISORY SO WILL 
MENTION IN HWO FOR NOW.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING 
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 
WEDNESDAY.  ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND SUFFICIENT LIFT WILL 
PROVIDE LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS EARLY IN THE DAY.  ADDITIONALLY 
...WITH WEAK INSTABILITY DEVELOPING OVER PORTIONS OF THE 
AREA...MAINLY OVER SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL LOCATIONS...A STAY RUMBLE OF 
THUNDER IS POSSIBLE.  PRECIP WILL DECREASE FROM SOUTHWEST TO 
NORTHEAST LATE IN THE DAY.  WEDNESDAY NIGHT...A BRIEF BREAK IN 
PRECIP IS EXPECTED BEHIND THE FRONT AND AHEAD OF THE UPPER LOW AND 
ASSOCIATED WRAP AROUND MOISTURE MOVING IN.  HOWEVER...TIMING OF THIS 
IS DIFFICULT AND WILL ONLY LOWER POPS TO REFLECT THIS.  
OTHERWISE...COLDER AIR WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE FRONT AND WRAP AROUND 
PRECIP WILL TRANSITION TO LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES ESPECIALLY OVER 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND FAVORED NORTHWEST FACING SLOPES WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT.  A FEW SHOWERS WILL LINGER OVER FAR NORTHWESTERN LOCATIONS 
INTO THURSDAY.  OVER THE REST OF THE AREA...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL BUILD IN AND WILL CONTROL AREA WEATHER THROUGH FRIDAY.  MODEL 
CONSISTENCY REMAINS POOR DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE EXTENDED.

THINK THAT KCHA COULD POTENTIALLY SEE SOME THUNDER OVER THE

IT COULD MISS THE TERMINAL AS WELL, BUT JUST WANTED TO ERR ON THE
SIDE OF CAUTION. STORMS SHOULD LOSE ENERGY BY AROUND 02Z AND BECOME
JUST RAIN AT THAT POINT. OVERNIGHT COULD SEE SOME FOG AND LOW

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...INCREASING LOW-LEVEL JET
ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY IN RESPONSE TO AN UPPER WAVE MOVING
ACROSS THE AREA WILL ENHANCE THE ISENTROPIC LIFT. INCREASING
DYNAMICS IS ALREADY INCREASING CONVECTION OVER THE PLATEAU AND
ALABAMA. FORECAST SOUNDING SHOWS ELEVATED INSTABILITY...SO HAVE
INCLUDED THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA.

PLENTY OF LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE PULLING INTO THE SOUTHERN VALLEY WILL
ALSO PRODUCE EXTENSIVE FOG AND DRIZZLE OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE CHA
AREA.

FOR TUESDAY...DOWNSLOPING WINDS WILL HELP CLEAR OUT THE CLOUDS OVER
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE VALLEY WHILE THE SOUTHERN HALF STAYS
WITHIN LOW-CLOUDS AND MORNING FOG/DRIZZLE.

A STRONG JET OVER THE OHIO VALLEY AND JET ASSOCIATED WITH INCOMING
UPPER TROUGH WILL PRODUCE STRONG UPPER DIVERGENCE OVER THE AREA
LATE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. AGAIN...GIVEN ELEVATED INSTABILITY
EXPECTED WIDE SPREAD SHOWERS AND CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. SOME OF
THE RAIN COULD BE HEAVY OVER THE AREA...ESPECIALLY PLATEAU AND
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE FOR TUESDAY NIGHT.

FOR WEDNESDAY...COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA PRODUCING
WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS. CONVECTION WILL END
FROM WEST TO EAST AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVES ACROSS THE REGION.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...A BRIEF SHOT AT LIGHT 
SNOW STILL POSSIBLE LATE CHRISTMAS EVE INTO EARLY CHRISTMAS MORNING. 
NO ACCUMULATION EXPECTED EXCEPT FOR MAYBE UP TO AN INCH OR SO ACROSS 
THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. THEN A WEEKEND SYSTEM APPROACHES THAT THE 
MODELS STILL AREN'T HANDLING WELL.

BY WEDNESDAY EVENING THE BULK OF THE PRECIPITATION WILL HAVE PASSED 
TO OUR EAST AS WE AWAIT THE PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT. THE GFS AND 
THE NAM BOTH SHOW A DRY SLOT BETWEEN THE FRONTAL PASSAGE AND THE 
FINAL PUSH OF PRECIP INTO THE AREA. THIS MEANS THERE WILL LIKELY BE 
A BREAK BETWEEN THE LIQUID PRECIP AND ANY SNOW THAT OCCURS. THE WRAP 
AROUND MOISTURE AND ASSOCIATED SHORTWAVE COMES IN CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT. 
AS OF NOW...IT LOOKS LIKE LOCATIONS NORTH OF 1-40 MAY BE THE ONLY 
ONES TO SEE ANY SNOW. THE LOWER ELEVATIONS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
VALLEY APPEAR TO BE TOO WARM FROM THE LATEST GUIDANCE. AREAS NORTH 
OF I-40 MAY SEE LIGHT SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS/FLURRIES AFTER MIDNIGHT 
AND INTO EARLY CHRISTMAS MORNING...THE BEST CHANCES WILL BE ACROSS 
NETN AND SWVA. PRECIP QUICKLY MOVES OFF TO THE NORTHEAST DURING THE 
MID TO LATE MORNING HOURS OF CHRISTMAS DAY AND SOME AREAS MAY EVEN 
SEE A CHANGE OVER BACK TO LIGHT RAIN/DRIZZLE BEFORE THE PRECIP 
COMPLETELY EXITS. AS THE DAY PROGRESSES THE CLOUDS SHOULD ERODE FROM 
SW TO NE...BRINING SUNSHINE TO MOST AREAS BY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON. 
WE SHOULD STAY DRY FROM THURSDAY EVENING THROUGH MOST OF THE DAY 
FRIDAY WITH SUNSHINE BRIEFLY RETURNING.

BRING PRECIP BACK IN FRIDAY NIGHT AND KEEP IT INTO MONDAY. MODELS 
STILL DOING A VERY POOR JOB HANDLING THIS NEXT SYSTEM. THE ECMW 
LOOKS WET WITH A POTENT SHORTWAVE SWINGING THROUGH WHILE THE GFS IS 
MUCH DRIER WITH NOTHING MORE THAN A WEAK FRONT CRUISING THROUGH. 
WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF POPS BETWEEN THE GFS AND ECMW UNTIL THEY 
BETTER AGREE. DURING THIS TIME FRAME...IT MAY BE COLD ENOUGH TO SEE 
SOME LIGHT SNOW ACROSS ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN

TOWARD THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES. A COLD FRONT WILL BEGIN APPROACHING 
FROM THE WEST. WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT MAINLY NORTHEAST EARLY THIS 
MORNING WILL MOVE OUT.  SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL JET WILL STRENGTHEN 
TONIGHT...BRINGING INCREASING MOISTURE BUT FORCING STILL NOT

EXPECTED TO END. A SHOWER MAY MOVE INTO THE SOUTH THIS 
AFTERNOON...AND WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS ALL AREAS 
TONIGHT.  ALL LIQUID PRECIP IN THE SHORT TERM.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY 
LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL STAY CLOSE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE WET 
FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST AS THE 
ADVERTISED HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH LUMBERS SLOWLY EAST FROM 
THE PLAINS TO THE APPALACHIANS FROM 12Z TUESDAY THROUGH 12Z 
CHRISTMAS DAY. AS IT DOES SO THE UPPER SYSTEM WILL DEEPEN AS IT 
SHIFTS NORTHEAST FROM THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE EASTERN 
GREAT LAKES. WARM AND MOIST AIR WILL STREAM NORTH INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA AHEAD OF A FRONTAL BOUNDARY THAT WILL TAKE ITS SWEET TIME 
MAKING IT ONTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. SHOWERS SHOULD BE WIDESPREAD 
ACROSS THE PLATEAU THROUGH THE MORNING ON TUESDAY PROGRESSING EAST 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA BY TUESDAY 
EVENING. STILL LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE AN AREA OF STRONG DOWNSLOPE 
FLOW ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA SLOWING THE 
ONSET OF SHOWERS OR KEEPING THE CHARACTER OF RAIN RATHER SPOTTY AND 
LIGHT THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY. IN ADDITION THE WARMING SHOULD BE 
REALIZED AT THE SURFACE WHICH SHOULD MAKE THIS LOCATION THE WARMEST 
SPOT IN THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE 
LOW 60S. STILL LOOKS LIKE THERE COULD BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF A FEW EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS IN THIS REGIME...BUT 
MAINLY LIMITED TO WESTERN AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS. THE COLD FRONT WILL 
BE A GOOD SIX HOURS SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS FORECAST THINKING WHICH 
WILL REALLY LIMIT THE POTENTIAL FOR MUCH IN THE WAY OF SNOW. THE 
RAIN SHOWERS SHOULD REALLY TAPER OFF FROM WEST TO EAST BEHIND THE 
FRONT AS THE DAY PROGRESSES ON WEDNESDAY WITH MODELS CONTINUING TO 
SHOW SUBSIDENCE ALONG WITH DECREASING DEPTH OF MOISTURE ACROSS THE 
REGION. AN AREA OF DEEPER MOISTURE SWINGS BACK EAST INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATER WEDNESDAY EVENING INTO CHRISTMAS MORNING 
BUT THE ARRIVAL OF THE COLDEST AIR FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SNOW WILL 
SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS MODEL DEPICTION. THEREFORE...THERE MAY BE A 
BRIEF PERIOD LATE CHRISTMAS EVE INTO EARLY CHRISTMAS MORNING WHERE 
THERE MAY BE A COUPLE FLURRIES OF SNOW IN THE GREAT VALLEY MAINLY 
NORTH OF I-40. EVEN THE HIGHER TERRAIN...ABOVE 3000 FEET...ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE MAY ONLY PICK UP AROUND 
AN INCH OF SNOW BEFORE THE SYSTEM IS ENTIRELY GONE BY ABOUT NOON ON 
CHRISTMAS DAY. WE SHOULD STAY DRY FROM THURSDAY EVENING THROUGH MOST 
OF THE DAY FRIDAY WITH A FAIRLY DECENT CHANCE AT SEEING A LENGTHY 
PERIOD OF SUNSHINE ON FRIDAY. MODELS STILL NOT ENTIRELY ON THE SAME 
PAGE FOR THE END OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST WITH ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH

AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES MAY BE COLD ENOUGH FOR A CHANCE FOR SOME 
LIGHT SNOW...MAINLY HIGHER TERRAIN SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
THE NAM AND GFS CONTINUE TO SHOW DIFFERENT SCENARIOS FOR THE SHORT 
TERM...WITH THE GFS KEEPING MEASUREABLE PRECIP TO OUR EAST 
TONIGHT...WHILE THE NAM CONTINUES TO BE THE WETTER MODEL. HOWEVER 
THE NAM HAS BEEN TRENDING DRIER COMPARED TO YESTERDAY. IT SHOWS 
MOISTURE CONFINED TO A SHALLOW LAYER BELOW 700 MB AND ISENTROPIC 
LIFT AT THE 290-295K LEVELS...MORE OF A DRIZZLE PROFILE THAN MUCH 
MEASUREABLE RAIN. A WEAK DOWNSLOPE WIND COULD FURTHER REDUCE QPF IN 
THE TN VALLEY. THE GOING FORECAST LOOKS GOOD TO HANDLE THIS 
PATTERN...WITH CHANCE POPS EAST TAPERING TO ONLY DRIZZLE WEST...SO 
NO MAJOR CHANGES WILL BE MADE. THE ISENTROPIC LIFT SHOWN BY THE NAM 
LIFTS NORTH OF THE OUR AREA BETWEEN 12-15Z...SO WILL END ALL RAIN 
CHANCES BEFORE NOON. HOW MUCH CLOUD COVER LINGERS BEHIND IS VERY 
UNCERTAIN...BUT WILL LEAN ON THE PESSIMISTIC SIDE AND KEEP MOISTLY 
CLOUDY CONDITIONS FOR MOST OF THE DAY WITH TEMPERATURES ON THE COOL 
SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
THE BEGINNING OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD REMAINS ACTIVE AND THEN A
QUIETER FINISH. STORMS...RAIN/WIND...AND SNOW STILL POSSIBLE. THIS
IS BECOMING A TRICKY FORECAST.
 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY FEATURE HEIGHTS QUICKLY BUILDING OUT AHEAD 
OF OUR IMPENDING STORM SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING FOR 
A WHILE NOW. AS MENTIONED IN YESTERDAY'S DISCUSSION...THIS WILL
KEEP MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY UNSEASONABLE WARM AS DEEP SOUTHERLY
FLOW WILL BE IN PLACE. LOWS MONDAY NIGHT STILL LOOK TO BE 10 TO 12
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. HIGHS ON TUESDAY WILL BE IN THE MID/UPPER 50S
AND NEAR 60 IN A FEW SPOTS...GENERALLY 5 TO 10 DEGREES ABOVE
NORMAL. START BRINGING IN RAIN CHANCES MONDAY NIGHT AND INCREASING
THEM THROUGH THE DAY ON TUESDAY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. IT WILL TAKE A
WHILE FOR PORTIONS OF NEON AND SOFA TO SEE RAIN BECAUSE OF.
  
STORMS...LATE TUESDAYS AFTERNOON INTO EVENING LOOKS TRICKY TO ME 
REGARDING STORMS. THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR OUR EXTREME SOUTHERN 
AREAS TO SEE A FEW STRONG STORMS...IT DEPENDS ON SEVERAL FACTORS. 
HOW MUCH INFLUENCE/IMPACT WILL THE CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS FURTHER 
SOUTH HAVE ACROSS OUR AREA...WHERE WILL THE WARM FRONT BE 
DRAPED...HOW MUCH INSTABILITY WILL THERE BE? THE CERTAINTIES 
ARE...STRONG LIFT PRESENT...HIGH SHEAR AND HELICITY VALUES AND 
PLENTY OF MOISTURE. WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO CLOSELY WATCH THIS TO 
SEE HOW IT FURTHER UNFOLDS. LEFT THUNDER IN FOR KNOXVILLE 
AND SOUTHWARD FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON INTO EVENING.

FOR THE RAIN/WIND...IF THE CONVECTION TO OUR SOUTH REALLY BLOWS UP 
IT COULD LIMIT HOW MUCH PRECIP WE SEE. IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR STRONG 
CONVECTION TO OUR SOUTH TO INTERRUPT THE FLOW OF MOISTURE INTO OUR 
AREA. HAVING SAID THAT...I STILL THINK IT IS LIKELY WE SEE SOME 
DECENT RAINFALL ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN AREAS DUE TO THE EXISTING 
MOISTURE THAT WILL BE IN PLACE...THE PROXIMITY OF THE SURFACE LOW 
MOVING ACROSS...AND THE STRONG 850MB JET AXIS OVER OUR AREA. CURRENT 
GFS AND NAM SOUNDINGS CONTINUE TO SHOW PW VALUES RANGING FROM 1.40 
TO 1.20 INCHES FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. THIS PUTS US AT 2SD ABOVE NORMAL 
FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. I STILL DON'T THINK FLOODING WILL BE A 
CONCERN BECAUSE OF HOW QUICKLY THIS SYSTEM IS MOVING. HIGHEST 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL LIKELY BE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY WITH 
AMOUNTS FROM HALF AN INCH TO ONE INCH POSSIBLE IN SOME LOCATIONS. 
GUSTY WINDS FROM 20 TO 30KTS WILL LIKELY OCCUR ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH WEDNESDAY DUE TO THE 40 TO 
50KT 850MB JET. BREEZY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE LOWER ELEVATIONS 
EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH.

THE SNOW...FOR THE SNOW LOVERS IT IS NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD. FOR THE 
PAST FEW DAYS THE MODELS HAVE BEEN DELAYING THE ARRIVAL OF THE COLD 
AIR...AND THEY CONTINUE TO DO SO. THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE TRACK OF 
THE LOW. DUE TO THE DELAYED COLD AIR AND THE SPEED OF WHICH THE 
UPPER LOW RACES OFF TO THE NORTHEAST...THE SNOW POTENTIAL CONTINUES 
TO DECREASE. BY THE TIME THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH ON 
WEDNESDAY...CHRISTMAS EVE...IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE LITTLE 
MOISTURE LEFT. BECAUSE OF THE SPEED OF THE LOW THERE WON'T BE MUCH 
TIME TO FUNNEL WRAP AROUND MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. THOUGH THERE 
LIKELY WON'T BE ANY ACCUMULATION ACROSS LOWER ELEVATIONS...MOST 
AREAS WILL STILL PROBABLY SEE LIGHT SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS/FLURRIES 
ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH EARLY CHRISTMAS MORNING....WITH THE BEST 
CHANCES ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA. UPPER ELEVATIONS MAY STILL SEE
SOME MINOR ACCUMULATIONS OF AROUND AN INCH OR TWO.
 
MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THIS SYSTEM QUICKLY EXITING ON 
THURSDAY...CHRISTMAS DAY...AS IT RACES OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. WE MAY 
EVEN SEE SOME SUNSHINE BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON ACROSS THE PLATEAU AND 
SOUTHERN AREAS. ANOTHER QUICK MOVING WEAKER SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH 
FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY...BUT MODELS AREN'T HANDLING IT TOO WELL. WILL 
CONTINUE WITH POPS THOUGH UNTIL THERE IS BETTER RESOLUTION. THE 
SYSTEM SHOULD BE EXITING THE AREA BY SUNDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND 
INTO THE AREA TODAY.  EXPECT THE REMAINING CLOUD COVER TO BREAK UP 
ALLOWING DECENT AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE TODAY.  WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY 
WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION TONIGHT.  BETTER LIFT SHOULD STAY TO OUR 
SOUTH AND EAST.  MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED...AND RATHER SHALLOW...SO 
WILL JUST CARRY PATCHY DRIZZLE AND SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS FOR 
LIGHT RAIN.  THERMAL PROFILES SUGGEST ALL LIQUID PRECIP FOR TONIGHT. 
JUST MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO MAV TEMPS...INCLUDING TWEAKING MOST MIN 
TEMPS UP SLIGHTLY FOR TONIGHT GIVEN EXPECTED CLOUD COVER.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS STILL INDICATE SUNDAY 
NIGHT SHORT WAVE WILL BE IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING AWAY TO THE EAST 
ON MONDAY ALLOWING FOR A DRIER AFTERNOON WITH PERHAPS A BREAK OR TWO 
OF SUNSHINE HERE AND THERE ESPECIALLY WEST. WILL BE AWAITING THE 
STRENGTHENING MIDDLE AMERICA STORM SYSTEM MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY 
WHICH FEATURES A STRENGTHENING AND MOISTENING SOUTHERLY FLOW ACROSS 
THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. AS THIS OCCURS THE WIND FIELD WILL RAMP 
UP RATHER DECENTLY AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS. THIS 
STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL BRING A WARM FRONT ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION MONDAY NIGHT SO THERE COULD BE A FEW 
SHOWERS WITH THIS FEATURE MAINLY ACROSS WESTERN SECTIONS. THE STRONG 
WIND COMPONENT ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS WILL LEAD TO A NICE 
DOWNSLOPING PATTERN ACROSS MUCH OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST 
AND PART OF CENTRAL EAST TENNESSEE WHERE THE CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE 
LOWER DUE TO THE TYPICAL WARMING AND DRYING OF THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE 
DUE TO THE FORCED FLOW OVER THE TERRAIN. A SHARP COLD FRONT WILL 
FORM OUT ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON TUESDAY AND THE FRONT WILL 
TAKE ITS SWEET TIME MAKING EASTWARD PROGRESS WHICH WILL KEEP THE 
FORECAST AREA IN THE SYSTEM'S WARM SECTOR TUESDAY THROUGH TUESDAY 
NIGHT. THE MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE SOME INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THE 
FRONT SO ADDED THE CHANCE FOR SOME THUNDERSTORMS TO FORM IN THE 
EXPECTED WIDESPREAD PATTERN OF SHOWERS AHEAD OF THE FRONT. THE FRONT 
MOVES SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TUESDAY NIGHT 
INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING AND WILL BE A LITTLE SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY 
EXPECTED. THEREFORE ANY TRANSITION TO SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS ON THE 
BACK SIDE OF THE AMPLIFIED SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE IT WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL 
WEDNESDAY EVENING. FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT THE SNOW EVENT DOESN'T 
LOOK VERY IMPRESSIVE WITH A FEW LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES IN 
THE GREAT VALLEY WITH A LITTLE BETTER POSSIBILITY OF SNOWFALL IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN...MAINLY ABOVE 3000 FEET WHERE SOME MINOR 
ACCUMULATION MAY OCCUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THERE STILL MAY BE A FEW 
SNOW SHOWERS ONGOING THROUGH LATE MORNING ON CHRISTMAS DAY ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE BUT THE PRECIP SHOULD BE 
OVER IN THIS AREA BY EARLY AFTERNOON. AGAIN...STILL LOOKS LIKE THERE 
COULD BE SOME SUNSHINE RETURNING ACROSS WESTERN PARTS OF THE 
FORECAST AS THE DAY PROGRESSES. MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE TO A CERTAIN 
DEGREE FOR THE END OF THE FORECAST ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY SO WE WILL 
HAVE TO WAIT ON FUTURE RUNS TO GET A BETTER IDEA FOR THIS PERIOD. 
FOR NOW ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH WILL BE ON THE APPROACH FRIDAY INTO 
SATURDAY WITH MOISTENING AND INCREASING LIFT WEIGHTED MORE TOWARD 
FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY AS AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS 
THE REGION.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...CLOUDS ARE SLOWLY ERODING
FROM THE WEST THIS AFTERNOON...AND MOST OF THE TN VALLEY SHOULD BE
CLEAR BEFORE MIDNIGHT IF THE TREND CONTINUES AND IF THE HRRR IS
ACCURATE. WITH THE EXPECTED CLEARING AND CALM WINDS...CONDITIONS
APPEAR FAVORABLE FOR FOG TONIGHT. CROSSOVER TEMPERATURES ARE
ESPECIALLY FAVORABLE NORTH...SO WILL MENTION PATCHY/AREAS OF FOG
THERE AS WELL AS SW NC. FOG SHOULD BE SLOW TO DISSIPATE DUE TO THE
LOW SUN ANGLE AND WEAK MIXING TOMORROW MORNING. THE REST OF THE DAY
SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY...WITH HIGH CLOUDS INCREASING LATE IN THE
DAY.

A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH IN THE SOUTHERN STREAM NOW OVER TX WILL BE 
LIFTING E-NE AND CROSSING OUR AREA SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. WITH THE 
JET POSITIONED FROM SOUTHERN AL TO THE NC COAST...THE MAJORITY OF 
LIFT AND DEEP MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE EAST OF OUR AREA. THE NAM
PULLS MORE MOISTURE INTO OUR AREA THAN THE GFS...BUT EVEN THE NAM
SHOWS THIS MOISTURE MAINLY BELOW THE -10C LEVEL...SUGGESTING THAT
DRIZZLE IS MORE LIKELY THAN MEASURABLE RAINFALL. AS A RESULT...WILL
CUT BACK POPS TO A CHANCE EAST TO NOTHING WEST...BUT MENTIONING
DRIZZLE EVERYWHERE. QPF WILL BE REDUCED AS WELL...TO NO MORE THAN A
TENTH IN THE MOUNTAINS. TEMPERATURE PROFILES IN ALL THE MODEL
SOUNDINGS INDICATE ALL LIQUID PRECIP. THE TROUGH PASSAGE SHOULD
BRING AN END TO ANY RAIN/DRIZZLE ON MONDAY AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...QUITE THE ACTIVE LONG 
TERM PERIOD WITH A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED SYSTEM COMING IN FOR CHRISTMAS THAT
WILL BRING...RAIN...MAYBE A FEW STORMS...WIND...AND PERHAPS SNOW.

MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY HEIGHTS WILL BE QUICKLY BUILDING OUT AHEAD 
OF A DEEP TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE CENTRAL U.S. AND SOUTHERN PLAINS. 
THIS WILL ALLOW FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY DAY TO BE UNSEASONABLE 
WARM. LOWS MONDAY NIGHT WILL BE 10 TO 12 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. HIGHS 
ON TUESDAY WILL BE IN THE MID TO UPPER 50S...5 TO 10 DEGREES ABOVE 
NORMAL. RAIN CHANCES INCREASE ON TUESDAY AS THIS HIGHLY AMPLIFIED 
AND DEEP TROUGH IS ON OUR DOORSTEP BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON. DID DECIDE 
TO INTRODUCE SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS FROM KNOXVILLE SOUTH 
TUESDAY AFTERNOON INTO TUESDAY NIGHT. CAPE IS VERY WEAK BUT SHEAR 
AND HELICITY ARE ROBUST...IN LARGE PART DUE TO A STRONG 850MB JET OF 
40 TO 50 KTS THAT WILL BE IN PLACE. BETTER INSTABILITY EXISTS 
FURTHER TO OUR SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST BUT DID WANT TO MENTION A STORM 
OR TWO POSSIBLE ACROSS OUR CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AREAS. ABUNDANT 
MOISTURE AND STRONG LIFT WILL LEAD TO SOME DECENT RAINFALL ACROSS 
THE AREA FOR TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...MORE SO ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN AREAS. CURRENT GFS SOUNDINGS SHOW PW VALUES RANGING FROM 
1.40 TO 1.20 INCHES FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. THIS PUTS US AT 2SD ABOVE 
NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. I DON'T THINK FLOODING WILL BE A 
CONCERN THOUGH BECAUSE OF HOW QUICKLY THIS SYSTEM IS MOVING. SO NOW 
THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT RAIN AND STORMS...LET'S TALK ABOUT SNOW.

CHRISTMAS EVE IS LOOKING TO BE RATHER NASTY WITH THE DEEP TROUGH AND 
ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW MOVING ACROSS. LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN 
CONTINUES WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH STRONG COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH BY 
LATE AFTERNOON INTO EARLY EVENING. AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH EXPECT 
RAIN TO CHANGE TO SNOW ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA ALONG WITH BREEZY 
WINDS. THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION IS HOW MUCH MOISTURE WILL BE 
LEFT. MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN SHOWING THE HIGHLY AMPLIFIED 
SYSTEM FOR SEVERAL DAYS OUT BUT HAVE NOT BEEN WITH THE EXACT 
PLACEMENT OF THE LOW. THE LATEST FEW MODEL RUNS OF THE ECMW AND THE 
GFS ARE TRENDING THE LOW FURTHER TO OUR WEST. THIS MEANS THAT THE 
BULK OF THE MOISTURE WILL HAVE PASSED OFF TO OUR EAST BEFORE IT GETS 
COLD ENOUGH TO SNOW BACK BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. IT LOOKS LIKE OUR 
SNOW WILL BE IN THE FORM OF WRAP AROUND MOISTURE. THE CHANGEOVER TO 
SNOW LOOKS TO OCCUR SOMETIME ON WEDNESDAY EVENING WITH SNOW 
LINGERING THROUGH EARLY CHRISTMAS MORNING. MOST OF THE PRECIP DURING 
THIS TIME FRAME SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF SCATTERED LIGHT SNOW 
SHOWERS. LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATION EXPECTED AT THIS TIME FOR LOWER 
ELEVATIONS. HIGHER ELEVATIONS MAY GET AN INCH OR TWO. AGAIN...ALL OF 
THE ABOVE DEPENDS ON THE TRACK OF THE LOW...BUT THIS IS HOW IT'S 
LOOKING FOR NOW.

THIS SYSTEM QUICKLY EXITS ON THURSDAY...CHRISTMAS DAY...AS IT RACES 
OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. ANOTHER QUICK MOVING WEAKER SYSTEM MOVES 
THROUGH ON FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY THAT COULD BRING SOME LIGHT SHOWERS 
TO THE AREA.

FAR...AND MUCH OF THAT NOT REACHING THE GROUND.  WILL CARRY SOME 
SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS ALL BUT SOUTHWEST/WEST ZONES EARLY 
TODAY FOR SOME LIGHT RAIN/SNOW...BUT LOOKS LIKE PRECIP AMOUNTS WILL 
BE QUITE LIGHT.  SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN FROM THE 
NORTHWEST AND NORTH LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT...ALONG WITH SOME 
DRYING. EXPECT CLOUDS TO DECREASE...ALTHOUGH CONFLICTING SIGNALS IN 
THE SHORT RANGE MODELS AND WEAK FLOW LEAD TO LOWER THAN NORMAL 
CONFIDENCE IN SKY FORECAST FOR THE SHORT TERM. JUST SOME MOSTLY 
MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO MAV TEMPS...MOSTLY TO TWEAK DOWN SOME HIGHS AND 
TWEAK UP SOME LOWS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...SUNDAY STARTS OUT DRY WITH SOME 
RIDGING ALTHOUGH ANOTHER WEAK SHORT WAVE WILL BE SWINGING NORTHEAST 
OUT OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY 
PRODUCING SOME LIGHT RAIN. THERE COULD BE A SNOW FLURRY IN THE 
HIGHEST TERRAIN ACROSS EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA. THIS WAVE SHOULD BE MOVING AWAY TO THE NORTHEAST DURING 
THE DAY MONDAY ALLOWING FOR A RETURN TO SOME SUNSHINE MAINLY WESTERN 
AREAS. FOLLOWING THE DEPARTURE OF THIS SYSTEM THE UPPER LEVEL 
PATTERN WILL BE UNDERGOING SOME MAJOR LEAGUE AMPLIFICATION WITH A 
FULL LATITUDE TROUGH FORMING ACROSS THE PLAINS. THIS WILL KEEP THE 
WEATHER A LITTLE UNSETTLED MONDAY NIGHT WITH A STRENGTHENING MOIST 
SOUTHERLY FLOW COMPLETE WITH A COUPLE WEAK IMPULSES. THEREFORE KEPT 
A SMALL CHANCE FOR A SHOWER GOING THROUGH THIS PERIOD. TUESDAY INTO 
TUESDAY NIGHT THE PROBABILITY FOR SHOWERS...MAYBE EVEN A CLAP OF 
THUNDER WILL BE ON THE INCREASE AS A DEEPENING SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM DRAGS A STRONG COLD FRONT TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
THE FRONT WILL MOVE RATHER SLOWLY EAST IN THE HIGHLY AMPLIFIED 
PATTERN AND SHOULD BE JUST EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 12Z 
WEDNESDAY. DUE TO THE TIGHT CIRCULATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH...A LARGE AREA OF DEEP MOISTURE WILL WRAP AROUND THE 
BACK SIDE OF THE FEATURE AND THE MOIST AIR WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A 
TRAILING SHORT WAVE. MUCH COLDER AIR WILL BE SPREADING EAST BEHIND 
THE FRONT DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY AND BY THE AFTERNOON THE RAIN 
WILL BE CHANGING TO SNOW IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS BUT MAINLY OUT 
WEST ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. BY WEDNESDAY EVENING TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SOME LIGHT SNOW ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. AGAIN THE DEEPEST MOISTURE AND STRONGEST LIFT WILL BE OVER 
NORTHERN SECTIONS...MAINLY THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AS WELL AS THE 
SMOKY MOUNTAINS. A LITTLE TOO EARLY TO SAY BUT SOME OF THESE HIGHER 
TERRAIN AREAS COULD PICK UP AN INCH OR TWO OF SNOW WILL OROGRAPHIC 
SUPPORT. THE MODELS CONTINUE WITH A PROGRESSIVE MODE FOR THIS SYSTEM 
ON CHRISTMAS DAY ALLOWING DRIER AIR AND A RETURN TO SUNSHINE FOR 
MOST AREAS. THE UPPER FLOW FLATTENS OUT AGAIN CHRISTMAS EVENING IN 
TIME FOR THE ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER FAST MOVING UPPER TROUGH AND 
ASSOCIATED SURFACE COLD FRONT WHICH MAY BRING SOME LIGHT RAIN ON 
FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...
THERE REMAINS MUCH UNCERTAINTY IN THE SHORT TERM PERIOD DUE TO LARGE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE NAM AND THE GFS. THE NAM IS THE WETTER AND 
COLDER OF THE TWO MODELS. THE PREFERENCE IS MORE TOWARD THE GFS DUE 
TO THE PRECIP/CONVECTION THAT IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP ALONG THE GULF 
COAST...PROVIDING A STABILIZING EFFECT UPSTREAM AND PREVENTING 
NORTHWARD MOISTURE ADVECTION. THE RAP APPEARS TO AGREE WITH THIS 
SCENARIO...AND THE LATEST SREF APPEARS TO BE TRENDING DOWNWARD IN 
POPS/QPF. 

AS A RESULT...WILL CONFINE LIKELY POPS TO EXTREME SOUTHERN PORTIONS 
OF THE AREA TONIGHT...FADING TO LOW CHANCE POPS NORTH. QPF WILL BE 
LIGHT...UP TO A TENTH OF AN INCH SOUTH AND IN THE MOUNTAINS. IN 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS...MAINLY ABOVE 2500 FT...THE PRECIP SHOULD BE 
MOSTLY SNOW...BUT WITH A SMALL WINDOW OF ADEQUATE MOISTURE DEPTH

RAIN. WILL MENTION RAIN OR SNOW IN THAT AREA AS A COMPROMISE...WITH 
WITH NO ACCUMULATIONS. THE FASTER EXIT OF PRECIP SHOWN BY THE GFS 
WILL BE FOLLOWED...ENDING POPS IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
A WEAK SYSTEM WILL BE EXITING TO THE NE SATURDAY NIGHT WITH SKY
CONDITIONS IMPROVING TO PARTLY CLOUDY. UPPER FLOW IS ZONAL WITH
DRIER AIR MASS AND WEAK HIGH PRESSURE SETTLING OVER THE REGION.
THE SURFACE HIGH WILL BE OVERHEAD SUNDAY WITH SKIES PARTLY TO
MOSTLY SUNNY AND HIGH TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL IN THE
UPPER 40S TO MID 50S. ANOTHER SOUTHERN SYSTEM DEVELOPS ACROSS THE
GULF COAST SUNDAY AND BRINGS CLOUDS AND RAIN ACROSS THE FORECAST
AREA SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. AFTER A BRIEF BREAK IN THE STEADY
RAIN MONDAY NIGHT A MUCH STRONGER SYSTEM STILL LOOKS ON TRACK TO
MOVE INTO THE MS VALLEY MONDAY. A DEEP TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL
STATES WILL MOVE INTO THE EASTERN STATES TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. A
STRONG COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY NIGHT INTO
WEDNESDAY. A SURFACE LOW DEEPENS OVER OH WEDNESDAY. THE SYSTEM
FINALLY SHIFTS EAST OF THE AREA ON CHRISTMAS DAY. THERE COULD BE
SOME THUNDERSTORMS IF ENOUGH INSTABILITY DEVELOPS TUESDAY AFTERNOON
AND EVENING AHEAD OF THE FRONT. MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY
AND THURSDAY BEHIND THE FRONT. AS COLDER AIR MOVES IN LATE
WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT SOME MINOR SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS ARE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A WEAK AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL EXTEND INTO THE AREA TODAY...WITH SOME SUNSHINE IN STORE.  SOME 
SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL SWING ACROSS THE REGION TONIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY. MODELS TREND HAS BEEN DRIER WITH THIS SYSTEM...AND FORCING 
AND MOISTURE LOOK LIMITED.  HOWEVER...THERE APPEARS TO BE ENOUGH TO 
WARRANT LIKELY POPS SOUTH MAINLY SOUTH TONIGHT AND CHANCE 
ELSEWHERE...WITH CHANCE POPS INTO EARLY SATURDAY BEFORE TAPERING 
OFF.  PRECIP TYPE IS PROBLEMATIC...WITH MODEL DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT 
THE THERMAL PROFILE WILL LOOK LIKE.  WILL LEAN TOWARD A COMPROMISE 
SOLUTION AT THIS POINT AND ALLOW RAIN OR SNOW FOR ALL BUT SOUTH 
WHERE WILL KEEP ALL RAIN.  PRECIP AMOUNTS LOOK QUITE LIGHT...SO ANY 
SNOW ACCUMULATION EXPECTED TO BE MINOR AND MORE LIKELY OVER THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN. NO WINTER WEATHER ADVISORIES AT THIS POINT...BUT 
WILL MENTION IN THE HWO.  WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS EXCEPT 
FOR SATURDAY...WHEN EXPECT CLOUD COVER WILL LIMIT TEMP RISE SO WILL 
UNDERCUT MAV TEMPS SIGNIFICANTLY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS RELATIVELY 
CLOSE IN DEPICTION OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST FEATURING A DEPARTING 
TROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. COULD BE A COUPLE SNOWFLAKES STILL AROUND IN 
THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS AT THIS TIME SO KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE GOING 
HERE. SHORTWAVE RIDGING ALLOWS FOR A BREAK IN THE ACTION ON SUNDAY. 
HOWEVER...NEXT UPPER WAVE SLIDES NORTHEAST OUT OF THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT GENERATING SOME LIGHT RAIN FOR THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH WITH THIS SYSTEM FOR MOSTLY LIQUID 
PRECIPITATION BUT THERE MAY BE A FEW SNOWFLAKES IN THE HIGHEST PEAKS 
ACROSS EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. DOESN'T 
APPEAR LIKE MUCH OF A PROBLEM HERE WTIH TEMPERATURES NOT DESCENDING 
INTO THE FREEZING ZONE UNTIL LATE SUNDAY NIGHT. HAD TO KEEP A SMALL 
CHANCE FOR SOME LIGHT RAIN GOING MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WITH SOME 
MOISTENING AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A WEAK IMPULSE RIPPING NORTHEAST 
AHEAD OF A DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH ACROSS MIDDLE AMERICA. THIS TROUGH 
REALLY AMPLIFIES TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY DRIVING A STRONG COLD 
FRONT THROUGH THE VIEWING AREA FROM AROUND MIDNIGHT THROUGH 12Z 
WEDNESDAY. WARM AND MOIST AIR STREAMS NORTH AHEAD OF THE BOUNDARY 
AND THE STRENGTH OF A SYSTEM LIKE THIS WARRANTS THE USE OF LIKELY 
POPS ACROSS THE REGION FOR SHOWERS. AS COLDER AIR AND A TRAILING 
SHORT WAVELENGTH FEATURE DROPPING THROUGH THE BACK SIDE OF THE LONG 
WAVE CIRCULATION...SOME SNOW SHOWERS COULD BE IN THE WORKS FOR 
CHRISTMAS EVE. SOME OF THIS PRECIPITATION COULD HANG AROUND FOR A 
WHILE CHRISTMAS MORNING ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE BUT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA DRIER AIR AND 
POSSIBLY SUNSHINE WILL BE ON THE INCREASE THROUGH CHRISTMAS DAY.

SOUTH OF TN AND AFFECT THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES INTO THE CAROLINAS.
TEMPERATURES WILL DROP INTO THE 30S FRIDAY EVENING AND AREAS TO THE
NORTH OF INTERSTATE 40...ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS COULD

NIGHT AND SUNDAY WITH SKIES BECOMING PARTLY SUNNY.

.SHORT TERM... LITTLE BIT OF A TRICKY FORECAST FOR THE EARLY PART OF 
TODAY. WEAK RIPPLE OF ENERGY, COMBINED WITH JUST ENOUGH MOISTURE, 
AND TEMPS RIGHT AROUND FREEZING, IS LEADING TO THE POTENTIAL FOR 
SOME WINTRY MIX FOR THE WESTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. SEEING 
REPORTS OF LIGHT FREEZING RAIN, SLEET, SNOW, AND RAIN IN WESTERN AND 
CENTRAL TENNESSEE. THINK THAT AREAS ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND 
THE WESTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE SOME OF THIS AS 
WELL. PRETTY GOOD LAYER OF WARM AIR ABOVE THE SURFACE THAT SHOULD 
LEAD TO LIQUID PRECIP BEFORE IT NEARS THE SURFACE WHERE TEMPS ARE AT 
OR BELOW FREEZING EARLY THIS MORNING. THINK THAT SNOW IS A 
POSSIBILITY IN THE NORTHERN AREAS, BUT MOISTURE IS RELATIVELY 
LIMITED IN THE DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE, SO AT THIS TIME BELIEVE 
ANYTHING THAT FALLS WILL MOST LIKELY BE LIQUID OR FROZEN. DRY AIR 
ABOVE THE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL ALSO BE OF INTEREST AS IT COULD IMPEDE 
THE EASTWARD PROGRESS OF THE SYSTEM. HAVE ISSUED AN SPS TO ADVISE 
PEOPLE ON THEIR MORNING COMMUTE OF THE HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH 
FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET. SURFACE TEMPS SHOULD WARM UP ABOVE FREEZING 
ACROSS THE AREA BY MID MORNING AND ANY PRECIP THAT IS ABLE TO LINGER 
AROUND SHOULD REMAIN IN THE FORM OF RAIN.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
A WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL KEEP THINGS DRY FRIDAY...BUT A
FAST MOVING SYSTEM ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES WILL PULL THROUGH
THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING. MAIN DYNAMICS IS FROM
THE LEFT ENTERANCE REGION OF THE JET ALONG WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT.
TEMPERATURE PROFILE SUGGEST MAINLY RAIN...BUT ACROSS SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS...RAIN WILL MIX WITH OR
CHANGE TO SNOW. LITTLE ACCUMULATION EXPECTED.

WEAK SURFACE RIDGING AGAIN FOR SUNDAY...BUT THE SOUTHERN STREAM
WILL PULL MOISTURE BACK INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR SUNDAY
NIGHT AND MONDAY AHEAD OF A STRONG NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH. THE
NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH WILL DEVELOP A LONG-WAVE TROUGH OVER THE
EASTERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE NATION FOR MID-WEEK OR CHRISTMAS DAY.
RAIN INITIALLY TUESDAY NIGHT WILL CHANGE TO SNOW ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

NORTHWEST FLOW SNOWFALL POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. SNOW
SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE MOST LOCATIONS CHRISTMAS EVE.

BE ON THE INCREASE AHEAD OF THE MID/UPPER LEVEL LOW NOW OVER NM/TX. 
THE BEST FORCING WITH THIS SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH THE 500 MB VORT

AT THE SAME TIME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS CUT OFF AS THE 850 MB FLOW 
REMAINS WESTERLY. THUS WE MAY NOT SEE MUCH PRECIP REACHING THE 
GROUND TOMORROW AS PRECIP FALLS THROUGH A VERY DRY LAYER. WILL HAVE 
LOW CHANCE POPS ALONG THE PLATEAU COUNTIES IN THE MORNING...WITH 
SLIGHT CHANCES ELSEWHERE. IT COULD BEGIN AS A LITTLE SNOW IN HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS OF THE PLATEAU BEFORE CHANGING TO RAIN. ONLY A FEW 
HUNDRETHS OF AN INCH OF PRECIP IS EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THIS PERIOD WE ARE UNDER A ZONAL FLOW ALOFT WITH SURFACE RIDGING

THEN AFTER A COUPLE OF DRY OR LOW POP DAYS...THE NEXT SYSTEM
APPROACHES AND MAY SPREAD ORGANIZED PRECIP INTO THE AREA BY MONDAY
NIGHT OR TUESDAY. THIS SYSTEM LOOKS VERY STRONG...BUT THE MAIN
THREAT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE NORTH OF HERE...BUT STILL A CHANCE OF
LIGHT WINTERY PRECIP THEN.

RADAR SHOWS SOME VERY LIGHT PRECIP IS MOVING ACROSS E KY AND SW VA
AT THE MOMENT...ALTHOUGH NO SURFACE OBS IN THAT AREA REPORT PRECIP
ON THE GROUND. SOME OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN THAT AREA MAY BE
SEEING LIGHT PRECIP...MOST LIKELY RAIN BASED ON MID 30S TEMPS IN
THAT AREA. WILL ADJUST POPS IN THE UPDATE TO ADD JUST A SLIGHT
CHANCE IN WISE COUNTY...AND REMOVE POPS ELSEWHERE...BUT SOME
ISOLATED PATCHES OF DRIZZLE MAY BE POSSIBLE FOR THE NEXT FEW HOURS.
LOW CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE THIS AFTERNOON...HOWEVER

SHOULD RESULT IN LIMITED SUNSHINE TODAY. WILL DECREASE HIGH

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TOMORROW)
CURRENTLY LIGHT SHOWERS MOVING ACROSS PORTIONS OF SW VIRGINIA, WITH
OVERCAST CONDITIONS ACROSS THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA.
RELATIVELY QUIET WEATHER TODAY WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY TO OVERCAST SKIES
EXPECTED ACROSS THE AREA. CHANCE FOR PRECIP IN THE SHORT TERM WILL
HAVE TO WAIT TILL TOMORROW WHEN MOISTURE FROM THE GULF COUPLED WITH
A WEAK RIPPLE OF ENERGY COULD GIVE A QUICK SHOT OF PRECIP TO THE
AREA. THIS ROUND OF PRECIP SHOULD MOVE THROUGH PRETTY FAST AND
DEPENDING ON THE TIMING COULD LEAD TO SOME LIGHT SNOW. AT THIS
POINT THINK EVERYWHERE SHOULD REMAIN BELOW A QUARTER INCH OF
LIQUID, SO EVEN IF IT DOES BRIEFELY FALL AS SNOW IT SHOULD BE VERY
LIGHT AND MOST LIKELY CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...FAIRLY ZONAL FLOW 
STARTS THE EXTENDED WITH A JET STREAK MOVING ACROSS THE GULF COAST 
STATES FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY PLACING THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
UNDER THE FAVORED LEFT EXIT REGION OF THE JET. SYNOPTIC LIFT 
COMBINED WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL PRODUCE CATEGORICAL/LIKELY POPS 
FOR SATURDAY. COLD AIR IS LIMITED...SO EXPECT MAINLY RAIN.

AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH OVER THE AREA SUNDAY WILL KEEP SKIES 
MOSTLY CLOUDY. GFS AND ECMWF INDICATE A STRONG STORM SYSTEM 
DEVELOPING FOR CHRISTMAS EVE WITH A DEEP LONG-WAVE UPPER TROUGH
OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. RAIN INITIALLY WILL LIKELY
CHANGE TO SNOW OVER MOST OF THE AREA. WAY TOO EARLY FOR
AMOUNTS...BUT WATCH SYSTEM CLOSELY SINCE FAIRLY COLD AIR WILL BE
DRAWN SOUTHWARD INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY WILL KEEP 
THE AREA UNDER ALMOST CONSTANT CLOUD COVER THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON. ANY SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS THAT COULD GET KICKED UP 
BEHIND THE FRONT WILL MOVE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS BY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE MOVES IN WEDNESDAY FOR SLOWLY CLEARING SKIES 
AND DRY WEATHER. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR NORMAL.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL RIDGE INTO THE TN VALLEY EARLY IN THE PERIOD. AN UPPER LEVEL 
IMPULSE WILL MOVE EAST THROUGH THE TN VALLEY ON THURSDAY. THIS 
FEATURE WILL BRING A RETURN TO LAYER MOISTURE AND PROVIDE ENOUGH 
LIFT FOR LIGHT PRECIPITATION TO MOVE ACROSS THE AREA FOR MUCH OF 
THURSDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL. 

RELATIVELY DRY CONDITIONS RETURN ON FRIDAY WITH A MILD WARM UP. HIGH 
CLOUDS BEGIN TO INVADE LATER IN THE DAY WITH THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER 
UPPER LEVEL FEATURE. 

AN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST INTO THE TN VALLEY ON SATURDAY. A SW 
TO NE SPEED MAX WILL RUN THROUGH THE SOUTH INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. THIS FEATURE WILL BRING A THICKENING CLOUD DECK AND 
THE ONSET OF RAIN ON FRIDAY NIGHT. WEAK SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL 
DEVELOP SE OF THE AREA WITH AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDING 
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON SATURDAY. A SECONDARY UPPER 
IMPULSE WILL SWING INTO THE UPPER TROUGH FROM THE CENTRAL U.S. 
KEEPING THE RAIN CHANCES GOING INTO SUNDAY MORNING. FREEZING LEVELS 
PROGGED TO HOLD UP WELL UNTIL EARLY SUNDAY MORNING WHEN LOW LEVEL 
COLD AIR ADVECTION BEGINS MOVING IN FROM THE NW. PRECIPITATION TYPE 
WILL LIKELY CHANCE TO SNOW EARLY SUNDAY...MAINLY ACROSS NORTHERN AND 
ELEVATED AREA. UPPER TROUGH AXIS WILL HAVE MOVED EAST AND MOISTURE 
WILL BE LIMITED BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES WILL BE 
TAPERING OFF WITH SUNDAY TEMPERATURES REMAIN WELL BELOW NORMAL. 

AREA IS BETWEEN SYSTEMS ON MONDAY. AN ELONGATED JET STREAK FROM THE 
PAC NW WILL DIVE INTO THE TN VALLEY ON TUESDAY BRINGING ANOTHER 
CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS
THE AREA BY 15Z. A FRONTO-GENETIC BAND OF SHOWERS WILL EXIT THE
AREA BY 13Z. MODELS...ESPECIALLY THE NAM...SHOW LOW-LEVEL CAPES
WILL STAY ELEVATED BETWEEN 80-150 J/KG...SO EXPECT ANOTHER ROUND OF
LIGHT SHOWERS TO MOVE ACROSS THE NORTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE AREA
TODAY AND THIS EVENING.

FOR TONIGHT...WEAK OROGRAPHIC FLOW WILL KEEP A CHANCE POPS FOR THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. RIDGING
WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA WEDNESDAY ENDING SHOWER CHANCE WITH LOW-
CLOUDS DISSIPATING.

SINCE EXPECT LOW-CLOUDS TO REMAIN ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA TONIGHT
INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING...WENT ON THE COOLER SIDE OF GUIDANCE
FOR HIGHS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)... IN THE LONG TERM
THE FIRST CHANCE FOR PRECIP INVADES THE AREA THURSDAY AS A PLUME OF
GULF MOISTURE MAKES A RUN AT THE FORECAST AREA. PRECIP COULD START
AS SOON AS EARLY THURSDAY MORNING AND IF IT DOES THERE'S A SLIGHT
CHANCE IT COULD COME IN THE FORM OF SNOW FLURRIES. THINK THAT THE
MOISTURE WILL BE SO LIMITED THAT VERY LITTLE RAIN/SNOW SHOULD FALL
AND IF SNOW DOES FALL IT SHOULDN'T STICK TO MOST SURFACES. IT'S
EVEN POSSIBLE THAT THE MOISTURE IS SO LIMITED THAT IT ALL FALLS OUT
OVER WEST/CENTRAL TENNESSEE AND THE SYSTEM DRIES UP BEFORE THE
MOISTURE/LIFT IS IN PLACE OVER OUR AREA.

THE BETTER CHANCE FOR PRECIP WILL COME OVER THE WEEKEND AS A 
TROUGH/LOW PRESSURE CENTER MOVES OVER THE GREAT LAKES. THE LATEST 
ECMWF HAS MOVED THE LOW FURTHER NORTH (MORE IN LINE WITH THE GFS) 
AND WANTS TO KEEP MOST OF THE AREA (EXCEPT FOR THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS) AS A COLD RAIN. LOOKING AT FORECAST SOUNDINGS SEEMS LIKE 
THE BEST TIME FRAME TO POTENTIALLY SEE SNOW SHOULD BE EARLY SATURDAY 
AS THERE SHOULD BE PLENTY OF MOISTURE IN THE DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE 
AT THAT TIME. AT THIS TIME FORECAST SOUNDINGS IN THE VALLEY SHOW 
TEMPS AROUND 850MB AND LOWER SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH TO MELT ANY SNOW. 
IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD STAY COLD ENOUGH TO 
SEE SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS. MID LEVEL MOISTURE SEEMS TO DRY OUT 
OVERNIGHT SUNDAY AS THE SYSTEM EXISTS THE AREA. WHEN ALL IS SAID AND 
DONE THINK THAT MOST PLACES WILL SEE LESS THAN A HALF AN INCH OF 
PRECIP, HOWEVER SOME AREAS COULD SEE A BIT MORE THAN THIS.

WITH A RELATIVELY CLOUDY FORECAST TEMPS REMAIN A LITTLE BELOW 
AVERAGE THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SMALL DEWPOINT
DEPRESSIONS...CLEAR SKY AND CALM WINDS HAVE ALLOWED AREAS OF FOG TO
DEVELOP. SOME OF THE FOG WILL BE DENSE PRODUCING THICK FROST
DEVELOPMENT.

FOR TODAY...AFTER FOG/LOW CLOUDS DISSIPATE BY MID-
MORNING...GENERALLY MOSTLY SUNNY SKY UNTIL MID/LATE AFTERNOON.
INCREASING MOISTURE AHEAD OF FRONTAL BOUNDARY. MODELS SHOW STRONG
UPPER LEVEL JET MOVING ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES PLACING THE
FORECAST AREA UNDER THE FAVORED LEFT EXIT REGION. THE SYNOPTIC/
FRONTOGENETIC FORCING WILL PULL A BAND OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE AREA
WITH CATEGORICAL POPS ANTICIPATED TONIGHT. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW
ELEVATED INSTABILITY. HAVE INCLUDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/... LOW CLOUDS AND SOME LIGHT 
SCATTERED PRECIPITATION WILL LINGER ON TUESDAY AS A PASSING UPPER-
TROUGH SCOOTS ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY TO THE NORTH. BY THE 
EVENING...PRECIPITATION WILL BEGIN TO WANE EXCEPT FOR SOME ISOLATED 
ACTIVITY ALONG THE TERRAIN. ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND EVEN SOME WEAK 
RIDGING ON WEDNESDAY WILL PROMOTE DRIER WEATHER...THOUGH SOUNDINGS 
INDICATE SOME LOW CLOUDS COULD LINGER OVER THE REGION FOR AT LEAST 
PART OF THE DAY. THE NEXT WEATHER FEATURE OF NOTE WILL BE AN UPPER-
TROUGH PASSING THRU THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. MODELS ARE SHOWING GOOD 
CONSENSUS WITH RESPECT TO PRECIPITATION BEING LIKELY DURING THIS 
PERIOD...BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS SYSTEM. 
SPECIFICALLY...THE GFS TRACK IS MORE NORTHERLY AND A WEAKER OPEN 
WAVE. THIS WOULD PROMOTE A WARMER...MOSTLY RAIN EVENT. THE ECMWF 
SHOWS A DEEPER CLOSED LOW MOVING THRU THE AREA...WHICH WOULD BRING 
IN SOME COLDER AIR AND RESULT IN A POTENTIAL FOR SOME ACCUMULATING 
SNOWFALL ALONG THE MOUNTAINS OF NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL CONTINUE TO MONTITOR THE LATEST MODEL 
TRENDS...BUT FOR NOW 6-7 DAYS OUT...WILL REMAIN CAUTIOUS WITH MAKING 
TOO MANY ADJUSTMENTS.

307 PM EST SUN DEC 14 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUEDAY)...EROSION OF LOW CLOUDS THIS 
AFTERNOON HAS LEFT SOME LARGE AREAS OF CLEARING ACROSS MUCH OF SE TN 
AND ALSO OVER PARTS OF THE PLATEAU. APPEARS THAT THE REMAINDER OF NE 
TN AND EVEN SW VA MAY BRIEFLY CLEAR OUT. THE CHALLENGE IS HOW FAR 
SOUTH THESE LOW CLOUDS RE-DEVELOP OVERNIGHT. I OPTED TO SPREAD 
CLOUDS JUST A BIT FURTHER SOUTH THAN THE RAP/NAM MODELS SUGGEST... 
CLOSE TO ALONG I-40 AND I-81. KEPT IN THE PATCHY DENSE FOG OR 
FREEZING FOG FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST PACKAGE. CLOSE TO GFS MOS MINS 
OR A BLEND WHERE CLOUDS ARE LIKELY.

FOR MONDAY...A SWITCH TO SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW SHOULD HELP TO 
BREAK UP ANY LOW CLOUDS AROUND IN THE MORNING. COULD NOT FIND ANY 
MODEL SOLUTION THAT BRINGS SHOWERS INTO OUR WESTERN FORECAST AREAS 
THROUGH 16/00Z...SO SHAVED POPS BACK TO MAINLY SEQUATCHIE VALLEY.

SHOWERS SEEM MOST LIKELY MONDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT AND 
POPS WERE NUDGED UP TO LIKELY ACROSS THE BOARD. KEPT SCATTERED 
SHOWERS IN FOR NE TN AND SW VA TUESDAY MORNING THEN 30 PERCENT OR 
LESS POPS FOR THE REMAINDER OF TUESDAY. A FEW TWEAKS OFF THE GFS MOS 
MAXES MONDAY...THEN CLOSELY FOLLOWED THE SIMILAR MOS GUIDANCE FOR 
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...EARLY WEEK SHORT WAVE 
MOVES AWAY TO THE EAST TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY GENERATING A FEW 
SHOWERS MAINLY NORTHERN SECTIONS WITH A COUPLE SNOW FLURRIES IN THE 
MOUNTAINS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. NEXT 
WAVE SWINGS OUT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY SPREADING 
SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE REGION. TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
COLD ENOUGH FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME SNOW SHOWERS LATE THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING BEFORE LOW LEVEL WARMING GETS UNDERWAY. A 
MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF RAIN DEVELOPS FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY AS A MORE 
ROBUST SHORT WAVE BUILDS NORTHEAST FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ACROSS 
THE MID SOUTH/OHIO VALLEY. KEPT HIGHER GOOD CHANCE AND LIKELY POPS 
GOING DURING THIS PART OF THE FORECAST WITH BETTER MODEL AGREEMENT 
WITH THE STRONGER WAVE. AGAIN HAD TO SPRINKLE SOME SNOW SHOWERS INTO 
THE MIX WITH COLDER LOW LEVEL NIGHTTIME TEMPERATURES BUT THE BEST 
CHANCE OF FROZEN PRECIPITATION WOULD BE IN THE COLDER AIR BEHIND THE 
DEPARTING SYSTEM SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. HOWEVER...MOISTURE 
DEPTH AND LIFT WILL BE ON THE DECREASE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE 
PROGRESSIVE SYSTEM.

SEEMS TO PERFORM THE BEST DURING THE PAST 24 HOURS AND WILL FOLLOW
CLOSELY FOR FORECASTING LOW-CLOUDS. CLOUD COVER WILL MAINLY BE
CONFINED ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN COUNTIES THROUGH THE
FORECAST...EXCEPT FOR FOG DEVELOPMENT. 

CLOSE DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS...CLEAR SKY CALM WINDS HAVE ALLOWED
PATCHY DENSE FOG TO DEVELOP THIS MORNING. FOG AND TEMPERATURES
BELOW FREEZING WILL PRODUCE A GOOD DEAL OF FROST DEVELOPMENT.

FOG WILL DISSIPATE BY MID-MORNING...BUT LOW CLOUDS REMAIN...
MAINLY OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE PLATEAU COUNTIES.

FOR TONIGHT...ANOTHER ROUND OF FOG DEVELOPMENT ANTICIPATED.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/... WINDS WILL VEER TO THE 
SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. THESE WINDS...ALONG 
WITH MOSTLY TO PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS WILL ALLOW FOR AN EVEN WARMER 
DAY ONCE ANY LINGERING OVERNIGHT FOG/CLOUD COVER DISSIPATES...WITH 
HIGHS IN THE 55 TO 60 DEGREE RANGE IN MOST LOCATIONS. AS THE FRONT

HOWEVER...SOME WRAP AROUND MOISTURE AND A PERSISTENT INVERSION MAY 
KEEP LOW CLOUDS IN /PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE

BRIEF BOUT OF RIDGING ON THURSDAY...ANOTHER BROAD UPPER-TROUGH WILL

THIS AREA MAY NOT FALL ANYMORE AND MAY ONLY HAVE DRIZZLE.

FARTHER SOUTH TEMPERATURES ARE COLDER AS CLOUDS HAVE STAYED TO THE

KEEP THREAT FOR DRIZZLE AND FREEZING DRIZZLE SW VA AND NE TN WHERE
TEMPERATURES ARE AT OR BELOW FREEZING AND ELSEWHERE CHANGED WORDING

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...FORECAST FOR TONIGHT AND

LAYER MOVES AFTER SUNSET. THE NAM AND RAP MODELS DEPICTION OF 925
MB RH CLOSELY RESEMBLED SATELLITE PICS THIS AFTERNOON...AND WAS
CLOSELY FOLLOWED FOR GUIDANCE TONIGHT. ONLY MINOR TWEAKS IN GENERAL
AS PREVIOUS GRIDS TOOK THE BROKEN TO OVERCAST CLOUD LAYER TO ALL
BUT EXTREME SRN VALLEY COUNTIES OF SE TN AND SW NC. NO PATCHY FOG
NEAR LAKES AND STREAMS...BUT I DID ADD A VERY LOW POP FOR PATCHY
LIGHT RAIN...DRIZZLE OR FREEZING DRIZZLE TO SW VA AND PARTS OF NE
TN. THIS MESHES WELL WITH OUR NWS NEIGHBORS...AND WILL BE ADDED TO
THE AFTERNOON HWO PRODUCT.

THOSE CLOUDS SHOULD ERODE DURING THE LATE MORNING AND AFTERNOON
SUNDAY...BUT COULD LINGER AT LEAST PARTLY CLOUDY FOR SW VA AND NE
TN WELL INTO EARLY SUNDAY NIGHT. THESE CLOUDS EXIT MONDAY JUST
BEFORE CLOUDS ADVANCE FROM THE WEST WITH THE APPROACH OF THE
CENTRAL PLAINS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. GFS/ECMWF/SREF ALL INDICATE NOT
MUCH CHANCE OF ANY PRECIPITATION UNTIL VERY LATE MONDAY AFTERNOON
FOR OUR WRN MOST COUNTIES. THUS...I FAVORED THE MILDER GFS MAXES
MONDAY AS NAM MOS MAXES CONTINUE TO BE ON THE COOL SIDE WITH LITTLE
SUPPORT. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MID LATITUDE CYCLONE 
MOVES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
TUESDAY NIGHT GENERATING SHOWERS. AS THE SYSTEM IS DEPARTING TUESDAY 
NIGHT ENOUGH COLD AIR WILL HAVE BUILT INTO THE FORECAST AREA FOR A 
COUPLE SNOW FLURRIES IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. THE RETURNING ZONAL CONFIGURATION ALLOWS 
FOR A DRY WEDNESDAY HOWEVER WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY SLIDING ACROSS 
THE MID SOUTH MAY LEAD TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A SHOWER ON THURSDAY. 
BETTER RAIN CHANCES WILL BE BACK IN THE PICTURE FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY 
WITH GOOD CHANCE TO LIKELY POPS. THERE ARE MODEL DIFFERENCES WITH 
THIS SYSTEM WITH THE ECMWF COLDER AND DEEPER WITH A LITTLE BETTER 
CHANCE OF SOME FROZEN PRECIPITATION WHILE THE GFS IS MORE 
PROGRESSIVE AND WARMER DURING THIS END OF WEEK PERIOD. WILL AWAIT 
FUTURE MODEL DEPICTION OF THIS PERIOD FOR FORECAST FINE TUNING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IS COVERAGE
OF LOW CLOUDS TODAY. NAM MODEL SEEMS TO HANDLE THE LOCATION AND
EXTENT OF THE CLOUDS INITIALLY. VERY STRONG LOW-LEVEL INVERSION
WILL KEEP CLOUDS FROM MIXING OUT AS IT MOVES SOUTHEAST INTO THE
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

MAX TEMPERATURE FORECAST TODAY WILL BE VERY TRICKY AND DEPEND ON
HOW FAST CLOUDS MOVE INTO THE AREA. FOR THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE
AREA...GENERALLY TRENDED TOWARD THE COOLER NAM MOS. FOR TONIGHT
LOWS...GENERALLY WENT A DEGREE OR TWO MILDER DUE TO THE CLOUDS.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/... MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW A STEEP 
INVERSION PERSISTING UNDERNEATH A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE ON SUNDAY. 
THIS WILL LIKELY KEEP ANY LINGERING LOW STRATUS ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE AREA THROUGH THE MORNING AND PERHAPS THROUGH MOST OF THE 
DAY AT KTRI AND POINTS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND ALONG THE 
KENTUCKY BORDER. THIS WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES A BIT LOWER IN THESE 
LOCATIONS IN THE LOWER TO PERHAPS MID 40S. HOWEVER...SOME EROSION OF 
THIS SHIELD WILL OCCUR ACROSS THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL VALLEY AND ALLOW 
HEATING TO WARM TEMPERATURES INTO THE LOW TO MID 50S. 

WINDS WILL VEER TO THE SOUTHEAST SUNDAY NIGHT AS A COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES FROM THE WEST ON MONDAY. THESE WINDS WILL ALLOW FOR AN 
EVEN WARMER DAY AREAWIDE ON MONDAY WITH HIGHS IN THE 55 TO 60 DEGREE 
RANGE. SOME SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION MONDAY 
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE...BUT LIMITED MOISTURE 
WILL PREVENT THINGS FROM BECOMING TOO WIDESPREAD. AFTER ANOTHER SHOT 
OF COOLER AIR...A RETURN TO ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND EVEN SOME WEAK 
RIDGING BY THE END OF THE WEEK SHOULD PROMOTE A WARM-UP /ALONG WITH 
PARTLY SUNNY/DRY WEATHER FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. ANOTHER WEAK 
TROUGH PASSAGE LATE FRIDAY AFTERNOON INTO FRIDAY NIGHT WILL THEN 
BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF SCATTERED SHOWERS TO THE REGION TO BEGIN THE 
WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TOMORROW)
QUIET WEATHER WILL BE THE STORY IN THE SHORT TERM. BIGGEST HICCUP
IN THE FORECAST WAS NAM GUIDANCE COMING IN MUCH COOLER THAN THE GFS
WHEN IT COMES TO HIGH TEMPS ON SATURDAY. THE NAM WANTS TO KEEP THE
BOUNDARY LAYER NEARLY SATURATED THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND WANTS TO
KEEP TEMPS DOWN DUE TO THIS. NAM TRIED TO DO SOMETHING SIMILAR
EARLY THIS WEEK WHEN IT LINGERED IN POPS MUCH LONGER THAN THEY
ACTUALLY OCCURRED. BELIEVE THE NAM IS WAY OFF DUE TO THE FACT THAT
THERE WONT BE ANY MOISTURE TO WORK WITH THAT WOULD ALLOW ANY POP
CHANCES OR EVEN LOW LEVEL CLOUDS ON SATURDAY. THEREFORE HAVE GONE
CLOSER TO THE WARMER AND SUNNIER GFS MOS GUIDANCE THROUGH SATURDAY.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER RIDGE PUSHES EAST 
TO ACROSS THE ERN 1/3RD OF THE NATION SUNDAY...BEFORE GIVING WAY TO 
THE CUTOFF GENERALLY WEAK UPPER LOW COMING OUT OF THE CENTRAL 
PLAINS. THE ASSOCIATED LARGE SURFACE RIDGE SHOULD HELP KEEP OUR 
WEATHER DRY THROUGH LATE MONDAY...CLOSE TO PREVIOUS TIMING IN GRIDS. 
STAYED BELOW LIKELY POPS FOR NOW SINCE THE UPPER LOW TRACKS QUITE 
FAR TO OUR NORTH. BEST CHANCE FOR POPS SHOULD BE MONDAY NIGHT...
ALTHO POPS REMAIN OUT TO TUESDAY EVENING.

THIS SYSTEM IS FOLLOWED BY MORE UPPER RIDGING OUT TO THURSDAY. ECMWF 
AND GFS START TO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BY THURSDAY WITH SOME HINTS OF 
A SRN STREAM SHORTWAVE AND ISENTROPIC LIFT POSSIBLE BY THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. WENT WITH THE BLENDED POPS AND KEPT PCPN TYPE AS 
RAIN SHOWERS FOR NOW. 

SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS TO GRIDS WERE MOSTLY TO ADD A BIT MORE SKY COVER 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...FOR MID AND HIGH CLOUDS WHICH MAY STAY 
TO OUR NORTH. OTHERWISE...FOR TEMPS WE FAVORED THE MILDER GFS MAXES 
FOR THE WEEKEND...WITH ONLY BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE EXPECTED WHICH 
SHOULD EASILY MIX OUT TO GIVE WAY TO PLENTY OF SUNSHINE. 850 MB 
TEMPS WARMING TO OUR WEST OVER MIDDLE TN SUNDAY SHOULD HELP CHA WARM 
WELL INTO THE 50S. DAYS 4-7 MOS BLENDED TEMPS LOOKED GOOD AND WERE
CLOSELY FOLLOWED.

.SHORT TERM...(WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY)
OVERCAST SKIES ACROSS MOST OF THE CWA AT THIS POINT AND THINK THAT
THOSE SHOULD LINGER THROUGH MUCH OF TODAY INTO TONIGHT DUE TO
DECENT CAA AND A DECENT INVERSION TRAPPING THEM IN. LOW CLOUDS
SHOULD CLEAR OUT EARLY TOMORROW...ACCORDINGLY HAVE NUDGED TEMPS UP
A BIT OVERNIGHT INTO TOMORROW. STILL GETTING SOME VERY LIGHT
RETURNS IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA SO HAVE KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS UP
THERE INTO TONIGHT. ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE VERY LITTLE IF ANY AS
WELL. TEMPS SHOULD BE A BIT WARMER TOMORROW AS CLOUDS CLEAR OUT OF
THE AREA. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY EVENING THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
WILL BE THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDING EASTWARD FROM THE PLAINS STATES.
THIS UPPER RIDGE LOOKS TO SETTLE ACROSS THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE
NATION BY EARLY SUNDAY. A GENERALLY WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS
INITIALLY CUT OFF OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS...THEN SHOULD BEGIN TO
AFFECT THE SRN APPALACHIANS BY MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY.

THUS...LOOKS LIKE A QUITE DRY PATTERN RIGHT THROUGH THROUGH MONDAY. 
KEPT THE HIGHEST POPS LOCKED IN FOR MONDAY NIGHT WITH SOLID CHANCE 
POPS AND SCATTERED WORDING FOR TUESDAY. KEPT SOME LOW POPS IN FOR 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...DUE TO CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT AND NW LOW 
LEVEL FLOW WHICH SHOULD CAUSE SOME LINGERING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. 

FOR TEMPS...A VERY LARGE SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD KEEP 
OUR REGION UNDER WEAK N-NE SURFACE TO LOW LEVEL FLOW THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...SO TEMPS WILL SEE JUST A GRADUAL WARM-UP. STRAYED JUST 
ABOVE THE MODEL BLEND FOR MONDAY WHICH WILL BE THE WARMEST DAY... 
POSSIBLY TOPPING THE 60 DEGREE MARK OVER SRN AREAS. A COOL DOWN BY 
WEDNESDAY ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE EXITING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM.

FOR THE 18Z TAFS... BORDERLINE VFR/MVFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE THROUGH MOST OF THE DAY AT ALL THE TAF SITES AND CLOUDS
SHOULD STICK WITH US THROUGH A GOOD PORTION OF THE DAY. EXPECT THE
CLOUDS TO SLOWLY RETREAT AND SHOULD BE OUT OF HERE HOPEFULLY BY
SUNRISE TOMORROW. WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON KTRI FOR POTENTIAL
FOG, BUT CURRENTLY THINK THAT DUE TO LITTLE PRECIP, AND IF THE
WINDS CAN STAY UP, RADIATIVE FOG WON'T FORM.

QUICK UPDATE TO ADJUST A FEW VALUES. RAISED POPS IN THE NORTHEAST
WHERE WE'RE GETTING RETURNS ON RADAR MOVING INTO OUR AREA. AND ALSO
RAISED TEMPS IN A FEW PLACES WHERE TEMPS WERE QUICK TO REBOUND
AFTER LAST NIGHTS LOWS. AND ANOTHER FEW TWEAKS TO SLIGHTLY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SKIES HAVE REMAINED MOSTLY
CLOUDY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. LOW CLOUDS ARE TRAPPED
NEAR THE SURFACE WITH NW FLOW BRINGING THEM DOWN FROM THE GREAT
LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY. SOME LIGHT DRIZZLE AND SNOW FLURRIES AND
SNOW SHOWERS ARE OCCURRING ACROSS NORTHERN TN AND SOUTHWEST VA THIS
MORNING. THERE IS ALSO SOME POSSIBLE FREEZING DRIZZLE OCCURRING AT
ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET IN THE MOUNTAINS. TEMPERATURES IN THE
LOWER ELEVATIONS DID NOT FALL AS LOW AS EXPECTED SO MAINLY DRIZZLE
AND LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS IS FALLING BELOW 2500 FEET. AREA RADARS ARE
SHOWING WEAK RETURNS MOVING SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST IN MEAN UPPER FLOW.
DEEP SURFACE LOW HAS MOVED OFF THE EAST COAST AND UPPER TROUGH IS
OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE COUNTRY WITH A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
AREA CENTERED OVER THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES AND CANADA MOVING SOUTH
INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY.

SHORT RANGE MODELS SHOW THIS PATTERN TO CONTINUE THIS MORNING WITH
SOME DRYING BY THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS SE TWO THIRDS OF THE FORECAST
AREA. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL STAY TRAPPED FROM ABOUT KNOXVILLE OR
MORRISTOWN NORTH AS SOUNDINGS SHOW INVERSION THROUGH MUCH OF THE
DAY. EXPECTING PRECIPITATION TO END THIS AFTERNOON BUT MAY CONTINUE
A LITTLE LONGER NE AND EASTERN TN MOUNTAINS. SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS
SHOULD BE VERY LIGHT. WILL UPDATE SPS TO TALK ABOUT THE CHANCE FOR
WINTER PRECIPITATION...SNOW SHOWERS AND FREEZING DRIZZLE BUT MOSTLY
ABOVE 2500 FEET AND EMPHASIZE THE LIGHT AMOUNTS THAT COULD STILL
AFFECT HIGHER ELEVATION ROADS. KEPT HIGH TEMPERATURES CLOSER TO MET
GUIDANCES LOWER NUMBERS. ELEVATIONS OF 2500 FEET AND HIGHER WILL
LIKELY STAY MID 30S OR COLDER WITH HIGHS ELSEWHERE UPPER 30S TO MID
40S. TONIGHT SKIES SHOULD CLEAR BUT MAY BE LATE NE SECTIONS DUE TO
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND INVERSION. LOWS DROP TO THE 20S TO NEAR
30...BUT TEENS HIGHEST ELEVATIONS.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE
INTO THE SOUTHEAST U.S. THROUGH THE WEEKEND. DRY CONDITIONS WITH
ABOVE NORMAL DAT TIME TEMPERATURES.

A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE MID MS VALLEY ON MONDAY. 
THE LOW WILL TRACK THROUGH THE TN VALLEY ON TUESDAY. MODELS MAY BE A 
LITTLE FAST WITH THE SYSTEM. THE CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION BEGINS 
MONDAY EVENING AND CONTINUES THROUGH TUESDAY. A MILD COOL DOWN

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY/...
THE BASE OF AN UPPER-TROUGH IS MOVING THROUGH THE REGION THIS
AFTERNOON...BRINGING CLOUD COVER...LIGHT PRECIPITATION AND A
COLDER AIR MASS INTO THE AREA. AS SYNOPTIC LIFT HAS INCREASED OVER
THE COURSE OF THE DAY...THESE LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS HAVE INCREASED IN
COVERAGE IN THE VALLEYS. DUE TO THE COLDER AIR ALOFT...LIGHT SNOW
AND PERHAPS EVEN SOME LIGHT SLEET IS FALLING OVER THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS OF THE GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS ABOVE 2500 FT. THIS
PRECIPITATION WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON
AND EVENING...BEFORE GRADUALLY TAPERING OFF BY DAYBREAK AS LIFT
DECREASES. GIVEN THE SOMEWHAT LIMITED MOISTURE...AM NOT EXPECTING
ANY HIGH QPF TOTALS. MOST LOCATIONS ABOVE 2500 FT SHOULD ONLY
RECEIVE A DUSTING TO PERHAPS AN INCH OF SNOW BY WEDNESDAY /WITH THE
HIGHEST PEAKS ABOVE 5000 FT GETTING 2 OR 3 INCHES/.

HOWEVER...THE PRIMARY CONCERN WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE THREAT FOR
FREEZING DRIZZLE TO FALL LATER TONIGHT ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE LOW
AS COLD AIR FILTERS INTO THE SURFACE. MODEL SOUNDINGS AT KTRI LATE
TONIGHT BETWEEN 06-12Z SHOW CLOUD SEEDING OCCURRING AT AROUND -6C
WHICH WOULD INDICATE MORE OF A THREAT FOR FREEZING DRIZZLE THAN
SNOW. THIS PROFILE WILL BE COMMON ACROSS VALLEY LOCATIONS OF
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA /AND PERHAPS AS FAR
SOUTH AND WEST AS THE KNOXVILLE METRO/ LATE TONIGHT THRU WEDNESDAY
MORNING. GIVEN THE LIGHT QPF AMOUNTS...ANY ICING WOULD ONLY AMOUNT
TO A GLAZE...BUT EVEN A LITTLE BLACK ICE COULD STILL LEAD TO SOME
SLIPPERY ROADS DURING THE MORNING COMMUTE SHOULD THE SURFACE
TEMPERATURE SLIP BELOW FREEZING. GIVEN THIS...WILL ISSUE A SPECIAL
WEATHER STATEMENT FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED LOCATIONS AND THE HIGHER
TERRAIN FOR LATE TONIGHT.

OTHERWISE...PRECIPITATION WILL WANE AFTER SUNRISE AS THE SYSTEM
TRACKS EAST. HOWEVER...MODEL SOUNDINGS CONTINUE TO INDICATE THE LOW
STRATUS HANGING ON THROUGH THE EARLY AFTERNOON ACROSS MUCH OF THE
AREA /AND ALL DAY OVER THE NORTHEAST ZONES/. GIVEN THIS...ALONG
WITH THE NORTHWEST FLOW COLD AIR ADVECTION...LOWERED HIGH
TEMPERATURES A COUPLE OF DEGREES INTO THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S
AGAIN. DRY CONDITIONS WILL BE THE NORM BY THE AFTERNOON....WITH
SOME PARTIAL SUNSHINE OCCURRING IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY. 

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
A DRY FORECAST WILL BE CONTINUED FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH
MONDAY AS A HIGH AMPLITUDE RIDGE MOVES FROM THE PLAINS TO THE EAST
COAST. A GRADUAL WARMING TREND CAN BE EXPECTED EACH DAY...PEAKING
IN THE MID-UPPER 50S BY MONDAY. THERE IS A 500 MB VORT MAX THAT THE
MODELS TRACK ACROSS NRN AL/GA WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BUT THIS SHOULD
HAVE LITTLE IMPACT AS FORECAST SOUNDINGS ARE VERY DRY ALOFT.

THE NEXT CHANCE FOR PRECIP WILL BE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. THE GFS 
HAS NOT BEEN CONSISTENT WITH THIS SYSTEM...SWITCHING FROM A CLOSED 
LOW TO AN OPEN WAVE...AND SO THE ECMWF SOLUTION OF MAINTAINING A 
SLOWER CLOSED LOW IS PREFERRED. IT TRACKS THE UPPER LOW FROM OK/AR
ON MONDAY DUE EAST TO DIRECTLY OVER OUR AREA ON TUESDAY. WILL
CONTINUE THE PREVIOUS FORECAST OF CHANCE POPS ARRIVING MONDAY
EVENING...AND CONTINUE THAT CHANCE INTO TUESDAY.

THE BASE OF AN UPPER-TROUGH IS SWINGING THROUGH THE REGION LATE
THIS MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON...BRINGING WITH IT SOME COLDER AIR
INTO THE REGION. THE SYNOPTIC LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
SYSTEM...COMBINED WITH THE MOISTURE IN PLACE HAVE GENERATED LIGHT
SHOWERS AND WIDESPREAD LOW CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE REGION THIS
MORNING. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THESE SHOWERS EXPANDING AS
SYNOPTIC LIFT INCREASES THIS AFTERNOON. AT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS
/ESPECIALLY ABOVE 2500-3000 FT/...THIS RAIN WILL FALL AS LIGHT
SNOW. THOUGH AM NOT EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF ACCUMULATION .A
LIGHT DUSTING WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THESE AREAS THRU 00Z...AND
PERHAPS AROUND AN INCH AT THE VERY TOP OF THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS ABOVE
5000 FT. THE CLOUD COVER AND DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 30S WILL
PREVENT TEMPERATURES FROM CLIMBING MUCH...AND SO VALLEY LOCATIONS
WILL REMAIN IN THE 38-42 DEGREE RANGE FOR MOST OF THE DAY...
RESULTING IN JUST LIGHT RAIN FALLING. LATER IN THE EVENING BEHIND
THE WEAK FRONT...COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL BEGIN AND ALLOW FOR SOME
LIGHT RAIN/SNOW AND PREHAPS FREEZING DRIZZLE TO FALL IN THE VALLEYS
OVERNIGHT. A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT FOR BLACK ICE WILL LIKELY BE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...
MOST EXCITEMENT FOR THE SHORT TERM WILL START IN THE EARLY PARTS
OF TUESDAY MORNING. NORTHWEST FLOW SETS UP OVER THE AREA WHICH
USUALLY LEADS TO SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF
THE CWA. CURRENTLY THINK THE BEST TIME FOR THE ONSET OF SNOW SHOWERS
TO BE EARLY TOMORROW MORNING. LOOKING AT CROSS SECTIONS THE
MOISTURE IS CONFINED TO THE VERY LOW LEVELS SO AT THIS TIME DO NOT
THINK THAT ACCUMULATIONS WILL AMOUNT TO MUCH. SO AT THIS TIME WILL
NOT ISSUE ANY SORT OF ADVISORY SINCE SNOWFALL AMOUNTS SHOULD REMAIN
WELL BELOW ADVISORY LEVELS EVEN IN THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. ALSO
SINCE IT IS A WEAK NORTHWEST FLOW EVENT HAVE ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE
POPS AS YOU MOVE IN TOWARDS THE VALLEY, IN ADDITION TEMPS SHOULD
REMAIN WARM ENOUGH IN THE VALLEY THAT IF ANYTHING DOES HAPPEN TO
FALL IT SHOULD REMAIN ALL LIQUID EVEN AFTER A COLD FRONT MOVES
THROUGH THE AREA ON TUESDAY AND KNOCKS BACK HIGH TEMPS ABOUT 5
DEGREES.


.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
SNOW SHOWERS GENERATED BY THE NORTHWEST FLOW AND SOME STEEP LOW
LEVEL LAPSE RATES MAY CONTINUE THROUGH WEDNESDAY. WITH
STABILIZATION AFTER SUNSET...ANY ACTIVITY SHOULD END IN THE
EVENING. WILL HAVE ONLY A FEW TENTHS OF AN INCH ACCUMULATION
THROUGH WEDNESDAY IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

THE REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD WILL BE DRY...WITH 
TEMPERATURES WARMING EACH DAY. A CLOSED LOW WILL BE PULLING AWAY 
OVER THE NORTHEAST WHILE A LARGE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE BUILDS IN FROM 
THE WEST. THE PERIOD WILL START OFF COLD WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 30S 
TO MID 40S WEDNESDAY...BUT BY THE WEEKEND HIGHS WILL BE WELL INTO 
THE 50S. THE GFS AND ECMWF BOTH SHOW A CLOSED LOW TRACKING ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND LOWER MS VALLEY ON MONDAY...BUT THE 12Z GFS 
HAS TRENDED SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS...SO ANY PRECIP APPEARS TO

FOR THE 18Z TAFS...HIGH AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS ARE MOVING ACROSS THE
AREA, BUT CONDITIONS SHOULD REMAIN VFR THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE

BRING LOWER CLOUDS AND EVEN A CHANCE OF PRECIP, ESPECIALLY AT

BE LATER TONIGHT AND FIRST HALF OF SATURDAY. RAIN WILL INCREASE FROM

RANGING TO LOW CHANCE SOUTH.  WILL MAKE SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO MAV 
TEMPS...MOSTLY TO LOWER A BIT THURSDAY GIVEN EXPECTED CLOUD 
COVER/PRECIP.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...WEAK INVERTED 
TROUGH OR FRONTAL BOUNDARY STILL IN THE VICINITY THURSDAY NIGHT WITH 
LIFT AND ABUNDANT MOISTURE...LIGHT RAIN POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT. HIGHEST 
AMOUNTS EXTREME NE TN AND SW VA. FRIDAY HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS DOWN 
EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS BUT NEW SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTH 
CENTRAL STATES AND MOVES EAST INTO THE TN VALLEY. LIGHT RAIN AGAIN 
BECOMES LIKELY IN THE MOIST SW FLOW. RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT 
WITH MORE SIGNIFICANT RAIN TO THE WEST OVER THE MS VALLEY FRIDAY. AS 
SURFACE LOW AND FRONT SHIFT EAST FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY RAIN 
INCREASES. MAY HAVE ONE INCH OR MORE OF RAIN BETWEEN FRIDAY NIGHT 
AND SATURDAY. RAIN MOVES EAST SATURDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SUNDAY SO 
EXPECT A DRY SUNDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE AND PARTLY SUNNY SKIES MOST 
OF THE DAY. TEMPERATURES THURSDAY NIGHT WILL STAY IN THE MILD 40S. 
HIGHS FRIDAY ONCE AGAIN REACH THE 50S TO LOWER 60S. FRIDAY NIGHT 
WARMER WITH MORE RAIN AND COOLER SATURDAY AS MORE STEADY RAIN 
SPREADS IN. SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY TEMPERATURES STAY MILD WITH 
LOWS IN THE 40S AND HIGHS IN THE 50S. 

A FAST MOVING FRONTAL SYSTEM DROPPING OUT OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS 
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY WILL BRING MORE RAIN INTO THE TN VALLEY LATE 
MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WILL SEE MUCH 
COOLER TEMPERATURES BEHIND THIS FRONT WITH WEDNESDAY DRY AND THE SUN

CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. A SHORT WAVE TROUGH THAT WILL BE EXITING TO THE

CHANCE OF THAT HAPPENING MAY BE AT TRI SO INCLUDED JUST A VICINITY
REMARK HERE. THE INTERESTING THING IS THERE IS A BIT OF WIND HERE
AND THERE THIS MORNING THAT IS MIXING THE LOWER LEVELS OUT WHICH
HAS ERADICATED SOME OF THE IFR AND MVFR CEILINGS AS WELL AS THE
LIFR/IFR FOG THAT WAS THE RULE EARLIER THIS MORNING AROUND 06Z.
FORECAST FLIGHT WEATHER IMPROVEMENT ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE
AFTERNOON WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF A CEILING BELOW EIGHT THOUSAND

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOOKS LIKE ONE MORE SHORT 
WAVELENGTH TROUGH WILL PASS EAST ACROSS THE REGION TODAY. THIS 
FEATURE AND A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL PROVIDE SOME WEAK LIFT FOR 
LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING BUT MODEL 
FORECASTS POSITION THIS LIFT MORE TOWARD THE EASTERN SOUTHEAST HALF 
OF THE FORECAST AREA BY AFTERNOON AS THE FRONT SLIPS FURTHER EAST 
TOWARD THE APPALACHIAN SPINE. PERHAPS ANY CHANCE OF RAIN BY LATE 
AFTERNOON INTO THE EARLY EVENING WILL JUST BE ALONG THE MOUNTAINS 
BEFORE ENDING. ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BE ON THE INCREASE LATER TONIGHT 
AHEAD OF ANOTHER SYSTEM AND PLACED JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR RAIN IN 
ASSOCIATION WITH THIS FEATURE. MILD AIR SHOULD HOLD POSITION OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA AS THE AIR MASS SOURCE REGION CONTINUES OFF THE 
BEAUTIFUL BLUE PACIFIC WATERS. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)... THE MAIN CHANGE TO THE 
FORECAST WILL BE MADE ON THURSDAY. THE NAM AND GFS SHOW ISENTROPIC 
LIFT AND AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH OVER THE AREA...PRODUCING LIGHT 
PRECIP THROUGH THE DAY. WILL BRING POPS UP TO HIGH CHANCES 
NORTH...WITH SLIGHT CHANCES SOUTH. THE LIFT MOVES OUT BUT ABUNDANT 
MOISTURE REMAINS INTO THURSDAY NIGHT...SO WILL HAVE LOW TO SLIGHT 
CHANCES THAT PERIOD. SYNOPTIC LIFT INCREASES AGAIN FOR FRIDAY 
THROUGH SATURDAY AS A MORE AMPLIFIED SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES INTO THE 
MS VALLEY REGION. THE BEST QG FORCING OCCURS SATURDAY...AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO HAVE LIKELY POPS WITH MODERATE RAIN THIS PERIOD. A COLD 
FRONT PASSAGE WILL BRING LOWERING POPS SATURDAY NIGHT. 

SUNDAY LOOKS TO BE DRY AS WE WILL HAVE A SHORTWAVE RIDGE CROSSING THE 
AREA AND SOME DRIER AIR BUILDING IN BEHIND THE FRONT. HOWEVER THIS 
APPEARS TO BE SHORT LIVED AS THE GFS AND ECMWF SHOW A DEEPENING 
UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN CONUS FOR MONDAY. THEIR DEPICTIONS OF 
THE DETAILS OF PRECIP PLACEMENT AND TIMING ARE DIFFERENT...SO 
CONFIDENCE IS FAIRLY LOW...BUT WILL HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR 
MONDAY...WITH DRIER AND COOLER CONDITIONS FOR TUESDAY.

CONTINUES ACROSS THE EASTERN TN VALLEY. A WEAK COLD FRONT OR
BOUNDARY LIES OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH A BUILDING HIGH JUST EAST
OF THE APPALACHIANS. WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY WAS MOVING NE ALONG THE
FRONT MOST OF THE DAY WITH LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS AFFECTING MUCH OF THE
AREA. TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN IN THE 50S TO LOWER 60S AT MID
AFTERNOON EXCEPT 40S EASTERN PART OF SW VA AS COLD AIR DRAINAGE
GETS FUNNELED DOWNSLOPE TOWARDS TENNESSEE. TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY
MOIST PATTERN CONTINUES AS FRONT REMAINS STATIONARY AND MOISTURE
MOVING OVER IT WILL CREATE MORE SHOWERS AS WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY
TRAVELS ALONG IT. NOT MUCH CHANGE TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY WITH LOW
CHANCE POPS SOUTH AND HIGHER NORTHEAST. PATCHY FOG FORMING AGAIN
TONIGHT WITH MOIST ATMOSPHERE. MILD LOWS AGAIN TONIGHT WITH HIGHS
MID 50S TO LOWER 60S AGAIN WEDNESDAY ABOUT THE SAME AS TODAY.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...ZONAL FLOW ALOFT 
CONTINUES FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...THEN A MORE AMPLIFIED SHORT WAVE 
TROUGH WILL BE APPROACHING LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. HIGHER 
POPS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO BE MORE IN LINE WITH THIS TIMING. HOWEVER 
PRIOR TO THIS SYSTEM...RAIN CHANCES LOOK QUITE LOW FOR WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT.

KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN FOR MOST AREAS FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY 
NIGHT...BUT UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGING BARELY SUPPORT OUR CURRENT 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. THE ONLY FORM OF LIFT I COULD SEE DEVELOPING 
WOULD BE EASTERLY UPSLOPE FLOW AROUND THE SURFACE HIGH ACROSS THE 
GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY REGION. LATER SHIFTS MAY BE ABLE TO DROP 
THOSE POPS AND GO DRY...ALTHOUGH MOS POPS HAVE CONSISTENTLY RUN WELL 
ABOVE CLIMO. 

UPPER FLOW LOOKS TO BECOME W-NW FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY BUT ANY SHORT 
WAVE ENERGY COULD BE WELL NORTH OF THE TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. KEPT IN CONTINUITY WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR
MONDAY DUE TO A TRAILING WEAK SURFACE TROUGH OR COLD FRONT. DRY FOR
NOW ON TUESDAY IN LINE WITH THE ECMX MOS POPS AND BLENDED MODEL

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO THE SYNOPTIC SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE 
SHORT TERM...WITH WEAK DISTURBANCES EMBEDDED IN A GENERALLY ZONAL 
FLOW PROVIDING AT LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN MOST PERIODS. 

TODAY...A FRONT REMAINS STATIONARY OVER SW VA AND THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU...AND THIS WILL PROVIDE SOME WEAK FORCING FOR PRECIP THROUGH 
THE DAY. WHILE RADAR SHOWS LITTLE PRECIP NOW IN THIS AREA...MODELS 
SHOW A LOW DEVELOPING ALONG THE FRONT TODAY THAT WILL BRING A 
RESURGENCE OF SHOWERS. WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS NORTH TODAY...WITH 
CHANCE POPS SOUTH. POPS DECREASE THIS EVENING AS THE LOW LEVEL 
CONVERGENCE WITH THE LOW DIES OUT AND THE BOUNDARY BECOMES MORE 
DIFFUSE. SHALLOW MOISTURE AND WEAK LIFT WILL MEAN LIGHT QPF AND 
LOW/SLIGHT CHANCE POPS CONTINUING THROUGH TONIGHT...WITH CHANCES 
INCREASING SLIGHTLY ON WEDNESDAY WITH THE PASSAGE OF A WEAK 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH. 

WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING EAST ACROSS KY SHOULD PUSH THE BOUNDARY 
TO OUR EAST AND BRING ENOUGH DRYING TO HAVE A DRY PERIOD WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT AND ANOTHER SERIES OF VORT MAXES 
APPROACHING THE AREA WILL BRING POPS BACK UP ON THURSDAY AND 
THURSDAY NIGHT. UNCERTAINTY REMAINS HIGH FOR THIS PERIOD AS FORCING 
FEATURES ARE SUBTLE AND THE MODELS ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
SHOWERS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE AGAIN FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY WITH
ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH APPROACHING THROUGH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.
MILD AND MOIST AIR WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD NORTHEAST AHEAD OF THE
SYSTEM WHICH WILL FEATURE A SURFACE LOW AND FRONTAL BOUNDARY
PASSAGE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON SATURDAY. THEREFORE
POPS WILL BE HIGHEST FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY DUE TO CONVERGENCE
IN THE VICINITY OF THE LOW AND SURFACE COOL FRONT. FORECAST
CONFIDENCE DECREASES BY SUNDAY AND MONDAY WITH MODEL DIVERGENCE
LATE IN THE PERIOD. DROPPED POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SUNDAY WITH
INDICATION OF SHORT WAVE RIDGING BEHIND THE DEPARTING UPPER TROUGH.
YET ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH AND SURFACE WAVE BUILD INTO THE EASTERN
STATES ON MONDAY SO TWEAKED THE POPS UP JUST A TAD FOR THE
POSSIBILITY OF A SHOWER HERE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT MAX
TEMPERATURES APPEAR TO STAY NEAR OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH
THE PERIOD WHILE MINS HOLD SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL WITH
TRAJECTORIES ORIGINATING OFF THE MILD PACIFIC WATERS. &&

TO MID 40S ACROSS MIDDLE TN...UPPER 40S ALONG THE PLATEAU...AND
UPPER 50S TO LOW 60S ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN VALLEYS

TO MOVE SPREAD INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST. THIS ACTIVITY WILL
CONTINUE TO DO SO OVER THE COURSE OF THE EVENING...WITH THE
HIGHEST CONCENTRATION FAVORING THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE
AREA...ESPECIALLY AFTER 06Z. HAVE INCREASED POPS TO CATEGORICAL
ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA...WITH LIKELY VALUES PREVAILING ELSEWHERE
OVERNIGHT. LATE IN THE NIGHT...THIS PRECIPITATION SHOULD BEGIN TO
WANE /ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE PLATEAU/...BY AROUND 12Z...THOUGH
SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL PERSIST INTO THE DAY TOMORROW. LOW TEMPERATURES
WILL BE DEPENDENT ON HOW FAR SOUTH AND EAST THE FRONT MAKES IT.
BASED ON ITS CURRENT TRAJECTORY...THINK SOME OF THE COOLER AIR WILL
MAKE IT INTO THE PLATEAU...AND THUS LOW TO MID 40S LOWS ARE
WARRANTED THERE. ELSEWHERE TO THE SOUTH AND EAST...CLOUDS WILL HELP
TO KEEP TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...AT MID AFTERNOON A COLD FRONT
LIES OVER SE KY AND EXTENDS SW THROUGH MIDDLE TN. IT HAS MADE VERY
LITTLE PROGRESS SOUTHEAST SINCE THIS MORNING AND WAS STILL JUST NW
OF THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES WERE CLOUDY THIS MORNING BUT BREAKS
OVER THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND PLATEAU ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB
INTO THE MID 60S TO UPPER 60S. ONLY PATCHY LIGHT RAIN HAD FALLEN
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SO FAR BUT A LARGE AREA OF RAIN WAS JUST
BEGINNING TO MOVE ONTO THE PLATEAU AT MID AFTERNOON. SHORT TERM
MODELS BRING A FIRST WAVE OF RAIN ACROSS THE NORTHERN SECTIONS LATE
THIS AFTERNOON OR EVENING FOLLOWED BY A FEW HOURS BREAK AND THEN
ANOTHER WAVE LATE TONIGHT. RAINFALL AMOUNTS SHOULD BE LIGHT LESS
THAN ONE HALF INCH THROUGH TUESDAY. THE FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH OF
THE AREA TUESDAY BUT LOW PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP ALONG THE
FRONT TO THE SOUTHWEST AND SPREAD RAIN BACK OVER THE FRONT DURING
THE DAY. TEMPERATURES WILL STAY MILD TONIGHT IN THE 40S TO NEAR 50
AND BE ABOVE NORMAL AGAIN TUESDAY. WENT SLIGHTLY BELOW GUIDANCE DUE
TO RAIN FALLING TUESDAY BUT STILL REACH THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND A 
SERIES OF GENERALLY WEAK SHORTWAVES WILL KEEP A THREAT OF SHOWERS 
FOR JUST ABOUT THE ENTIRE LONG TERM. A FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL WANDER 
IN OR NEAR THE REGION AND ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO RAIN CHANCES. MODELS 
GENERALLY AGREE ON THE POTENTIALLY STRONGER SHORTWAVE TO BE PASSING 
ACROSS AROUND LATE FRIDAY TO EARLY SATURDAY. KEPT CONTINUITY WITH 
PREVIOUS GRIDS AND LATEST MOS FOR HIGH CHANCE TO LOW END LIKELY POPS 
FOR THOSE PERIODS. NO WINTRY PRECIPITATION AS TEMPS STAY MUCH ON THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A COLD FRONT WILL BE APPROACHING FROM THE NORTHWEST TODAY...BUT 
STALL ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN SECTIONS TONIGHT AS THE UPPER 
SHORTWAVE PASSES WELL NORTH AND THE FLOW ALOFT PARALLELS THE FRONT. 
THIS WILL KEEP THE MAJORITY OF PRECIP THROUGH THE PERIOD ACROSS OUR 
NORTHERN SECTIONS. TODAY...QPF IS EXPECTED TO BE LIGHT IN NORTHERN 
AREAS AS MOISTURE REMAINS QUITE SHALLOW AND LIFT IS WEAK. WILL KEEP 
POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE UNTIL 00Z WHEN WE SEE MORE LOW LEVEL 
CONVERGENCE COMING IN WITH THE FRONTAL ZONE AND MOISTURE DEPTH 
REACHING ABOVE THE -10C LEVEL. WILL HAVE CATEGORICAL POPS NORTH WITH 
CHANCE POPS SOUTH. THIS CONTINUES INTO TUESDAY MORNING...THEN AN 
UPPER SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSAGE BRINGS SOME MIDLEVEL DRYING AND LESS 
LIFT BY THE AFTERNOON...LOWERING POPS DOWN INTO THE CHANCE/SLIGHT 
CHANCE RANGE. TEMPERATURES TODAY AND TUESDAY APPEAR TO BE QUITE MILD 
AS WE WILL REMAIN IN THE WARM SECTOR...REACHING THE LOWER TO MID 60S 
IN MOST OF THE VALLEY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...
THE SHORT VERSION OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST IS WARM, CLOUDY, AND
ON/OFF RAINY.

THE LONG VERSION... MOISTURE AND CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL LINGER AROUND 
ON TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. BOUNDARY THEN HANGS AROUND THE AREA 
THROUGH PRETTY MUCH THE REST OF THE WORK WEEK MAKING THE REMAINDER 
OF THE FORECAST A LITTLE TRICKY ON EXACT TIMING OF PRECIPITATION. 
MODELS ALL AGREE THAT THE BOUNDARY SHOULD BE OVER OR JUST NORTH OF 
US, BUT THE LOCATION OF THE MOISTURE AND BEST LIFT IS NOT WELL 
AGREED UPON. AT THIS POINT BELIEVE PLACES NORTH AND WEST OF OUR CWA 
STAND TO GET BETTER ISENTROPIC LIFT AND SHOULD SEE THE BULK OF THE 
PRECIP THROUGH THE WORK WEEK. IN THE LONG TERM BELIEVE OUR BEST 
CHANCE TO SEE WIDESPREAD MODERATE RAIN MIGHT COME ON SATURDAY ALONG 
THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. TEMPS COULD BE A BIT TRICKY THROUGH THE PERIOD 
WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES, RAIN, AND FRONTAL BOUNDARIES ALL FACTORING 
IN. WE SHOULD REMAIN AT OR ABOVE CLIMATOLOGY THROUGH THE WEEK INTO 
THE WEEKEND. THUNDER MIGHT BE POSSIBLE AT THE LATE PART OF THE WEEK 
INTO THE WEEKEND, BUT DUE TO LOW CONFIDENCE HAVE NOT BROUGHT MENTION 
OF THIS IN THE GRIDS AT THIS POINT.

SOUTHWARD INTO MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND SOUTHERN KENTUCKY. AS A
RESULT...TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE REGION ARE

GUSTY SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS UNDER DECREASING CLOUDS HAS BEEN
OCCURRING MUCH OF THE DAY. DAYTIME TEMPERATURES WARMED INTO THE MID
AND UPPER 60S TO NEAR 70 IN THE FOOTHILLS.

LOOK FOR REMAINING CLOUDS TO SLOWLY BREAK UP AND DISSIPATE WITH
WEAKENING WINDS BY SUNSET. HOWEVER CLOUDS WILL MOVE BACK INTO THE
REGION OVERNIGHT. 

MOIST SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO AID IN KEEPING MINIMUM
TEMPERATURES WARM. PREFERRED MET GUIDANCE TONIGHT. THE UPPER FLOW
WILL BE NEARLY PARALLEL TO THE SURFACE FLOW. THIS MEANS THE FRONT
WILL OOZE ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND ORIENT ITSELF IN A NE TO SW FASHION
MOVING EVER SO SLOWLY SOUTHEAST. ISENTROPIC UPGLIDE ALONG AND JUST
AHEAD IS WEAK...HOWEVER NEAR SATURATION IN THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE
ATMOSPHERE MAY ALLOW SOME SPRINKLES/DRIZZLE AND PATCHY FOG TO
DEVELOP LATE TONIGHT ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND EXTREME SW VA.
OTHER AREAS MAY SEE PATCHY FOG NEAR SUNRISE. LOOK FOR INCREASING
RAIN CHANCES THROUGH THE DAY ACROSS THE TN VALLEY ALONG THE FRONT.
THE BEST CHANCES FOR MONDAY WILL BE ACROSS SW VA...THE NORTHERN TN
VALLEY AND ALONG THE PLATEAU. DAYTIME TEMPERATURES LOOK TO BE
SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN TODAY DUE TO MORE CLOUD COVER THROUGH THE DAY
BUT OVERALL NOT TOO BAD FOR EARLY DECEMBER.

.LONG TERM...MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...
THE TIMING OF THE FRONT LOOKS TO BE PUSHED BACK FROM EARLIER MODEL
RUNS. NOW THE MODELS ARE SHOWING EVEN MORE MOISTURE MOVING IN TO
THE AREA LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. THE FRONT WILL SLOWLY MOVE
AWAY BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AND THE NEXT DISTURBANCE MOVES THROUGH
LATE WEDNESDAY EVENING THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING. THIS LIFT IS
EXPECTED TO BE A LITTLE FARTHER NORTH...SO HIGHER RAINFALL AMOUNTS
IN THE FORECAST FOR AREAS NORTH OF I-40. AS THIS AREA OF PRECIP
MOVES NORTHEAST OF THE AREA FRIDAY MORNING...ANOTHER WIDESPREAD
AREA OF RAIN IS RIGHT ON ITS HEELS MOVING IN FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH
SATURDAY. MOISTURE LOOKS DECENT WITH EACH SYSTEM MOVING IN...BUT
THE INSTABILITIES AND WIND LOOK MILD. CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON
TIMING...AS MODELS SEEM TO PICK DIFFERENT DAYS FOR RAIN...BUT CAN
EXPECT SCATTERED LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS AND MOSTLY OVERCAST SKIES

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A THIN AND SHALLOW LAYER OF MOISTURE AROUND 850 MB IS KEEPING A 
BROKEN TO OVERCAST CLOUD DECK OVER THE AREA. THE GFS IS QUICK TO 
ERODE THE CLOUDS THIS MORNING...WHILE THE NAM MAINTAINS IT THROUGH 
MOST OF THE DAY. THE RAP AND HRRR SHOW SOME PARTIAL CLEARING THIS 
AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY SOUTH AND EAST...AND WILL GO WITH THIS 
SOLUTION. THIS WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON TEMPERATURES...WITH THE 
COOLEST TEMPS IN THE PLATEAU (UPPER 50S) AND WARMEST IN THE 
FOOTHILLS (MID 60S). AS A COLD FRONT PUSHES TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY 
TONIGHT...CLOUDS SHOULD BEGIN TO INCREASE AGAIN AFTER MIDNIGHT FROM 
THE NW. MOISTURE REMAINS TOO SHALLOW FOR PRECIP FOR MOST OF THE AREA 
TONIGHT...BUT WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING NW IN CASE THE 
ARRIVAL OF PRECIP IS SIMILAR TO THE SREF...WHICH IS A BIT FASTER 
THAN SHOWN BY THE NAM AND GFS.

.LONG TERM...
RELATIVELY ZONAL FLOW WITH A FEW EMBEDDED WEAK SYSTEMS MOVING THROUGH 
THE AREA WILL BE THE STORY IN THE LONG TERM. THE WEAK NATURE OF 
THESE SYSTEMS AND THE MODELS DISCREPANCY IN HANDLING THEM HAS LED TO 
A SLIGHTLY BELOW AVERAGE CONFIDENCE FORECAST IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD, 
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO RAIN CHANCES. 

FIRST AND MOST LIKELY BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL COME WITH A COLD 
FRONT MOVING THROUGH...SHOULD ENTER THE NORTHERN PARTS OF THE CWA 
MONDAY EVENING WITH THE BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIP COLLOCATED WITH AND 
JUST NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY. MODELS BEGIN TO HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH 
THIS SYSTEM. SOME ARE HINTING AT SLOWING DOWN THE FRONT AND WASHING 
IT OUT AND HAVING THE AREA QUICKLY RETURN TO S/SW WINDS BY TUESDAY. 
WITH THESE WINDS FUNNELING THROUGH THE VALLEY SOME GUIDANCE WANTS TO 
BRING LOCATIONS IN THE SOUTH TO NEAR 70 DEGREES FOR A HIGH ON 
TUESDAY. HAVE NOT BIT OFF ON THIS SINCE I THINK MODELS MIGHT BE 
OVERDOING THE WARM AIR ADVECTION AND EXPECT INCREASED CLOUDS AND 
POTENTIAL RAIN TO PUT A BIT OF A DAMPER ON THE TEMPS FOR TUESDAY. 
BUT WILL DEFINITELY NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON TUESDAYS HIGHS ESPECIALLY 
IN THE SOUTH. 

WITH DECENT INFLUXES OF MOISTURE OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE REMAINDER 
OF THE WEEK THERE WILL BE A CHANCE RAIN THROUGH NEARLY THE ENTIRE 
EXTENDED PERIODS OF THE FORECAST. A WEAK BOUNDARY WILL BE IN THE 
AREA ON WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AND COULD LEAD TO RAIN WHEREVER IT 
DECIDES TO SET UP SHOP. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A RUMBLE OF 
THUNDER IN THE VICINITY AT THE END OF THE WEEK, HOWEVER NO SEVERE 
WEATHER IS EXPECTED AT THIS TIME.

STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT HAS SET UP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WHICH
HAS CAUSED WINDS IN SOME AREAS TO GUST NEAR 30 MPH. HOWEVER...OTHER
LOCATIONS THAT HAVE THICKER CLOUD COVER HAVE HAD MUCH LOWER WIND
AND WIND GUSTS. LOOK FOR CLOUD COVER TO THIN A LITTLE BEFORE SUNSET
AND THEN FILL BACK IN OVERNIGHT. HIGHEST RH VALUES EXIST BETWEEN
THE BL AND AROUND 925MB...BUT DO NOT SHOW UP IN THE 850MB PROGS.
THE EXTRA CLOUD COVER WILL LIKELY KEEP OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPERATURES
ON THE WARMER SIDE. HAVE OPTED TO STAY CLOSER TO THE MET GUIDANCE
FOR THAT REASON. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SUPPORT CLOUDS LESSON THROUGH
THE DAY SUNDAY. LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION WILL PERSIST BRINGING
DAYTIME MAX TEMPERATURES INTO THE 60S. DRY CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...
CLOUDS AND PRECIP CHANCES WILL INCREASE SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY
MORNING AS A FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA. LIGHT SHOWERS COULD DEVELOP
MONDAY MORNING AHEAD OF THE FRONT MAINLY ALONG THE NORTHERN
PLATEAU...BUT WIDER AREA OF PRECIP LOOKS TO FILL IN THE REST OF THE
CWA MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH.
ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL SET UP BEHIND THE FRONT AS A HIGH PRESSURE
SYSTEM MAKES ITS WAY ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THIS WILL KEEP
RAIN CHANCES OVER THE AREA FOR TUESDAY AND MOST OF WEDNESDAY. THERE
WILL BE A BREAK WITH THE PRECIP AROUND WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY
AS DRIER AIR MAKES ITS WAY INTO THE MIDLEVELS. BUT THURSDAY NIGHT
THROUGH THE REST OF THE PERIOD...HIGH PRESSURE IN THE GULF WILL
HELP KEEP THAT ISENTROPIC LIFT BRINGING MOISTURE AND PRECIP TO THE

.AVIATION...
A BROKEN TO OVERCAST CIG AT 4-5 KFT IS CURRENTLY OVER MIDDLE TN AND
WILL MOVE EAST INTO THE TN VALLEY OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS. THEY
SHOULD REMAIN IN THE VFR RANGE. SOME DECREASE IN CLOUDS IS EXPECTED
TO OCCUR IN THE AFTERNOON AS MIXING INCREASES AND WINDS PICK UP TO
AROUND 10 KTS. UNCERTAINTY IS HIGH REGARDING CLOUDS TONIGHT...BUT
WILL STAY VFR FOR NOW. THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT SOME LOW CLOUDS
MAY DEVELOP...BUT WILL WAIT UNTIL WE GET CLOSER TO ADD IT TO TAFS.

310 AM EST SAT NOV 29 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE ALONG THE ATLANTIC COASTLINE WHILE A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES NE ACROSS THE UPPER MS VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES. 
THIS WILL PROVIDE A S-SW LOW LEVEL FLOW THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. THE 
NAM AND GFS SHOW ISENTROPIC LIFT AND MOISTURE ADVECTION SPREADING 
INTO THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON AROUND 850 MB...AND REMAINING IN PLACE 
OVERNIGHT. MEANWHILE THE RAP SHOWS VERY LITTLE MOISTURE THROUGH 
TODAY. THIS DRIER SOLUTION IS GENERALLY PREFERED AS SATELLITE SHOWS 
NO CLOUDS AT THIS LEVEL UPSTREAM. WILL BRING IN SOME CLOUDS IN THE 
PLATEAU THIS AFTERNOON...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW. IT WILL ALSO MAKE 
FOR A TRICKY TEMPERATURE FORECAST. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE WARMER GFS 
MOS FOR HIGHS...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW. A TIGHTENING PRESSURE 
GRADIENT THROUGH THE DAY WILL BRING WINDS UP TO 10-15 MPH WITH SOME 
GUSTS OF 20-25 POSSIBLE AT TIMES THIS AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
ONLY SLIGHT TWEAKS AND CHANGES TO THE FORECAST IN THE LONG TERM...
SLIGHT RIDGING STAYS IN PLACE OVER THE AREA ON SUNDAY WHICH WILL
LIKELY BE THE WARMEST DAY FOR THE NEXT 7 DAYS FOR MOST LOCATIONS.
HIGH PRESSURE MOVES OFF TO THE EAST ON MONDAY AS A COLD FRONT
ENTERS THE MIX LATE IN THE DAY BRINGING DECENT CHANCES OF RAIN POST
FRONTAL PASSAGE. THINK THE BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN ALONG WITH THE
HIGHEST RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL BE TIED CLOSELY WITH THE FRONT, BUT
CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL LINGER THROUGH MID WEEK AS MOISTURE AND POST
FRONTAL ISENTROPIC LIFT COULD COMBINE TO BRING LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS
ON AND OFF THROUGH THE FIRST PART OF THE WEEK. TAKE A BIT OF A
BREAK MID WEEK BEFORE ANOTHER SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH BRINGING IN
ABUNDANT MOISTURE FROM THE GULF AND ANOTHER COUPLE OF DAYS WITH
CHANCES OF RAIN.

AREA OF MID-LEVEL CLOUDS WILL MOVE THROUGHT HE NORTHERN HALF OF THE
AREA THIS MORNING-EARLY AFTERNOON. OCCASIONAL LIGHT FLURRIES CAN 
ALSO BE EXPECTED THROUGH MID-MORNING OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA..
NORTHERN TENNESSEE AND THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS.

FOR TONIGHT...SKY CLEARS ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO DROP...ESPECIALLY
ACROSS THE VALLEYS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)... WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE
RIDGING BUILDING IN BRINGING WITH IT WARMER TEMPS. SHOULD CONTINUE
THIS TREND THROUGH MOST OF THE WEEKEND BEFORE A COLD FRONT MOVES
THROUGH THE AREA ON MONDAY. ON SUNDAY AHEAD OF THE FRONT MODELS
WANT TO GENERATE VERY LIGHT QPF WITH SHALLOW MOISTURE AND WEAK
ISENTROPIC LIFT. HAVE BROUGHT MENTION OF THIS IN THE NORTHEAST
PORTIONS OF THE AREA ON SUNDAY BUT THINK IF ANYTHING DOES FALL IT
WILL BE VERY LIGHT AND ONLY AMOUNT TO A TRACE OR SLIGHTLY MORE.
BEST CHANCE OF RAIN HAPPENS WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE FRONT ON
MONDAY. COULD SEE MODERATE RAINFALL RATES DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY
WITH THE HIGHEST RAINFALL AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE IN OUR NORTHERN
AREAS. WILL HAVE TO WATCH TEMPS ON MONDAY AS FRONT COULD MAKE HIGH
TEMP FORECAST TRICKY ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHWEST. FRONT SHOULD BE
THROUGH THE AREA BY OVERNIGHT CAUSING TEMPS TO COOL BY ABOUT 5 - 10
DEGREES ACROSS THE AREA. SLIGHT CHANCES FOR SHOWERS LINGER ACROSS
THE AREA THROUGH WEDNESDAY. WE WILL BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS AFTER THAT
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WORKWEEK, BEFORE THE NEXT BEST CHANCE
OF RAIN COMES WHEN ANOTHER SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS THE AREA JUST BEYOND

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS CONTINUING TO MOVE THROUGH THE REGION EARLY
THIS MORNING...BRINGING SCATTERED TO WIDESPREAD SHOWER ACTIVITY TO
THE AREA. AS COLD AIR ADVECTION OCCURS ALOFT...SOME SNOW HAS BEGUN
TO MIX WITH RAIN AT THE LOWER LEVELS BELOW 1500 TO 2000 FT.
ELSEWHERE ALONG THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...A TRANSITION TO ALL SNOW
WILL CONTINUE OR HAS ALREADY OCCURRED AS TEMPERATURES CONTINUE TO
COOL ALOFT. AS A RESULT...ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL IS EXPECTED ACROSS
THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS...AND PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
AND FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AS SYNOPTIC LIFT PEAKS BETWEEN 09-12Z.
ALONG THE MOUNTAINS...TOTALS BETWEEN 2 TO 3 INCHES WILL BE COMMON
ALONG THE HIGHEST PEAKS...WITH TOTALS CLOSER TO 1 INCH IN THE
LOWER ELEVATION VALLEY AREAS IN THE TRI-CITIES/ABINGDON METRO. A
WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR THESE AREAS
THROUGH NOON TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS.

BETWEEN 12Z TO 15Z...LIFT AND MOISTURE BEGINS TO WANE AS
PRECIPITATION TAPERS OFF FROM WEST TO EAST. STILL HAVE MENTIONABLE
POPS ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF EAST TN AND PORTIONS OF SW
VIRGINIA THROUGH MOST OF THE AFTERNOON AS WEAK OROGRAPHIC LIFT MAY
HELP MAINTAIN SOME LIGHT SNOW THERE. OTHERWISE...CLEARING WILL
OCCUR GRADUALLY FROM WEST TO EAST OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND
EVENING. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR SOME GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING
OVERNIGHT AND A HARD FREEZE AS LOWS PLUNGE INTO THE LOWER 20S IN
MOST AREAS BY DAYBREAK FRIDAY MORNING.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
PERIODS OF ZONAL FLOW OR SOME DEGREE OF UPPER RIDGE AMPLIFICATION
THROUGH THE LONG TERM. MODELS GENERALLY CONSISTENT FROM EARLIER
RUNS AND SUPPORT A DRY FORECAST FROM FRIDAY THROUGH AT LEAST LATE
SUNDAY. STILL SEEING SOME VERY LIGHT QPF ADVERTISED JUST OFF TO OUR
WEST AND NORTHWEST FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER...THIS
SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH A WARM FRONT THAT MOVES FROM THE MID-MS
VALLEY TO OHIO VALLEY REGION...SO IT LOOKS WISE TO STAY DRY HERE
FOR THOSE PERIODS.

RAIN CHANCES DO APPEAR NEEDED FOR SUNDAY NIGHT OUT TO WEDNESDAY DUE  
TO A COUPLE OF WEAK COLD FRONTS...PLUS SOME POTENTIAL FOR WEAK E-SE

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT AND THANKSGIVING DAY...
AS THE SHORTWAVE THAT CAUSED ALL THE SNOW THIS MORNING MOVES
NORTHEAST...CLOUDS LINGER OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NE TN CAUSING TEMPS
TO RANGE FROM THE MID 30S TO LOWER 40S. MEANWHILE...FARTHER SOUTH
WHERE SUNSHINE HAS BEEN ABUNDANT TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN INTO THE
LOWER 50S.

THE NEXT QUICK MOVING SYSTEM WAS LOCATED OVER NE AR/W TN. SOME LIGHT 
RAIN WAS ALREADY NOTED IN NE AR JUST SOUTH OF THE MO STATE LINE. 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THERE ARE DRIER LOW LEVELS TO 
OVERCOME BEFORE PRECIP ACTUALLY MAKES IT TO THE SURFACE. THIS SHOULD 
OCCUR AFTER 7PM ET...AND GRADUALLY SPREAD EAST. LOOK FOR LIGHT RAIN 
TO BEGIN FIRST AND THEN CHANGE OVER TO SNOW AS THE LOW LEVELS 
SATURATE AND WETBULB COOLING OCCURS. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH HIGHEST POPS AND QPF OCCURRING OVER NE TN AND SW VA. THE 
CHALLENGE COMES IN HOW THE GROUND TEMPS PLAY IN ACTUAL 
ACCUMULATIONS. THERE APPEARS TO BE THE POTENTIAL FOR BURSTS OF 
HEAVIER SNOWFALL AFTER MIDNIGHT GENERALLY NORTH OF I-40 AND E OF I-
75 WITH ABOUT A 6 TO 8 HOUR DURATION. THE HIGHER TERRAIN STILL LOOKS 
LIKE THE FAVORED SPOTS TO RECEIVE THE BULK OF SNOWFALL HOWEVER WITH 
HOLIDAY TRAVEL LIKELY AND SNOW...THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY WILL 
CONTINUE FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THROUGH NOON TOMORROW.

THE BULK OF PRECIPITATION WILL BEGIN TO WIND DOWN AFTER NOON HOWEVER 
THERE WILL STILL BE A FEW SPOTS WHERE RAIN AND SNOW WILL OCCUR IN SW 
VA AND THE TN MOUNTAINS. 

CLOUDS WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN DAYTIME TEMPERATURES FOR 
THANKSGIVING. ANTICIPATE AT LEAST A 5 DEGREE COOL-DOWN FROM TODAY/S 
TEMPS AS THE COOLER AIR ALOFT DESCENDS. /AC

.LONG TERM.../THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...OFFENDING MID
WEEK SHORT WAVE MOVES AWAY THURSDAY NIGHT BUT NOT BEFORE THE SMALL
POSSIBILITY OF A COUPLE MORE SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER.
SURFACE RIDGE CONTINUES SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE REGION WITH A ZONAL
FLOW ALOFT DEVELOPING FOR A DRY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. BY SUNDAY
MODELS GENERATE A MORE ACTIVE FLOW COMPLETE WITH DEEPENING MOISTURE
ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AS WARMER AIR RETURNS AHEAD OF A ANOTHER
FRONTAL SYSTEM. THEREFORE...SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS
WERE USED ON SUNDAY. THE MOIST COLUMN AND LIFT INCREASE SUNDAY
NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE FRONT WHICH
MOVES THROUGH THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT. HELD ONTO MORE SLIGHT AND
LOW CHANCE POPS TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS ANOTHER WEAK SHORT
WAVE APPEARS TO TRAVERSE THE MID SOUTH. STAYED CLOSE GUIDANCE MAX
AND MIN TEMPS WHICH ALLOW FOR A NICE WARMING TREND SATURDAY THROUGH
MONDAY.

.SHORT TERM.../WEDNESDAY THROUGH THANKSGIVING DAY/...AN UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH CONTINUES TO TRACK INTO THE AREA EARLY THIS MORNING...
SPREADING LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND THE
SMOKY MOUNTAIN FOOTHILLS. WHILE TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 30S TO
LOWER 40S ARE BEING MAINTAINED IN THE VALLEYS...COLDER AIR PRESENT
ALOFT IS PRODUCING SOME ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL ALONG THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS OF THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS /MAINLY ABOVE 2500
FEET/. MODELS HAVE CONTINUED INDICATE SOME DECENT SNOWFALL
PRODUCTION ACROSS OUR FAR NORTHEAST MOUNTAIN ZONES /WHERE MEAN
WINDS MAY ALSO HELP TO ENHANCES SOME OROGRAPHIC LIFT LOCALLY DUE TO
THE ORIENTATION OF THE MOUNTAINS THERE/. AS A RESULT...A WINTER
STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR JOHNSON...CARTER AND UNICOI
MOUNTAIN AREAS AS TOTALS OF 3 TO 5 INCHES WILL BE COMMON ALONG THE
HIGHEST AREAS/. ADVISORY-LEVEL SNOWFALL OF 1 TO 4 INCHES MORE
COMMON ELSEWHERE ACROSS ELEVATED AREAS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS.

PRECIPITATION WILL TAPER OFF BY MID TO LATE MORNING AS DRY AIR 
FILTERS IN AND THE SYSTEM QUICKLY SHIFTS EAST. LOW CLOUDS MAY LINGER 
FOR MOST OF THE DAY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE...BUT SOME CLEARING SHOULD TAKE PLACE OVER MUCH OF THE 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY BY THE AFTERNOON...ALLOWING HIGHS TO 
CLIMB INTO THE LOWER 50S. ANOTHER RAPIDLY APPROACHING TROUGH WILL 
BRING CLOUD COVER AND PRECIPITATION BACK INTO THE REGION 
TONIGHT...ALONG WITH A SHOT OF COOLER AIR. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR 
ANOTHER ROUND OF SNOWFALL ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS LATE TONIGHT 
THROUGH MID-MORNING ON THANKSGIVING DAY. ACCUMULATIONS WILL 
GENERALLY BE CONFINED TO LOCATIONS ABOVE 2000 FEET...WITH TOTALS OF 
1 TO 3 INCHES POSSIBLE IN THESE AREAS ACROSS THE BLUE RIDGE/SMOKY 
MOUNTAINS OF EAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. IN THE 
VALLEY...SNOW WILL LIKELY MIX WITH RAIN AT TIMES LATE TONIGHT INTO 
THANKSGIVING MORNING. HOWEVER...SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN 
JUST ABOVE FREEZING...RESULTING IN LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATIONS IN 
MOST AREAS. 

ALTHOUGH SNOWFALL WILL BE RELATIVELY LIGHT...GIVEN THE HOLIDAY 
TRAVEL /AND THE PREVIOUS SNOWFALL FROM EARLIER TODAY/...THINK A 
WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IS WARRANTED FROM MIDNIGHT THROUGH 18Z 
THURSDAY FOR THE FAR NORTHEAST/EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE KTRI SOUNDING SHOWS 
A PERIOD AROUND 12Z WHERE SOME LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS OF UP TO 
AN INCH MAY BE POSSIBLE. GIVEN THIS...HAVE ALSO INCLUDED SULLIVAN 
AND WASHINGTON TN COUNTIES IN THE ADVISORY AS WELL AS SURFACE 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD FALL JUST BELOW FREEZING THANKSGIVING MORNING 
THERE. OTHERWISE...PRECIPITATION WILL QUICKLY WANE BY THE LATE 
MORNING AND AFTERNOON THURSDAY AS MOISTURE DROPS OFF SIGNIFICANTLY 
/RESULTING IN A COOLER BUT DRY END TO THE HOLIDAY/. 


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FAST MOVING 
SHORTWAVE WILL BE JUST ABOUT TO EXIT THE REGION BY THE START OF THE 
LONG TERM GRIDS...BUT I KEPT CONTINUITY WITH A FEW HOURS OF FLURRIES 
OR STRAY SNOW SHOWERS FOR THE FAR NE COUNTIES. AFTERWARDS...ZONAL 
FLOW ALOFT FOR FRIDAY WITH A SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE MOVING 
INTO THE REGION...THEN ACTUALLY SLIPPING OFF TO THE SE COASTAL AREAS 
BY 06Z SATURDAY. 500 MB HEIGHTS RISE JUST SLIGHTLY OVER THE WEEKEND
KEEPING MAINLY A ZONAL FLOW ALOFT. 

THIS SHOULD EQUATE TO A FEW DRY DAYS BEFORE A WEAK COLD FRONT TRIES 
TO EASE SE TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY. THE SUPER BLENDED GRIDS TOSSED IN LOW POPS AS EARLY AS 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...BUT QPF FROM MODELS IS EXTREMELY LIGHT 
MAINLY TO OUR NW IN ASSOCIATION WITH A WARM FRONT. THUS...I OPTED TO 
KEEP POPS OUT OF THE FORECAST UNTIL SUNDAY NIGHT. NUDGED POPS UP TO 
LOW CHANCE FOR MONDAY WHEN THE COLD FRONT LOOKS TO BE PASSING NEAR 
OR ACROSS THE REGION. 

MOS POPS REMAIN BELOW CLIMO FOR TUESDAY...AND THE SUPER BLENDED POPS 
WERE EVEN LOWER...SO STAYING WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR TUESDAY FOR 
NOW. ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS FROM SUNDAY THROUGH PROBABLY WEDNESDAY SHOULD 
BE APPRECIATED BY MOST FOLKS.

VALLEY LOCATIONS WILL BE WARM ENOUGH TO KEEP THE PRECIPITATION 
MAINLY RAIN...BUT HIGHER ELEVATIONS SHOULD SEE SIGNIFICANT SNOW.  
WILL ISSUE A SNOW ADVISORY FOR THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL MOUNTAINS AS 
WELL AS SW VA...FOR SOME MAINLY HIGH ELEVATIONS SNOW ACCUMULATIONS.  
PRECIPITATION SHOULD DIMINISH BY AROUND OR SHORTLY AFTER NOON. WILL 
MAKE MAINLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO MAV TEMPS...MOSTLY MINOR TWEAKS 
DOWN.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...NAM WANTS TO
TRACK THE SECOND UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE/TROUGH JUST A BIT FURTHER
SOUTH AND THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW IS FORECASTED TO MOVE RIGHT
ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE CWA BRINING IN A LARGE AMOUNT OF
RAIN/SNOWFALL. ON THE OTHER HAND OTHER MODELS WANT TO KEEP THE
UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE/TROUGH FURTHER NORTH AND THE ASSOCIATED
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TO MOVE ACROSS NORTH OF THE CWA. AT
THIS POINT AM LIKING TO SHY AWAY FROM THE NAM SOLUTION AS RUN TO
RUN CONSISTENCY HAS BEEN MUCH LOWER FOR THIS EVENT. NO MATTER WHICH
SOLUTION YOU BELIEVE MOS GUIDANCE IS COMING IN A COUPLE OF DEGREES
WARMER FOR WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. THIS COULD INHIBIT SNOW GROWTH
IN NORTHEAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS DAYTIME HIGHS RISE
INTO THE 30'S AND 40'S WHILE OVERNIGHT LOWS MAYBE GET INTO THE
UPPER 20'S. THE COLDEST TEMPS WON'T ARRIVE UNTIL THURSDAY NIGHT
WHEN WE GET CLEARING SKIES AND BETTER RADIATIVE COOLING. AT THIS
POINT THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST FACTORS IN TEMPS/ACCUMULATIONS FOR
WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WILL BE WHERE SNOWFALL OCCURS STARTING
TONIGHT INTO TOMORROW. IF SNOWFALL HAS OCCURRED OVER A LOCATION
TEMPS MIGHT COOL DOWN ENOUGH TO ALLOW ACCUMULATIONS...HOWEVER IF NO
SNOW FALLS GROUND TEMPS MIGHT STAY WARM ENOUGH TO MELT ANY SNOWFALL
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY AND SNOW MIGHT ONLY STICK ON THE
GRASS AND LITTLE WILL ACCUMULATE ON THE ROADS. IF THE PREDOMINANT
PRECIPIATION TYPE IS RAIN IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WILL HAVE TO
WATCH TO SEE HOW MUCH OF IT EVAPORATES BEFORE TEMPS GET BELOW
FREEZING AGAIN, COULD LEAD TO SOME ISSUES OF WATER FREEZING ON THE
ROADS IF IT'S NOT EVAPORATED BY FRIDAY MORNING. WILL HAVE TO
MONITOR FIRST ROUND OF SNOW VERY CAREFULLY TO SEE WHAT THE IMPACTS
MIGHT BE ON THE SECOND ROUND. POTENTIALLY A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY
MIGHT BE NEEDED FOR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THURSDAY
NIGHT INTO BLACK FRIDAY MORNING, BUT WILL NOT DO ANYTHING AT THIS
TIME AND TAKE A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH WITH WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT
INTO TOMORROW. I HAVE TRENDED UP A FEW DEGREES WITH TEMPS
ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH WHERE LITTLE TO NO SNOW IS EXPECTED BUT
WENT A LITTLE COOLER THAN BLENDED GUIDANCE FURTHER NORTH AND IN
ELEVATED LOCATIONS WHERE SNOWFALL ACCUMULATION IS MORE LIKELY.

THE AREA CONTINUES TO WARM UP THROUGH THE WEEKEND TO WHERE WE SHOULD 
BE FLIRTING WITH 60'S FOR HIGHS ON SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. MODELS 
ARE STILL SUGGESTING A FRONT WILL WORK ITS WAY DOWN TOWARDS THE AREA 
OVER THE WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK, BUT ARE NOT IN GREAT AGREEMENT WITH 
WHAT TO DO WITH IT ONCE IT GETS HERE. WILL HAVE TO MONITOR THIS AS 
THE TIME FRAME GETS CLOSER BUT AT THIS MOMENT MOST OF THE MODELS 
THINK THE FRONT SHOULD HANG UP SOMEWHERE AROUND KENTUCKY LEADING TO 
MOST OF THE ASSOCIATED PRECIP TO REMAIN NORTH OF OUR AREA.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MAIN CHANGES MADE WERE TO
INCREASE POPS FOR LATE TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING...AS THE LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKS NE ALONG THE SC-NC COASTAL AREAS. THE LOW
TRACKS NE AWAY FROM THE SRN APPALACHIANS RATHER QUICKLY WEDNESDAY. 

MODELS ALL QUITE CONSISTENT WITH A SWATH OF PRECIPITATION WRAPPING
WESTWARD ACROSS OUR REGION...AND LIKELY FALLING IN THE FORM OF SNOW
FOR THE SMOKIES...NRN MTNS OF E TN AND MOST OF SW VA. THE BEST
PERIOD OF POTENTIAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS LOOKS TO BE FROM ABOUT 08Z
TO 15Z WEDNESDAY...THEN THE DEPTH OF MOISTURE SHRINKS RAPIDLY AND
THERE IS NO REAL FORM OF LIFT FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS.

ADDED SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS FOR THOSE MENTIONED AREAS IN
LINE WITH GUIDANCE AND ADJACENT NWS GRIDS...GENERALLY AROUND WINTER
WEATHER ADVISORY TOTALS. PLAN TO HIGHLIGHT THIS IN OUR HWO PRODUCT
AND ALSO A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT. 

OTHERWISE...JUST HIGH CLOUDINESS TODAY WHICH COULD BE DENSE ENOUGH
TO AFFECT MAX TEMPS...ALTHO I DID NUDGE HIGHS UP TO AT LEAST NEAR
THE COOLER NAM MOS MAXES. MOS BLEND FOR MINS TONIGHT AND CLOSE TO
GFS MOS FOR HIGHS WEDNESDAY...EXCEPT COOLER WHERE SOME SNOW MAY
OCCUR. 


.LONG TERM.../WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...A SECONDARY SHOT
OF COLDER AIR WILL PUSH INTO THE REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY
THANKSGIVING MORNING. THIS WILL GENERATE SOME ADDITIONAL ISOLATED
TO SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS...PARTICULARLY ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN
OF EAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. GIVEN THE PREVAILING WNW
FLOW...THIS WILL NOT BE A TRUE UPSLOPE EVENT...BUT RATHER A
SYNOPTIC LIFT EVENT FROM THE PASSING UPPER- TROUGH. MOISTURE MAY BE
THE ONE LIMITING FACTOR FOR MOST OF THE REGION /PARTICULARLY LATER
IN THE DAY ON THURSDAY/. STILL...A GOOD WINDOW FOR PRECIPITATION
FROM 06Z TO 18Z THURSDAY MAY RESULT IN SOME ADDITIONAL SNOWFALL
ACCUMULATIONS OF AN INCH OR TWO ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN...AND
PERHAPS INTO SOME LOWER ELEVATIONS OF FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. PRECIPITATION WILL TAPER OFF BY THANKSGIVING
NIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE SLOWLY BEGINS TO BUILD IN ON BLACK FRIDAY.

THIS WILL RESULT IN A MOSTLY DRY AND MILD FORECAST FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD...WITH HIGHS PEAKING IN THE UPPER 50S TO
LOWER 60S BY THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. A VERY BROAD TROUGH
MAY SEND A WEAK FRONT IN OUR DIRECTION BY SUNDAY AND MONDAY...BUT
ONLY ISOLATED TO PERHAPS WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED AS
THE FRONT SHOULD HANG UP TO THE NORTH AND WEST OF THE FORECAST
AREA.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...JUST SOME BRIEF COLD ADVECTION 
BEHIND THE EXITING COLD FRONT. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN 
TONIGHT AND TUESDAY.  SHOULD BE PRECIP FREE FOR THE SHORT TERM. 
SHOULD SEE ANY LINGERING LOWER CLOUDS IN THE COLD ADVECTION EXIT 
DURING THE NIGHT...BUT EXPECT SOME HIGH CLOUDS TO MOVE ACROSS LATER 
TONIGHT AND TUESDAY.  WINDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO DIMINISH THIS 
EVENING...SO WILL LET REMAINING WIND ADVISORY EXPIRE ON SCHEDULE.  
MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...AT THIS POINT THE
MOST EXCITEMENT FOR THE LONG TERM PERIODS WILL COME TUESDAY NIGHT
THROUGH THURSDAY AS A LOW PRESSURE CENTER IN THE ATLANTIC STARTS TO
MAKE IT'S WAY NORTH ALONG THE EAST COAST. IT SHOULD BE STRONG
ENOUGH TO HAVE MOISTURE WRAP AROUND AND INVADE THE AREA AS
OVERNIGHT TUESDAY. CURRENTLY THINK THE HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS HAVE
THE BEST CHANCES TO SEE SNOW. AREAS TOWARDS THE VALLEY WOULD LIKELY
SEE A COLD RAIN WITH TEMPS REMAINING ABOVE FREEZING DURING THE BEST
TIME FRAME FOR PRECIPITATION. AT THIS POINT HAVE SNOWFALL TOTALS
THROUGH THURSDAY BETWEEN A TRACE TO 2 INCHES IN THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS
AND HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA, WITH SOME OF THE
HIGHEST PEAKS GETTING AROUND 3 INCHES.

QUICK ON THE HEELS OF THE WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ANOTHER SHORTWAVE 
MOVES ACROSS AND CONTINUES TO BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN/SNOW TO 
THE AREA. EARLY THURSDAY/LATE WEDNESDAY SOME OF THE MODELS WANT TO 
START TO DRY OUT THE MID LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE WHILE OTHERS WANT 
TO KEEP IT MOIST. WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS AS THE TIME DRAWS 
CLOSER AS IT COULD HELP SOME LOCATIONS PICK UP ANOTHER QUICK BOUT OF 
SNOW IF THE DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONES ARE STILL MOIST COME THURSDAY 
MORNING.

WE TAKE A BREAK FOR A LITTLE WHILE AS TEMPS SLOWLY BEGIN TO CLIMB 
BEFORE OUR NEXT BEST SHOT AT PRECIP EARLY NEXT WEEK. MODELS WANT TO 
BRING IN A FRONT AND STALL IT OUT SOMEWHERE IN THE GENERAL VICINITY. 
HOWEVER AT THIS POINT THEY ARE STILL NOT IN GREAT AGREEMENT ON WHERE 
THIS COULD OCCUR. IF THIS DOES COME TO PASS PLACES NORTH OF THE 
FRONT COULD BE IN STORE FOR SOME STEADY RAIN TOWARDS THE BEGINNING 
OF NEXT WEEK.

MUCH COOLER IN THE UPPER 40S TO MID 50S. LOW PRESSURE IN THE GULF

MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS. HAVE INCREASED AMOUNTS
THERE WITH MOSTLY TRACE AMOUNTS OF SNOW AND SOME COLD RAIN
ELSEWHERE LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS THE SYSTEM MOVES UP
THE EAST COAST. MAY NEED AN ADVISORY FOR THE EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS
WEDNESDAY. LOWS MONDAY NIGHT SHOULD BE NEAR FREEZING AND SLIGHTLY
COOLER MOUNTAINS. HIGHS MOUNTAINS WEDNESDAY 30S TO LOWER 40S BUT
WARMER TO THE WEST. ANY SNOW WILL BE BRIEF AND NOT AFFECT TRAVEL
OUTSIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS. WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY WEAK UPPER
LOW MOVING SOUTHEAST WITH SHORTWAVE PRODUCES A CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN

MOSTLY A LIGHT RAIN BUT LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

HIGHER PRESSURE THEN REGAINS CONTROL THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY.
HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN ANCHORED ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST FOR NEXT
WEEKEND BUT A NEW AREA OF LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
PLAINS AND MOISTURE IN SOUTHWEST FLOW MOVES INTO THE TN VALLEY BY

.SHORT TERM... (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...SURFACE WARM FRONT REMAINS
SOUTH OF THE AREA EARLY TONIGHT. MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE HAS BEEN SLOW
TO RELEASE THIS AFTERNOON AND WILL MOVE NE THROUGH THE AREA THIS
EVENING. RAIN CHANCE REMAINS HIGH THROUGH MIDNIGHT. STRONG
SOUTHEAST H85 WINDS CONTINUE INTO EARLY TONIGHT. MOUNTAIN WAVE
WINDS WILL LIKELY PERSIST THROUGH LATE NIGHT. STRENGTHENING SW-NE
UPPER JET TAKES SHAPE TONIGHT INTO MONDAY THROUGH THE TN VALLEY.
THE SURFACE WARM FRONT WILL MOVE NORTH THROUGH THE AREA TONIGHT
FOLLOWED BY A DECREASE IN PRECIPITATION. ISOLATED TO SCATTERED
SHOWERS REMAIN POSSIBLE ON MONDAY AHEAD OF A LATE DAY COLD FRONT.
WINDS WILL INCREASE BECOMING BREEZY FROM THE SOUTHWEST ON MONDAY.

.LONG TERM... (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)
NAM WANTS TO CONTINUE TO LINGER SOME LIGHT PRECIP THROUGH EARLY 
TUESDAY MORNING WHILE THE GFS/ECMWF WANT TO KEEP THE ENERGY OF THE 
SYSTEM FURTHER NORTH AND OUT OF OUR AREA. REGARDLESS OF WHICH 
SOLUTION YOU BELIEVE LIGHT PRECIP SHOULD BE OUT OF THE AREA BY 
TUESDAY MORNING. TUESDAY HIGHS WILL BE COOLER THAN MONDAY'S AND 
SLIGHTLY BELOW AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. NAM WANTS TO KEEP THE 
FRONT DOWN SOUTH OF US ALONG WITH ANY CHANCE OF CHANCE OF RAIN/SNOW 
FOR THE AREA. ON THE OTHER HAND OTHER MODELS SUCH AS THE GFS/ECMWF 
WANT TO GIN UP A LOW THAT SLIDES ALONG THE FRONT AND BRINGS IN 
ENOUGH MOISTURE TO ALLOW RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS TO OUR NORTH EAST. HAVE TRENDED TOWARD THIS SOLUTION AND 
BROUGHT IN LIGHT SNOW ON WEDNESDAY. CURRENTLY HAVE THE SNOW STAYING 
IN THE HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS AS THEY HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF PRECIP 
AND COOLER TEMPS TO SUPPORT SNOW, BUT AT THE MOMENT HAVE THOSE 
LOCATIONS RECEIVING AROUND AN INCH OR LESS.

TEMPS WILL SLOWLY WARM BACK UP THROUGH THE SECOND HALF OF THE WORK 
WEEK TILL HIGHS WILL BE NEAR 50 ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA NEXT 
WEEKEND. NEXT BEST CHANCE OF PRECIP WILL COME OVER THE WEEKEND AS A 
POTENTIAL BOUNDARY MOVES OVER THE AREA. HAVE LOW CONFIDENCE ON PRECIP 
CHANCES/TYPE AT THIS TIME AS MODELS ARE NOT IN GREAT AGREEMENT ON 
WHEN (OR IF) THIS MIGHT HAPPEN.

401 AM EST SUN NOV 23 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SOUTHERLY WINDS THIS MORNING WILL 
EVENTUALLY SPREAD SHOWERS INTO THE FORECAST AREA AS THE WARM FRONT 
APPROACHES. THE SE 850 JET...WHICH WILL INCREASE TO AROUND 50 TO 60 
KNOTS BY EARLY AFTERNOON...PLUS A STABLE LAYER SUPPORT UPGRADING THE 
HIGH WIND WATCH TO A HIGH WIND WARNING. THE DOWNSLOPE FLOW INTO THE 
CENTRAL AND SRN VALLEY WILL LIKELY DELAY THE ONSET OF MEASURABLE 
RAINS FOR THOSE AREAS...IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS.

SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY IS LACKING...BUT A BRIEF PERIOD OF 
ELEVATED INSTABILITY WITH THE WARM FRONT THIS EVENING...WAS WORTH 
ADDING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS TO SE TN AND SW NC COUNTIES. 

THE SE FLOW SHIFTS TO SW BY 03Z MONDAY AND THE HIGHEST WIND SPEEDS 
MAY BE DECREASING BY THEN. HOWEVER...A TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT AHEAD 
OF THE COLD FRONT...COULD REQUIRE AT LEAST A WIND ADVISORY FOR 06Z 
TO 12Z MONDAY. THUS...OPTED TO KEEP THE HIGH WIND WARNING THROUGH 
12Z MONDAY FOR NOW. 

MAX TEMPS TODAY ARE CHALLENGING...GIVEN ABOUT A 20 DEGREE DIFFERENCE 
IN TEMPS EARLY THIS MORNING FROM 34 DEGS AT TRI TO 56 DEGS AT CHA. 
DOWNSLOPING EFFECT SHOULD ADD A FEW DEGREES FOR CENTRAL AND NRN 
VALLEY AREAS. THE GFS MOS MAX TEMPS LOOKED REASONABLE WITH A FEW 
ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR DOWNSLOPE WARMING. MINS TONIGHT SHOULD BE 
QUITE MILD GIVEN THE STRONG SW WINDS AND NO FRONTAL PASSAGE UNTIL ON 
MONDAY. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS BRING IN MID LEVEL DRY 
SLOT MONDAY AHEAD OF COLD FRONT. WINDS STILL STRONG OUT OF THE SW 
AHEAD OF FRONT. WILL LIKELY NEED A WIND ADVISORY OR DOWNGRADE HIGH 
WIND WARNING DURING THE DAY THURSDAY. KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE 
POPS WITH NAM MODEL WETTER AND WARMER THAN GFS. TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
MILD AS WELL IN THE 60S. INITIAL FRONT TO PASS THROUGH MONDAY 
AFTERNOON...THEN SECONDARY FRONT TO FOLLOW IN THE EVENING. COLD AND 
DRY AIR MASS MOVES IN MONDAY NIGHT ENDING PRECIPITATION AND DROPPING 
TEMPERATURES DOWN TO NEAR FREEZING OR SLIGHTLY BELOW. TUESDAY AND 
MOST OF TUESDAY NIGHT ARE DRY AS COOL HIGH PRESSURE MOVES ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA. LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY LOW PRESSURE 
DEVELOPS ALONG OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER FLORIDA. THIS SYSTEM WILL 
MOVE NORTHEAST MAINLY ALONG THE EAST COAST BUT MOISTURE WRAPPING 
AROUND THE SYSTEM TO THE EAST AND NORTHEAST WILL BRING CLOUDS AND 
PRECIPITATION BACK TO THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND DOWN INTO THE TN 
VALLEY WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR LIGHT SNOW 
MOUNTAINS AND POSSIBLY EVEN IN THE VALLEY. AMOUNTS WILL BE 
LIGHT...PROBABLY LESS THAN ONE INCH. COLD UPPER TROUGH IS REINFORCED 
AS PRECIPITATION SHIFTS NORTHEAST WEDNESDAY. A WEAK SYSTEM IN NW 
FLOW CROSSES NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY BUT AGAIN ONLY LIGHT PRECIPITATION. FRIDAY AND SATURDAY 
MORE COOL AND DRY WEATHER AS UPPER TROUGH STAYS OVER EASTERN US.

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...NOT MUCH CHANGE TO PREVIOUS 
FORECAST. STILL LOOKS GOOD FOR POSSIBLE MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON INTO THE OVERNIGHT. DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE AREA TO MOVE 
NORTHEAST FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES AS STRONG 
HIGH PRESSURE IS ANCHORED ALONG THE SOUTHEAST US COAST. HEAVIEST 
RAINFALL SHOULD STAY ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS WITH STRONG

TEMPERATURES. INSTABILITY FAIRLY LOW WITH WARM FRONT BUT ENOUGH TO 
MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE SUNDAY. BEHIND COLD FRONT MONDAY TEMPERATURES 
DROP DOWN INTO THE LOWER TO MID 30S OVERNIGHT WITH CLEARING SKIES.

THE REST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD IS DOMINATED BY A DEEPENING UPPER
TROUGH JUST TO THE WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA. HIGH PRESSURE WILL
KEEP SKIES SUNNY TUESDAY WITH MUCH COOLER HIGHS. LATE TUESDAY NIGHT
AND WEDNESDAY A DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW TO MOVE UP THE EAST COAST.
MOISTURE WRAPPED AROUND IT WILL SPREAD CLOUDS AND SOME LIGHT RAIN

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY) SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
CONTINUES ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT AND SHIFTS EAST ON SATURDAY. DRY 
AIRMASS IN PLACE WITH ANOTHER NIGHT OF GOOD COOLING. LOWS COOLER 
THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA. MOSTLY SUNNY ON 
SATURDAY WITH SOME HIGH CLOUDS STREAMING INTO THE AREA FROM THE 
WEST. TEMPERATURES RISING TO NEAR NORMAL. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY) SLIGHT RIDGING IS STILL 
BUILDING IN LEADING TO CONTINUED WARMING UP THAT SHOULD LAST THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND. MOST EXCITING PART OF THE FORECAST WILL COME ASSOCIATED 
WITH A AREA OF LOW PRESSURE THAT IS CURRENTLY SITTING SOUTH OF THE 4 
CORNERS REGION. SHOULD CONTINUE TO SLIDE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
PORTIONS OF THE U.S. BEFORE BECOMING NEGATIVELY TILTED AS IT MOVES 
JUST NORTH AND WEST OF THE AREA. POPS FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST LOOK 
NEARLY INTACT WITH THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN COMING EARLY SUNDAY 
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT AS PRECIP SPREADS IN FROM THE SOUTH AND WEST. 
HEAVY RAIN AND EVEN SOME POSSIBLE THUNDER WILL BE LIKELY, AND 
ALTHOUGH POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAIN IS PRESENT, THINK THE SYSTEM 
SHOULD MOVE THROUGH QUICK ENOUGH TO BELAY ANY FLOODING.

ALSO OF NOTE IS THE POTENTIAL TO SEE A MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT IN THE 
FOOTHILLS. DURING THE DAY ON SUNDAY AS 850 WINDS START TO VEER OUT 
OF THE SOUTHEAST AND PICK UP SPEED JUST NORTHWEST OF THE AREA, 
LEADING TO A FAVORABLE SET UP FOR MOUNTAIN WAVES. WILL HAVE TO 
MONITOR THE BOUNDARY LAYER TO MAKE SURE THERE IS A STABLE LAYER TO 
AID IN ITS FORMATION. WILL HOLD OF FOR NOW ON ANY SORT OF WIND 
PRODUCT AND LET A COUPLE OF RUNS OF HIGHER RES MODELS COME IN SINCE 
THEY CAN SAMPLE THE TERRAIN BETTER.

AFTER THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH TEMPS WILL TAKE A BIT OF A DIVE 
STARTING TUESDAY AND ONLY REACHING INTO THE 40'S AND MAYBE 50'S. A 
WEAK SYSTEM WILL THEN MOVE NEAR THE VICINITY OF THE AREA LATE IN THE 
FORECAST PERIOD BRINGING A CHANCE OF RAIN/SNOW.

UPPER-LEVEL RIDGING WILL HELP PROMOTE DRY AND PARTLY SUNNY

THE AFTERNOON. CLOUDS AND PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL RAPIDLY 
INCREASE SATURDAY NIGHT AS A DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SHIFTS

WILL PUSH A WARM FRONT THROUGH THE REGION...BRINGING WIDESPREAD 
SHOWERS AND EVEN SOME SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS DURING DAY ON SUNDAY 
/ALONG WITH MILDER TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER 60S/. THERE WILL BE A 
POSSIBILITY FOR SOME MINOR LOCALIZED FLOODING GIVEN THE HIGH 
PWATS...BUT THE PROGRESSIVE NATURE OF THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD LIMIT 
THIS THREAT SOMEWHAT. 
 
WITH A STRONG 70-80 KT 850 MB LLJ ROTATING OVER THE PLATEAU ON 
SUNDAY AND PREVAILING SE TO SSE FLOW OVER THE MOUNTAINS...A GOOD

WINDS IN THE 30 TO 40 MPH RANGE...WITH HIGHER GUSTS LOOK AS THOUGH 
THEY WILL CERTAINLY BE POSSIBLE...SO WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOR 
THE NEED FOR A WIND ADVISORY AND/OR HIGH WIND WARNING FOR THESE 
AREAS AS THE WEEKEND APPROACHES. AFTER ANOTHER MILD DAY ON MONDAY... 
A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT...BRINGING IN 
SOME COOLER AIR /ALONG WITH SOME ADDITIONAL LIGHT SHOWER CHANCES/. 
THIS PREVAILING BROAD TROUGH WILL LINGER THROUGH WEDNESDAY... 
PROMOTING COOLER AIR AND THE THREAT FOR SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED

300 AM EST THU NOV 20 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WEAK SYSTEM WILL MOVE THROUGH TO 
OUR NORTH THIS MORNING...BRINGING IN SOME LOW TO MID LEVEL CLOUDS 
AND POSSIBLY A FEW FLURRIES...MAINLY OVER NORTHEASTERN LOCATIONS.  
THIS SYSTEM WILL PULL OUT OF THE AREA BY MID MORNING WITH SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN FOR CLEARING SKIES DURING THE AFTERNOON. 
THE WARMING TREND CONTINUES TODAY AS TEMPERATURES CLIMB INTO THE 40S 
AND EVEN A FEW 50S SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON.  THE HIGH REMAINS IN 
CONTROL THROUGH THE NIGHT FOR CONTINUED DRY CONDITIONS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT 
OVERALL...ALTHOUGH DIFFERENCES INCREASE A BIT LATE IN THE PERIOD. 
FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS ABOUT AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.  SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED TO OUR NORTH FRIDAY WILL SHIFT EAST AND 
SOUTHEAST INTO SATURDAY.  SHOULD BE DRY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY WITH A 
WARMING TREND.  A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL TRACK NORTHEAST OUT OF 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TO THE GREAT LAKES REGION SUNDAY AND SUNDAY 
NIGHT...BRINGING A WARM FRONT THROUGH OUR AREA SUNDAY AND A COLD 
FRONT MONDAY.  RAIN WILL MOVE IN SATURDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUE INTO 
SUNDAY. SOME THUNDER MAY OCCUR MAINLY SOUTH AND CENTRAL AREAS SUNDAY 
AS WELL.  THE LOW LEVEL JET WILL INCREASE AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE 
DIRECTION WILL BE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST...WITH A POTENTIAL FOR A HIGH 
WIND EVENT DUE TO MOUNTAIN WAVES IN THE USUAL HIGHER ELEVATION AND 
FOOTHILLS LOCATIONS.  WILL MENTION THREAT IN HWO. UPPER TROUGH WILL 
MOVE INTO THE AREA TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...AND THERE MAY BE IMPULSES 
MOVING THROUGH THE FLOW WHICH WILL HELP TO BRING A FEW SHOWERS OR 
SNOW SHOWERS AT TIMES...ALTHOUGH THE DETAILS STILL HAZY THIS FAR 
OUT.  WILL JUST HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS MAINLY NORTH AND EAST ZONES 
TUE THROUGH WED.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE HAS 
SHIFTED TO THE SOUTHEAST TODAY. MODEST WARM AIR ADVECTION HAS GOTTEN 
UNDERWAY WITH SOUTHWEST FLOW IN ADVANCE OF APPROACHING COLD FRONT. 
SEPARATE JET SEGMENTS WILL STRENGTHEN TONIGHT. ONE WILL MOVE THROUGH 
THE LOWER GREAT LAKES WHILE THE SOUTHERN STREAM WILL MOVE THROUGH 
THE LOWER TN VALLEY. THE EXIT REGION OF A H70-H50 SEGMENT WILL 
PROVIDE MEAGER LIFT COINCIDENT WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN MOISTURE 
AHEAD OF COLD FRONT. FLURRIES A GOOD BET ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA 
EARLY THURSDAY BUT MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION DOES NOT APPEAR LIKELY. 
TEMPERATURES REMAIN COOL WHILE MUCH CLOSER TO NORMAL. 

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/... 

AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE AXIS WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE REGION 
LATE THIS WEEK...RESULTING IN CONTINUED FAIR/DRY WEATHER AND WARMER 
TEMPERATURES. THE COMBINATION OF ABOUNDANT SUNSHINE...SOUTHERLY FLOW 
AND INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES WHICH HELP PUSH HIGHS INTO THE 50S BY 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. CLOUDS AND PRECIPIATION CHANCES WILL RAPIDLY 
INCREASE SATURDAY NIGHT AS DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SHIFTS FROM 
THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO GREAT LAKES ON SUNDAY. THIS WILL 
RESULT IN WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND EVEN SOME THUNDERSTORMS FOR 
SUNDAY...WITH MILD TEMPERATURES IN THE 60S. SOME STRONG SOUTHEAST 
WINDS ALONG THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS COULD RESULT IN LOCALIZED 
MOUNTAIN WAVE WINDS ALONG THE SMOKY MTN FOOTHILLS...SO MAY NEED TO 
MONITOR FOR A WIND ADVISORY ALONG THE MTNS LATER THIS WEEKEND. THE 
MILD WEATHER WILL CONTINUE INTO MONDAY AS ANOTHER SHORTWAVE KICKS 
OFF ANOTHER ROUND OF SCATTERED SHOWERS. A BROAD TROUGH WILL CONTINUE 
TO KICK OFF SUBTLE SHORTWAVES TUESDAY...AND THUS CHANCES FOR 
ADDITIONAL ISOLATED SHOWER CHANCES. THEN...TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY A STRONGER FRONT AND PUSH OF COLDER AIR COULD RESULT IN 
SOME SLIGHT CHANCES FOR SNOW SHOWERS ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND 
EVEN INTO THE VALLEY...BEFORE TAPERING OFF BY THANKSGIVING MORNING.

WILL INCREASE AND BECOME SOUTHERLY THIS AFTERNOON...BRINGING WARMER 
AIR INTO THE REGION.  HIGHS SHOULD CLIMB INTO THE UPPER 30S AND 40S

LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT 
OVERALL AND RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY IS GOOD ENOUGH TO YIELD AVERAGE 
TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. 
A WEAK AND MOISTURE STARVED COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH ON

A STRONGER SYSTEM WILL AFFECT THE REGION BY SUNDAY AS A LOW PRESSURE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...SNOW SHOWERS HAVE ENDED THIS 
AFTERNOON ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH A FEW POSSIBLE FLURRIES NE. 
SKIES ARE NOW CLEAR SE TWO THIRDS WITH JUST A FEW CLOUDS OVER THE
NE. GUSTY NORTHWEST TO WEST WINDS HAVE MADE IT FEEL LIKE A RAW MID
WINTER DAY WITH WIND CHILLS IN THE SINGLE DIGITS TO MID 20S...NOT
MID NOVEMBER. TEMPERATURES HAVE ONLY MADE IT INTO THE 20S TO LOWER
30S AS OF MID AFTERNOON.

AS THE COLD UPPER TROUGH TO THE NORTH SHIFTS EAST AND VERY DRY
SURFACE HIGH MOVES IN TONIGHT SKIES WILL STAY CLEAR WITH WINDS
SUBSIDING AND TEMPERATURES DROPPING TO NEAR RECORD LOWS IN THE
TEENS TO NEAR 20. WEDNESDAY A FAST MOVING CLIPPER NOW OVER SOUTH
CENTRAL CANADA AND THE NORTHERN ROCKIES MOVES THROUGH THE UPPER MS
VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES. SOME CLOUDS WILL SINK INTO THE OHIO VALLEY
AND TN VALLEY BY LATE WEDNESDAY BUT THE AIR MASS WILL BE TOO DRY
FOR ANY PRECIPITATION. SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL INCREASE AHEAD OF THE
SYSTEM WHICH WILL HELP TEMPERATURES TO WARM INTO THE 40S...SOME
10 TO 15 DEGREES ABOVE TODAYS HIGH TEMPERATURES. HIGHS COULD BE A
AFFECTED SOME BY CLOUDS NE SECTIONS SO KEPT TEMPERATURES IN SW VA
MAINLY IN THE UPPER 30S.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...OVERALL THEME
WILL BE A GRADUAL WARMING TREND THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED WITH A
WEEKEND STORM SYSTEM THAT WILL BRING POTENTIALLY HEAVY RAIN AND A
FEW STORMS.
 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT WILL STILL BE BELOW AVERAGE BUT MUCH WARMER THAN 
TUESDAY NIGHT. TEMPS IN THE MID TO UPPER 20S...ROUGHLY 10 DEGREES 
BELOW AVERAGE. LONGWAVE TROUGH CONTINUES TO PUSH EAST OF OUR AREA 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND INTO THURSDAY. AS THAT HAPPENS THOUGH...A WEAK 
WAVE WILL PASS TO OUR NORTH PROVIDING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SNOW 
SHOWERS ACROSS PORTIONS OF NETN AND SWVA. LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATION 
EXPECTED ACROSS LOWER ELEVATIONS BESIDES A DUSTING. ELEVATIONS 
ABOVE 3000 FEET MAY SEE UP TO HALF AN INCH OF SNOW BY THURSDAY 
MORNING. THURSDAY HIGHS BACK NEAR 40 EXTREME NORTHERN AREAS...MID 
40S CENTRAL VALLEY...NEAR 50 SOUTHERN VALLEY. FRIDAY RIDGING 
CONTINUES TO BUILD OVER OUR AREA OUT AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING WEEKEND 
SYSTEM. A WEAK AND SUBTLE SHORTWAVE LIFTS TO THE NORTHWEST OF US ON 
FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT BUT KEPT THIS PERIOD DRY AS THERE IS LIMITED 
MOISTURE TO WORK WITH THIS FAR EAST. HIGH PRESSURE STILL CONTINUING 
TO BUILD ON SATURDAY AS A LOW PRESSURE CENTER ACROSS TEXAS WILL HELP 
TO AMPLIFY UPPER LEVEL FLOW ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. THIS WILL 
ALLOW SATURDAYS HIGHS TO CLIMB NEAR 50 AND MID AND UPPER 50S. DID 
INTRODUCE SLIGHT CHANCE POP ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON FOR THE PLATEAU 
AND PORTIONS OF THE SWVA COUNTIES. MODELS STILL IN AGREEMENT THAT 
THE BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIP STILL LOOKS TO BE LATE SATURDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING. MODERATE TO POTENTIAL PERIODS OF HEAVY 
RAINFALL LOOK POSSIBLE AS SOUTHERLY 850MB FLOW WILL ADVECT MOISTURE 
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM. CURRENT GFS 
SOUNDINGS AT 12Z SUNDAY SHOW PW VALUES FOR CHA...TYS...AND TRI BEING 
BETWEEN 2SD ABOVE NORMAL AND THE 99TH PERCENTILE FOR MEAN PW 
CLIMATOLOGY. HOWEVER...THIS SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE A FAST 
MOVER SO FLOODING DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT WILL BE A THREAT AT THIS 
TIME. 

THERE COULD ALSO BE A FEW RUMBLES OF THUNDER WITH THIS SYSTEM. 
LIMITED INSTABILITY HOWEVER WILL KEEP THE BETTER CHANCES ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN VALLEY. THIS SYSTEM MOVES OUT DURING THE DAY ON SUNDAY WITH 
CLEARING CONDITIONS LATE. ANOTHER LESS POTENT SYSTEM MOVES IN ON 
MONDAY AND WILL BRING ANOTHER CHANCE FOR RAIN. THE NEXT LONGWAVE 
TROUGH BEGINS TO MOVE IN LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY AND WILL 
BRING YET AGAIN ANOTHER QUICK SHOT OF RAIN. THIS TROUGH WILL DROP 
TEMPERATURES FROM THE MID 60S ON MONDAY INTO THE UPPER 40S AND NEAR 
50 FOR TUESDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COLD ADVECTION OVER THE AREA 
WILL GRADUALLY COME TO AN END TODAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
CONTINUES TO BUILD IN. THERE WILL BE SOME MORNING FLURRIES OR LIGHT 
SNOW SHOWERS AROUND...THEN EXPECT THE CLOUDS TO DIMINISH FROM 
SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST DURING THE DAY. IT WILL BE QUITE COLD FOR THE 
SHORT TERM. TONIGHT WILL BE CLEAR AND MAY SEE DAILY RECORD LOW TEMPS 
THREATENED.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...WARMING TEND EXPECTED 
THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED WITH TEMPERATURES WARMING AT LEAST A LITTLE 
EACH DAY.  ON WEDNESDAY INTO EARLY THURSDAY...A WEAK BOUNDARY WILL 
PUSH THROUGH.  WHAT LITTLE MOISTURE THAT IS ATTACHED TO THE BOUNDARY 
SHOULD STAY TO OUR NORTH...LEAVING THE MRX CWA WITH SOME INCREASE IN 
CLOUDS BUT REMAINING DRY.  SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN BY MID 
DAY THURSDAY.  MODELS BRING IN A WEAK DISTURBANCE FRIDAY AND SATURDAY 
FOR ISOLATED SHOWERS MAINLY OVER SOUTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS.  MAIN 
SYSTEM OF CONCERN WILL MOVE IN SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...LINGERING 
INTO MONDAY.  THE AIR MASS WILL BECOME WEAKLY UNSTABLE...ALLOWING

.SHORT TERM...(LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT)TERM...LOW PRESSURE
ASSOCIATED WITH ARCTIC COLD FRONT HAS NOW MOVED EAST OF THE
APPALACHIANS WITH MUCH COLDER AIR MASS FILTERING INTO THE FORECAST
AREA AND A SECONDARY PUSH OF EVEN COLDER AIR IS FOLLOWING THE FRONT
NOW AS IT MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA. LOW CLOUDS IN THE COLD AIR
MASS ARE WRINGING OUT SOME LIGHT RAIN...SNOW AND POSSIBLE SLEET
OVER SW VA AND NE TN WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER TO MID 30S. 
OVERALL AM ONLY EXPECTING TRACE AMOUNTS AT MOST LOCATIONS.

ELSEWHERE SKIES ARE CLOUDY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY AND IN THE 30S TO NEAR
40 WITH HIGHER ELEVATIONS ALREADY IN THE 20S. WILL ISSUE AN SPS TO
ADDRESS POSSIBLE ICE FORMING ON ROADS IN AREAS WHERE HEAVY RAIN
FELL AND SOME SNOW SHOWERS IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS OVERNIGHT. WIND
CHILLS WILL FALL TO 5 BELOW ZERO IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. LOWS
TUESDAY MAY REACH NEAR RECORDS SINCE THEY ARE 22 IN 1997 AT THE
CHATTANOOGA AIRPORT...KNOXVILLE AIRPORT IS 19 IN 1959 AND TRI
CITIES AIRPORT IS 16 IN 1997.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...COLD...COLD...COLD TO
START THE LONG TERM. THEN...THE LONGWAVE TROUGH REMAINS THROUGH
THURSDAY WITH A WARM-UP FOR THE WEEKEND AHEAD OF OUR NEXT BIG
SYSTEM.

ARCTIC AIR IN PLACE ON TUESDAY AS WE ARE FIRMLY ENTRENCHED WITHIN A 
DEEP LONGWAVE TROUGH. MOST AREAS WILL REMAIN BELOW FREEZING ON 
TUESDAY WITH MANY MINIMUM MAX TEMP RECORDS LIKELY BEING BROKEN. CHA 
MIN MAX RECORD IS 34 IN 1903...CURRENT FORECAST IS 33. TYS MIN MAX 
RECORD IS 33 IN 1951...CURRENT FORECAST IS 30. TRI MIN MAX RECORD IS 
31 IN 1951...CURRENT FORECAST IS 27. SOME LIGHT SNOW 
SHOWERS/FLURRIES POSSIBLE TUESDAY MORNING ACROSS PORTIONS OF NE TN
AND SW VA DUE TO UPSLOPE SNOW...A LIGHT DUSTING MAY OCCUR. NO
SURPRISE THAT MANY LOW TEMP RECORDS ON WEDNESDAY MORNING WILL ALSO
LIKELY BE BROKEN. CHA MIN RECORD IS 17 IN 1914...CURRENT FORECAST
IS 19. TYS MIN RECORD IS 17 IN 1914...CURRENT FORECAST IS 17. TRI
MIN RECORD IS 17 IN 2008...CURRENT FORECAST IS 12.
 
ANOTHER SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH ON WEDNESDAY BUT MOST OF THE 
MOISTURE SHOULD STAY NORTH...RESULTING IN A DRY DAY. THE BEGINNING 
OF A WARMING TREND IS ALSO EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY WITH TEMPS 10 TO 15 
DEGREES WARMER THAN TUESDAY. AFTER WEDNESDAY...TEMPERATURES CONTINUE 
TO WARM AS HIGH PRESSURE SLOWLY STARTS TO BUILD IN AHEAD OF A 
WEEKEND STORM SYSTEM. MODELS STILL WANT TO BRING A WEAK SHORT WAVE 
INTO OUR REGION LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY BRINGING SOME LIGHT 
PRECIPITATION TO THE AREA. SATURDAY...A LOW PRESSURE CENTER ADVANCES 
TOWARD US FROM OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THE AMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL 
FLOW OUT AHEAD OF THE LOW WILL RESULT IN BOTH TEMPERATURE AND 
MOISTURE ADVECTION. TEMPS WARM INTO THE UPPER 40S AND LOW 50S WITH 
LIGHT PRECIP POSSIBLE SATURDAY AS A WARM FRONT ADVANCES NORTHWARD 
THROUGH THE AREA. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE BEST CHANCE OF PRECIP 
OCCURS ON SUNDAY AS A NEGATIVELY TILTED TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM SWINGS THROUGH. TEMPS ON SUNDAY WILL BE IN THE MID 
TO UPPER 50S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 40S TO LOW 50S. EVEN A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE AS THIS SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. ANOTHER SHOT OF LIGHT PRECIP ON MONDAY AS YET ANOTHER 
WEAK WAVE ROLLS THROUGH. TEMPS ON MONDAY LOOK TO BE THE WARMEST THEY 
HAVE BEEN SINCE EARLY/MID NOVEMBER WITH HIGHS IN THE LOW TO MID 
60S...SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

FORECAST AREA THE NEXT FEW HOURS. RADARS TO THE WEST HAVE SHOWN
MUCH LESS PRECIPITATION THAN EARLY THIS MORNING WITH SNOW SHOWERS
ALREADY ENDING. UPDATED FORECAST TO LOWER CURRENT TEMPERATURES WEST
BASED ON FRONTAL PLACEMENT AND DECREASED POPS FOR THE WESTERN
AREAS. LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON BUT
AM NOT CONFIDENT MUCH WILL OCCUR SOUTHERN AREAS BASED ON CURRENT
RADAR TRENDS. BEST CHANCE FOR SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES WILL BE
NORTHERN TN AND SW VA. WIND CHILL TEMPERATURES HAVE ALREADY
DROPPED TO THE 20S IN WESTERN AND MIDDLE TN WHERE TEMPERATURES ARE
AT OR BELOW FREEZING. THE MAIN STORY THIS AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT
WILL BE THE COLD TEMPERATURES COMBINED WITH WEST TO NW WINDS 10 TO

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DEPART 
WITH ARCTIC AIR RUSHING IN BEHIND IT TODAY INTO TONIGHT. RAIN WILL 
DIMINISH FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST TODAY. MOISTURE EXPECTED TO BE 
RATHER SHALLOW ONCE COLD AIR ARRIVES...AND DOES NOT LOOK TOO 
FAVORABLE FOR UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWERS. HOWEVER...MAY BE A SOME LIGHT 
SNOW/ICE AS THE COLD AIR COMES IN OVER SOME OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
AND COULD SEE SOME FLURRIES IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS TONIGHT.  ALSO

JUST ABOVE WIND CHILL ADVISORY CRITERIA BY LATE TONIGHT.  WILL ISSUE 
AN SPS TO HIGHLIGHT THE MINOR WINTRY PRECIP ACCUMULATIONS OVER THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN AND THE LOW WIND CHILL VALUES. WILL KEEP THE HIGH 
WIND WARNING OVER THE MOUNTAINS TO START THE DAY GIVEN THE STRONG 
LOW LEVEL JET.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...LONG WAVE TROUGH HOLDS 
POSITION OVER THE EASTERN U.S. UNTIL LATER IN THE WORK WEEK AS SOME 
SHORT WAVE ENERGY RIPS SOUTH ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE 
NATION. THIS WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES A GOOD TEN TO FIFTEEN DEGREES 
BELOW NORMAL THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD WITH SOME WARMING EXPECTED 
OVER THE WEEKEND. HOWEVER...TO START OUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD ON 
TUESDAY TEMPERATURES WILL BE RIDICULOUSLY BELOW NORMAL WITH WHAT 
LOOKS LIKE RECORDS BROKEN ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA WITH MIN 
MAXIMUM READINGS TOPPING OUT ONLY IN THE MID AND UPPER 20S NORTH TO 
THE LOWER 30S SOUTHERN SECTIONS. RECORD LOW TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
THREATENED TUESDAY NIGHT AS WELL. MODELS BRING A WEAK SHORT WAVE 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY BRINGING 
SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION TO THE AREA. SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY THE UPPER 
LEVEL FLOW WILL BECOME AMPLIFIED AS SHORT WAVE ENERGY DROPS THROUGH 
THE BASE OF A WESTERN U.S. UPPER TROUGH. THIS WILL LEAD TO 
INCREASING MOISTURE AND TEMPERATURE ADVECTION WHICH MAY RESULT IN 
SOME LIGHT SHOWERS ON SATURDAY AS WARMER AIR ADVANCES NORTH. 
STRENGTHENING MOISTURE ADVECTION AN ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL INCREASE 
THE CHANCE OF RAIN DURING THE DAY SUNDAY AS A STRONG STORM SYSTEM 
APPROACHES SUNDAY NIGHT.

ELEVATIONS OF THE FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS.

VERY DYNAMIC SYSTEM WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHAINS OVERNIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING. UPPER LEVEL
JET OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL PLACE THE AREA UNDER STRONG
DIVERGENCE ALOFT BETWEEN 06-12Z. THE DIRECT CIRCULATION AROUND THIS
JET WILL STRENGTHEN THE FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING OVER EAST TENNESSEE.
LATEST FORECAST SOUNDING SHOWS ELEVATED ABOVE 850MB...ESPECIALLY
AREAS ALONG AND SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 40. WILL INCLUDE A CHANCE OF
THUNDER FOR EARLY MONDAY MORNING.

THE STRONG UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM WILL ALSO INTENSIFY THE BOUNDARY
LAYER JET WITH 850MB WINDS INCREASING TO 65-70 KTS BETWEEN 06-12Z.
WILL ISSUE A HIGH WIND WARNING FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS THROUGH
13Z. STRONG INVERSION BELOW 850MB WILL KEEP WINDS FROM MIXING TO

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...
THE AREA OF RAIN AFFECTING THE CWA THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING IS 
ASSOCIATED MAINLY WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT...WHICH THE MODELS SHOW 
DECREASING AROUND MIDNIGHT. A BRIEF LULL IN THE PRECIP SHOULD OCCUR 
AROUND THAT TIME BEFORE Q-G FORCING ASSOCIATED WITH THE JET ENTRANCE 
REGION RAMPS UP PRECIP AGAIN LATE TONIGHT. LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION 
WITH A 40-50 KT LLJ MAY RESULT IN TEMPERATURES WARMING SLIGHTLY 
OVERNIGHT. HIGHER ELEVATIONS MAY APPROACH WIND ADVISORY
CRITERIA...BUT MOST SPOTS SHOULD STAY BELOW AND THUS WILL NOT ISSUE
AN ADVISORY AT THIS TIME. SW DIRECTION OF 850 MB WINDS IS NOT
FAVORABLE FOR MOUNTAIN WAVE DEVELOPMENT. QPF AMOUNTS OF 1 TO 2
INCHES ARE EXPECTED AREA WIDE...WITH SOUTHERN AREAS ON THE HIGHER
END OF THAT RANGE.

BY MONDAY MORNING WE WILL HAVE A COLD FRONT BEGINNING TO PUSH EAST 
INTO THE AREA...AND STRONG FORCING WILL EXIT TO THE EAST AND BRING 
CATEGORICAL PRECIP TO AN END. STRONG COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT 
WILL BRING FALLING TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE DAY...AND A CHANGE TO 
SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE LACK OF 
DEEP MOISTURE INTO THE DENDRITE GROWTH ZONE SHOULD MEAN ONLY LIGHT
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES AND AN UPSPLOE WIND
OF 20-25 KTS COULD RESULT IN SOME HIGHER ELEVATIONS SEEING AROUND 1
INCH THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. LOWS MONDAY NIGHT ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN
THE TEENS TO AROUND 20 IN MOST SPOTS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
DEPARTING UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE COULD LINGER INTO TUESDAY MORNING
WITH SOME SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA BUT MAINLY THE
COLD DRY ARCTIC AIR MASS WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES BELOW FREEZING FROM
THE TEENS IN THE MOUNTAINS TO 20S TO LOWER 30S VALLEYS. ONLY A FEW
LOCATIONS IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEYS MAY REACH ABOVE FREEZING. RECORD
LOW MAXIMUMS WILL BE POSSIBLE. WEST WINDS 10 TO 15 MPH WILL ADD TO
THE CHILL. COLD UPPER TROUGH WILL REMAIN OVER THE FORECAST AREA
THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH ANOTHER SYSTEM DROPPING INTO THE GREAT LAKES
WEDNESDAY. SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY CLEAR OVER THE TN VALLEY AND LOWS
TUESDAY NIGHT WILL BE THE COLDEST OF THE YEAR. MOST LOCATIONS AGAIN
COULD EXPERIENCE RECORD LOWS FOR THE DATE. THE GREAT LAKES SYSTEM
WEDNESDAY MAY SPREAD SOME CLOUDS ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE
REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL THEN
MODERATE WITH LOWS IN THE 20S AND HIGHS IN THE 40S.

THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY GFS BRINGS A SYSTEM FROM THE LOWER MS 
VALLEY INTO THE TN VALLEY. HIGHER ELEVATIONS MAY GET SNOW BUT MOST 
LOWER ELEVATIONS WOULD HAVE A LITTLE LIGHT RAIN. THE BULK OF THE 
SYSTEM WILL STAY SOUTH OF TN AS IT MOVES RAPIDLY EAST. COLDER AND 
DRIER CONDITIONS RETURN FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. MEANWHILE A NEW 
TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE WESTERN STATES THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. LOW 
PRESSURE DEVELOPS OUT AHEAD OF THE TROUGH SATURDAY EAST OF THE 
ROCKIES. THEN THIS SYSTEM ORGANIZES AND SPREADS CLOUDS AND RAIN WITH 
POSSIBLE SNOW NE AND MOUNTAINS LATE SATURDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SUNDAY. 
THIS SYSTEM IS MUCH WARMER SO HIGHS SUNDAY SHOULD REACH THE 50S WITH 
ALL RAIN FOR THE FORECAST AREA.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT AND SUNDAY
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OFF THE COAST OF VA/NC OVERNIGHT.
FARTHER WEST A DEEPENING SHORTWAVE OVER THE PLAINS/MIDWEST WILL
AID IN ALLOWING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO ADVANCE NORTHWARD WITH THE
STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY WINDS. AS A RESULT...CLOUDS WILL THICKEN
PARTICULARLY AFTER MIDNIGHT ACROSS THE TN VALLEY. THE CLOUDS SHOULD
HELP KEEP THE SURFACE TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN PREVIOUS
NIGHT/S. THERE WILL BE MENTION OF SLIGHT CHANCE /LOW CONFIDENCE/ MIX
PRECIP ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...HOWEVER THE LOWEST LEVELS OF
THE ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN TOO DRY FOR MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION TO
OCCUR UNTIL AFTER NOON ON SUNDAY. THIS HIGHER RAIN CHANCE ALSO
COINCIDES WITH THE BEST DYNAMICS OF THE UPPER TROUGH FOR THIS TIME
PERIOD. THEREFORE THE BULK OF PRECIPITATION WILL BEGIN SUNDAY
AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY
SURFACE LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN MS VALLEY SUNDAY EVENING SHIFTS
NORTHEAST TOWARD THE TN VALLEY OVERNIGHT WITH COPIUS GULF MOISTURE
STREAMING NE. RAINFALL WILL INCREASE AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE. AT THE
SAME TIME NEXT PUSH OF ARCTIC AIR WILL BE HEADED SOUTHEAST FROM THE
MID MS VALLEY AND OHIO VALLEYS. THE ARCTIC AIR NOW LOOKS LIKE IT
DOES NOT REACH THE NW SECTIONS UNTIL LATER MONDAY AFTER MOST OF THE
MOISTURE FROM THE SOUTHERN STREAM BEGINS TO MOVE OUT. TEMPERATURES
WILL LIKELY DROP DURING THE AFTERNOON ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND
ALONG THE KY/VA BORDER SO RAIN WILL MIX WITH AND CHANGE TO SNOW BY
EVENING. FARTHER EAST AND SOUTH THE CHANGEOVER WILL BE
LATER...MAYBE NOT UNTIL EVENING. SINCE DEEPER MOISTURE WILL HAVE
MOVED OUT SNOWFALL AMOUNTS WILL BE LIMITED MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY
MORNING. TEMPERATURES WILL STAY ABOVE FREEZING SUNDAY
NIGHT...MOSTLY IN THE LOWER 40S AND REMAIN IN THE 40S UNTIL
AFTERNOON MONDAY EXCEPT FALL OVER HIGHEST PLATEAU ELEVATIONS AND
NEAR KY BORDER OF SW VA TO NEAR FREEZING BEFORE MONDAY EVENING.
SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATION WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND OVER THE MOUNTAINS BORDERING NORTH
CAROLINA MONDAY NIGHT AS UPSLOPE NORTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS.

THE ARCTIC COLD WILL SET IN MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WITH MOST OF 
THE FORECAST AREA BELOW FREEZING. LOWS TUESDAY MORNING DROP TO THE 
MID TEENS TO MID 20S. HIGHS TUESDAY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WILL 
ONLY REACH THE LOWER TO MID 20S. TUESDAY NIGHT SHOULD BE THE COLDEST 
OF THE YEAR WITH LOWS IN THE TEENS TO NEAR 20 AND SINGLE DIGITS 
HIGHER MOUNTAINS. A WARMING TREND STARTS WEDNESDAY AND CONTINUES 
INTO SATURDAY. COLD UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EAST FLATTENS OUT THURSDAY 
BUT TEMPERATURES REMAIN BELOW NORMAL. ANOTHER SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE 
MS VALLEY THURSDAY. CLOUDS AND A CHANCE OF RAIN RETURN THURSDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR FREEZING AT 
NIGHT WITH SNOW POSSIBLE MAINLY HIGHER ELEVATIONS BUT HIGHS DURING

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
AREA WILL SHIFT EAST.  SHOULD BE PLENTY OF SUN TODAY...WITH WARMER 
BUT STILL BELOW NORMAL TEMPS.  MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO RETURN TONIGHT 
AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM WITH INCREASING CLOUDS ACROSS THE AREA. ANY 
PRECIPITATION SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL AFTER 12Z AS LOWER LEVELS OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE WILL BE RATHER DRY. JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...SHORT WAVE TROUGH SHIFTS EAST 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON SUNDAY GENERATING A SURFACE WAVE OVER 
THE WESTERN GULF COASTAL REGION. MOISTURE WILL BE ON THE INCREASE 
LIFTING ISENTROPICALLY OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION DURING 
THE DAY SUNDAY. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR LIGHT RAIN TO OVERSPREAD THE 
FORECAST AREA FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST THROUGH THE DAY. SURFACE 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARMING ABOVE FREEZING BY MID DAY BUT THERE IS 
A SMALL CHANCE FOR A FEW FLURRIES ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU DURING 
THE MORNING ON SUNDAY. DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THIS WILL BE MUCH OF A 
PROBLEM. WHILE THE SURFACE LOW SHIFTS NORTHEAST ACROSS THE DEEP 
SOUTH A DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH WILL BE BUILDING STEADILY EAST INTO 
THE MIDDLE OF THE NATION. THIS CIRCULATION WILL BE DRIVING THE 
SECOND ARCTIC AIR MASS OF THE COLD SEASON BACK INTO THE EASTERN U.S. 
ON MONDAY. A NICE INLFUX OF MOISTURE OFF THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL BE 
LIFTED AHEAD OF THIS MASS OF COLD AIR GENERATING WIDESPREAD RAINFALL 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. LATE IN THE DAY 
ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE PRECIPITATION SHIELD TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
DROPPING BELOW FREEZING ALLOWING THE LIGHT RAIN TO CHANGE TO SOME 
LIGHT SNOW. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL BE 
DIMINISHING FAIRLY QUICKLY IN THE POST FRONTAL AIR SO THERE SHOULD 
NOT BE A LENGTHY PERIOD OF SNOWFALL WHICH SHOULD KEEP AMOUNTS RATHER 
LIGHT. IT STILL APPEARS THE MAIN AREA WHERE THERE MAY BE SOME LIGHT 
ACCUMULATION WILL BE IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND OVER THE MOUNTAINS BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA MONDAY NIGHT AS AN 
UPSLOPE NORTHWESTERLY FLOW DEVELOPS. STILL LOOKS LIKE A BONE 
CHILLING COLD DAY ON TUESDAY WITH MAX TEMPS ABOUT 25-30 DEGREES 
BELOW NORMAL WITH LOWS BY WEDNESDAY MORNING ABOUT 20 DEGREES BELOW 
NORMAL. TEMPERATURES SLOWLY MODERATE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE 
WORK WEEK BUT WILL STILL BE ABOUT 5-10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL ON 
FRIDAY. MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE TOWARD THE END OF THE FORECAST 
PERIOD WITH A DRIER APPEARANCE TO THE GFS AND WETTER ON THE ECMWF. 
WENT CLOSER TO THE MORE PESSIMISTIC EUROPEAN WITH ANOTHER FRONTAL 
SYSTEM BRINGING RAIN TO THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY NIGHT.

AREAS AND AIDED BY SOME SURFACE HEATING. THESE CLOUDS AREA STARTING
TO DIMINISH AS WE GET PAST THE MAX HEATING. THINK BY SUNSET MOST OF
THESE CLOUDS WILL DISSIPATE. WINDS WILL BE DIMINISHING OVERNIGHT AS
THE SURFACE RIDGE SETTLES INTO THE AREA...SETTING THE STAGE FOR A
VERY COLD NIGHT ACROSS THE AREA. SATURDAY WILL START TO WARM UP
SOMEWHAT AS THE RIDGE SLIDES TO THE EAST AND THE COLD AIR STARTS TO
RETREAT. WILL GO CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS. RH VALUES WILL BE QUITE
LOW SATURDAY AS THE AIR MASS STARTS TO WARM UP BUT THE DEW POINTS
REMAIN VERY LOW.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODERATING TEMPERATURES 
SATURDAY NIGHT AS CLOUDS INCREASE AHEAD OF NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM. 
UPPER FLOW THATS STARTS AS WESTERLY BECOMES SOUTHWESTERLY SUNDAY.THE 
MOISTURE INCREASES ESPECIALLY SUNDAY WITH LIGHT RAIN BEGINNING IN

SUNDAY MORNING AND THEN INCREASES BY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. INITIAL 
PRECIPITATION SHIELD MERGES WITH 2ND AREA AHEAD OF NEW UPPER TROUGH

FRONT WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL BE RIGHT OVER THE EASTERN TN VALLEY 
MONDAY MORNING. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY COME IN THE MORNING

SHOULD CHANGE TO SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS AS THE FREEZING LEVEL DROPS 
BUT ONLY LIGHT AMOUNTS EXPECTED. THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SW VA 
MOUNTAINS NEAR KENTUCKY COULD SEE LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS. THE DEEPER 
MOISTURE MOVES OUT MONDAY EVENING BUT NW FLOW SNOWFALL WILL CONTINUE

FAN THE ATMOSPHERIC CONFIGURATION DURING THE EXTENDED FORECAST WILL 
NOT BE MUCH TO YOUR LIKING. THE HEMISPHERIC PATTERN FEATURES AN

WHILE ANOTHER TRAILING WAVE DROPS SOUTH INTO THE NORTH CENTRAL U.S. 
SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. MOISTURE WILL BE RETURNING ON SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW 
ALOFT OVER THE TOP OF THE CHILLY LOW LEVEL AIR MASS. THE RESULTING 
ISENTROPIC LIFTING WILL GENERATE SOME LIGHT SHOWERS WHICH WILL 
SPREAD FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST ACROSS THE VIEWING AREA DURING 
THE DAY SUNDAY WITH DEEPENING MOISTURE AND LIFT AHEAD OF AN 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. THERE WILL BE A 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A COUPLE SNOW SHOWERS EARLY SUNDAY AS THE MOISTURE 
STARTS TO BUILD INTO THE REGION BUT TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE WARMING 
ABOVE FREEZING FAIRLY QUICKLY TO ALLOW FOR A RAIN EVENT.

THE NEXT ARCTIC SURGE (WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES AROUND THE FREEZING 
MARK ON TUESDAY AND MID TO UPPER 30S ON WEDNESDAY) WILL BE FOLLOWING 
BEHIND THE SECOND UPPER TROUGH MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. TYPICAL 
TRAILING MOISTURE AND OROGRAPHIC LIFT BUILDING IN DURING THIS PERIOD 
WILL GENERATE SOME LIGHT SNOWFALL WITH THE USUAL EMPHASIS IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN. BY TUESDAY DRY ADVECTION WILL HAVE BROUGHT AN END TO 
THE PRECIP AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO KEEP 
PRECIPITATION OUT OF THE FORECAST ALL THE WAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT 
BEFORE ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH BUILDS INTO THE CENTRAL U.S.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A
WEAK INVERTED TROUGH OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE. LOW-LEVEL ISENTROPIC LIFT AND SHALLOW MOISTURE ARE
HELPING TO LOWER CLOUD BASES AND PRODUCE AREAS OF FOG AND
DRIZZLE...MAINLY ALONG AND NORTH OF INTERSTATE 40. ENOUGH DRIZZLE
MAY PRODUCE SOME MEASURABLE AMOUNTS...SO WILL GO WITH 20-30 POPS.

INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH MOVES EAST OF THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON WITH
COLD AIR ADVECTION ALLOWING SOME OF THE LIGHT RAIN TO CHANGE TO
LIGHT SNOW OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE.

LOW CLOUDS WILL ONLY SLOWLY ERODE FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST
THROUGH THE PERIOD. GENERALLY WENT WITH THE COLDER NAM HIGHS FOR
TODAY DUE TO CLOUDS AND DRIZZLE. MOST LOCATIONS TODAY WILL SEE
TEMPERATURES REMAIN STEADY OR SLOWLY FALL DUE TO COLD AIR ADVECTION
THIS AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE COLD CONTINUES DURING 
THE LONG TERM WITH UNSEASONABLY COLD AIR IN PLACE. 

DUE TO AN ARCTIC SURFACE HIGH MOVING IN ON FRIDAY...IT WILL BE THE 
COLDEST DAY OF FALL THUS FAR. HIGH TEMPS ARE STILL ON TRACK TO BE 20 
TO 25 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL WITH HIGHS CLOSE TO WHAT THE NORMAL LOWS 
SHOULD BE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER 
OUR AREA BY SATURDAY BUT TEMPERATURES DO SLIGHTLY MODERATE. 
SATURDAYS HIGHS NEAR 40 ACROSS THE NORTHERN AREAS AND MID TO UPPER 
40S SOUTHERN. SURFACE HIGH PUSHES OFF TO OUR EAST SATURDAY NIGHT AS 
ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL TROUGH HEADS OUR WAY. MODELS ARE TRENDING A 
LITTLE SLOWER WITH THIS NEXT SYSTEM SO IT NOW LOOKS LIKE THE BEST 
CHANCES FOR PRECIP WILL BE LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING AND THROUGH 
MONDAY. THIS DELAY IN THE ARRIVAL OF THE TROUGH WILL ALLOW SUNDAYS 
TEMPS TO BE WARMER THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED WITH HIGHS SIMILAR TO 
SATURDAY.
 
THEN LATE SUNDAY NIGHT AND INTO MONDAY...THE NEXT BOUT OF ARCTIC AIR 
ARRIVES AS ANOTHER COLD FRONT PUSHES INTO THE AREA. THIS WILL LIKELY 
RESULT IN MORNING HIGH TEMPS AS COLD AIR POURS IN THROUGH THE DAY. 
AS EVERYONE KNOWS...THINGS CAN CHANGE BUT SNOW POTENTIAL IS LOOKING 
LESS LIKELY...IN TERMS OF ACCUMULATION ACROSS THE LOWER ELEVATIONS. 
DUE TO THE TROUGH SLOWING DOWN...IT WILL TAKE LONGER FOR THE COLD 
AIR TO MOVE INTO OUR AREA. SO AS OF NOW IT LOOKS LIKE LATE SUNDAY 
NIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY MORNING AREAS ALONG THE PLATEAU AND NORTH OF 
KNOXVILLE COULD CHANGE OVER TO SNOW FOR A BRIEF TIME. THEN...SNOW 
QUICKLY CHANGES BACK OVER TO RAIN LATER MONDAY MORNING AS THE COLDER 
AIR DOESN'T GET IN UNTIL LATER IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. RAIN 
BACK TO SNOW MONDAY EVENING AND OVERNIGHT...BUT BY THIS TIME MOST OF 
THE MOISTURE IS OFF TO OUR EAST THUS THE LESS LIKELY CHANCES FOR ANY 
ACCUMULATIONS. MONDAY EVENING INTO TUESDAY MORNING IS WHEN ALL AREAS 
COULD SEE SNOW SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS...WITH LITTLE TO NO 
ACCUMULATION EXPECTED EXCEPT FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN. TUESDAY AND 
BEYOND LOOKS COLD AND DRY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...CLOUD COVER HOLDING SOLID IN 
MOST LOCATIONS...EXCEPT FOR DOWNSLOPE AREAS SUCH AS WRN NC AND SRN 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. EVEN THE SMOKY MTNS SEEM TO ONLY SEE AN 
OCCASIONAL BREAK OF SUNSHINE. MURPHY NC ENJOYING PLEASANT LOWER 60S
WHILE UPPER 30S TO MOSTLY 40S ELSEWHERE AT MID AFTERNOON.

MIN TEMPS TONIGHT WILL BE STRONGLY AFFECTED BY LIGHT WINDS AND 
LINGERING CLOUD COVER...AS THE BETTER COLD AIR ADVECTION OCCURS 
AFTER 12Z THURSDAY. THUS...I CHOSE TO GO A DEGREE OR SO ABOVE THE 
GFS MOS EXCEPT FOR THE FAR NRN AREAS SUCH AS NRN PLATEAU AND SW VA. 
NOT MUCH FORCING OTHER THAN WEAK UPSLOPE...BUT THE MOISTURE IS 
TRAPPED BELOW AN INVERSION...SO SPRINKLES OR DRIZZLE COULD FALL. 
ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR PARTS OF SW VA AND NRN MTNS OF E TN 
LATE TONIGHT. 

I DO FEEL THAT THE CLOUDS WILL BREAK IN THE AFTERNOON THURSDAY...IN 
LINE WITH PREVIOUS SKY COVER GRIDS...BUT THE CLOUDS WILL LIKELY BE 
SLUGGISH OVER NE TN AND SW VA AGAIN. THE MILDER GFS MOS MAXES ARE 
REACHABLE IN WRN AND SRN AREAS WHERE SOME AFTERNOON SUNSHINE COULD 
OFFSET THE STEADY FLOW OF COOLER AIR INTO THE LOWER LEVELS. 


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THIS PERIOD THE UPPER TROUGH WILL BE OVER THE EASTERN CONUS...WITH 
SURFACE COLD HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUING TO BUILD INTO THE REGION.  BY 
SATURDAY MORNING THE SURFACE HIGH IS OVER THE AREA...THEN SLIDES 
EAST AND ALLOWS A BRIEF WARMING TO START THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF 
THE WEEKEND.  AFTER THAT...THE NEXT COLD SURGE SHOULD BE HITTING 
NEAR MONDAY WITH COLD AIR LOCKED INTO PLACE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE 
PERIOD.

GOING TO HAVE SOME FLURRIES MENTIONED IN THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS 
THURSDAY NIGHT.  MOISTURE LOOKS SLOW TO MOVE INTO OUR AREA...WILL 
HOLD OFF NEXT POPS UNTIL SUNDAY.   BIGGEST QUESTIONS ARE FOR THE 
PRECIP TYPE ON THE FRONT SIDE OF THIS SYSTEM...WILL COLD AIR BE IN 
PLACE SUNDAY MORNING.  LOOKS LIKE OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL LIKELY BE 
AROUND MIDNIGHT SATURDAY NIGHT...AND TEMPS WILL LEVEL OFF OR MIGHT 
EVEN RISE TOWARD DAYBREAK.  AT ANY RATE...BY THE TIME ANY PRECIP 
MOVES IN I THINK THE TEMPERATURES AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL BE 
WARMING QUICKLY ENOUGH TO BE JUST RAIN SHOWERS.  THEN LATE SUNDAY 
NIGHT AND INTO MONDAY...THE NEXT COLD FRONT SURGES INTO THE 
AREA...WILL LIKELY HAVE EARLY HIGH TEMPS AS THE COLD AIR POURS IN.  
PRECIP WILL BE TRYING TO CHANGE OVER TO SNOW...BUT IT WILL BE MOVING 
QUICKLY WITH THE AIR DRYING OUT QUICKLY...SO ONLY KEEPING SOME LOW 
POPS IN THE MOUNTAINS MONDAY NIGHT FOR UPSLOPE FLOWS.  STARTING 
TUESDAY...LOOKS COLD AND DRY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A STRONG COLD FRONT IS
MOVING ACROSS THE AREA WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS. SHOWERS WILL END BY
15Z. NAM AND GFS VARY GREATLY ON EXTENT OF LOW-CLOUDS REMAINING
ACROSS THE REGION WITH THE NAM MOST AGRESSIVE. GIVEN THAT THE NAM
MODEL HAS A BETTER HANDLE OF CURRENT EXTENT OF LOW CLOUDS INTO THE
MID-WEST AND OHIO VALLEY AND TYPICALLY CLOUDS HANG-OUT OVER THE
AREA AFTER FROPA...WILL TREND TOWARD THE NAM.

FOR THE LATTER HALF OF TONIGHT AND THURSDAY MORNING...AN INVERTED
TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT
DEVELOPING. MOISTURE REMAINS SHALLOW...SO ANY PRECIPITATION (MIX OF
RAIN/SNOW) WILL BE LIGHT.

GENERALLY TRENDED DAYTIME HIGHS TOWARD COOLER NAM MOS DUE TO MORE
CLOUDS AND COLD AIR ADVECTION.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...OVERALL...A COLD LONG 
TERM IN STORE AS A COUPLE OF ROUNDS OF UNSEASONABLY COLD AIR OUT OF 
CANADA MAKES ITS WAY ALL THE DOWN INTO THE APPALACHIANS. 

THURSDAY NIGHT WE WILL BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A LARGE UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH THAT WILL HELP TO CONTINUE TO PUSH UNSEASONABLY COLD AIR INTO 
THE REGION. SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN PLACE FOR LIGHT SNOW TO OCCUR OVER 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF E/NE TN AND SW VA AS A WEAK MOISTURE STARVED 
FRONT MOVES THROUGH...NO ACCUMULATION EXPECTED. LOWS THURSDAY NIGHT 
WILL BE AROUND 15 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL WITH LOWS FROM NEAR 20 TO MID 
20S. ON FRIDAY WE WILL BE FIRMLY ENTRENCHED IN COLD AIR DUE TO 
STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION FROM THE NORTH. HIGH TEMPS FRIDAY LOOK TO 
BE THE COLDEST OF THE SEASON WITH HIGHS ANYWHERE FROM 20 TO 25 
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. HIGHS ON FRIDAY WILL ACTUALLY BE CLOSE TO WHAT 
THE NORMAL LOWS SHOULD BE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE STARTS TO BUILD IN FRIDAY AFTERNOON FROM THE WEST AND IS 
CENTERED OVER OUR AREA BY SATURDAY. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR SATURDAYS 
HIGHS TO WARM UP TO NEAR 40 ACROSS THE NORTHERN AREAS AND MID TO 
UPPER 40S SOUTHERN.

SURFACE HIGH PUSHES OFF TO OUR EAST SATURDAY NIGHT AS ANOTHER SYSTEM 
APPROACHES FROM OUT OF THE PLAINS. MODELS STILL AREN'T HANDLING THE 
OVERALL EVOLUTION OF THIS SYSTEM TOO WELL. THE TIMING HOWEVER STILL 
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. THE BEST CHANCE FOR POPS WILL BE ON SUNDAY AND 
SUNDAY NIGHT..WILL START THEM LATE SATURDAY NIGHT AND RUN THROUGH 
MONDAY. DURING THIS TIME PERIOD THERE IS STILL THE POTENTIAL FOR 
SNOW ACROSS OUR ENTIRE AREA...AS THE SYSTEM DOES BRING IN ANOTHER 
LARGE TROUGH WITH REINFORCING COLD AIR. SNOW AMOUNTS ARE STILL 
UNCERTAIN DUE TO EVOLUTION INCONSISTENCIES NOTED ABOVE. AS OF NOW 
THOUGH...ANY ACCUMULATIONS LOOK TO BE LIGHT. WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH 
CLOSELY TO SEE HOW THINGS EVOLVE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. WITH THAT 
SAID...THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE 
UNSEASONABLY COLD AS WELL AS ANOTHER LARGE AND DEEP TROUGH WILL BE 
IN PLACE ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S.

THE LEADING EDGE PRESSING TOWARD MIDDLE TENNESSEE. CLOUDS WILL BE ON 
THE INCREASE AHEAD OF THE FRONT TONIGHT BUT MOISTURE IS LIMITED TO 
ABOUT 800 MB AND BELOW. THE CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE QUITE LOW WITH 
THE BOUNDARY TONIGHT WITH TONIGHT AND MOST LIKELY WILL AMOUNT TO A 
FEW SPRINKLES. SUPPOSE THE BEST CHANCE OF MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION 
WILL BE ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. THE FRONT MOVES ONTO THE PLATEAU 
AROUND 05-06Z AND ACROSS THE GREAT VALLEY BETWEEN 06-09Z. LOW CLOUDS 
WILL HANG AROUND THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF THE MORNING FOR MOST 
LOCATIONS BUT MAY STILL BE IN PLACE AROUND THE APPALACHIAN SPINE 
AROUND NOON. HOWEVER...SUNSHINE WILL BE ON THE INCREASE AND SHOULD

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...WENESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY WILL BE DRY...AS ANOTHER SHORTWAVE APPROACHES...BRINGING A 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR PRECIP IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA FOR THURSDAY NIGHT. 
MOISTURE IS LOW WITH THIS SHORTWAVE SO WILL JUST MENTION A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF FLURRIES...WITH LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATION.  LOW

CHANCES FOR PRECIP TO OCCUR OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF E/NE TN AND 
SW VA THU AFTERNOON AND EVE. BY LATE AFTERNOON SOME LIQUID PRECIP

ANOTHER DEEP TROUGH WILL TRANSLATE ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS SAT/SAT 
NIGHT. PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL INCREASE SAT NIGHT THROUGH MON

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...EXCELLENT WEATHER WILL BE SLOW 
TO CHANGE DURING THE SHORT TERM AS A BROAD UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
ENCOURAGES THE PROTECTIVE RIDGE TO SLIP EAST DURING THE DAY TUESDAY. 
MODELS KEEP MEAN RELATIVE HUMIDITY RIDICULOUSLY LOW THROUGH AT LEAST 
THE MID DAY TIME FRAME TUESDAY. AS THE AFTERNOON PROGRESSES THE 
CLOUD SHIELD ASSOCIATED WITH THE POLAR FRONT WILL BUILD STEADILY 
EAST TOWARD THE APPALACHIAN SPINE. STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE 
BLEND FOR TEMPERATURES TONIGHT AND VETERAN'S DAY. IT LOOKS LIKE 
PATCHY FOG COULD FORM AGAIN ALONG THE WATERWAYS TOWARD DAYBREAK BUT 
SHOULD BURN OFF A LITTLE FASTER THAN IT DID TODAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...OUR WELCOMED WARMUP 
STARTS TO COME TO A CLOSE AT THE START OF THE SHORT TERM. BEGINNING 
ON TUESDAY NIGHT RIDGING EXITS TO OUR EAST DUE TO AN APPROACHING 
WEAK SHORTWAVE AND FORTHCOMING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. THE FIRST WAVE 
APPROACHES TUESDAY NIGHT IN A SOMEWHAT FLAT BUT BROAD UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH AND LINGERS INTO WED MORNING. DURING THIS PERIOD IS WHEN WE 
COULD SEE SOME LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS...ALTHOUGH LIFT AND MOISTURE ARE 
UNIMPRESSIVE AS THE UPPER LOW IS WELL INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION. 
LIGHT SHOWERS EXIT BY LATE MORNING ACROSS MOST AREAS WITH CLEARING 
CONDITIONS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EVENING HOURS. 

OUR NEXT FEATURE APPROACHES LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND INTO THURSDAY. 
THIS TROUGH WILL BRING MUCH COLDER AIR INTO THE AREA AS A STRONG LOW 
PRESSURE CENTER DROPS DOWN INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS. THIS LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DEEPEN THE ONCE BROADER TROUGH AND ALLOW FOR 
STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION ACROSS OUR REGION. MOISTURE IS LACKING SO 
THURSDAY LOOKS DRY BUT MUCH COOLER WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER TO MID 
40S FOR MOST AREAS WITH LOWS IN THE LOWER TO UPPER 20S THURSDAY 
NIGHT. DID INCLUDE SLIGHT CHANCE POP ACROSS THE SPINE OF THE 
APPALACHIANS AS THEY MIGHT GET SOME LIGHT PRECIP DUE TO UPSLOPE FLOW 
DURING THE DAY ON THURSDAY. THE TROUGH STARTS TO MOVE EAST ON FRIDAY 
BUT COLD AIR WILL STILL BE FIRMLY ENTRENCHED WITH HIGHS STRUGGLING 
TO GET OUT OF THE MID TO UPPER 30S FROM KNOXVILLE NORTH...AND LOWER 
40S KNOXVILLE SOUTH.

BRIEF ZONAL FLOW RETURNS FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. THIS WILL ALLOW 
MAX TEMPS TO WARM BY ABOUT 5 TO 8 DEGREES SATURDAY AFTERNOON. 
HOWEVER...ANOTHER TROUGH COMES SWINGING THROUGH LATE SATURDAY NIGHT 
INTO MONDAY. THIS WILL YET AGAIN BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF COLD AIR 
DOWN OUT OF CANADA AND INTO OUR AREA. THIS TROUGH...UNLIKE THE 
EARLIER ONE...WILL HAVE PLENTY OF MOISTURE TO WORK WITH SO POP 
CHANCES IN PLACE FROM LATE SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY. THE BEST 
CHANCE FOR PRECIP...HIGHEST POPS...LOOK TO BE SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH 
EVENING. IT DOES LOOK LIKE MOST AREAS COULD SEE SOME LIGHT SNOW LATE 
SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING...THEN AGAIN SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY MORNING AS TEMPS DIP BACK BELOW FREEZING. THIS SYSTEM IS WAY 
TOO FAR OUT TO PREDICT ANY AMOUNTS AT THIS TIME. WILL HAVE TO WAIT 
AND SEE HOW FUTURE MODEL RUNS HANDLE THIS SYSTEM. PRECIP BEGINS TO 
EXIT THROUGH THE DAY ON MONDAY WITH CLEARING CONDITIONS LATE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE NEXT WEATHER MAKER FOR OUR
FORECAST AREA WAS THE DEEPENING LOW OVER WESTERN MONTANA. THE
ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW WILL DEVELOP/DEEPEN OVER WESTERN NEBRASKA
THIS MORNING. A WELL DEFINED COLD FRONT WILL BLAST SOUTHWARD INTO
THE OKLAHOMA/TX PANHANDLES BY LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVE. BY TUESDAY
MORNING THE FRONT WILL BE SLOWLY TRACKING ACROSS THE MS RIVER INTO
WEST TENNESSEE.

CURRENTLY CALM WINDS AND CLEAR SKIES WILL GIVE WAY TO PATCHY FOG
DEVELOPMENT OVER THE TN VALLEY BY SUNRISE. SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL
WINDS WILL USHER IN WARMER TEMPERATURES ALONG WITH HIGHER RELATIVE
HUMIDITIES. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES WILL PREVAIL TODAY AND TONIGHT.
DAYTIME HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE SEASONAL
NORMS AND WELL BELOW RECORDS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
SHIFT TO THE EAST OF THE AREA ON TUESDAY AS AN UPPER-LOW DEEPENS
OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS/GREAT LAKES AND SENDS A COLD FRONT TOWARD
THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. AHEAD OF THIS BOUNDARY ON
TUESDAY...ANOTHER WARM DAY IS EXPECTED AS PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS
AND SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL HELP WARM MOST AREAS INTO THE MID 60S TO
AROUND 70 DEGREES. THEN... TUESDAY EVENING/NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY
MORNING...SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS WILL OVER SPREAD THE REGION FROM
WEST TO EAST AS THE FRONT PUSHES INTO THE AREA. BEHIND THE
FRONT...MUCH COOLER CANADIAN AIR WILL BEGIN TO FILER INTO THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AS HIGHS WILL DROP TO THE LOW TO MID 40S BY
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...WITH LOWS IN THE 20S BEING COMMON OVERNIGHT.
SOME LIGHT UPSLOPE RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS ON THURSDAY...BUT OTHERWISE A DRY FORECAST IS EXPECTED
THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. ANOTHER DEEP AREA OF LOW PRESSURE
WILL DIVE OUT OF CANADA INTO THE GREAT LAKES ON SUNDAY WHICH WILL
SEND ANOTHER STRONG COLD FRONT AND REINFORCING SHOT OF COLDER AIR
OUR WAY EARLY NEXT WEEK. ADDITIONALLY...SOME PRECIPITATION CHANCES
WILL EXIST WITH THIS SYSTEM PASSAGE...THOUGH UNCERTAINTY EXISTS
WITH THE EXACT TRACK/TIMING OF THIS STORM SYSTEM. ATTM...HAVE
CHANCES POPS AREAWIDE SATURDAY NIGHT AND EXPENDED THEM TO LIKELY ON

DEPARTED WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. PATCHY FOG EXPECTED ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH PATCHY FREEZING FOG POSSIBLE ACROSS PORTIONS OF 
NETN WHERE TEMPERATURES ARE AT OR BELOW FREEZING. OVERNIGHT LOWS 
AROUND 6 TO 8 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.

THINGS QUICKLY WARM UP TOMORROW AS WINDS TURN SOUTHERLY AND RIDGING 
BEGINS TO BUILD INTO THE AREA. HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S 
EXPECTED BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON...WHICH IS A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL 
FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...BROAD UPPER TROUGH DROPS 
INTO THE NORTH CENTRAL U.S. DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE PERIOD WITH 
AN INITIAL SHORT WAVE AND AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONTAL SYSTEM. MODELS 
CONTINUE TO SHOW AN INCREMENTALLY SLOWER ADVANCE OF THE FRONT ON 
TUESDAY WITH LIMITED MOISTURE RESULTING IN LIGHT QPF. WITH THIS IN 
MIND MAINTAINED A TREND OF TRIMMING BACK POPS TO ALMOST NOTHING 
DURING THE DAY TUESDAY WITH SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE PROBABILITY 
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. MODELS ARE ALSO TRENDING BACK ON POPS 
WITH A TRAILING...NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION...SHORT WAVE 
LATER WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY SO GLADLY DROPPED PRECIP INTO A 
SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY HERE. THE NEXT FEATURE TO BRING A CHANCE OF 
RAIN TO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL BE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY 
WITH ANOTHER FRONTAL SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM APPEARS TO HAVE A GREATER 
MOISTURE SUPPLY WITH DECENT FRONTAL LIFTING SO FORECAST 
PROBABILITIES ARE A LITTLE HIGHER DESPITE ITS ARRIVAL AT THE END OF 
THE EXTENDED. TEMPERATURES WILL BE RATHER PLEASANT ON THE FRONT SIDE 
OF THE FIRST FRONTAL SYSTEM WITH MAX TEMPS ABOUT TEN DEGREES ABOVE 
NORMAL FOR A NICE TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE SLOWLY DROPPING BACK 
A LITTLE BELOW NORMAL BY WEDNESDAY WITH THE TRAILING OVERCAST SKY 
CONDITION BEHIND THE FRONT. THE REALLY CHILLY AIR STARTS OOZING INTO 
THE REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND TAKES UP RESIDENCE THROUGH THE END OF 
THE FORECAST PERIOD AS THE LATE WEEKEND FRONTAL SYSTEM BUILDS EAST. 
IT APPEARS THAT MAX TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOUT 15 TO 20 DEGREES 
BELOW NORMAL WHILE MINS WILL BE AT THEIR LOWEST AT ABOUT 10 DEGREES 
BELOW NORMAL THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY NIGHT.

CLEAR AROUND NOON. LOWER LEVEL WINDS SHIFT SOUTH LATE THIS

BUILD INTO THE REGION ON MONDAY...PROMOTING A MOSTLY CLEAR SKY AND
SOUTHERLY WINDS. THIS WILL HELP PUSH HIGHS BACK INTO THE MID TO
UPPER 60S ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE ON TUESDAY
AHEAD OF A TROUGH THAT WILL BRING SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS TO THE

CLOUDS THIS AFTERNOON BUT VERY WEAK RETURNS ON AREA RADARS. KEPT IN
PREVIOUS MENTION OF A CHANCE OF SPRINKLES FOR NRN PLATEAU AND SW VA
AS THE WEAK COLD FRONT PASSES. THINKING THAT CLOUDS WILL DECREASE
ENOUGH OVERNIGHT TO ALLOW PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP AGAIN...LOCALLY
DENSE AT PLACES LIKE TRI-CITIES AND MURPHY NC. 

A DRY FORECAST CONTINUES FOR SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY...COURTESY OF
ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND SURFACE RIDGING. MAX TEMPS SUNDAY AND MIN
TEMPS SUNDAY NIGHT SHOULD RUN JUST BELOW SEASONAL NORMALS...WITH A
NICE WARM-UP FOR MONDAY. DID NOT SEE ANY REASON TO DIFFER MUCH FROM
THE WARMER GFS MOS...SO NUDGED THE PREVIOUS MAX TEMP GRID UP BY
SEVERAL DEGREES.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS HAVE SLOWED 
ARRIVAL OF THE UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT ON TUESDAY SO 
TWEAKED POPS BACK A BIT HERE WITH THE MAIN IMPACT TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY. MOISTURE DEPTH NOT TOO IMPRESSIVE WITH THIS SYSTEM THUS 
POPS REMAIN IN THE CHANCE RANGE. UPPER FLOW STAYS WEST SOUTHWEST 
BEHIND THIS FEATURE AS NEXT SHORT WAVE DROPS SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE 
NORTH CENTRAL STATES HELD ONTO SLOWLY DECREASING POPS ON WEDNESDAY 
AND THEN USED MAINLY A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SOME LIGHT QPF ON 
THURSDAY WITH THIS TRAILING SHORT WAVE SHIFTING EAST ACROSS THE 
NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION. WHILE IT WILL BE A LITTLE WARMER 
THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING...LOW 
LEVEL TEMPERATURES MAY STILL DROP RIGHT AROUND THE FREEZING MARK OR 
A LITTLE BELOW DURING THIS PERIOD...MAINLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN SO 
HAD TO KEEP A LIGHT SNOW SHOWER GOING IN THE MOUNTAINS. ALSO APPLIED 
SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY AS THE SECOND 
UPPER TROUGH EXITS. THE UPPER FLOW AMPLIFIES NICELY OUT WEST WITH A 
DEEPENING TROUGH LATER FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY WHICH MEANS THE EASTERN 
U.S. WILL HAVE A PLEASANT WARM UP WITH SOME SUNSHINE ON SATURDAY 
WHILE AWAITING MORE RAIN LATER IN THE WEEKEND WITH THE NEXT MID

INTO THE 60S BY MONDAY AND TUESDAY BEFORE ANOTHER STRONGER COLD
FRONT SWEEPS THROUGH THE REGION TUESDAY EVENING/NIGHT INTO
WEDNESDAY. THIS FRONT WILL BRING SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR ISOLATED TO
SCATTERED SHOWERS...BUT THE PRIMARY IMPACT WILL BE THE MUCH COOLER
AIR THAT WILL FILTER INTO THE REGION IN ITS WAKE. HIGHS WILL DROP
INTO THE UPPER 40S AND 50S ON WEDNESDAY...AND EVENTUALLY THE LOW TO
MID 40S BY FRIDAY AS ANOTHER SHOT OF COLDER AIR MOVES INTO THE

TROUGH. THIS SECONDARY TROUGH PASSAGE WILL ALSO YIELD SOME
OPPORTUNITIES FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY..
AND PERHAPS INTO FRIDAY THANKS TO SOME CONTINUED UPSLOPE FLOW.
GIVEN THE COLDER AIR THAT IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE REGION...THIS
MAY ALSO LEAD TO SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS ALONG THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE COMBINATION OF
SLUGGISH CLOUD COVER AND COLD AIR ADVECTION KEPT MAX TEMPS DOWN
TODAY. EXPECT SKIES TO CONTINUE TO CLEAR THIS EVENING WITH A FAIR
AMOUNT OF HIGH CLOUDS MOVING ACROSS TONIGHT. ADDED A FEW PATCHES
OF VALLEY FOG FOR LATE TONIGHT.

A WEAK AND MOSTLY DRY COLD FRONT APPROACHES SATURDAY...BUT WILL
SPREAD A BRIEF INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER. I KEPT THE MINIMAL POPS IN
FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS BUT MEASURABLE RAINS AT THE SURFACE SEEM VERY
UNLIKELY. OPTED TO KEEP MAXES A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW THE GFS MOS FOR
SATURDAY. MIN TEMPS NOT LOW ENOUGH AND RAIN CHANCES JUST TOO LOW TO
CARRY ANY MENTION OF SNOW SHOWERS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT. 

CLEARING SKIES AND SLIGHTLY WARMER SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. NOT
MUCH ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED FOR PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR THOSE PERIODS. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE EXTENDED PERIOD 
STARTS OUT ON THE NICE SIDE WITH BUILDING HEIGHTS AND A 
STRENGTHENING SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF THE NEXT UPPER TROUGH. 
SUNSHINE AND PLEASANT NEAR TO ABOVE NORMAL HIGH TEMPERATURES SHOULD 
BE THE NORM ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. HOWEVER...CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE 
INCREASE DURING THE DAY TUESDAY WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS. THE BEST 
CHANCE OF SEEING SOME RAIN AREA WIDE WILL BE TUESDAY NIGHT AS A COLD 
FRONT BUILDS EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION...ALTHOUGH 
THE CHANCE FOR A FEW SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY 
INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT IN AN AREA OF ISENTROPIC LIFTING. COLDER AIR 
WILL BE SPREADING SOUTHEAST FROM THE MIDWEST INTO THE MID SOUTH 
LATER IN THE DAY INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS INTO EARLY THURSDAY 
MORNING. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH FOR A FEW LIGHT SNOW 
SHOWERS OR FLURRIES DURING THIS PERIOD HOWEVER...SOME DRIER AIR WILL 
BE SPILLING INTO THE REGION SO IT LOOKS LIKE A TREND OF DECREASING 
PRECIPITATION PROBABILITY AT THIS TIME. MODEL AGREEMENT STARTS TO 
FALL APART LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY SO 
POPS APPLIED WILL ONLY BE SLIGHT TO SMALL CHANCE RANGE HERE AS A 
SURFACE WAVE IS DEPICTED TO SHIFT NORTHEAST FROM THE CAROLINAS INTO 
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC LATE IN THE WORK WEEK. ENOUGH COLD AIR WILL BE 
OOZING FURTHER INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY DURING THIS 
PERIOD TO PULL TEMPERATURES A GOOD TEN TO FIFTEEN DEGREES BELOW 
NORMAL. THUS...WITH POPS IN THE FORECAST...THE OVERNIGHT PERIODS 
THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY NIGHT...WILL REQUIRE SOME LIGHT SNOW 
SHOWER WORDING.

AND THE 12Z OHX/RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW THE MOISTURE IS EXTREMELY SHALLOW.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
HIGH PRESSURE FILLING IN AT THE SURFACE...WINDS HAVE BEEN
GUSTY...AND WILL PROBABLY REMAIN SOMEWHAT GUSTY UNTIL THIS
AFTERNOON WHEN THE PRESSURE GRADIENT RELAXES. FOR POPS...WILL LEAVE
THE SLIGHT POPS WE HAVE IN OUR ELEVATED TERRAIN NORTH AND
EAST...BUT ONLY THROUGH MID MORNING. MODEL SOUNDINGS DO NOT LOOK TO
SUPPORT MUCH IN THE WAY OF PRECIP...SO KEEPING ALL OUR MOS STATIONS
DRY...EVEN THOUGH NAM MOS SHOWED SLIGHT POPS EVEN AT THE NORTHERN
SITES. CLOUDS SHOULD BE STUBBORN OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE
AREA...BUT DURING THE AFTERNOON THE SUN SHOULD START BURNING
THROUGH. THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA SHOULD SEE THE SUN BURNING
THROUGH THIS MORNING. WENT WITH THE NAM MAX TEMPS FOR TODAY...AS
THE NORTHERN MAX TEMPS LOOKED BETTER...COOLER DUE TO CLOUD COVER.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/... 
A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS PROGGED TO PUSH THROUGH THE REGION ON
SATURDAY...BRINGING SOME CLOUD COVER AND A BRIEF SHOT OF COOLER AIR
INTO THE AREA. IN ADDITION... SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS MAY DEVELOP
DURING THE AFTERNOON/EVENING AND NIGHT /PRIMARILY ALONG THE PLATEAU
AND EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS/. A GRADUAL WARMING TREND WILL TAKE
PLACE EARLY NEXT WEEK AS WEAK RIDGING TAKES PLACE AND ALLOWS
TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB BACK INTO THE LOW TO MID 60S BY
MONDAY...ALONG WITH A MOSTLY CLEAR SKY. HOWEVER... ANOTHER LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT LAKES WILL SEND A STRONGER COLD
FRONT INTO THE REGION BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON INTO TUESDAY
NIGHT...GIVING A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND
A STRONGER PUSH OF COOLER AIR. THIS COOLING SHOULD ALLOW FOR SOME
SNOW SHOWERS ALONG THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND RESULT IN TEMPERATURES
DROPPING BELOW THE FREEZING MARK IN MOST AREAS BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT
AS PARTIAL CLEARING TAKES PLACE. MODELS THEN WANT TO DEVELOP AN
ADDITIONAL ROUND OF LIGHT PRECIPITATION LATER ON THURSDAY INTO
THURSDAY NIGHT AS A BROAD TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE OHIO AND
TENNESSEE VALLEYS. HAVE OPTED TO ADD A LOW-MENTION OF POPS
HERE...BUT DID NOT GET OVERLY AGGRESSIVE WITH IT FOR NOW AND WILL
WAIT FOR BETTER CONTINUITY WITH THE MODELS. THE OTHER MAIN STORY
HEADING INTO LATER PART OF NEXT WEEK WILL BE THE COOLER
TEMPERATURES AS HIGHS IN THE UPPER 40S TO 50S WILL BE COMMON.

.AVIATION...
POWERFUL LITTLE SHORTWAVE MOVING THROUGH THE AREA WITH GUSTY POST-
FRONTAL WINDS AND SOME SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS OVER THE NORTHERN
HALF OF THE AREA. HOWEVER...WE ARE PROBABLY STARTING THE DOWNHILL
SIDE OF THIS SYSTEM AS THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS IS GETTING PAST THE
AREA...PER WATER VAPOR SATELLITE LOOP. SO SHOWERS SHOULD BE EXITING
THE NORTHERN HALF IN THE NEXT TWO HOURS. WINDS WILL SLOWLY SUBSIDE
BOTH DUE TO A SLOW RELAXATION OF THE PRESSURE GRADIENT AND BY
GETTING DEEPER INTO THE NIGHT AND THE BOUNDARY LAYER AT LEAST
PARTIALLY DECOUPLING. WINDS WILL LIKELY PICKUP AFTER SUNRISE WITH
THE INITIAL POST-SUNRISE MIXING...BUT PRESSURE GRADIENT LOOSENS
NOTABLY DURING THE DAY...SO THE AFTERNOON HOURS SHOULD HAVE LIGHTER
WINDS. ALSO...CIGS SHOULD BREAK UP ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS
DURING THE MORNING...BUT SHOULD HOLD ON FOR MUCH OF THE DAY ACROSS
THE NORTH.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...SHORT TERM CONCERNS WERE 
THE MILD TEMPS AHEAD OF THE COLD AIR (UPDATE ISSUED)...PLUS A CHANCE 
OF THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE EARLY EVENING ACROSS SW VA AND EXTREME NE 
TN. ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER TO THOSE AREAS JUST BEYOND 
07/00Z. 

OTHERWISE...THE MOISTURE UPSTREAM IS STILL PROGGED TO BE VERY 
SHALLOW AND NOT THAT COLD AT THE TOP OF THE SATURATED COLUMN. THUS 
NOT SEEING A THREAT OF ANY SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL FOR OUR FAVORED 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA AND EN TN. IN FACT...THE MOISTURE LOOKS 
TOO SHALLOW FROM BOTH GFS AND NAM TO SUPPORT A LOT OF CLOUDINESS FOR 
THE SMOKY MTNS. COORDINATED WITH NWS NEIGHBORS AND TRIMMED BACK OUR 
POPS FOR TONIGHT...ALSO THE AMOUNT OF SNOWFALL FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS.

GENERALLY LOOKING DRY FOR FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY WITH TEMPS TAKKING 
A BRIEF DIP BEFORE WARMING BACK TO SEASONAL NORMS BY SATURDAY. VERY
LITTLE ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED FOR GRIDS DURING THAT PERIOD.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...AN UPPER TROUGH AND 
YET ANOTHER COLD FRONT BUILD ACROSS THE REGION SATURDAY NIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY MORNING WITH LITTLE IMPACT DUE TO LIMITED MOISTURE. TRIMMED 
POPS BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE HERE. DRY ADVECTION BEGINS BEHIND THIS 
SYSTEM AND WHILE THE UPPER FLOW GRADUALLY CHANGES FROM ZONAL TO 
SOUTHWESTERLY BY MONDAY NIGHT...PRECIPITATION WILL NOT BE BACK IN 
THE FORECAST UNTIL TUESDAY AFTERNOON AS ANOTHER MID LATITUDE CYCLONE 
SHIFTS NORTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY. THIS SYSTEM HAS A LITTLE 
MORE AVAILABLE MOISTURE BUT STILL LOOKS LIKE A LIGHT RAIN EVENT WITH 
THE FRONT BUILDING THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS MAINLY TUESDAY 
NIGHT WITH SOME WRAP AROUND LIGHT QPF IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN FOR 
WEDNESDAY. LOOKS DRY AGAIN WITH ZONAL FLOW BACK OVER THE MID SOUTH 
ON THURSDAY. IN TERMS OF THE MAX/MIN TEMPERATURE FORECAST PRETTY 
MUCH UNDERCUT GUIDANCE THROUGH THE PERIOD.

THIS HOUR OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. TEMPERATURES
ARE STILL IN THE 50S WITH 40S HIGHER ELEVATIONS. ANOTHER FRONT LIES
TO THE NW AN EXTENDS SW FROM A SURFACE LOW OVER LAKE MICHIGAN
MOVING INTO THE MID MS VALLEY. THE FIRST FRONT WAS NEARLY
STATIONARY AND WILL FINALLY MOVE EAST THIS MORNING. THE SECOND
FRONT WILL PUSH SOME DRIER AIR INTO THE REGION LATER THIS MORNING
AND AFTERNOON BUT A SHORTWAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECOND FRONT WILL
MOVE SOUTHEAST OVER THE OHIO VALLEY LATE TODAY AND TONIGHT. EXPECT
HIGHS TO CLIMB TO THE MID 50S HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND LOWER TO MID
60S LOWER ELEVATIONS AS WE GET SOME CLEARING BEHIND FRONT AND WIND
INCREASE.

COLDER AIR ALOFT WILL BRING ANOTHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS TO THE
NORTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE REGION AND LOWER FREEZING LEVELS
TONIGHT. THE SHOWERS WILL CHANGE TO SNOW LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY
FRIDAY. HAVE FOLLOWED THE NAM GUIDANCE HIGHER PRECIPITATION CHANCES
AND WARMER LOWS TONIGHT. WITH THAT IN MIND HAVE TRIMMED BACK
SNOWFALL AMOUNTS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. LOWS TONIGHT MOSTLY MID
30S TO NEAR 40 BUT NEAR 30 HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. ONLY THE HIGHEST
ELEVATIONS IN SW VA AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS SMOKY MOUNTAINS AND NE TN
MOUNTAINS WILL RECEIVE ANY MEASURABLE SNOWFALL. AMOUNTS MOSTLY
LESS THAN ONE INCH EXCEPT HIGHEST ELEVATIONS SMOKY MOUNTAINS. WINDS
WILL INCREASE ESPECIALLY HIGHER ELEVATIONS AS SYSTEM MOVES FROM THE
OHIO VALLEY INTO THE MID ATLANTIC LATE TODAY AND TONIGHT. STRONGEST
WINDS WILL BE 15 TO 25 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 35 MPH MOUNTAINS IN THE
EVENING.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A FEW SHOWERS LINGER ACROSS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...CENTRAL VALLEY...SMOKY MTNS 
INTO SE TN AND SW NC JUST STARTING TO MOISTEN UP AT MID AFTERNOON.
SPRINKLES OR A STEADY LIGHT RAIN NOTED ALREADY ACROSS THE REMAINDER 
OF THE FORECAST AREA. MODERATE SHOWERS OVER NRN PLATEAU SPREADING 
TOWARD SE KY AND SW VA AT THIS TIME. POPS WERE ADJUSTED UPWARDS FOR 
THE 21Z TO 00Z LEFT OVER GRIDS. TEMPS REALLY CAME TO A SCREECHING 
HALT WITH THE ONSET OF ANY RAIN...BUT LIKELY WON'T FALL MUCH EITHER
OVERNIGHT. THUS...I TRENDED QUITE CLOSE TO GFS MOS MINS. BUMPED POPS 
UP OVERNIGHT TO FALL BETWEEN 90 AND 100 PERCENT.

A FEW MORE CHANGES MADE TO THURSDAY'S WEATHER...TO KEEP MORE 
CLOUDINESS AND ALSO INCREASE RAIN CHANCES ACROSS THE NRN HALF OF E 
TN AND SW VA. THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY RAINS SHOULD BE SLIPPING ESE OF 
THE APPALACHIANS IN THE 12Z TO 15Z PERIOD...BUT SOME STRONG COLD AIR 
ADVECTION ALOFT WILL STEEPEN THE LAPSE RATES IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS. 
LOW LEVEL CAPES REACH AS HIGH AS 100 TO 150 J/KG OVER NE TN AND SW 
VA THURSDAY AFTERNOON. THIS SHOULD EQUATE TO SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS 
AS THE AIRMASS IS NOT SHOWN TO COOL ENUFF FOR SNOW SHOWERS...BUT 
SOMETHING TO WATCH IN THE SMOKIES? OPTED FOR HIGH CHANCE POPS WITH 
SCATTERED WORDING FOR NOW. ALSO...THE CLOUDS...SHOWERS AND COLD AIR 
ADVECTION SUGGEST THAT THE MOS MAX TEMPS ARE RATHER OPTIMISTIC. I 
CHOSE TO UNDERCUT THE GFS MOS AND EVEN THE COOLER NAM MOS IN A FEW 
SPOTS. 


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...COLD AIR ALOFT AND 
LOW-LEVEL MOSITURE WRAPPING AROUND NORTHEAST UNITED STATES UPPER 
TROUGH WILL PRODUCE SCATTERED-BROKEN SHOWERS THURSDAY NIGHT. UPSLOPE 
WILL ALSO ENHANCE PRECIPITATION OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THERMAL 
PROFILE BECOMES COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN. LIGHT 
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ANTICIPATED FOR THE HIGHEST TERRAIN...GENERALLY 
UP TO 1 INCH. LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES LINGER INTO THE 
NORTHEAST SECTIONS (INCLUDING SMOKY MOUNTAINS) FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 
FRIDAY. LOW-LEVEL CLOUDS SLOWLY ERODES FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST 
FRIDAY.

ANOTHER WEAK SHORT-WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN 
APPALACHAINS SATURDAY NIGHT. DYNAMICS AND MOISTURE VERY LIMITED...SO 
RAIN CHANCES LOW.

A FAIRLY ZONAL FLOW FOR SUNDAY...BUT MAIN INTEREST IS FIRST OF THE 
SEASON POLAR VORTEX MOVES ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA THROUGH EARLY NEXT 
WEEK. THE GFS AND ECMWF VARY GREATLY ON THE EXTENT OF THE COLD 
ARCTIC-LIKE AIR MOVING SOUTH INTO THE REGION FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY. 
THE ECMWF IS FASTER AND MORE AGRESSIVE. WILL COMPROMISE FOR NOW AND 
GO A CAT OR TWO COLDER FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY/...
THE UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE THAT HAS BEEN PROMOTING THE FAIR WEATHER 
ACROSS THE REGION THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS IS FLATTENING AND IS 
SHIFTING OFF TO THE SOUTH AND EAST. THIS HAS ALLOWED SOME HIGH 
CLOUDS AHEAD OF AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
TO MOVE THROUGH THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...THESE CLOUDS 
HAVE DONE LITTLE TO SUPPRESS HEATING AS THE PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY 
CONDITIONS HAVE ALLOWED HIGHS TO PEAK IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S IN 
MOST SPOTS AS OF MID-AFTERNOON. 

OVERNIGHT...THESE CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE AS THE COLD
FRONT/TROUGH NOSES TOWARD THE REGION. THIS WILL HELP KEEP LOWS 5 TO
10 DEGREES HIGH THAN LAST NIGHT...IN THE MID TO UPPER 40S. THE COLD
FRONT WILL GRADUALLY PUSH TOWARD THE AREA AFTER SUNRISE AS CLOUDS
CONTINUE TO INCREASE. SOME ISOLATED ACTIVITY WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG
THE PLATEAU IN THE MORNING...AND WILL EVENTUALLY INCREASE ACROSS
THE REGION OVER THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...MODELS KEEP
MOST OF THE WIDESPREAD ACTIVITY WEST OF THE REGION UNTIL EVENING.
THUS...HAVE KEPT THE SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCES POPS FOR THE
AFTERNOON...BUT HAVE NOT GONE HIGHER ATTM. SOUTHWEST WINDS AHEAD OF
THE FRONT SHOULD HELP PUSH HIGHS INTO THE LOW TO PERHAPS MID 60S
DESPITE THE CLOUD COVER.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/... 
ON WEDNESDAY EVENING...LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE WILL MOVE INTO THE
AREA TO PROVIDE GOOD FORCING FOR SHOWERS...AND WILL HAVE
CATEGORICAL POPS THROUGH THE NIGHT AS THIS FORCING MOVES EAST. THE
NAM AND GFS HAVE SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES WITH THE FRONTAL
PASSAGE...WITH THE GFS BEING THE FASTER OF THE TWO. THE ECMWF SIDES
MORE WITH THE GFS TIMING...AND SO WILL LEAN THE FORECAST TOWARD THE
FASTER SOLUTION...DROPPING POPS DOWN QUICKLY THROUGH THURSDAY.
NORTHERN AREAS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CHANCE POPS THURSDAY NIGHT AS
A POTENT VORT MAX ON THE SOUTHERN END OF A CLOSED UPPER LOW DROPS
INTO THE REGION. COLD MIDLEVEL TEMPS AND NW FLOW COULD PRODUCE SOME
SNOW SHOWERS IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY
MORNING...BUT MOISTURE IS RATHER LIMITED AND ONLY LIGHT
ACCUMULATIONS LOOK POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME.

ANOTHER DEEP TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE EASTERN CONUS...AND THE 
ASSOCIATED FRONTAL PASSAGE SHOULD BRING CHANCE POPS SATURDAY NIGHT 
AND SUNDAY MORNING. GFS AND ECMWF HAVE BEEN IN REASONABLY GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH EACH OTHER AND FAIRLY CONSISTENT FROM RUN TO RUN...SO 
WILL RAISE POPS A BIT HIGHER. A MORE ZONAL FLOW DEVELOPS ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...AND WILL HAVE DRY 
WEATHER WITH SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL TEMPS MONDAY AND TUESDAY.

THE UPPER-RIDGE OVER THE REGION YESTERDAY HAS BEGUN TO FLATTEN AND
SINK TOWARD THE SOUTH AND EAST OVER THE FLORIDA GULF COAST. THIS
HAS ALLOWED SOME HIGH CLOUDS FROM A STORM COMPLEX OVER THE SOUTHERN
PLAINS TO FILTER INTO THE REGION THANKS TO SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW
ALOFT. THIS CLOUD COVER MAY HELP TO KEEP TEMPERATURES DOWN A DEGREE
OR TWO TODAY...BUT WITH SOME DECENT HEATING AND PARTLY SUNNY
CONDITIONS /ALONG WITH SOME SOUTHWEST FLOW/...HIGHS IN THE MID TO
UPPER 60S WILL BE COMMON BY LATE AFTERNOON FOR THIS ELECTION DAY.
MAIN CHANGES TO THE GRIDS WERE TO INCREASE CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE

A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN
UNITED STATES...PROMOTING FAIR WEATHER ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY
AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE ABUNDANT SUNSHINE AND SOUTHERLY
WINDS HAVE HELPED TO WARM THE BOUNDARY LAYER NICELY INTO THE UPPER
50S TO MID 60S AS OF MID-AFTERNOON. WITH A CLEAR SKY PREVAILING...
TEMPERATURES WILL DROP QUICKLY AFTER SUNSET TONIGHT...BUT WILL BE A
FEW DEGREES WARMER AND BOTTOM OUT ABOVE FREEZING IN THE MID TO
UPPER 30S IN MOST AREAS. WINDS WILL PICK UP SLIGHTLY TOMORROW AHEAD
OF A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS...ALONG

WHILE THE GFS IS FASTER TO PUSH IT EAST. WILL KEEP SOME SLIGHT TO
LOW CHANCE POPS GOING INTO THURSDAY NORTH AND EAST. ON THURSDAY
NIGHT A TROUGH ROUNDING THE BASE OF A CLOSED LOW DIPS INTO OUR

WINDS. MOISTURE IS LIMITED BY THIS TIME BUT THERE COULD BE
SCATTERED SHOWERS NORTH AND IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH THIS SYSTEM
THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY MORNING. TEMPERATURES LOOK MARGINAL FOR
SNOW...EVEN IN THE MOUNTAINS...WHICH SHOULD MEAN ONLY VERY LITTLE
ACCUMULATION...IF ANY. IT MOVES THROUGH QUICKLY...AND A DRY

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL SLOWLY SHIFT SOUTHEAST. RETURN FLOW GETS 
UNDERWAY TODAY. NICE WARM UP EXPECTED WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES.  
 
.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE WARMING TREND CONTINUES 
INTO TUESDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE DOMINATING AREA WEATHER.  THE RIDGE 
BEGINS TO SHIFT EASTWARD ON WEDNESDAY...ALLOWING A COLD FRONT TO 
APPROACH THE AREA.  AHEAD OF THE FRONT...A BAND OF SHOWERS WILL 
DEVELOP AND MOVE THROUGH.  A FEW SHOWERS MAY REACH IN ON WEDNESDAY 
BUT THE MAIN LINE SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY 
TIME FRAME.  MODEL CONSISTENCY POOR BEYOND THIS POINT AND CONFIDENCE 
QUITE LOW.  THE ASSOCIATED UPPER LOW IS EXPECTED TO DROP SOUTH BUT 
THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW FAR SOUTH THIS FEATURE WILL REACH.  CURRENT 
MODEL RUNS ARE KEEPING THE LOW FARTHER TO OUR NORTH...LIMITING THE 
PRECIP. HOWEVER...WILL LIGHTLY SEE SOME INFLUENCE FOR THIS FEATURE 
ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY WITH ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS 
MOVING THROUGH...BEST CHANCE OVER NORTHERN LOCATIONS.  AS 
TEMPERATURES FALL THURSDAY NIGHT...SHOWERS OVER THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS MAY TRANSITION TO LIGHT SNOW.  WILL BE BRIEFLY BETWEEN 
SYSTEM ON SATURDAY WITH THE NEXT SYSTEM MOVING IN ON SUNDAY.

248 PM EST SUN NOV 2 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...VERY QUIET SHORT TERM 
COMPARED TO THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST NORTHWEST. CURRENT 
AIRMASS IS VERY DRY WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER TO MID 20S AREA 
WIDE. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES...LOW DEWPOINTS...AND LIGHT WINDS WILL 
ALLOW FOR TEMPERATURES TO DIVE INTO THE UPPER 20S CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN VALLEY...AND LOW TO MID 20S ACROSS NETN AND SWVA. OVERNIGHT 
LOWS WILL BE ABOUT 15 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. ALSO...DUE TO A 
WIDESPREAD FREEZE LAST NIGHT...THE FALL FREEZE PROGRAM WILL BE 
ALLOWED TO END ACROSS THE AREA. THUS WE WILL NO LONGER ISSUE
FREEZE WARNINGS UNTIL SPRING OF 2015.

TEMPS REBOUND TOMORROW AS THE RIDGE CONTINUES BUILDING WITH WINDS 
SWITCHING FROM NORTH TO SOUTH BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. EXPECT MOSTLY 
SUNNY SKIES WITH TEMPS NEAR 60 TO MID 60S.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...AMPLE SUNSHINE AND
SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL HELP TO WARM TEMPERATURES INTO THE MID TO
UPPER 60S IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS ON TUESDAY AS A HIGH PRESSURE
RIDGE REMAINS OVERHEAD. THIS RIDGE WILL SLIDE OFF TO THE EAST ON
WEDNESDAY AS AN UPPER-TROUGH/COLD FRONT SLOWLY MOVES EAST TOWARD
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. ATTM...MODELS ARE TRENDING SLIGHTLY
QUICKER...BUT ARE KEEPING THE MOST MEANINGFUL POPS WEST OF THE
REGION UNTIL LATE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. THUS...HAVE ORIENTED THE
GRIDS THIS WAY...AND KEPT THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT
AND EARLY THURSDAY MORNING AS THE FRONT MOVES IN. SHOWERS WILL
TAPER OFF FROM WEST TO EAST ON THURSDAY...BUT MODELS ARE NOW
HINTING SOME WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE TRIGGERING SHOWERS AND CREATING
SOME ADDITIONAL CLOUD COVER THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY /ALONG WITH
SOME SNOW SHOWERS FOR THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS/. TEMPERATURES WILL
ALSO DROP IN WAKE OF THIS FRONT...WITH HIGHS IN THE MID 50S TO
AROUND 60 DEGREES BECOMING COMMON HEADING INTO THE WEEKEND. AN
ADDITIONAL SHORTWAVE MAY KICK OFF ANOTHER ROUND OF ISOLATED TO
SCATTERED SHOWERS FOR SATURDAY...SO HAVE ADDED A MENTION OF THIS TO
THE FORECAST AS WELL.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
900 PM EDT FRI OCT 31 2014

.DISCUSSION...TEMPERATURES ARE DROPPING A LITTLE FASTER THAN
FORECAST BEHIND THE COLD FRONT ADVANCING THROUGH THE REGION. THE
BOUNDARY IS NEARING A TRI-DNN LINE. COOLING IS OF COURSE MORE
SENSITIVE TO ELEVATION WITH MID 30 DEGREE READINGS NOTED ON THE
HIGHER CUMBERLAND PLATEAU TERRAIN WHERE SOME LIGHT SNOW WAS FALLING
SINCE EARLY EVENING. THE MAIN EVENT BEGINS LATER TONIGHT WITH
STRONGER LIFT AND VERY COLD TEMPERATURES ALOFT WITH THE UPPER LOW.
THE LOW IS CURRENTLY DROPPING SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY.
WINTER STORM WARNING/ADVISORY STILL ON TRACK WITH BEST SNOWFALL
ACCUMULATION IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER WHERE SEVERAL INCHES
OF SNOW SHOULD FALL. IT STILL APPEARS THAT MUCH OF THE GREAT VALLEY
IN TENNESSEE (LOWER TERRAIN AREAS) WILL SEE A PERIOD OF SNOW LATE
TONIGHT INTO SATURDAY MORNING WITH SOME DECENT MELTING DUE TO WARM
GROUND TEMPERATURES. THEREFORE...MUCH OF THE ACCUMULATION WILL BE
ON GRASS COVERED SURFACES. WILL TWEAK TEMPERATURE/DEWPOINT GRIDS TO
MATCH CURRENT READINGS.

737 PM EDT FRI OCT 31 2014

.AVIATION...FIRST WAVE OF RAIN WORKING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
ALTHO MAY BE MOSTLY SNOW IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. BRIEF MVFR 
CONDITIONS POSSIBLE AT TAF SITES AS THE PRECIPITATION FALLS AS RAIN. 

EXPECT CEILINGS AND VISBYS TO LOWER INTO PERIODS OF IFR OVERNIGHT 
THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...ESPECIALLY AT TRI AND TYS. PRECIPITATION 
WILL CHANGE OVER TO SNOW OR A MIX...EXCEPT AT CHA WHERE PRECIP IS 
LESS LIKELY. CONDITIONS GRADUALLY IMPROVE DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS 
SATURDAY...BUT MAY BE SLOW TO RISE OUT OF MVFR AT TRI. 

PREVIOUS AFD FOLLOWS BELOW DUE TO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER OCCURRING...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...AS WITH THE PAST 
FEW MODEL RUNS...MODELS REMAIN IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT ON SNOW 
POTENTIAL. HOWEVER...THERE ARE SOME CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO 
THE SNOW FORECAST. EXTENDING THE CURRENT ADVISORY FURTHER SOUTH INTO 
THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO INCLUDE ANDERSON...UNION...GRAINGER...AND 
COCKE. ALSO ADDING THE MOUNTAIN ZONE OF MONROE INTO THE WINTER STORM 
WARNING.

WILL HOLD OFF ON WIND ADVISORY AS CRITERIA AREN'T QUITE MET. 
NONETHELESS...WINDS WILL STILL BE BREEZY TONIGHT INTO
SATURDAY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE GUSTS UP
TO 30 MPH WILL BE POSSIBLE ON SATURDAY. WINDS IN THE LOWER
ELEVATIONS COULD GUST BETWEEN 15 AND 20 MPH.

A DEEP UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL BEGIN MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS EVENING AND CONTINUE TO DIG FURTHER SOUTH THROUGH SATURDAY 
MORNING. THE UPPER LEVEL LOW PASSES RIGHT OVER THE EAST TENNESSEE 
VALLEY AND MOVES INTO SC/NC BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. DURING THIS TIME 
WE WILL EXPERIENCE STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION OUT OF THE NORTH ALONG 
WITH STRONG UPPER LEVEL FORCING AND PLENTY OF MOISTURE. STRONG COLD 
AIR ADVECTION WILL ALLOW FREEZING LEVELS TO BEGIN TO PLUMMET SHORTLY 
AFTER SUNSET AND BE DOWN TO AROUND 500 TO 1K FEET BY 
MIDNIGHT...LEVELS FURTHER FALL LATER INTO THE NIGHT WITH MOST AREAS 
NEAR FREEZING AT THE SURFACE BY AROUND 5/6AM EST. AGAIN...LITTLE 
QUESTION AS TO THE PRECIPITATION TYPE WITH THE WARM LAYER BECOMING 
SO SHALLOW. SOUNDINGS IN THE ADVISORY AND WARNING AREAS INDICATE 
GOOD SNOW GROWTH WITH MOISTURE ALL THE UP TO -20 DEG CELSIUS FOR 
SEVERAL HOURS. AREAS UP INTO SWVA AND EXTREME NETN EXPERIENCE GOOD 
MOISTURE AT -20 DEG C FROM ABOUT 06Z SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH ABOUT 
18Z SATURDAY AFTERNOON. DURING THIS TIME IS WHEN THE BULK OF THE 
SNOW WILL OCCUR.
 
MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOWFALL EXPECTED TONIGHT INTO SATURDAY ACROSS  
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. MODELS STILL INDICATING THAT THE SYNOPTIC 
SNOWFALLS SHOULD TAPER OFF EARLY SATURDAY AFTERNOON BUT UPSLOPE SNOW 
SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY ON SATURDAY AND INTO SATURDAY 
EVENING. CONFIDENCE IN THE SNOWFALL ACCUMULATION FORECAST FOR THE 
MOUNTAINS IS HIGH. THE ADVISORY AREAS ARE WHERE THERE ARE STILL SOME 
QUESTIONS. SNOW WILL FALL IN THESE AREAS...SOME PLACES EVEN SEVERAL
INCHES. THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH ACTUALLY STICKS TO THE GROUND DUE
TO WARM GROUND TEMPERATURES. FREEZE WATCH OUT FOR SATURDAY NIGHT
DUE TO EXPECTED SUBFREEZING TEMPS.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...LOW CLOUD COVER /AND PERHAPS 
A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS ALONG THE MTNS/ MAY LINGER THROUGH THE MORNING 
HOURS ON SUNDAY ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE DEPARTING LOW. HOWEVER... 
CLEARING WILL TAKE PLACE BY THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS A RIDGE OF 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN. THESE CLEAR CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN GOOD 
RADIATIONAL COOLING SUNDAY NIGHT AND RESULT IN ANOTHER FREEZE ACROSS 
SW VIRGINIA/NE TENNESSEE AND A NEAR FREEZE/FROST ELSEWHERE. 

HOWEVER...WITH WINDS INCREASING FROM THE SOUTH AND AMPLE SUNSHINE 
PREVAILING...A WARM-UP BACK INTO THE MID TO UPPER 60S THROUGH THE 
MIDDLE OF THE WEEK WILL OCCUR AS HIGHS CLIMB BACK INTO THE MID TO 
UPPER 60S BY TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. CLOUD COVER WILL INCREASE 
WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS A TROUGH/COLD FRONT SLOWLY 
APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. THIS WILL RESULT IN SOME SCATTERED RAIN 
CHANCES FOR LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY AS A WEAK FRONT MOVES 
INTO THE REGION. HOWEVER...THIS FRONT WILL ONLY BRING SLIGHTLY 
COOLER AIR...AND THE SKY SHOULD CLEAR OUT BY FRIDAY TO CLOSE OUT THE 
WORK WEEK.

901 PM EDT THU OCT 30 2014

.DISCUSSION...THE LATEST MODEL RUNS OF THE NAM...GFS AND ECMWF
BRINGS UPPER LOW LATE FRIDAY...FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY A LITTLE
FARTHER WEST. HONESTLY...I HAVE NEVER SEEN A STRONG UPPER LEVEL
DROP NEARLY DUE SOUTH FROM THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. VERY UN-COMMON. THE FARTHER WEST TRACK BRINGS THE
COLDER UPPER LEVEL AIR (NEAR -30C AT 500MB) DIRECTLY OVER THE
REGION WITH BETTER DYNAMICS. DECIDED TO ISSUE A WINTER WEATHER
ADVISORY INTO THE TRI-CITIES AREA. MAIN QUESTION REMAINS...HOW
MUCH WILL THE SNOW STICK? SINCE THE SNOW WILL BE FALLING DURING THE
NIGHT-TIME AND MORNING HOURS...THERE MAY BE A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE
OF THE SNOW STICKING ON GRASSY SURFACES ACROSS THE TRI-CITIES.
STILL THINK THE ROADWAYS SHOULD BE GOOD GIVEN THE WARMTH OF THE
GROUND.

IF THIS SYSTEM OCCURRED DURING JANUARY...WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH
DIFFERENT SNOW POTENTIAL. HAVE MADE SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO
SNOW AMOUNTS AS WELL.

FOR TONIGHT...AN AREA OF MID-LEVEL CLOUDS OVER WESTERN TENNESSEE
WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EVER-SO SLOWLY INTO THE AREA AND HAVE CHANGED
SKY FORECAST WORDING FOR TONIGHT.

WILL HAVE NEW ZFP AND WINTER WEATHER PRODUCTS OUT SOON.

245 PM EDT THU OCT 30 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE LOWER OHIO 
AND TN RIVER VALLEYS...WITH A SEASONABLY MILD AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE TONIGHT 
AS AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE SWINGS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY...AHEAD 
OF AN AMPLIFYING LONG WAVE UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN. THESE CLOUDS MAY 
EVENTUALLY INHIBIT MOST FOG FORMATION OVERNIGHT...BUT WILL CONTINUE 
TO MENTION PATCHY FOG EVERYWHERE DUE TO THE WARM WATER TEMPS 
POSSIBLY CREATING ANOTHER MORNING OF FOG ALONG THE WATERWAYS. THE 
MAIN STORY DURING THIS FORECAST PERIOD WILL BE THE AMPLIFYING UPPER-
LEVEL LONG WAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION...WHICH 
WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME A CUT-OFF UPPER LOW MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD 
RIGHT OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS DEEP UPPER TROUGH WILL PUSH A 
STRONG COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY AFTERNOON...WITH 
TEMPS FALLING QUICKLY AS THE SUN SETS FRIDAY EVENING AND RAIN 
QUICKLY CHANGING TO SNOW OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WITH THE DEEP 
UPPER LOW EXPECTED TO MOVE RIGHT OVER THE FORECAST AREA AFTER 
MIDNIGHT ON FRIDAY NIGHT...LAPSE RATES WILL STEEPEN CONSIDERABLY 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH CONVECTIVE SNOWFALL (AND THUS HIGHER 
SNOWFALL INTENSITIES) POSSIBLE LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY 
MORNING. WHILE SNOW WILL LIKELY BE OBSERVED MOST EVERYWHERE (EVEN IN 
THE VALLEYS) LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING...SNOWFALL 
ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE VERY ELEVATION-DEPENDENT DUE TO THE WARM 
GROUND TEMPS IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS. IT STILL APPEARS THAT 4 TO 8 
INCHES WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET 
MSL...BUT A FOOT OR MORE OF SNOWFALL APPEARS POSSIBLE OVER THE 
HIGHEST PEAKS ABOVE 5000 FEET DUE TO THE DIRECT PASSAGE OF THE DEEP 
UPPER LOW AND ITS VERY COLD TEMPS ALOFT. SINCE THE MODELS HAVE BEEN 
CONSISTENT WITH THIS PATTERN FOR SEVERAL RUNS...WILL GO AHEAD AND 
UPGRADE THE WATCH TO A WINTER STORM WARNING. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND 
NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH SATURDAY 
NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...SOME LOW CLOUD COVER MAY
LINGER THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS ON SUNDAY ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE
DEPARTING LOW...BUT CLEARING WILL OCCUR BY THE AFTERNOON AND
EVENING AS HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO BUILD IN. ANOTHER FREEZE
/POSSIBLY A HARD ONE IN SW VA/ WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE NORTHERN
AND CENTRAL VALLEYS EARLY MONDAY MORNING. HOWEVER...WITH WINDS
INCREASING FROM THE SOUTH AND AMPLE SUNSHINE PREVAILING...A WARM-UP
BACK INTO THE MID TO UPPER 60S FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY HIGH
TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED...WITH LOWS IN THE UPPER 30S AND 40S IN
MOST SPOTS. ANOTHER TROUGH/COLD FRONT LOOKS TO APPROACH THE AREA
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...GIVING THE REGION ANOTHER SHOT AT
SOME PRECIPITATION FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. MODELS STILL DIFFER
IN THE EXACT TIMING...BUT IT APPEARS THE BEST WINDOW MAY BE
WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY EVENING...SO HAVE THE HIGHEST POPS DURING
THIS TIME PERIOD...BEFORE CLEARING THINGS OUT BY THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RADIATION IN THE CLEAR SKY AND 
CALM WIND ENVIRONMENT ALONG WITH MOIST CONDITIONS AT THE SURFACE HAS 
ALLOWED SOME PATCHY FOG TO FORM. SOME OF THE FOG IS DENSE NEAR WATER 
BODIES AND WILL DISSIPATE A COUPLE HOURS AFTER SUNRISE SO ADDED A 
BIT OF THIS IN THE FORECAST. OTHERWISE...SHOULD BE A DRY DAY TODAY 
WITH LOTS OF SUNSHINE. UPPER TROUGH AMPLIFIES AS IT DROPS SOUTHEAST

AND WE MAY SEE A SPRINKLE OR TWO ON THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
JUST BEFORE 12Z. STAYED QUITE CLOSE TO THE MIDDLE OF MOS NUMBERS FOR 
MAX AND MIN TEMPS IN THE SHORT TERM.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AN INITIAL SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
APPROACHING FROM THE NW WILL BEGIN TO SPREAD LIGHT RAIN INTO THE 
AREA FRIDAY MORNING...THEN THE MAIN CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL BEGIN TO 
HAVE AN IMPACT FRIDAY EVENING. PEAK QG FORCING AND FRONTAL PASSAGE 
OCCUR IN THE 00Z-06Z TIME FRAME...WHICH IS WHEN WE SHOULD SEE A 
CHANGE FROM RAIN TO SNOW IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. A FAVORABLE NW FLOW 
SNOW PATTERN SETS UP FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...WITH 
UPSLOPE WINDS AROUND 25 KTS... STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES...AND 
ABUNDANT MOISTURE THROUGH THE DENDRITE GROWTH ZONE. SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON LOCAL TERRAIN. DECREASING 
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY SHOULD BRING LOWERING POPS AND QPF BY 
SATURDAY EVENING. 

A WINTER STORM WATCH WILL BE ISSUED FOR OUR TN MOUNTAIN ZONES AS 
WELL AS WISE...RUSSELL AND WASHINGTON COUNTIES IN VA WITH WORDING TO 
SPECIFY ELEVATIONS 2500 FT AND HIGHER. TOTAL SNOWFALL AMOUNTS ABOVE 
THAT LEVEL ARE EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN 4 AND 8 INCHES...WITH AROUND A 
FOOT IN THE HIGHEST PEAKS OF THE SMOKIES. THIS IS A BIT BELOW THE 
NAM SNOWFALL AMOUNTS TO ACCOUNT FOR INITIAL MELTING WITH THE 
RELATIVELY WARM GROUND THIS TIME OF YEAR. 

FEW CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. A 
LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE MOVING EAST ACROSS THE

TUESDAY BEFORE AN APPROACHING TROUGH/FRONT BRINGS A CHANCE OF RAIN 
WEDNESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
THE MAIN WEATHER ACTION TO OCCUR DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE
FIRST PERIOD AS FROPA ACCOMPANIED BY RAIN SHOWERS WILL BRING RAIN
TO CWA...ENDING WEST TO EAST. ENDING OVER THE PLATEAU AROUND
12-14Z...EASTERN MOUNTAINS AROUND 21Z ROUGHLY. SEASONAL-TYPE TEMPS
TONIGHT AND THURSDAY WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. MAYBE PATCHY FOG
THURSDAY MORNING NEAR LAKES.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
AN ANOMALOUSLY COLD PATTERN WILL BE SETTING UP ACROSS THE REGION AT 
THE START OF THE PERIOD. AN INITIAL SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL DROP SE 
OUT OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND BRING A CHANCE OF RAIN FRIDAY 
MORNING. BEHIND THIS A CLOSED LOW DROPS SOUTH FROM THE GREAT LAKES 
ON FRIDAY...WITH THE CORE OF THE LOW OVER THE APPALACHIANS FRIDAY 
NIGHT. A SURFACE FRONTAL PASSAGE AND QG FORCING WILL BRING 
INCREASING RAIN CHANCES THROUGH THE DAY FRIDAY...THEN WE SHIFT TO A

RESULTING COLD ADVECTION AND INSTABILITY WILL CHANGE PRECIP TO SNOW 
BETWEEN 00Z AND 06Z IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND IN SW VA...WITH A 
CHANCE IN THE PLATEAU AND VALLEY COMING BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z. POPS 
TAPER OFF THROUGH SATURDAY WITH STABILIZING MIDLEVEL TEMPS AND 
DECREASING MOISTURE DEPTH. IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS...TOTAL SNOWFALL 
AMOUNTS ABOVE WATCH CRITERIA APPEAR REASONABLE AT THIS TIME...BUT 
SINCE WE ARE STILL ABOUT 72 HOURS FROM THE START OF ANY 
SNOWFALL...WITH HOLD OFF ON A WATCH AND MENTION THE THREAT IN THE 
HWO. LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS MAY BE POSSIBLE IN THE VALLEY. A MORE 
EASTERN TRACK OF THE UPPER LOW SHOWN BY THE ECMWF AND GEFS MEAN 
WOULD RESULT IN LOWER AMOUNTS THAN THE MORE WESTERN TRACKS OF THE 
GFS AND NAM...SO THERE ARE STILL SOME MODEL DISPARITIES TO BE 
RESOLVED BEFORE CONFIDENCE CAN WARRANT A WATCH.

THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD WILL FEATURE A LARGE RIDGE MOVING EAST

.DISCUSSION...UPDATED FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY FORECAST. DUE TO GOOD
CONTINUITY BETWEEN GFS...ECMWF AND NAM MODELS...DECIDE TO INCREASE
THE CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SATURDAY.
STRONG UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS WITH CYCLO-GENESIS OVER CAROLINAS SATURDAY. END RESULT
WILL BE A GOOD DEAL OF PRECIPITATION DEVELOPING FRIDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH SATURDAY. ALSO...STRONG NORTHWEST OROGRAPHIC FLOW WILL
ENHANCE PRECIPITATION OVER THE WEST/NORTHWEST FACING SLOPES. 

THE UPPER TROUGH BRINGS THE FIRSTS SHOT OF WINTER-LIKE COLD WITH
THE VERTICAL PROFILE BECOMING COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW...ESPECIALLY
OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. ACCUMULATING SNOW IS A DISTINT
POSSIBILITY FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...GENERALLY AT OR ABOVE 2500
FEET...OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS. 
SNOWFALL OF 3 TO 6 INCHES ARE POSSIBLE OVER THE HIGHEST
ELEVATIONS...PLACES LIKE THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS AND HIGH
KNOB...VIRGINIA.

A MIXTURE OF SNOW AND RAIN SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE TRI-
CITIES AND KNOXVILLE AS WELL.

DUE TO THE EXPECTED AMOUNT OF PRECIPITATION...CLOUDS AND COLD AIR
ADVECTION...LOWERED HIGH TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE REGION AS WELL FOR
SATURDAY. WILL UPDATE HWO TO INCLUDE SNOWFALL CHANCES AND EXPECTED
COLD WEATHER.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...MAIN CONCERN THROUGH THE SHORT 
TERM WILL BE A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION.  A LINE OF SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ALONG AND AHEAD 
OF THE APPROACHING FRONT AND WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MRX CWA LATER 
TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING.  LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS ARE 
EXPECTED.  THE SHOWERS WILL PUSH THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH DRY 
CONDITIONS AND COOLER AIR MOVING IN DURING THE AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MOST CHANGES WERE 
MADE FOR FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND...DUE TO THE UPPER TROUGH/LOW THAT 
DEVELOPS OVER THE SRN APPALACHIANS AND CAROLINAS BY 12Z SATURDAY. 
THE AIRMASS WILL BE COLDER WITH MORE MOISTURE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT 
SCATTERED RAIN OR SNOW SHOWERS FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON. POPS WERE INCREASED ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA AND TEMPS WERE LOWERED BASED ON MODELS TRENDING TO THIS 
SOLUTION.

THE DEEP CYCLONIC FLOW EASES OFF BY SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY... 
WITH SURFACE RIDGE SETTLING OVER THE REGION INTO MONDAY. A COLD 
FRONT MAY BE APPROACHING FROM THE WEST LATE TUESDAY...SO INTRODUCED 
A LOW CHANCE OF SHOWERS BY TUESDAY NIGHT. 

OTHERWISE...JUST MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO MIN/MAX TEMPS PRIOR TO AND 
AFTER THE WEEKEND...CLOSE TO SIMILAR GFSX AND ECMX MOS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO
MOVE EAST THROUGH TUESDAY...WITH A COLD FRONT APPROACHING TUESDAY
AFTERNOON INTO EVENINGS. MODELS HAVE SEEMED TO SLOW THE FRONT
DOWN...SO TRIED TO REFLECT THIS IN THE POPS. OTHERWISE...
TEMPERATURES WILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL TONIGHT AND
TOMORROW.

..LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MAIN WEATHER SYSTEM IS 
THE SHORTWAVE TRACKING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND ITS ASSOCIATED 
COLD FRONT TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. SOUNDINGS STILL LOOK TOO 
STABLE FOR ANY MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS...AND THE PREVIOUS TIMING 
FOR SHOWERS TO MOVE ACROSS THE REGION LOOKED RIGHT ON TRACK. 

NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT BEHIND THIS SYSTEM INTO SATURDAY WITH A 
SHORTWAVE PASSING AROUND FRIDAY AFTERNOON OR EVENING. STILL NOT MUCH 
IF ANY MOISTURE TO SUPPORT MORE THAN MINIMAL POPS FOR THE NE AREAS.

UPPER RIDGING SPREADS ACROSS THE REGION OVER THE WEEKEND REACHING 
THE EAST COAST STATES BY MONDAY. THIS GENERALLY KEEPS OUR WEATHER 
DRY WITH TEMPS NEAR OR JUST BELOW SEASONAL NORMALS. THE COLDEST 
NIGHT LOOKS TO BE SATURDAY NIGHT WHEN MINS MAY BOTTOM OUT BELOW 32 
DEGREES IN NE AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
ANOTHER WARM AND DRY DAY IS ON TAP AS A LARGE RIDGE SITS JUST EAST 
OF THE AREA. A SW FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO THE MIDLEVELS WILL 
PRODUCE SOME WEAK WARM ADVECTION...WHICH WILL CONTINUE THE WARMING 
TREND AND ALLOW HIGH TEMPS TO RISE INTO THE LOWER TO MID 80S IN 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY LOCATIONS...WITH UPPER 70S NORTH. THESE 
HIGHS SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES SHORT OF BREAKING RECORDS. RISING 
DEWPOINTS THROUGH THE DAY SHOULD MEAN WARMER LOW TEMPS TONIGHT IN 
THE UPPER 40S TO UPPER 50S.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
A FAIRLY QUIET EXTENDED TIME- FRAME. AN UPPER TROUGH MOVING ACROSS
THE GREAT LAKES WILL PULL A WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY
NIGHT/WEDNESDAY MORNING. CONTINUED RIDGING INTO THE GULF COAST
STATES AHEAD OF THIS BOUNDARY WILL LIMIT MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY
RETURN INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS..SO WILL
KEEP THUNDER OUT OF THE FORECAST. ALSO...UPPER DYNAMICS WILL WEAKEN
AS THE BOUNDARY APPROACHES THE AREA...SO WILL KEEP RAIN CHANCES
CONFINED WITH HIGH CHANCE/LIKELY.

RIDGING BUILDS INTO THE AREA FOR LATE WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY 
PRODUCING MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS.  

ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE 
NORTHEAST UNITED STATES FOR FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. A STRONGER COLD 
FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA...BUT AGAIN GULF MOISTURE IS CLOSED OFF 
WITH LIMITED MOISTURE. NORTHWEST FLOW BEHIND FRONTAL PASSAGE WILL 
PRODUCE SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS FOR LATE FRIDAY AND FRIDAY EVENING 
OVER THE NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS. VERTICAL TEMPERATURE PROFILE COOLS OFF 
ENOUGH THAT SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS/FLURRIES POSSIBLE OVER THE 
HIGHEST ELEVATIONS.

RIDGING BUILDS BACK INTO THE AREA FOR THE WEEKEND.

.DISCUSSION...
HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO PROMOTE CLEAR AND CALM CONDITIONS ACROSS
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THIS EVENING. THIS HAS ALLOWED FOR
GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING AS TEMPERATURES HAVE ALREADY FALLEN INTO
THE 50S TO LOW 60S IN MOST LOCATIONS. SOME BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE
/WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 40S/...WILL PREVENT LOWS FROM DIPPING TOO
FAR TONIGHT...BUT READINGS RANGING FROM THE UPPER 40S TO MID 50S
ARE EXPECTED BY DAYBREAK. GIVEN THE AFOREMENTIONED CONDITIONS...A
GOOD SET UP FOR PATCHY FOG WILL BE PRESENT ONCE AGAIN LATE TONIGHT
THROUGH MID-MONDAY MORNING. SOME LOCALLY DENSE FOG MAY BE POSSIBLE
NEAR BODIES OF WATER AND ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST
NORTH CAROLINA WHERE A MOISTURE/DEWPOINT GRADIENT WAS NOTED. WILL
MONITOR THIS POTENTIAL OVERNIGHT FOR THE NEED FOR AN SPS IN THOSE
AREAS LATER TONIGHT DUE TO THE IMPACT IT MAY HAVE ON THE MORNING
RUSH HOUR COMMUTE.

THE WARMING TREND WILL CONTINUE TODAY AS THE MIDLEVEL HIGH PRESSURE 
RIDGE OVER TX MOVES EAST INTO THE GULF COAST REGION TODAY. THERE IS 
A DIFFUSE SURFACE BOUNDARY TO OUR NORTH...BUT IT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE 
IMPACT ON THE SENSIBLE WEATHER FOR OUR AREA. SOME MORNING CLOUDS AND 
FOG SHOULD DISSIPATE BY LATE MORNING...AND WITH CLEAR SKIES THROUGH

AROUND 70 NORTH. TONIGHT WILL BE CLEAR AND CALM AS SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BE OVER THE APPALACHIANS...AND LOWS WILL BE IN THE 40S 
TO LOWER 50S.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE MONDAY WILL MOVE EAST. AN UPPER TROUGH
MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WILL PULL A WEAK COLD FRONT INTO THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TUESDAY AND TUESDAY
NIGHT. CONTINUED RIDGING INTO THE GULF COAST STATES AHEAD OF
BOUNDARY WILL LIMIT MOISTURE WITH THIS SYSTEM. ENOUGH FRONTO-
GENETIC FORCING TO PRODUCE SCATTERED- BROKEN SHOWERS FOR MAINLY
TUESDAY NIGHT. INSTABILITY LIMITED AT BEST...SO WILL LEAVE THUNDER
OUT OF THE FORECAST.

ANOTHER RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA FOR 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...BUT ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY FOR FRIDAY. THE GFS AND ECMWF 
AGREE WITH BRINGING IN A STRONGER COLD FRONT THROUGH FOR FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON/EVENING. INCREASING LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE FOR LATE FRIDAY 
THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING. WILL INCLUDE OROGRAPHIC SHOWERS. 
TEMPERATURE PROFILE BECOMES COLD ENOUGH FOR LIGHT SNOW 
SHOWERS/FLURRIES FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS FRIDAY NIGHT.

CLOUDS BANKED AGAINST THE MOUNTAINS IS INDICATIVE OF LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE. THERE HAS BEEN SOME LIGHT WINDS AT TRI...WHICH SUGGESTS
THAT THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE THAT IS PRESENT WILL MANIFEST AS MVFR
CIGS. TYS IS CURRENTLY RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF SOME CLOUDS AT MVFR/VFR

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
AFTER A SUNNY START TO THE DAY...CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE
THIS AFTERNOON AS AN AREA OF HIGHER 850 MB THETA-E ADVECTS INTO THE
AREA FROM THE NW. CLOUDS SHOULD ARRIVE LATE ENOUGH IN THE DAY THAT
THE WARMING TREND OF THE PAST FEW DAYS WILL CONTINUE...REACHING THE
LOWER/MID 70S SOUTH AND CENTRAL TO MID/UPPER 60S NORTH. DEWPOINTS
WILL RISE THROUGH THE DAY WITH A SURFACE WARM FRONTAL
FEATURE...PEAKING IN THE EVENING BEFORE A WEAK COLD FRONT/DRY
BOUNDARY MOVES THROUGH TONIGHT. THE NAM WANTS TO PRODUCE SOME
PRECIP IN THE MOUNTAINS TONIGHT WITH THE UPSLOPE FLOW...BUT THIS
SEEMS OVERDONE WITH THE THIN MOIST LAYER AND LACK OF LIFT. TONIGHT
WILL BE MILDER WITH THE HIGHER DEWPOINTS AND MIXING FROM LIGHT
WINDS...MAINLY MID 40S TO LOWER 50S.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
WARM WEATHER STILL ON TAP FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH SOME 80S
POSSIBLE SUNDAY AND ESPECIALLY MONDAY IN THE SOUTHERN TN VALLEY.
RIDGE PATTERN WILL SHIFT EASTWARD... ALLOWING SHORTWAVE TO SPREAD
PRECIP OVER THE AREA DURING MIDWEEK. GFS AND ECMWF A BIT BETTER IN
LINE...SO BUMPED UP THE POPS TO INCLUDE SOME 40 AND 50 PERCENTS
WITH FROPA TUES NIGHT AND WED. TOSSED IN A BRIEF PERIOD OF
WRAPAROUND POPS UP IN THE NE PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR FRI.
BOTH MODELS HAVE COME INTO LINE WITH A COOL DOWN/REINFORCING FROPA
ON FRIDAY FOR A COOL BUT MOSTLY DRY TRICK OR TREATING
EVENING...WITH 5-10 MPH WINDS TOO.

VERY QUIET WEATHER ACROSS THE REGION THIS EVENING IN WAKE OF THE
SHORTWAVE THAT PASSED THROUGH THE AREA EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON. IN
ITS WAKE...CLEAR CONDITIONS ARE PREVAILING WHICH HAS ALLOWED
TEMPERATURES TO DROP OFF QUICKLY INTO THE UPPER 40S TO MID 50S
GENERALLY AS OF 9 PM EDT. WITH DEWPOINTS STILL HOLDING IN THE LOW
TO MID 40S...AM NOT EXPECTING LOWS CRATER TOO MUCH TONIGHT...BUT
READINGS IN THE MID TO UPPER 30S ARE EXPECTED ALONG THE TN/NC
MOUNTAINS AND IN SOUTHWEST VA/NORTHEAST TN. ELSEWHERE...LOWS IN
THE LOWER 40S ARE LIKELY ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEYS.
THIS BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE WILL ALSO RESULT IN PATCHY FOG
DEVELOPMENT LATE TONIGHT ONCE AGAIN...AS WELL AS SOME PATCHY FROST
IN SHELTERED VALLEYS WHERE LOWS DROP INTO THE MID 30S.

HIGH CLOUDS ARE STREAMING OVER THE AREA THIS MORNING IN ASSOCIATION
WITH A MID-UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. MOST OF THESE CLOUDS SHOULD BE EAST
OF OUR AREA BY THE AFTERNOON...LEAVING MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES FOR MOST

GONNA BE GETTING WARM EARLY NEXT WEEK AS IMPRESSIVE UPPER RIDGING
BUILDS OVER THE AREA. HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SEE 80 DEGREES SUNDAY

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
EARLY THIS MORNING...DENSE LOW STRATUS CLOUDS FROM THE LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM THAT SKIRTED THE REGION YESTERDAY CONTINUES TO LINGER
BENEATH THE TEMPERATURE INVERSION. THIS HAS RESULTED IN CONTINUED
MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE. THIS CLOUD SHIELD HAS ACTUALLY EXPANDED INTO THE
NORTHERN PLATEAU AND PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY THIS MORNING.
AS A RESULT...TEMPERATURES HAVE REMAINED IN THE LOW TO MID 40S IN
THOSE AREAS...COMPLETELY DIMINISHING THE FROST THREAT. THUS...HAVE
CANCELLED THE FROST ADVISORY IN ALL BUT THE SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA COUNTIES WHERE CLEAR CONDITIONS HAVE
ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO PLUNGE INTO THE MID TO UPPER 30S.

A 925 MB RH ANALYSIS INDICATES THESE LOW CLOUDS MAY LINGER THROUGH
MID TO LATE MORNING...BEFORE QUICKLY BREAKING UP BY MIDDAY INTO
EARLY AFTERNOON AS HEATING REALLY KICKS IN. WITH AN UPPER-RIDGE
AXIS MOVING IN AND AMPLE SUNSHINE EXPECTED...HIGHS IN THE 60S IN
MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS ARE ANTICIPATED...MAKING FOR A BEAUTIFUL
AUTUMN AFTERNOON. MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL LATER
TONIGHT...BUT HIGHER THICKNESS VALUES WILL ALLOW FOR LOWS IN THE
UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S...MAKING ANY FROST THREAT LOCALIZED ACROSS
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. THUS...WILL HOLD
OF ON AN ADVISORY FOR NOW AND WILL LET THE DAY SHIFT TAKE ANOTHER
LOOK AT IT.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
SOME DEGREE OF UPPER RIDGING GENERALLY THROUGH LATE TUESDAY...THEN
SOME TROUGHING TO OUR WEST WHICH LEADS TO A COLD FRONT APPROACHING
BY TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. SURFACE RIDGING DURING THE EARLY
PERIODS WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT EAST AND ALLOW SOME SOUTHERLY LOW
LEVEL FLOW TO DEVELOP BY TUESDAY...WHICH WOULD SUPPORT RAIN CHANCES
AS IN PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS. GFSX AND ECMX MOS POPS TRENDING
UPWARD FOR DAY 7 (WEDNESDAY) SO I NUDGED POPS UP AMD INTRODUCED LOW
CHANCE POPS FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WHICH KEEPS OUR GRIDS IN LINE
WITH NEIGHBORING NWS OFFICES.

THE SLIGHT FLUCTUATIONS IN GFSX MOS TEMPS FROM 12Z TO 00Z RUNS ARE 
KINDA PUZZLING. HOWEVER...I DID MAKE SLIGHT CHANGES FOR THE WEEKEND 
MAX TEMPS GIVEN THE DRY AIRMASS AND RIDGING. JUST MINOR TWEAKS 
OVERALL AS THE MONTH OF OCTOBER CLOSES OUT IN THE MORE TYPICAL DRY 
FASHION. ENJOY THE STRETCH OF GREAT FALL WEATHER DAYS...AND LESS 
CHILLY NIGHTS AS MIN TEMPS MODERATE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST... 
WITH HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION EXTENDING 
SOUTHWARD OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN 
EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDS OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN THIS 
AFTERNOON...ASSOCIATED WITH A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE 
NORTHEAST. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL SLOWLY DRIFT NORTHEASTWARD 
TONIGHT...BUT THE MODELS SUGGEST THAT THESE CLOUDS OVER SOUTHWEST
VA AND NORTHEAST TN MAY LINGER UNTIL SUNRISE THURSDAY MORNING. AS
A RESULT...THERE MAY NOT BE MUCH FROST FORMATION OVER THESE AREAS
TOWARDS SUNRISE...ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND
PLATEAU...SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC SHOULD HAVE CLEARING SKIES
AND GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT. FOR NOW...WILL
LET THE FROST ADVISORY CONTINUE FOR SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN
SINCE THERE STILL THE POSSIBILITY OF ENOUGH CLEARING TOWARDS
SUNRISE FOR SOME PATCHY FROST DEVELOPMENT. OTHERWISE...HIGH
PRESSURE LINGERS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...
WITH A WARMING TREND DEVELOPING ON FRIDAY AS TEMPS RISE BACK TO
ABOVE NORMAL LEVELS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS
ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...AND WILL COMPROMISE
WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...COOL NORTHWEST FLOW WILL 
BE IN PLACE TO START OUT THE LONG TERM PERIOD. HOWEVER...THE WEEKEND 
WILL BE A DRY PERIOD ALBEIT WITH A FEW CLOUDS IN THE WAKE OF THE 
WEAK SHORT WAVE THAT MOVES THROUGH ON FRIDAY. THE DRY WEATHER MAY 
LAST ALL THE WAY THROUGH TUESDAY AS ANOTHER UPPER RIDGE BUILDS OVER 
THE EASTERN STATES SUNDAY INTO TUESDAY. MODELS FLATTEN OUT THE RIDGE 
BY MID WEEK WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A WEAK FRONTAL PASSAGE ON 
WEDNESDAY. WITH THIS IN MIND...ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS
WITH SOME MOISTURE AND FRONTAL LIFT INDICATED IN THE PROGS. IN
TERMS OF THE TEMPERATURE FORECAST...STAYED BETWEEN THE COOLER ECM

.UPDATE...
CORRECTED SENTENCE IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH IN THE SHORT TERM
PORTION TO READ 08Z TO 13Z THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
A CLOSED UPPER-LOW CONTINUES TO SCOOT TO THE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS EARLY THIS MORNING. THIS HAS PUSHED SOME BKN
TO OVC DECKS OF LOW STRATUS INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. THIS CLOUD COVER HAS DONE LITTLE TO KEEP
TEMPERATURES FROM FALLING HOWEVER AS NORTHERLY WINDS CONTINUED TO
BRING COOLER AIR INTO THE REGION...WITH READINGS IN THE LOW TO MID
40S NOTED THERE AS OF 3 AM EDT. THIS NORTHERLY FLOW WILL PERSIST
THROUGHOUT THE DAY...REINFORCING THIS COOLER AIR MASS. THUS DESPITE
THE AMPLE SUNSHINE...HIGHS IN THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S ARE EXPECTED
ONCE AGAIN. THE AFOREMENTIONED CLOUDS WILL LINGER THROUGH THE
MORNING ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...BEFORE BEGINNING TO DIMINISH BY
THE AFTERNOON AS THE LOW DROPS INTO NORTH CAROLINA.

BY THE EVENING...MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS WILL BE PREVAILING IN MOST
LOCATIONS WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING. THE
TIGHTER PRESSURE GRADIENT NOTED OVER THE AREA EARLIER IN THE DAY
WILL ALSO RELAX...WHICH WILL ALLOW WINDS TO WEAKEN AND EVEN
COMPLETELY DECOUPLE IN SOME SHELTERED VALLEYS. AS A RESULT...LOWS
WILL BE EVEN COOLER TONIGHT AND DROP INTO THE MID 30S ACROSS THE
NORTHERN PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. THIS SHOULD ALLOW PATCHY FROST TO DEVELOP
/ESPECIALLY IN SHELTERED VALLEYS/ LATE TONIGHT. THUS...DECIDED TO
ISSUE A FROST ADVISORY FOR THOSE AREAS /AND THE EAST TN MTNS/ FROM
08Z TO 13Z THURSDAY. ADDITIONALLY...SOME PATCHY FOG MAY ALSO
DEVELOP LATE TONIGHT ALONG AREA RIVERS AND LAKES...SO HAVE
MAINTAINED THAT IN THE FORECAST AS WELL.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
REALLY A PROLONGED STRETCH OF SOME AWESOME FALL WEATHER DAYS AND
NIGHTS. ONLY ITEM OF ANY CONCERN IS THE EXCELLENT RADIATIONAL
COOLING THAT SETS UP AGAIN ON THURSDAY NIGHT. AIRMASS TRENDING VERY
DRY BY THEN WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES GENERALLY DOWN TO 1/4
INCH OR LESS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. GROWING SEASON SHOULD BE
WINDING DOWN...BUT I FELT IT WAS PRUDENT TO MENTION AREAS OF FROST
(OUTSIDE OF NRN AND SMOKY MTNS WHERE A FREEZE OCCURRED ON 10/20).
THIS WILL ALSO BE NOTED IN OUR HAZARDOUS WEATHER PRODUCT (HWO).

OTHERWISE...REALLY NO RETURN OF ANY SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW UNTIL 
LATE MONDAY. NAM MOS WAS AT ODDS WITH GFS MOS FOR THURSDAY THRU 
FRIDAY MAX/MIN TEMPS. WENT CLOSER TO GFS MOS FOR NOW...SINCE COOLER 
MINS AND WARMER MAXES MAKE MORE SENSE GIVEN THE PATTERN.  

FINAL NOTE...12Z AND OOZ GFSX MOS GUIDANCE TRENDING AWAY FROM 
PREVIOUS MAX/MIN GRIDS FROM THE WEEKEND INTO TUESDAY. MADE A FEW 
ADJUSTMENTS TO ALSO BRING US MORE IN LINE WITH NEIGHBORING NWS 
GRIDS.

POSSIBLY CLIPPING TRI. 

CLOUD COVER AND SPOTTY SHOWERS LATE TONIGHT SHOULD PULL NORTH A BIT 
BUT I EXPECT TRI TO TREND DOWN TO MVFR BY OR AFTER 22/06Z. THOSE W

.SHORT TERM.../TODAY AND TONIGHT/...SEEING A FEW SHOWERS DEVELOP
ALONG THE INCOMING COLD FRONT...MAINLY ACROSS SE KY AND SW VA.
PATCHY VALLEY FOG NOTED IN A FEW AREAS WHERE SKY COVER IS MORE
ABSENT. THE PATTERN SUGGESTS LINGERING CLOUD COVER FOR AT LEAST SW
VA AND NE TN THROUGH TODAY...AND EVEN INTO TONIGHT. SURFACE LAPSE
RATES STEEPEN THIS AFTERNOON WITH LOW LEVEL CAPES REACHING 40 TO 80
J/KG. KEPT PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER GRIDS INTACT...BUT ALSO ADDED
SPRINKLES TO MUCH OF THE REST OF NE TN AND SMOKIES. 

THE LINGERING CLOUDS AND SOME COLD AIR ADVECTION LENDED MORE
SUPPORT TO THE COOLER MOS MAX TEMPS TODAY...BUT A BLEND FOR MOS
MINS TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM.../WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...AN UPPER-LOW OVER THE
MID-ATLANTIC WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE A COOL...NORTHWEST FLOW
ACROSS THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY...REINFORCING THE COOL AIR MASS AND
KEEPING HIGHS IN THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S AREAWIDE. SOME DENSER
CLOUD COVER MAY ALSO BE PRESENT ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE INITIALLY...BUT WILL GRADUALLY GIVE WAY TO
MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS DRIER AIR FILTERS
INTO THE REGION. A BRIEF BOUT OF RIDGING ON THURSDAY WILL ALLOW FOR
A QUICK WARM-UP BEFORE ANOTHER DRY UPPER- TROUGH BRINGS DOWN
ANOTHER MINOR SHOT OF COOLER AIR ON FRIDAY. THEREAFTER...A MORE
PRONOUNCED UPPER-RIDGE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA THIS WEEKEND INTO
EARLY NEXT WEEK...ALLOWING FOR AMPLE SUNSHINE AND DRY CONDITIONS
THROUGH THE REMAINDER PERIOD. THIS WILL RESULT IN HIGHS REACHING
THE 70S ACROSS THE VALLEYS EACH DAY SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY.

TRY TO SHOW THE SYSTEM DEVELOPING A CLOSED LOW OVER THE MID
ATLANTIC AND NE STATES. AS MOISTURE ROTATES AROUND IT A FEW
SHOWERS WILL LINGER TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY IN THE NE SECTIONS.
THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY HIGHER PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE WEST
AS RIDGING REPLACES TROUGH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
CONTINUING TO BUILD ACROSS OUR AREA BUT ANOTHER RE-ENFORCING SHOT
OF COLD AIR WILL ARRIVE TONIGHT AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH SWINGS
THROUGH. ENOUGH MOISTURE AND LIFT LOOK TO TO BE PRESENT TO GENERATE
SOME LIGHT SHOWERS ACROSS NETN...SWVA...AND THE SMOKIES AS THIS
TROUGH MOVES THROUGH. SHOWERS WILL BE LIGHT THOUGH...WITH MOST
AREAS ONLY SEEING A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF AN INCH UP TO ONE TENTH OF
INCH. THIS SYSTEM WILL MOVE THROUGH RATHER QUICKLY WITH CLEARING
SKIES LATE TONIGHT. THIS WILL POSSIBLY ALLOW FOR SOME FOG OVERNIGHT
IN AREAS THAT DO RECEIVE RAIN...IF THE WINDS CAN SETTLE DOWN.
OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL BE QUITE A BIT COLDER COMPARED TO LAST
NIGHT...ROUGHLY 8 TO 10 DEGREES. 
 
HIGH PRESSURE FURTHER BUILDS INTO THE AREA TOMORROW WHICH SHOULD 
RESULT IN MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AREA WIDE BY THE AFTERNOON HOURS. HIGH 
TEMPS WILL BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER...AGAIN...DUE TO THE COLD AIR
RE- ENFORCEMENT THAT WILL OCCUR TONIGHT. HIGHS WILL GENERALLY BE 5
TO 7 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. OVERALL...A NICE FALL DAY EXPECTED
TOMORROW.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...THERE IS ONLY SO 
MANY WAYS TO SAY IT...BUT REPETITIVE TROFFING ALOFT OVER THE EAST 
COAST WILL BE THE DRIVER OF THE WEATHER DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD. 
THIS WILL RESULT IN CHANCES OF SHOWERS LATE MONDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY...MAINLY OVER THE NORTHEAST HALF TO THIRD OF THE AREA. 
EXPECTING THE BEST CHANCES TO OCCUR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY OVER 
AND NEAR SW VA AND THE FAR NE TN MOUNTAINS. IN COMPARISON...THE 
CHATTANOOGA VICINITY IS EXPECTED TO STAY DRY THROUGH THE PERIOD... 
TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE MOISTURE BAND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
TROUGH. AS THE UPPER TROUGH GRADUALLY MOVES INTO THE NORTH ATLANTIC 
LATE NEXT WEEK...RIDGING WILL BUILD IN OVER OUR REGION...WITH A 
CONSEQUENT WARM-UP EXPECTED FOR FRI-SAT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE STARTING TO 
BUILD INTO THE REGION NOW.  MAIN UPPER TROUGH IS STILL TO THE 
WEST...AND NORTHWEST FLOW LOOKS TO HAVE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SPEEDMAX 
AND UPPER COLD POOL THAT WILL SWEEP ACROSS THE AREA TODAY...LATE 
AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EVENING.  THE COLD POOL INDUCES SURFACE-BASED 
INSTABILITY OF 50-100 J/KG OVER THE NORTHEASTERN SECTIONS.  THIS 
SETUP WILL MAKE THE POSSIBILITY OF LIGHT SHOWERS...BUT BETTER 
CHANCES WILL BE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...WHERE UPSLOPE FLOW WILL 
ASSIST AS WELL. THIS SYSTEM SHOULD SPEED THROUGH THE AREA...SO MOST 
PRECIP WILL END BY 06Z...AND CERTAINLY BY 12Z.  WILL GO SLIGHTLY 
ABOVE GUIDANCE ON MAX TEMPS MAINLY BECAUSE OF HOW MILD THE TEMPS ARE 
ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA THIS MORNING...NEEDED TO GET THE MAX TEMPS 
TO HAVE MORE CUSHION ABOVE THESE CURRENT TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER TROUGH TO CONTINUE OVER 
EASTERN STATES SUNDAY WITH SURFACE HIGH BUILDING BACK IN BEHIND 
SHORTWAVE. SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY SUNNY. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN 
THE 60S. SUNDAY NIGHT SKIES STAY CLEAR WITH FROST POSSIBLE 
NORTHEAST. THE COLD TEMPERATURES DO NOT LAST AS CLOUDS INCREASE 
MONDAY AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. TROUGHING TO PERSIST OVER 
THE NORTHEAST AND EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY FOR MUCH OF THE WEEK.
 
THE SYSTEM MONDAY SLOWS AND A WEAK UPPER LOW FORMS AND SPINS OVER 
THE NORTHEAST STATES THROUGH WEDNESDAY. INCREASED CHANCE OF RAIN 
LATE MONDAY NE TWO THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA. CONTINUED CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES NE HALF MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. STACKED LOW FINALLY SHIFTS EAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY AS SURFACE HIGH BUILDS SOUTH FROM THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO 
VALLEY. CONDITIONS IMPROVE NE WITH SKIES MOSTLY SUNNY TO PARTLY

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED 
OVER THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO...WHICH EXTENDS NORTHWARD OVER THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS A LARGE
CUT-OFF UPPER LOW CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION...WHICH WAS
BRINGING AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDS OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE
FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING. THIS UPPER LOW WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE
NORTHEASTWARD TONIGHT...WITH CLOUDS CONTINUING TO DIMINISH FROM THE
SOUTHWEST. WITH THIS BEING THE FIRST NIGHT WITH CLEAR SKIES AFTER
A RAINY PERIOD...THINK THAT FOG WILL BE A GOOD BET OVER THE FORECAST
AREA AS THE WINDS CALM. THUS...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS
EVENING TO MENTION DECREASING CLOUDINESS AND AREAS OF FOG DEVELOPING
AFTER MIDNIGHT.

.AVIATION... 
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED 
OVER THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO...WITH A COLD FRONT OVER THE UPPER 
MS RIVER VALLEY AND CENTRAL PLAINS. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS A 
LARGE CUT-OFF UPPER LOW CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION WHICH 
WAS BRINGING AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDS OVER THE TAF SITES THIS 
EVENING. THIS UPPER LOW WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHEASTWARD 
TONIGHT...WITH CLOUDS SLOWLY DIMINISHING FROM THE SOUTHWEST OVER THE 
TAF SITES. WITH THIS LIKELY BEING THE FIRST NIGHT WITH CLEAR SKIES 
AFTER A RAINY PERIOD...THINK THAT FOG WILL BE A GOOD BET AT THE TAF 
SITES AS THE WINDS CALM. THE ONLY EXCEPTION MAY BE AT KTRI WHERE 
SOME CLOUDS MAY LINGER LONG ENOUGH OVERNIGHT TO PREVENT MUCH FOG 
DEVELOPMENT. FOR NOW...WILL MENTION TEMPORARY IFR VISIBILITIES AT 
ALL THREE TAF SITES AFTER MIDNIGHT...ALTHOUGH FOG MAY BECOME MORE 
DENSE AT KCHA AND KTYS WHERE CLOUDS SHOULD DIMINISH FASTER THIS 
EVENING. OTHERWISE...BREEZY WINDS ARE EXPECTED ON FRIDAY AS THE COLD 
FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT OVERALL...BUT THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE 
DETAILS AND RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY ISSUES.  FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS 
SLIGHTLY ABOUT AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.  THE LONG TERM PERIOD 
WILL BE DOMINATED BY UPPER LEVEL NORTHWEST FLOW...AND SOME UPPER 
LEVEL SHORT WAVES COMING DOWN WILL BRUSH THE AREA ESPECIALLY NORTH. 
A COUPLE OF WEAK COLD FRONTS WILL PUSH THROUGH DURING THE PERIOD AS 
WELL.  SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES...BUT LOOKS LIKE FIRST SHORT 
WAVE/WEAK COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH IN THE SAT/SAT NIGHT TIME 
FRAME.  APPEARS MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED AND QUITE SHALLOW...SO FOR 
NOW WILL JUST BEEF CLOUDS UP BUT KEEP THINGS PRECIP FREE.  NEXT 
SHORT WAVE/WEAK COLD FRONT LOOKS TO BE AROUND MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT.  
THIS SYSTEM LOOKS MOISTURE STARVED AS WELL...BUT WILL KEEP SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS IN MAINLY NORTH/CENTRAL FOR BOTH PERIODS.  WILL 
GENERALLY MAKE ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO GFS MOS TEMPS.

TROUGH WILL PIVOT THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TONIGHT. VERY 
COLD AIR TRAPPED IN UPPER CIRCULATION WITH H70 TEMPS NEAR -4C AND 
H50 TEMPS NEAR -16C. THE STEEP LAPSE RATES WILL AID IN SHOWER 
DEVELOPMENT AS THE TROUGH MOVES THROUGH OVERNIGHT. SMALL HAIL ALSO 
POSSIBLE WITH FREEZING LEVEL LOWERING TO BELOW 7000 FEET. PATTERN 
SUPPORTS LOW CHANCE OF COLD AIR FUNNEL CLOUD DEVELOPMENT. SOUTHWEST 
WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE WNW ON THURSDAY AS SURFACE PRESSURE FALLS 
OCCUR NE OF THE AREA. STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL BECOME NEUTRAL 
BY LATE THURSDAY. SHOWER ACTIVITY WILL TAPER OFF SLOWLY TO THE NE 
DURING THE DAY THURSDAY. RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT.  
 

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/... THE UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH THAT BROUGHT CLOUDS/RAIN TO AREA THIS WEEK WILL CONTINUE TO 
GRADUALLY EXIT THE REGION THURSDAY NIGHT...ALLOWING SOME DRIER AIR 
TO FILTER INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS WILL RESULT IN SOME 
CLEARING BY FRIDAY MORNING AS ZONAL FLOW PREVAILS ALOFT LATE THIS 
WEEK. THIS BOUT OF FAIR WEATHER AND SUNSHINE WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES 
TO CLIMB BACK INTO THE MID TO UPPER 70S ON FRIDAY ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL/SOUTHERN VALLEY. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE/DRY COLD FRONT WILL PUSH 
ANOTHER SHOT OF COOLER AIR INTO THE REGION FOR SATURDAY...DROPPING 
TEMPERATURES BACK INTO THE MID 60S TO AROUND 70 DEGREES FOR THE 
WEEKEND. YET ANOTHER TROUGH WILL DIVE SOUTHWARD FROM THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...BRINGING SOME ADDED CLOUD COVER 
AND SOME ISOLATED TO PERHAPS SCATTERED SHOWERS TO THE REGION. 
THEREAFTER...A BROAD RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO NOSE ITS WAY INTO THE AREA 
FOR THE LATER PART OF THE WEEK. HOWEVER...DESPITE THE SUNSHINE AND 
DRY CONDITIONS...THE INFLUENCE OF NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL KEEP 
HIGHS IN THE 60S FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...COLD FRONT HAS NOW MOVED 
THROUGH MOST OF THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN VALLEY WITH SHOWERS ALONG 
FRONT THROUGH THE CENTRAL MOUNTAINS...VALLEY AND NORTHERN PLATEAU...
SOME CLEARING BEHIND FIRST AREA WHICH IS NOW JUST NE OF THE FORECAST
AREA ALLOWED ATMOSPHERE TO DESTABILIZE. GUSTY WINDS TO 35 MPH HAVE
OCCURRED WITH THE SHOWERS ALONG THE FRONT. HIGHER WINDS IN THE
FOOTHILLS HAVE CAUSED SOME DAMAGE AND WILL CONTINUE HIGH WIND
WARNING UNTIL 00Z FROM BLOUNT COUNTY NORTH. RAINFALL AMOUNTS WITH
THIS ACTIVITY HAVE BEEN ABOUT ONE HALF INCH PER HOUR AS IT RACES
NORTH. HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE NEXT FEW HOURS FROM CENTRAL SECTIONS
NORTH AND TO MID EVENING NE BUT ONLY ISOLATED LOCATIONS EXPECTED TO
HAVE FLOODING...SO HAVE CANCELLED FLOOD WATCH. MODELS SHOW POSSIBLE
BRIEF BREAK IN CLOUDS BEHIND FRONT LATE THIS AFTERNOON OR EARLY
EVENING BUT UPPER LOW OVER IL MOVES SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE OHIO
VALLEY THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH SHOWERS MOVING IN WEDNESDAY LATE
MORNING TO EARLY AFTERNOON. NAM MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN GFS...SO
INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY NW TO CHANCE SE SECTIONS. LOWS TONIGHT
MUCH COOLER IN THE LOWER TO MID 50S. HIGHS WEDNESDAY WILL ONLY
REACH NEAR 60 HIGHER ELEVATIONS NE AND PLATEAU TO MID 60S VALLEYS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND REVEAL A CUT-OFF UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER THE UPPER OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY WEDNESDAY NIGHT GRADUALLY MOVING NORTHEASTWARD INTO 
CANADA BY THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS UPPER LOW WILL HELP TO GENERATE 
SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH THE GREATEST COVERAGE EXPECTED OVER THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. ANOTHER COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO 
MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT THE GFS AND ECMWF 
MODELS AGREE THAT THE MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH IT WILL BE LIMITED. 
HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY FOR THE 
WEEKEND...RESULTING IN DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS. ANOTHER UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH (BUT WEAKER THAN THE ONE TODAY) IS THEN PROGGED TO 
DEVELOP OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK... 
RESULTING IN ANOTHER SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS ON MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN 
THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH IS 
IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
320 PM EDT MON OCT 13 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...SKIES HAVE BECOME 
PARTLY CLOUDY THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH TEMPS
REACHING INTO THE MID 70S TO LOWER 80S AT MOST LOCATIONS. SOUTHEAST
TO SOUTH FLOW HAS ALLOWED AIR MASS TO WARM AND DRY OUT ESPECIALLY
IN THE FAVORED NE AREA. BIG CHANGES BEGIN TONIGHT AS CLOUDS
INCREASE AHEAD OF DEVELOPING STORM SYSTEM MOVING INTO THE LOWER MS
VALLEY. A LINE OF STORMS FROM THE MID SOUTH AND LOWER MS VALLEY IS
SLOWLY MOVING EAST INTO THE TN AND OHIO VALLEYS THIS AFTERNOON. THE
SURFACE LOW WILL SLOWLY MOVE NE AND BECOME CO LOCATED WITH AN UPPER
LOW. GFS A LITTLE FASTER THAN THE NAM/ECMWF BUT EXPECT THE SHOWERS
AND ISOLATED STORMS TO REACH SW PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA AFTER
MIDNIGHT OR AROUND 6Z. THESE STORMS COULD BE STRONG OVER THE
PLATEAU LATE...BUT OTHERWISE ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE SEVERE AS THEY
SHOULD BE WEAKENING. RAIN WILL INCREASE AROUND SUNRISE WEST AND
SPREAD NE SLOWLY DURING THE DAY TUESDAY. AM ISSUING A FLOOD WATCH
FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...SINCE SOME PARTS OF THE AREA HAVE
HAD 4 TO 6 INCHES IN THE LAST FEW DAYS WITH ANOTHER 2 TO 4 INCHES
POSSIBLE BY WEDNESDAY MORNING.

AT 12Z TUESDAY...MODELS SHOW THAT A PRE-FRONTAL 50-70 KT 850 MB JET
WILL EXTEND FROM THE UPPER TENNESSEE VALLEY NORTH ACROSS THE LOWER
OHIO VALLEY...TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES REGION. THIS FEATURE SHOULD
WEAKEN AS IT SHIFTS EAST ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS BUT IT MAY BE SLOW
ENOUGH THAT WITH BOUNDARY LAYER DESTABILIZATION AND STRONG LOW-LEVEL
SHEAR AND FRONTAL FORCING THAT THUNDERSTORMS THAT FORM WILL BECOME
SEVERE WITH DAMAGING WIND GUSTS AND ISOLATED TORNADOES SEE DAY2
OUTLOOK. STORMS WILL END DURING TUESDAY EVENING WITH RAIN DECREASING
OVERNIGHT. WINDS SHOULD ALSO DECREASE DURING THE EVENING. TEMPS TO
STAY IN THE MILD 60S TONIGHT AS SOUTHERLY WINDS CONTINUE AND
INCREASE. WEDNESDAY HIGHS WILL CLIMB BACK TO THE 70S BEFORE THE
HEAVY RAIN. MUCH COOLER TUESDAY NIGHT AS COLD FRONT FINALLY MOVES
THROUGH DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND REVEAL A CUT-OFF UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER THE MID WEST ON 
WEDNESDAY GRADUALLY MOVING NORTHEASTWARD INTO CANADA ON THURSDAY. 
THIS UPPER LOW WILL HELP TO GENERATE SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...WITH THE GREATEST COVERAGE 
EXPECTED OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA. ANOTHER COLD FRONT IS 
PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY OR FRIDAY 
NIGHT...BUT THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS AGREE THAT THE MOISTURE 
ASSOCIATED WITH IT WILL BE LIMITED. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS OVER 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY FOR THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK... 
RESULTING IN DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
GENERALLY TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH 
THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT IN 
IN THEIR HANDLING OF THE UPPER LOW THAT APPROACHES DURING THE SHORT 
TERM.  MAY BE A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS INTO THIS MORNING...BUT MUCH 
OF TODAY WILL BE DRY AS THERE WILL BE A BIT OF A PAUSE BEFORE THE 
NEXT ROUND OF PRECIP. BY LATE TODAY OR EARLY TONIGHT...SOME SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO BEGIN TO MOVE INTO WESTERN AREAS.  
WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE WESTERN ZONES LATE TODAY.  A BAND OF RAIN 
WITH EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED TO PROGRESS SLOWLY EAST ACROSS 
THE AREA TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. HOW MUCH INSTABILITY WILL BE PRESENT 
IS STILL UNCERTAIN...BUT FOR NOW STILL APPEARS STRONG TO SEVERE 
STORMS MAY BE POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY LATER TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. WILL 
CONTINUE MENTION IN HWO.  WITH GOOD INFLUX OF MOISTURE AND THE SLOW 
PROGRESSION OF THE BAND OF PRECIP SOME FLOODING ALSO POSSIBLE LATER 
TONIGHT AND ESPECIALLY TUESDAY...ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE ALREADY WET 
GROUND. A FLOOD WATCH MAY NEED TO BE ISSUED LATER TODAY OR TONIGHT 
FOR THIS THREAT.  THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF STRONG WINDS 
AND MOUNTAIN WAVES.  FAIRLY STRONG LOW LEVEL JET OVER THE AREA 
TONIGHT AND TUESDAY IS FAVORABLE IN DIRECTION FOR MOUNTAIN WAVES.  
HOWEVER...RIGHT NOW SOUNDINGS LOOK A BIT LESS FAVORABLE AS THE 
BOUNDARY LAYER MAY NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT STABLE LAYER EXTENDING 
ABOVE MOUNTAIN TOP.  GIVEN THIS UNCERTAINTY...AM NOT CONFIDENT 
ENOUGH TO UPGRADE TO A HIGH WIND WARNING AT THIS POINT SO WILL LEAVE 
WATCH IN PLACE FOR NOW.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY STAY 
THE COURSE FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST IDEOLOGY WITH DEEP CLOSED LOW 
ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHILE 
GRADUALLY LIFTING NORTHEAST ACROSS THE EASTERN LAKES THURSDAY INTO 
FRIDAY. WIDESPREAD SHOWERS WITH SOME WEAKENING CONVECTION CONTINUES 
EAST AND OUT OF THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY NIGHT 
ONLY TO BE REPLACED BY SCATTERED SHOWERS WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY AS 
ENERGETIC SHORT WAVELENGTH FEATURES CONTINUE TO PINWHEEL AROUND THE 
OHIO VALLEY UPPER LOW. STAYED WITH MEDIUM TO HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR 
SHOWERS WEDNESDAY DROPPING BACK TO LOW AND SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ON 
THURSDAY. IT STILL APPEARS THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO KEEP PRECIPITATION 
OUT OF THE FORECAST FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY ALTHOUGH AN EASTERN U.S. 
LONG WAVE TROUGH DEVELOPS THROUGH THE PERIOD AS ANOTHER COUPLE SHORT 
WAVES DROP SOUTH OUT OF CANADA INTO THE PARENT PRESSURE SYSTEM 
CIRCULATION. OF COURSE THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY DURING THIS PERIOD 
WITH MODELS HINTING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF A COUPLE SHOWERS 
DEVELOPING FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY WITH THE INITIAL SHORT WAVE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
RUC MESOANALYSIS SHOWS A RIDGE OF HIGHER CAPE VALUES EXTENDING NORTH 
ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. THE CONVECTION OVER NR AL MOVING NORTH 
MAY BE ABLE TO INTENSIFY A LITTLE OR AT LEAST SUSTAIN ITSELF AS IT 
MOVES THROUGH THIS AREA...SO THERE COULD BE SOME STRONG WINDS/SMALL 
HAIL IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND PLATEAU. THIS AREA OF CONVECTION 
SHOULD WEAKEN AS IT MOVES NE UP THE TN VALLEY...AND EXIT BY 
MIDNIGHT. MOS WAS WAY TOO COOL FOR LOWS LAST NIGHT...AND WILL GO A 
BIT ABOVE IT FOR LOWS TONIGHT WITH PLENTY OF CLOUD COVER EXPECTED.

AFTER MIDNIGHT...PRECIP CHANCES DROP OFF WITH STABILIZATION AND 
MOVEMENT OF THE UPPER JET STREAK TO THE NORTH. NO SIGNIFICANT VORT 
MAXES ARE SHOWN BY THE MODELS IN THE AREA TOMORROW...AND FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS SHOW A HEALTHY CAP. THUS MOST AREAS SHOULD BE DRY. SOME 
TERRAIN-INDUCED CONVECTION MAY BE POSSIBLE LATE IN THE AFTERNOON
IN THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU. AFTER INITIAL MORNING CLOUDS...THERE
COULD BE QUITE A BIT OF SUN BY AFTERNOON...ALLOWING HIGHS TO REACH
THE LOWER 80S IN THE VALLEY.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SLIGHT CHANGES TO
CURRENT FORECAST AS UPPER TROUGH AND DEVELOPING SYSTEM SLOWER NOW
THAN PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS. AREA OF SHOWERS AND STORMS OUT AHEAD OF
FRONT WILL AFFECT MAINLY WESTERN AND MIDDLE TN MONDAY NIGHT. SOUTH
TO SOUTHEAST WINDS DO INCREASE SO AM ISSUING A HIGH WIND WATCH
SHORTLY FOR THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND ADJACENT FOOTHILLS AS SETUP
LOOKS FAVORABLE FOR A MOUNTAIN WAVE PATTERN MONDAY NIGHT AND
TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL STAY MILD MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. RISK
FOR SEVERE STORMS CONTINUES TUESDAY AHEAD OF FRONT AND HEAVY
RAINFALL ALSO A THREAT WITH PRE FRONTAL LINE OF STORMS. WILL
ADDRESS THIS IN SPS. RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF 2 TO 3 INCHES IS POSSIBLE
FROM EARLY TUESDAY TO WEDNESDAY MORNING. THE SYSTEM WILL BE SLOW TO
EXIT WITH WRAP AROUND CLOUDS AS AN UPPER LOW BEHIND SYSTEM MOVES
INTO OHIO VALLEY AND THEN FINALLY MOVES NE THURSDAY. SHOWERS
LINGERING WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. HAD TO INCREASE POPS AND
CLOUD COVER FOR THESE PERIODS. TEMPERATURES WILL BE MUCH COOLER
WITH COLD AIR WRAPPING AROUND A CLOSED UPPER LOW. HIGHER PRESSURE
FINALLY BUILDS IN FRIDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND. SOME WEAK SHORTWAVE
ENERGY MOVES THROUGH THE UPPER FLOW AND MAY BRING SOME CLOUDS BUT
AIR MASS APPEARS TO DRY FOR ANY RAINFALL.

.DISCUSSION...
THE HRRR SEEMS TO HAVE A PRETTY GOOD HANDLE ON THE MAIN AREAS OF
RAINFALL THIS MORNING. THE GENERAL TREND THROUGH THE EARLY
AFTERNOON WILL BE FOR THE AREA OF SHOWERS NOW BETWEEN TYS AND TRI
TO MOVE NE...WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS ELSEWHERE. LATER THIS
AFTERNOON...THE JET STREAK OVER TEXARKANA TO NRN MS WILL TRACK INTO
WEST AND MIDDLE TN...WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN INCREASED ACTIVITY IN
OUR WESTERN SECTIONS. SATELLITE IS SHOWING SOME BREAKS IN THE
CLOUDS SOUTH...SO DESTABILIZATION IN THAT AREA SHOULD LEAD TO MORE
TS. SEVERE POTENTIAL LOOKS LOW AT THIS TIME ALTHOUGH WITH GREATER
HEATING SOME STRONG TO MARGINALLY SEVERE STORMS MAY BE POSSIBLE.

THE FORECAST WILL BE UPDATED TO REFLECT THESE TRENDS...MENTIONING
NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND SCATTERED TS LATE THIS AFTERNOON SOUTH AND
WEST. TEMPERATURES APPEAR ON TRACK SO FAR.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE NEARLY STATIONARY FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY JUST TO OUR SOUTH WILL REMAIN OVER THE REGION AND WEAKEN. 
PLENTY OF MOISTURE WILL LINGER OVER THE REGION...AND WEAK IMPULSES 
MOVING THROUGH WILL HELP TO TRIGGER SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS 
AT TIMES.  IT APPEARS THE ORIENTATION OF THE UPPER LEVEL JET WILL 
BECOME MORE FAVORABLE FOR SOME UPPER SUPPORT LATER TODAY INTO EARLY 
TONIGHT...WHICH SHOULD HELP TO ENHANCE PRECIP COVERAGE.  WHILE 
INSTABILITY LOOKS TO BE A LIMITING FACTOR...THERE MAY BE ENOUGH TO 
SUPPORT ISOLATED STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS ESPECIALLY WESTERN ZONES 
TODAY. WILL MENTION THREAT IN HWO. WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV 
TEMPS...BUT WILL BUMP UP SOME MINS SLIGHTLY FOR TONIGHT GIVEN MOIST 
BOUNDARY LAYER AND EXPECTED CLOUD COVER.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...AS IS USUALLY THE CASE...THE 
ECMWF TURNED OUT TO BE THE BETTER MODEL WITH ITS DEEP...GO SLOW 
APPROACH FOR THE FIRST SEVERAL DAYS OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD. BACKED 
UP TIMING OF POPS FOR THE ONSET OF THE MAIN CONVECTION AHEAD OF THE 
STRONG COLD FRONT WHICH WILL MAKE VERY SLOW PROGRESS ONTO THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY MID DAY TUESDAY. MODELS STILL SHOW A 
STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE 
NORTH CAROLINA BORDER WHICH SHOULD KEEP MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA 
DRY DURING THE DAY MONDAY. BRING THE CATEGORICAL POPS FOR CONVECTION 
GRADUALLY EAST MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING. STRONG WIND FIELD 
STILL PROGGED DURING THIS PERIOD ALONG WITH ADEQUATE INSTABILITY. 
THEREFORE...SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WITH DAMAGING WIND AND HAIL THREAT 
STILL POSSIBLE. AN ISOLATED TORNADO IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION 
EITHER STORM RELATIVE HELICITY VALUES BUMPING UP TO AROUND 150-200. 
THE MAIN CONVECTIVE LINE MOVES EAST INTO THE CAROLINAS LATER IN THE 
AFTERNOON TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY EVENING. DEEP UPPER LOW LUMBERS 
SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY 
WITH DEEP MOISTURE AND PLENTY OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY WRAPPING AROUND 
THE PRESSURE CIRCULATION FOR THE PRODUCTION OF POST FRONTAL SHOWERS 
DURING THIS PERIOD. THE UPPER LOW FINALLY LIFTS OUT THURSDAY NIGHT 
WITH A LITTLE DRIER WESTERLY FLOW DEVELOPING. HOWEVER...MODEL 
FORECASTS ARE REVEALING A COUPLE OF FAST MOVING SHORT WAVES BUILDING 
RAPIDLY EAST ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. FRIDAY NIGHT AND ANOTHER 
SATURDAY NIGHT. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THESE SYSTEMS APPEAR TO BE 
MOISTURE STARVED SO KEPT A DRY FORECAST GOING HERE.

PRESSURE MOVE EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION WILL PUSH A FRONT 
THAT HAS BEEN STATIONARY TO OUR NORTH TOWARD THE SOUTH. IT IS SHOWN 
BY THE NAM TO MAKE IT TO OUR SOUTHERN BORDER SUNDAY MORNING BEFORE 
LIFTING BACK TO THE NORTH THROUGH THE DAY. ALOFT...THERE APPEARS TO 
BE LITTLE FORCING FOR LIFT THROUGH TONIGHT...OTHER THAN SOME VORT 
MAXES THAT CROSS OUR NW SECTIONS. THE UPPER JET TO OUR WEST WILL 
BECOME MORE FAVORABLY POSITIONED TO ENHANCE DIVERGENCE ALOFT ON 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON. AROUND THIS TIME...850 MB WINDS TO BACK TO A MORE 
SOUTHERLY DIRECTION...AND ADVECT HIGHER THETA-E AIR INTO THE AREA. 
THERE MAY ALSO BE SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO 
DESTABILIZATION IN THE AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY SOUTH. SOME STRONG 
STORMS TO BORDERLINE SEVERE MAY BE POSSIBLE IN SOUTHERN AREAS IF THE 
INSTABILITY IN THE NAM MATERIALIZES.

FOR THE FORECAST...WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS FOR THE EVENING BASED ON 
OBSERVED RADAR AND SATELLITE TRENDS...THEN LOWER POPS BACK TO 
SCATTERED AFTER MIDNIGHT. WILL BRING POPS BACK UP INTO THE LIKELY 
RANGE ON SUNDAY...WITH A MENTION OF SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS IN THE 
AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON THE LOW SIDE OF MOS FOR 
HIGHS...AND ON THE HIGH SIDE OF MOS FOR LOWS.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...DEVELOPING STORM SYSTEM 
OVER THE PLAINS STATES MONDAY WILL ALLOW UPPER LEVEL RIDGE TO BUILD 
OVER THE SE COAST. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD SE OVER THE CAROLINAS 
AND WITH SE FLOW AROUND RIDGE A STRONG SE FLOW OVER THE MOUNTAINS 
SHOULD CAUSE SOME DRYING AND WARMING. KEPT POPS AT MOSTLY 20 PERCENT 
WITH SOME AREAS NOT SEEING ANY PRECIPITATION ESPECIALLY NE. AIR MASS 
BECOMES SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE WEST. MODELS ARE SOMEWHAT SLOWER WITH 
PROGRESSION OF UPPER TROUGH AND FRONT AS IT MOVES INTO THE TN AND 
OHIO VALLEYS AND OFF TO THE NE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. WINDS 
INCREASE OUT OF THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ESPECIALLY MOUNTAINS ANDS 
FOOTHILLS AHEAD OF PRECIPITATION WITH FRONT. A WIND ADVISORY WILL 
LIKELY BE NEEDED FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. TIMING OF PRE FRONTAL 
SHOWERS AND STORMS LOOK TO BE AFTER 06Z TUESDAY AND TAKE UNTIL 
AROUND 00Z WEDNESDAY TO BE THROUGH THE CWA. THREAT FOR SEVERE STORMS 
WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND ISOLATED TORNADOES TUESDAY. ECMWF STILL VERY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT)...TRIMMED BACK POPS FOR
EARLY THIS MORNING AS THE MAJORITY OF OUR CWA IS PRECIP FREE. THE
NEXT ROUND OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL APPROACH THE EXTREME SOUTHERN
VALLEY OVER THE NEXT HOUR OR SO. A WEAK LOW CONTINUES TO MOVE INTO
WV EARLY THIS MORNING BUT WILL ONLY ALLOW FOR MOSTLY LIGHT AND
SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS NETN AND SWVA. PATCHY DENSE FOG WILL ALSO
CONTINUE THROUGH EARLY MORNING ACROSS OUR AREA.

TODAY...A LOW PRESSURE CENTER WILL CONTINUE MOVING NE OUT OF 
ARKANSAS AND INTO WESTERN TN. A 500 MB VORT MAX ALSO ACCOMPANIES THIS 
LOW. A WEAK WARM FRONT WILL BE LIFTED FURTHER NORTH WITH THE LOW 
BECAUSE OF ITS NE MOVEMENT. THE LOW AND VORT MAX SHIFTING NORTH 
SHOULD ALLOW FOR BETTER PRECIP COVERAGE ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA. 
ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE FRONT WILL CONTINUE ALOFT...AND KEEP LIKELY 
POPS GOING IN THE FORECAST FOR MOST AREAS THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. 
WEAK INSTABILITY BUILDS INTO THE AREA TOMORROW AFTERNOON BUT LIFT 
WON'T BE OVERLY STRONG. LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES ARE FAIRLY HIGH BUT 
WEAKER MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES SHOULD HELP TO SUPPRESS ANY STRONGER 
STORM DEVELOPMENT ALONG WITH THE WEAK INSTABILITY ANTICIPATED. BUT 
BECAUSE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE HIGHER SHEAR VALUES OF 30 TO 40KTS AT 0-
6KM...A FEW STRONGER STORMS ARE POSSIBLE. OVERALL...IT WILL BE A WET 
AND CLOUDY SHORT TERM WITH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS DISAGREE ON THE SPEED OF 
THE STRONG SYSTEM TO IMPACT THE REGION EARLY IN THE WEEK. WENT A 
LITTLE CLOSER TO THE FASTER GFS/CANADIAN SOLUTION. STILL LOOKS LIKE 
A DECENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON SUNDAY...DIMINISHING 
A BIT DURING THE AFTERNOON IN A MOISTURE AND ENERGY RICH SOUTHWEST 
FLOW REGIME. LATER SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE ON THE DECREASE AS MUCH OF THE DEEPER 
MOISTURE AND LIFT BECOME RE-POSITIONED OUT WEST ACROSS THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE AMPLIFYING MID-AMERICA 
UPPER TROUGH. ADDITIONALLY...THE STRONG LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW 
WILL LEAD TO TREMENDOUS DOWNSLOPING ACROSS THE APPALACHIAN SPINE. 
THIS SHOULD LEAD TO A MUCH REDUCED CHANCE OF RAIN DURING THE DAY 
MONDAY WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME SUNSHINE ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
GREAT VALLEY. THE STRONG STORM SYSTEM BUILDS INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WITH A GOOD CHANCE FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE SYSTEM COLD FRONT. GOING WITH THE MORE 
PROGRESSIVE GFS/CANADIAN SOLUTION THE CHANCE FOR RAIN SHOULD BE 
DECREASING INTO TUESDAY AFTERNOON. A FAIR AMOUNT OF SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY AND MOISTURE APPEARS TO WRAP IN ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE DEEP 
UPPER TROUGH TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY SO MAINTAINED THE CHANCE POPS 
FOR SHOWERS THROUGH THIS PERIOD. DRIER AIR AND UPPER RIDGING BUILD 
IN BEHIND THE DEPARTING TROUGH ALLOWING FOR A RETURN TO SOME 
SUNSHINE AND A WARMING TREND FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.

RADAR SHOWS CONVECTION ALIGNED PARALLEL TO THE STEERING FLOW. AREAS 
FROM BLEDSOE CO. TO OQT TO TRI WILL LIKELY HAVE THE HIGHEST THREAT 
OF SOME FLOODING. GUSTY WINDS ARE POSSIBLE TOO BUT PROBABLY BELOW 
SEVERE LEVELS. 

TONIGHT...A SURFACE LOW WILL TRACK ALONG THE FRONT TO OUR 
NORTH...WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CATEGORICAL POPS ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN HALF. AS THE LOW MOVES TO WV EARLY SATURDAY MORNING...THE 
FRONT PUSHES SOUTHWARD. MEANWHILE A 500 MB VORT MAX MOVES ACROSS NRN 
AL. THIS SHOULD SHIFT THE MAIN PRECIP AXIS FARTHER SOUTH TOMORROW 
THAN WE HAVE SEEN TODAY. ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE FRONT WILL 
CONTINUE ALOFT...AND KEEP LIKELY POPS GOING IN THE FORECAST THROUGH 
SATURDAY NIGHT...ALTHOUGH WEAKER FORCING MAY MEAN LOWER QPF AMOUNTS 
AND LOWER THUNDERSTORM CHANCES. WILL CUT MOS TEMPERATURES BACK A 
LITTLE FOR TOMORROW GIVEN THE EXPECTED PRECIP AND CLOUD COVER.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...STATIONARY FRONT MAY PUSH JUST 
SOUTH OR EAST OF FORECAST AREA SUNDAY AS HIGHER PRESSURE DEVELOPS TO 
THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST OF FORECAST AREA. MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT 
WILL CONTINUE TO LIFT MOISTURE OVER THE FRONT AND A NEW WEAK
SURFACE LOW MAY FORM OVER WEST TN AND MOVE EAST OR NORTHEAST ALONG
THE FRONT. MORE SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE
ESPECIALLY IN THE MORNING NE AND THEN LATE IN THE DAY INTO
OVERNIGHT ALL AREAS. RAINFALL AMOUNTS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE
EXCESSIVE AT THIS TIME. ALSO SUNDAY A NEW UPPER TROUGH BEGINS TO
DROP SE THROUGH THE ROCKIES. A DEEPENING SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS OVER
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS SUNDAY NIGHT. MONDAY RIDGING BUILDS OUT AHEAD
OF THE PLAINS SYSTEM WITH ONLY SLIGHT CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND
STORMS. HIGHS SUNDAY MOSTLY IN THE 70S WITH LOWS SUNDAY NIGHT MID
50S TO LOWER 60S STILL ABOVE NORMAL. MONDAY TEMPERATURES ARE
EXPECTED TO BE SLIGHTLY WARMER WITH SOME FILTERED SUN POSSIBLE.
 
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY PLAINS SYSTEM WRAPS UP EVEN MORE AND MOVES 
EAST. GFS IS FASTEST OF THE MODELS. WINDS WILL INCREASE OUT OF THE 
SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM WITH POSSIBLE SEVERE WEATHER 
AHEAD OF IT WITH DAMAGING WINDS POSSIBLE AND A FEW TORNADOES. ALSO 
HIGH WINDS MAY DEVELOP IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS. 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MAY REACH 2 TO 3 INCHES 
WHICH COULD CAUSE FLOODING. A FLOOD WATCH MAY NEED TO BE ISSUED IF 
THIS TREND CONTINUES AS WEEKEND RAINFALL SATURATES THE SOIL. KEPT 
TEMPERATURES MILD TUESDAY WITH THE FRONT MOVING THROUGH DURING THE 
DAY TUESDAY. THE FASTER GFS MAY BRING THE FRONT THROUGH SEVERAL 
HOURS EARLIER SO MAY HAVE TO LOWER HIGHS LATER. ECMWF MODEL IS 
SLOWEST OF THE MODELS AND KEEP SHOWERS BEHIND THE FRONT TUESDAY 
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY SO FOLLOWED THIS TREND. 

SKIES BEGIN CLEARING WEDNESDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN AND KEEPS 
PATTERN QUIET THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK. TEMPERATURES WILL DROP 
BELOW NORMAL WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AND THEN RISE FRIDAY AS HIGH 
PRESSURE SHIFTS EAST.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FRONTAL BOUNDARY JUST TO OUR NORTH 
AND NORTHWEST IS NEARLY PARALLEL TO THE UPPER FLOW AND WILL NOT MAKE 
MUCH PROGRESS DURING THE SHORT TERM.  A WEAK DISTURBANCE IN THE 
UPPER FLOW WILL HELP TO ENHANCE PRECIP CHANCES BY THIS 
AFTERNOON/EVENING.  BEST CHANCES SHOULD BE NORTH CLOSER TO THE 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY...ALTHOUGH WILL STILL HAVE LIKELY POPS SOUTH.  
APPEARS THERE WILL BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR SOME THUNDER ESPECIALLY 
TODAY.  SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW MUCH CONVECTIVE ENERGY WILL BE 
AVAILABLE...BUT GIVEN WIND SHEAR PROFILE CANNOT RULE OUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS TODAY...SO WILL 
MENTION IN HWO.  WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS FOR THE SHORT 
TERM.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN 
AGREEMENT AT TIMES DURING THE LONG TERM PERIOD WITH SEVERAL SHORT 
WAVE PASSAGES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH OVER THE WEEKEND. FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WILL BE IN PLACE OVER TENNESSEE TO START THE WEEKEND BUT 
WILL BE ADVANCING BACK THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY AS THE UPPER LEVEL 
PATTERN REALLY CRANKS UP WITH AN AMPLIFYING WESTERN U.S. LONG WAVE  
TROUGH. LOOKS LIKE PLENTY OF MOISTURE FOR SHORT WAVE AND FRONTAL 
LIFTING ON SATURDAY FOR SOME RELATIVELY HIGH POPS FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. WARM SECTOR PRESSES NORTH INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON 
SUNDAY WITH SOME RIPPLES IN THE STRENGTHENING SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW SO 
KEPT SOME MEDIUM CHANCE POPS GOING FOR CONVECTION HERE. WAS ABLE TO 
GRADUALLY DROP PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION BACK SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY AS A MAJOR LEAGUE UPPER TROUGH PUSHES STEADILY EAST TOWARD 
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. IN THIS SCENARIO THERE MAY NOT BE VERY MUCH 
IN THE WAY OF RAIN ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH MUCH OF 
MONDAY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE FAVORED DOWNSLOPE REGION OF NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS A STRONG SOUTHERLY FLOW FORMS 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. OF COURSE THE CHANCE OF RAIN 
WOULD BE HIGHER IN THE UPSLOPE REGION OF SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA 
DURING THE DAY MONDAY. MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WILL BE A RATHER 
ACTIVE PERIOD AS A STRONG COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA. 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL FORM ALONG THE COLD FRONT AND THERE 
IS A GOOD CHANCE OF SEVERE STORMS WITH THIS EVENT AS MODEL PROGS 
INDICATE SUFFICIENT BUOYANCY AND STRONG SHEAR. THE GFS AND CANADIAN 
ARE PROGRESSIVE WITH THE DEEP TROUGH ALLOWING THIS FEATURE 
...AFTER PRODUCING A PERIOD OF WRAP AROUND SHOWERS TUESDAY NIGHT 
INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING...TO SWING EAST OF THE REGION DURING THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS ON  WEDNESDAY. THE ECMWF IS A LITTLE OUT ON THE EDGE 
WITH A CLOSED LOW EVENTUALLY FORMING OVER THE OHIO VALLEY KEEPING 
CLOUDS AND THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS GOING WELL INTO THURSDAY. WENT 
CLOSER TO THE NON-ECMWF CONCEPT OF IMPROVING WEATHER WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
AND BEYOND AS A NICE AMPLIFIED UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN FOR THURSDAY. 
GENERALLY STAYED UNDER GUIDANCE MAX TEMPS...ESPECIALLY IN THE COLD 
AIR ADVECTION PATTERN SETTING UP ON WEDNESDAY...WHILE STAYING CLOSE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
ONGOING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ASSOCIATED WITH A MIDLEVEL VORT 
MAX ARE EXPECTED TO EXIT THE AREA BETWEEN 21-00Z. WE SHOULD SEE A 
LULL IN PRECIP FROM 00Z TO AROUND 08Z BEFORE THE NEXT DISTURBANCE 
APPROACHES LATE TONIGHT...ONE THAT IS CURRENTLY GENERATING 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER MO. THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE NEAR THE GA COAST WILL 
CONTINUE TO PUMP GULF MOISTURE INTO THE AREA THROUGH TONIGHT...AND 
WE WILL BE IN THE WARM SECTOR WITH AN UNSTABLE AIR MASS WITH A FRONT 
ACROSS KY/WV...PARALLEL TO THE MID/UPPER FLOW. THIS PATTERN BECOMES 
NEARLY STATIONARY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. NORTHERN AREAS WILL HAVE THE 
HIGHEST POPS NEAR THE FRONT AND CLOSER TO THE UPPER JET...GOING UP 
TO CATEGORICAL TOMORROW AND CONTINUING THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...AND 
THE HIGHEST QPF. WHILE AVERAGE PRECIP AMOUNTS IN NORTHERN AREAS WILL 
BE BETWEEN 0.5 AND 1 INCH...LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS ARE LIKELY WITH 
EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...WET PATTERN CONTINUES
SATURDAY THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY. STATIONARY BOUNDARY NEAR TO OVER
THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY WILL BE A FOCUS FOR MORE SHOWERS AND A
FEW THUNDERSTORMS. LOW PRESSURE TO THE WEST OVER THE ARKLATEX MOVES
SLOWLY EAST ALONG THE FRONT SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WITH SHORTWAVES
CREATING PERIODS OF PRECIPITATION. RAINFALL AMOUNTS DO NOT LOOK
THAT HIGH BUT CLOUDS WILL BE PERSISTENT AND ANY THUNDERSTORMS MAY
PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. HIGH PRESSURE
RIDGING OVER FLORIDA AND EXTREME SOUTHEAST WILL STAY PUT AND SW
FLOW ALOFT WILL CONTINUE TO PUMP MOISTURE INTO THE TN VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH DIGS SOUTH INTO THE
PLAINS SUNDAY WITH A NEW LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER THE PLAINS. THIS
STRONGER SYSTEM WILL ALLOW RIDGE TO STRENGTHEN SOUTHEAST RIDGE
SOMEWHAT SHOWER CHANCES SHOULD DECREASE MONDAY BUT INCREASE MONDAY
NIGHT AND TUESDAY AS THIS SYSTEM WINDS UP AND LOW DEEPENS AS IT
MOVES INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND SOUTHERN CANADA MONDAY NIGHT AND
TUESDAY. STRONG WINDS WILL LIKELY DEVELOP AND COULD BE POSSIBLE
STRONG STORMS MONDAY NIGHT OR TUESDAY. WRAP AROUND SHOWERS IN
COLDER AIR MASS WEDNESDAY WITH SKIES CLEARING LATER WEDNESDAY AND
THURSDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A LITTLE ABOVE NORMAL DAYS AND

FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...INCREASING MOISTURE AND PERIODS OF
WEAK/MODERATE ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL HELP PRODUCE WIDELY SCATTERED TO

FOLLOWED GFS MOS TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE NOW IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK... 
AND REVEAL AN UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN THAT WILL BECOME MORE ACTIVE 
WITH TIME. A WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE 
LINGERING AROUND THE TN RIVER VALLEY FROM FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY... 
WHICH WILL HELP TO TRIGGER SCATTERED CONVECTION AROUND THE FORECAST 
AREA EACH DAY. MODELS INDICATE ONLY A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS 
DEVELOPING THIS WEEKEND OVER THE FORECAST AREA...BUT A DECENT 
VEERING WIND PROFILE WILL BE PRESENT EACH DAY TO HELP ORGANIZE AND 
STRENGTHEN A FEW STORMS TO POSSIBLY BECOME STRONG OR SEVERE. AN 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO DEVELOP OVER THE HIGH PLAINS ON 
SUNDAY...AND WILL BECOME HIGHLY AMPLIFIED BY MONDAY AND WILL DEVELOP 
A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ALONG A COLD FRONT OVER THE MID MS RIVER 
VALLEY BY MONDAY NIGHT. THIS HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
WILL CREATE A STRONG WIND FIELD ALONG AND AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT 
AS IT MOVES EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON TUESDAY. FOR 
MONDAY NIGHT...IT APPEARS THAT A HIGH END MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT AROUND 
THE MOUNTAINS AND THEIR ADJACENT FOOTHILLS WILL BE POSSIBLE...AS A 
STRONG SOUTH-SOUTHEASTERLY WIND FLOW AND A STABLE BOUNDARY LAYER 
DEVELOPS OVER THE MOUNTAINS WITH A VERY STRONG 850 MB JET (70 TO 75 
KT) DEVELOPING NORTHWEST OF THE MOUNTAINS. A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS IS THEN PROGGED TO DEVELOP ON TUESDAY AS THE COLD FRONT SLOWLY 
APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA WITH ITS STRONG WIND FIELD. AS A 
RESULT...IT APPEARS RIGHT NOW THAT THERE WILL BE A GOOD CHANCE FOR 
SEVERE STORMS OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY/TUESDAY NIGHT. AS

DYNAMICS STAY WELL NORTH AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION IS NOT 
STRONG. THE AREA OF SHOWERS/TSTMS SHOULD PROGRESS NE THROUGH THE 
DAY...WEAKENING AS IT ENCOUNTERS MORE STABLE AIR.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...

STRETCHED ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...SLOWLY DROPPING SOUTHWARD
THROUGH THE AREA DURING THE WEEKEND. ADDITIONALLY...THE AIR MASS
WILL BE MOISTURE AND WEAKLY UNSTABLE...ALLOWING SCATTERED
CONVECTION TO DEVELOP EACH PERIOD. MONDAY INTO TUESDAY...A COLD
FRONT WILL MOVE IN. MODELS STILL HAVE SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE
FRONTAL PASSAGE...ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO TIMING. A 850MB JET WILL
ACCOMPANY THE FRONT...AIDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORGANIZED
CONVECTION WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS.
COOLER...DRIER AIR MOVES IN BEHIND THE FRONT FOR WEDNESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE
ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH 12-13 UTC THIS MORNING. A NEARLY SOLID LINE
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA.
INSTABILITY IS LIMITED WITH CAPES OF 100-250 J/KG...BUT SHEAR IS
HIGH WITH 0-1KM BULK SHEAR OF 40KTS AND 0-1KM SRH OF 300-400 M2/S2.
WILL WATCH FOR POTENTIAL OF BRIEF LOW-TOPPED SPIN-UPS EARLY THIS
MORNING...BUT CHANCES ARE LOW. MAIN CONCERN WILL BE ISOLATED
DAMAGING WINDS AND HAIL UP TO NICKEL SIZE. BEST CHANCE OF SEVERE
WILL BE ACROSS THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN HALF OF THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY.

AFTER FROPA...SURFACE RIDGING WILL BE THE MAIN PLAYER FOR REST OF 
TODAY AND TONIGHT WITH DRIER AIR. MOSTLY CLEAR SKY RETURNS FOR LATE 
MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON. MOISTURE FROM DEVELOPING SYSTEM OVER THE 
PLAIN STATES WILL BE MAIN AFTER 12Z THURSDAY. FOLLOWED GUIDANCE 
TEMPERATURES CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE WEEKEND...BUT 
THEN REVEAL SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH A HIGHLY 
AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AND ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. A WEAK 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE LINGERING AROUND THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY ON THURSDAY AND INTO THE WEEKEND...HELPING TO TRIGGER 
SCATTERED CONVECTION AROUND THE FORECAST AREA EACH DAY. MODELS 
INDICATE ONLY A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING EACH DAY 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA...BUT A DECENT VEERING WIND PROFILE WILL BE 
PRESENT EACH DAY WHICH MAY HELP TO ORGANIZE AND STRENGTHEN A FEW 
STORMS TO BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE. BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...MODELS 
INDICATE THAT A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL DEVELOP 
OVER THE PLAINS ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY...WHICH WILL DEVELOP AN AREA OF 
LOW PRESSURE OVER THE MID MS RIVER AND LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEYS BY 
MONDAY NIGHT. THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL PUSH A COLD FRONT WITH A STRONG 
WIND FIELD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY MONDAY NIGHT (GFS MODEL 
SOLUTION) OR TUESDAY (ECMWF MODEL SOLUTION). WITH A STRONG VEERING 
WIND PROFILE EXPECTED WITH THIS COLD FRONT...IT APPEARS THAT THERE 
COULD BE A GOOD CHANCE FOR SEVERE STORMS OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR 
EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND COOLER THAN THE GFS 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK...WHICH IS IS BETTER 
AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS...AND MAKES SENSE DUE TO THE 
EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND SCATTERED CONVECTION EACH DAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...FINAL PIECE OF ENERGY DROPPING 
SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY WITH AN AREA OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING WITH THE UPPER LEVEL FEATURE AND THE 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. MODELS SHOW THE BEST SUPPORT FOR 
PRECIPITATION WILL BE ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA 
SO APPLIED A LIKELY POP HERE WITH MEDIUM AND HIGH CHANCE POPS SOUTH. 
DIMINISHING INSTABILITY ACROSS THE REGION TONIGHT SHOULD KEEP 
CONVECTION IN THE NON-SEVERE CATEGORY. IF ANY STORMS BECOME STRONG 
THEY WOULD MOSTLY LIKELY BE ON THE HIGHER CUMBERLAND PLATEAU TERRAIN 
FROM NORTHEAST TENNESSEE INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THIS EVENING. 
WEAKENING AREA OF LIFT ALONG THE FRONT CONTINUES FARTHER SOUTH INTO 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
DRIER WEST NORTHWEST FLOW BUILDS IN BEHIND THIS SYSTEM ALLOWING A 
DRY WEDNESDAY COMPLETE WITH SOME SUNSHINE. STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE 
MINS TONIGHT BUT TRIMMED A COUPLE DEGREES OFF SUGGESTED WEDNSDAY MAX 
TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
OVER THE AREA SHIFTS EAST EARLY IN THE PERIOD. SURFACE WARM FRONT 
MOVES NORTH THROUGH THE TN VALLEY BY THURSDAY. UPPER FLOW IS NEARLY 
ZONAL AND SHIFTS TO THE SW BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND. LAYER RH 
INCREASES WITH PWAT VALUES EXCEEDING 1.50 INCHES. LAYER THICKNESS 
VALUES ALSO RISE TO ABOVE NORMAL. WET AND WARM PERIOD CAN BE 
EXPECTED. TIMING OF IMPULSES IN THE UPPER FLOW WILL BE THE BIGGEST

.AVIATION...A COUPLE OF SYSTEMS YET TO MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT VALLEY
THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE FIRST IS GENERATING SOME SHOWERS
AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS CENTRAL EAST THROUGH NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA EARLY THIS AFTERNOON AND WILL
SHIFT EAST OF THIS REGION BY LATE AFTERNOON. STILL SOME AREAS OF
MVFR CEILINGS IN PLACE WITH THIS SYSTEM BUT FLIGHT WEATHER SHOULD
IMPROVE TO VFR AS THESE CEILINGS IMPROVE MID TO LATE AFTERNOON.
STILL SOME WIDELY SCATTERED CONVECTION OCCURRING ACROSS SOUTHERN
MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND SUPPOSE A FEW OF THESE SHOWERS COULD MOVE
ACROSS CHA AS THE AFTERNOON PROGRESSES SO ADDED A VICINITY THUNDER
GROUP HERE. THE NEXT SYSTEM TO IMPACT THE TERMINALS WILL BE THE
WAVE BUILDING TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY. THIS SHORT WAVE WILL DRAG THE
MIDWEST FRONTAL BOUNDARY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION
TONIGHT GENERATING A FEW MORE SHOWERS AND A COUPLE THUNDERSTORMS.
CEILINGS MAY DESCEND TO AN MVFR CATEGORY BEHIND THIS FRONTAL
BOUNDARY SO PLACED THIS IN AT MOST TERMINALS. WOULD EXPECT A RETURN
TO VFR FLIGHT AROUND 13-14Z ON WEDNESDAY WITH THE DEPARTURE OF THE
FINAL SHORT WAVE AND WEAKENING FRONTAL BOUNDARY.

WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY

TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE 
SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH 
THE COLD FRONT SLOWLY MOVING INTO THE AREA TONIGHT. MODELS INDICATE 
THAT ONLY A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL DEVELOP OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...BUT A FAIRLY STRONG 
VEERING WIND PROFILE (HELICITY VALUES AROUND 400 M2/S2) MAY HELP TO 
ORGANIZE AND STRENGTHEN SOME STORMS ENOUGH TO PRODUCE DAMAGING 
WINDS...LARGE HAIL...AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM 
AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVES 
EAST AND SOUTH OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH SURFACE RIDGING 
FOR WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT KEEPING CONDITIONS DRY.  UPPER 
FLOW BECOMES MORE WEST SOUTHWESTERLY THROUGH THE EXTENDED WITH A 
SERIES OF UPPER LEVEL JET STREAKS PRODUCING CYCLO-GENESIS OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS WITH FRONTO-GENESIS INTO THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY. 

INTERESTING FEATURE IS THAT MOISTURE FROM TROPICAL SYSTEM MOVING 
INTO BAJA CALIFORNIA WILL MOVE EAST INTO THE DEVELOPING FRONTO-
GENETIC BOUNDARY ENHANCING RAINFALL INTO THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY. 
THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GFS AND ECMWF IN WHERE THE 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY BECOMES QUASI-STATIONARY FOR LATE THIS WEEK INTO 
THE WEEKEND. WILL FOLLOW GFS CLOSELY FOR NOW WHICH KEEPS BOUNDARY  
NORTH OF THE AREA THROUGH THE WEEK...AND THEN PULLING SOUTH OVER THE 
AREA NEXT WEEKEND. PERIODS OF SHOWERS AND EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS CAN 
BE EXPECTED WITH THE GREATEST CHANCES OVER THE NORTHERN COUNTIES.

FIRING OUT TO THE WEST ACROSS WESTERN AND MIDDLE SECTIONS OF

TONIGHT. KEPT SOME THUNDER IN THE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT BUT NOT 
REALLY ANTICIPATING MUCH IN THE WAY OF SEVERE CONVECTION. SOME OF 
THE STORMS MAY BECOME STRONG OUT WEST OVER THE PLATEAU BUT MODEL 
PROGS INDICATE BUOYANCY WILL BE MEAGER. THERE COULD BE A BIT OF A 
BREAK IN THE RAIN FOLLOWING THE DEPARTURE OF OVERNIGHT PRECIPITATION

SOUTHERLY FLOW IN PLACE. STAYED CLOSER TO THE COOLER MET MOS MAX 
TEMPS ON TUESDAY WITH YET ANOTHER SHORT WAVE AND ASSOCIATED CLOUD 
SHIELD.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...BY TUESDAY NIGHT THE 
UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL BE TRANSLATING  
EAST ACROSS E TN AND SW VA. HIGHEST PRECIP CHANCES WILL OCCUR OVER 
SW VA AND NE TN/HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NC/TN STATE LINE. RAIN WILL

.AVIATION...FIRST WAVE OF CONVECTION IS JUST MAKING ITS WAY INTO
TRI AREA BUT IN FAST FLOW PATTERN WENT AHEAD AND ENDED STORMS HERE
RELATIVELY QUICKLY. LOOKS LIKE SOME DOWNWARD MOTION BEHIND THIS
FEATURE ALLOWS FOR SOME VFR FLIGHT FOR A PERIOD THIS AFTERNOON
WHILE THE TERMINALS AWAIT A SECOND UPPER LEVEL FEATURE EXPECTED TO
FORM ACROSS WESTERN KENTUCKY AND WESTERN TENNESSEE. IF THIS
DEVELOPS ACCORDING TO MODEL DEPICTION...AN AREA OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS WOULD IMPACT THE TERMINALS FROM AROUND 23Z THROUGH
04Z TONIGHT SO WENT AHEAD AND PLACED THIS CONVECTION IN THE
FORECAST. EXPECT SOME FOG FORMATION IN THE WAKE OF THE DAY'S
RAINFALL BUT WITH THE ACTIVE PATTERN KEEPING A MID DECK AROUND
DON'T BELIEVE THERE WILL BE MUCH OF A DROP IN VSBY. MORE STORMS TO
BUILD IN ON TUESDAY BUT THEY MAY NOT MOVE INTO THE GREAT VALLEY
UNTIL AFTER THE VALID FORECAST PERIOD.

.DISCUSSION...NICE LOOKING DISTURBANCE OVER WESTERN TENNESSEE RIPPING
RAPIDLY EAST IN THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW THIS MORNING. ALREADY AN AREA
OF CONVECTION FIRING AHEAD OF THE FEATURE. INSTABILITY A LITTLE
SUSPECT WITH MU CAPES STRUGGLING TO AROUND 700-800 J/KG.
HOWEVER...SHEAR IS DEFINITELY ADEQUATE RISING TO AROUND 45-50 KTS
SO SOME ORGANIZATION OF STORMS LIKELY. WILL STAY THE COURSE WITH
CURRENT FORECAST WITH LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS FOR SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. LOOKS LIKE THIS FIRST WAVE IN FOR THE MID DAY INTO
EARLY AFTERNOON PERIOD WITH MORE ENHANCEMENT WITH A SECONDARY SURGE
LATE IN THE DAY INTO THE EARLY EVENING HOURS. STRENGTHENING LOW
LEVEL WARM ADVECTION SUFFICIENT TO PUSH TEMPERATURES CLOSE TO
FORECAST MAXES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH 
A WARMER AND MORE HUMID AIR MASS (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY) OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. A SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY WILL 
CONTINUE TO BRING MORE MOISTURE INTO THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...AS A 
BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION 
AMPLIFIES SOME MORE OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. THIS UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH WILL HELP TO TRIGGER SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY TODAY...ESPECIALLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS A 
MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPS. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A 
FAIRLY STRONG VEERING WIND PROFILE UP THROUGH THE MID LEVELS...WITH 
WINDS INCREASING WITH HEIGHT THROUGHOUT THE TROPOSPHERE. THUS...THINK 
THAT SOME STORMS COULD BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING...WITH THE MAIN THREATS BEING DAMAGING WINDS...LARGE HAIL... 
AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH MAXES FOR TODAY (DUE TO 
DIFFERENCES IN PRECIP COVERAGE)...BUT ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
MINS FOR TONIGHT. WILL GENERALLY COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO WHERE 
THE DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...ANOTHER UPPER-LEVEL
DISTURBANCE WILL ROTATE AROUND THE PARENT UPPER-LOW OVER THE GREAT
LAKES AND THROUGH THE OHIO/TENNESSEE VALLEYS ON TUESDAY. THIS FRONT
WILL TRIGGER YET ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THOUGH
INSTABILITY MAY BE SLIGHTLY MORE LIMITED THAN ON MONDAY/MONDAY
EVENING...SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY COMBINED WITH SOME STRONG WIND
SHEAR PROFILES WILL GIVE THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG/ORGANIZED STORMS
TO EXIST. THE COLD TEMPERATURES ALOFT WOULD SUPPORT A MARGINAL
SEVERE HAIL THREAT WITH THE STRONGEST/MORE ORGANIZED ACTIVITY ALONG
WITH LOCALIZED DAMAGING WINDS.

THE UPPER-PATTERN BECOMES MORE ZONAL ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY... 
WHICH SHOULD KEEP THE FORECAST MAINLY DRY. HOWEVER...A WEAK SHORT
WAVE MAY TRIGGER SOME ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND STORMS THURSDAY
AFTERNOON/EVENING. THEN...THIS ACTIVITY WILL INCREASE IN COVERAGE
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY AS THE PRIMARY FRONT SAGS SOUTH FROM THE
OHIO VALLEY. AS A RESULT...HAVE INCREASED POPS TO HIGH-END CHANCE
TO LIKELY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE CWA FRIDAY AFTERNOON.
DEPENDING ON TIMING...SOME STRONG THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE POSSIBLE
WITH THIS ACTIVITY DURING THE LATER PART OF THE WORK WEEK. THE
FRONT WILL SAG SOUTH ON SATURDAY...WHICH MAY LIMIT PRECIPITATION
CHANCES FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE WEEKEND. HOWEVER...WITH MOISTURE
IN PLACE AND A PREDOMINANT TROUGH-PATTERN PREVAILING...THE
OPPORTUNITY FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL EXIST SUNDAY AND
INTO THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK. GIVEN THE EXPECTED CLOUD COVER
LATE IN THE WEEK...OPTED TO DROP HIGH TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES.
DO THINK A BRIEF WARM-UP INTO THE UPPER 70S/LOWER 80S IS STILL
POSSIBLE FOR WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY DUE SOME WEAK RIDGING.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...THE CHILL IS GONE...AS 
TEMPS HAVE BOUNCED BACK INTO THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S. THE 
RETREATING COOL AIRMASS WILL GIVE WAY TO SOME STRONG LOW LEVEL WARM 
AIR ADVECTION OVERNIGHT...EVEN IF CLOUDS DON'T INCREASE TO MORE THAN 
PARTLY CLOUDY. THIS SHOULD EQUATE TO NO COOLER THAN MID 40S FOR THE 
HIGHEST ELEVATIONS...STILL A LITTLE COOLER IN NRN VALLEYS. KEPT 
FORECAST GRIDS DRY FOR TONIGHT AS SHOWERS ARE NOT EXPECTED UNTIL 
LATE MONDAY MORNING.

SHOWERS POSSIBLE WITH THE WARM FRONT MONDAY...THEN MOISTURE 
INCREASES AHEAD OF A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES AND FINALLY A COLD FRONT 
ON TUESDAY. THUS...RAIN CHANCES LOOK QUITE HIGH LATE MONDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY. POPS WERE INCREASED SLIGHTLY MONDAY NIGHT AND RAISED UP TO 
SOLID LIKELY FOR TUESDAY. A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLE 
MAINLY MONDAY EVENING FOR OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES...WHICH IS ALREADY
HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR HWO PRODUCT. 

FOR TEMPS...CLOSE TO GFS MOS FOR MINS TONIGHT AND MAXES MONDAY... 
THEN I FAVORED THE MILDER NAM MOS MINS MONDAY NIGHT. A LOT OF CLOUDS 
AND HIGH POPS TUESDAY MAKES A MOS MAX BLEND THE BEST CHOICE.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...ACTIVE PATTERN STILL IN 
THE WORKS WITH AN AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH SHIPPING OUT TO THE EAST 
EARLY IN THE PERIOD. HAD TO HAVE SOME MEDIUM CHANCE POPS GOING 
TUESDAY NIGHT WITH A WEAKENING FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIPPING SOUTH 
ACROSS THE REGION BUT WAS ABLE TO KEEP WEDNESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT DRY WHILE MORE SHORT WAVE ENERGY RIDES BACK TOWARD THE EASTERN 
U.S. IN FAST WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY IN 
TIMING OF BEST LIFT WITH THESE FAST MOVING DISTURBANCES RIP EAST SO 
HAD TO BROAD BRUSH SOME CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. ECMWF/GFS INDICATE A COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
WILL BE SLIPPING GRADUALLY SOUTH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
AROUND FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY ALLOWING FOR A MEDIUM CHANCE POP REGIME 
AND THEN HAD TO CARRY ANOTHER PERIOD OF LOW CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN ON SUNDAY MID AMERICA UPPER TROUGH 
UNDERGOES AMPLIFICATION LEADING TO STRENGTHENING SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW. 
MAINTAINED FORECAST MAXES WHICH BUMP ABOVE NORMAL MID TO LATE WORK 
WEEK AND THEN A LITTLE CLOSER...BUT STILL ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH THE

SIGNIFICANT SHORT WAVE WILL DROP SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE BASE OF THE 
EASTERN TROUGH BRINGING DECENT CHANCE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. THE SYSTEM WILL BE MOVING AWAY TUESDAY 
NIGHT AS THE UPPER FLOW BECOMES ZONAL. HOWEVER...AT LEAST A COUPLE 
MORE ADDITIONAL WAVES WILL BE RIDING QUICKLY EAST IN TIME TO BRING A 
CHANCE FOR SHOWERS BACK INTO THE FORECAST ON THURSDAY. MORE ROBUST 
SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL ALLOW DEVELOPMENT OF A SURFACE LOW BY FRIDAY. 
THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE FRIDAY INTO 
SATURDAY AS MOIST LOW LEVEL FLOW IS LIFTED ALONG THE SYSTEM COLD 
FRONT.

.DISCUSSION...A CHILLY START TO THIS SATURDAY MORNING WITH LOWS 
GENERALLY IN THE 40S AND WESTERLY WINDS OF 5 TO 15 MPH. 12Z OHX/RNK 
SOUNDINGS SUPPORT HIGHS IN THE 50S TO LOWER 60S ACROSS THE LOWER 
ELEVATIONS...AND ONLY IN THE 40S FOR HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 

MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IS THE FREEZE WATCH AREA AND I PLAN TO WAIT 
FOR THE 12Z MOS GUIDANCE TO TRICKLE IN THIS MORNING. WILL MORE THAN 
LIKELY NEED TO UPGRADE THE FREEZE WATCH TO A WARNING WITH THE 
AFTERNOON PACKAGE...POSSIBLY EARLIER.

FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW AROUND 30 KNOT WESTERLY WINDS AT THE TOP OF

.UPDATE...FOR AN ADDITION TO THE LONG TERM DISCUSSION.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRONG COLD FRONT ALONG THE
EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH THE LEADING
EDGE OF A MUCH COLDER AIR MASS OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. THIS
UNSEASONABLY COLD AIR MASS WILL CONTINUE TO ADVECT EASTWARD INTO
THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...WITH TEMPS EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN TEN AND
FIFTEEN DEGREES BELOW NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. THE MAIN
CONCERN IN THE SHORT TERM IS THE POSSIBILITY OF THE FIRST FROST AND
FREEZE OF THE FALL SEASON LATE TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING. MODEL
GUIDANCE TEMPS HAVE BEEN TRENDING COOLER WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE MODEL
RUN...AND NOW INDICATE TEMPS CLOSE TO FREEZING ACROSS SOUTHWEST
VA...NORTHEAST TN...AND SOUTHWEST NC. WITH DEWPOINTS EXPECTED TO BE
FAIRLY LOW TONIGHT (MID 20 TO LOWER 30S) AS AN AREA OF HIGH
PRESSURE BECOMES CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHEAST...THINK THAT TEMPS
COULD EASILY TUMBLE TONIGHT (POSSIBLY LOWER THAN GUIDANCE) AS SKIES
CLEAR AND SURFACE WINDS DECOUPLE FROM THE WINDS ALOFT. SINCE THIS
SCENARIO IS THE KIND THAT CAN EASILY CREATE UNEXPECTEDLY COOLER
TEMPS THAN ORIGINALLY FORECASTED (AND IT IS STILL FAIRLY EARLY IN
THE FALL SEASON)... THINK IT IS PRUDENT TO ISSUE A FREEZE WATCH FOR
SOUTHWEST VA... NORTHEAST TN...EAST TN MOUNTAINS...AND SOUTHWEST NC
FOR LATE TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING. IN ADDITION...WILL MENTION
PATCHY FROST ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER
ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE UPCOMING WEEK...HELPING
TO MAINTAIN PRECIPITATION CHANCES AND SOME COOLER AUTUMN-LIKE
TEMPERATURES. 

AFTER A VERY CHILLY NIGHT...TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM INTO THE 65
TO 70 DEGREE RANGE IN MOST SPOTS BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. WITH A
SOUTHERLY WIND AND SOME INCREASING CLOUDS...WARMER LOWS IN THE
UPPER 30S TO 40S ARE EXPECTED FOR SUNDAY NIGHT. THE FIRST IN A
SERIES OF SHORTWAVES WILL PUSH THROUGH THE AREA ON MONDAY...
BRINGING ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND PREHAPS A RUMBLE OF
THUNDER OR TWO...ALONG WITH SOME ADDED CLOUD COVER. THEN MONDAY
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY...A STRONGER UPPER-LEVEL DISTURBANCE WILL MOVE
THROUGH AREA AND PROVIDE BETTER LIFT FOR MORE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS. SOME LOCALIZED STRONG STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE
DURING THIS TIME PERIOD DUE TO THE MAINLY ELEVATED INSTABILITY
COMBINED WITH SOME STRONG SHEAR. THE COLD TEMPERATURES ALOFT WOULD
SUPPORT A MARGINAL SEVERE HAIL THREAT WITH THE STRONGEST/MORE
ORGANIZED ACTIVITY ALONG WITH LOCALIZED DAMAGING WINDS.
 
ADDITIONAL SUBTLE WAVES WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR MORE ISOLATED 
SHOWERS TUESDAY NIGHT BEFORE TAPERING OFF BY WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY AS 
RIDGING BEGINS TO BRIEFLY NOSE IN. BY FRIDAY...A STRONGER TROUGH AND 
FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND BRING SOME BETTER 
CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS BY THE AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT HOURS. 
GIVEN THIS BETTER CONFIDENCE...HAVE INCREASED POPS TO 40 PERCENT IN 
THE DAY 7 GRIDS.

317 PM EDT FRI OCT 3 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...COLD FRONT HAS PASSED JUST
EAST OF BOWLING GREEN KY AND NASHVILLE TN...AS INITIAL BATCH OF
SHOWERS WAS JUST EXITING OUR NE TN AND SW VA COUTNIES.

COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND PERHAPS AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM...SHOULD
BE LESS THAN 60 PERCENT OVERALL. HOWEVER...SOME DEVELOPMENT WITH
THE FRONT IS EXPECTED AND THE RAP/HRR MODELS BOTH SHOW A LITTLE
BETTER COVERAGE OVER SW VA/NE TN THIS EVENING. THIS IS LIKELY DUE
TO BEST UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE THOSE AREAS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE
UPSTREAM SHORTWAVE TRACK. 

OTHERWISE...MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE CHILLY FALL AIRMASS
SETTLING IN SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. I ADDED PATCHY AREAS OF FROST
TO NE AREAS AND SMOKIES FOR NOW WITH MINS IN THE 30S IN THOSE
LOCATIONS. SURFACE WINDS WOULD APPEAR TO FALL OFF SHARPLY SATURDAY
EVENING. WENT QUITE CLOSE TO GFS MOS FOR THE FORECAST PERIODS. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION WILL BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF UPPER TROUGHING THROUGH AT 
LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST WHICH KEEPS 
TEMPERATURES A LITTLE BELOW NORMAL THROUGH TUESDAY. A SHORTER 
WAVELENGTH FEATURE AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL DROP 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE REGION LATER MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY 
GENERATING A FEW SHOWERS. HOWEVER...UPPER LEVEL HEIGHTS WILL BE 
BUILDING WEDNESDAY INTO FRIDAY IN A DRIER REGIME COMPLETE WITH A 
FAIR AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE. THE INSOLATION AND A STRENGTHENING 
SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL HELP BOOST TEMPERATURES BACK A FEW DEGREES ABOVE 
NORMAL DURING THIS LATTER PART OF THE WORK WEEK.

FEATURE OF INTEREST IS THE ACTUAL COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY...CURRENTLY
OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE...WHICH MAY PRODUCE A SHOWER IN THE VICINITY
OF TYS AND TRI AROUND 00Z. FINALLY A STRONG TRAILING SHORT WAVE
IN PLACE OVER THE MIDWEST...WELL BEHIND THE SURFACE FRONT...COULD
PRODUCE A SHOWER AT TRI DEEP INTO THE EVENING. EXPECT THERE TO BE A
LOW CLOUD LAYER HANGING AROUND AT ABOUT 2500-3000 FEET OVER THE

310 AM EDT FRI OCT 3 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION...WITH ITS 
ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS EASTERN KY AND 
THE TRI-CITIES AREA...AND ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT EXTENDING 
SOUTHWARD OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY AND OZARKS REGION. AREA 
RADARS REVEAL A PRE-FRONTAL SQUALL LINE OVER MIDDLE TN AND NORTHWEST 
AL...WHICH IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN THIS MORNING AS IT MOVES INTO A 
MORE STABLE AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MOST OF THIS PRE-
FRONTAL ACTIVITY SHOULD MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
AROUND SUNRISE THIS MORNING...WITH ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE 
REDEVELOPMENT LIKELY LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO EARLY EVENING AS THE 
COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE 
LOCAL AIR MASS WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO BECOME MARGINALLY UNSTABLE THIS 
AFTERNOON BEFORE FRONTAL PASSAGE...SO IT APPEARS THAT ONLY ISOLATED 
STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS WITH DAMAGING WINDS WILL BE POSSIBLE. AS FOR 
TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES
ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...IN WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT
THAT WILL SWEEP THROUGH THE REGION FRIDAY EVENING/NIGHT...A MUCH
COOLER CANADIAN AIR MASS WILL FILTER INTO THE AREA ON SATURDAY.
THIS COOL/DRY AIR /ACCOMPANIED BY SOME BREEZY WNW WINDS/...WILL
KNOCK HIGHS BACK INTO THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S ACROSS THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS WILL BE A VERY
NOTICEABLE CHANGE FROM THE 80S READINGS THE AREA HAD BEEN
EXPERIENCING TO END SEPTEMBER/START OCTOBER. A VERY CHILLY NIGHT
WILL FOLLOW THE COOL DAY AS LOW TEMPERATURES WILL PLUNGE INTO THE
MID TO UPPER 30S UNDER A CLEAR SKY EARLY SUNDAY MORNING. AS A
RESULT...A FROST ADVISORY WILL LIKELY BE NEEDED OVER A GOOD PORTION
OF THE REGION... PARTICULARLY ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA.
WILL STILL MONITOR THE POTENTIAL FOR A LIGHT FREEZE OVER SHELTERED
VALLEYS IN SOUTHWEST VA...THROUGH THINK TEMPS SHOULD STAY JUST
ABOVE THE FREEZING MARK AT THE MOMENT.

THEREAFTER...A SLIGHT WARMING TREND WILL OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE 
WEEK...BUT THE REGION WILL REMAIN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A BROAD 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING A SERIES A SHORTWAVE TROUGHS 
THROUGH THE AREA EARLY THIS WEEK. AS A RESULT...SOME CHANCES FOR 
SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL EXIST ON MONDAY AND ESPECIALLY MONDAY NIGHT 
AND TUESDAY...BEFORE BECOMING MORE ISOLATED AGAIN BY WEDNESDAY. HIGH 
TEMPERATURES AS MENTIONED WILL RECOVER BACK INTO THE 70S BY EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...AND MAY EVENTUALLY APPROACH THE 80 DEGREE MARK BY 
THURSDAY THANKS TO SOME WEAK RIDGING/SUNSHINE.

ISSUED AN UPDATE TO MAKE SOME TWEAKS TO TEMPERATURES...BRINGING
THEM DOWN A BIT IN LINE WITH OBSERVATIONS...AND ADJUSTING POPS A
LITTLE BASED ON TIMING OF PRECIP TO OUR WEST IN RADAR AND

SO...BUT THE BULK OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WITH THE BEST DYNAMIC
FORCING SHOULD COME INTHE 12-18Z TIME FRAME. THE LACK OF

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MAIN WEATHER EVENT
OCCURS FRIDAY AS A STRONG UPPER TROUGH AND COLD FRONT MOVE EAST
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY FRIDAY NIGHT. PREVIOUS
FORECAST GRIDS WERE STILL RIGHT ON TRACK WITH JUST A FEW MINOR
TWEAKS. SEVERE STORMS UNLIKELY...BUT SHEAR OF 30 KTS OR MORE WITH
SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY AS STRONG FORCING OCCURS THROUGH THE DAY.
THIS SHOULD RESULT IN AT LEAST SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WITH
ISOLATED STRONG TO MINIMALLY SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLE IN THE
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. 

MUCH COOLER TEMPS FOR THE WEEKEND AS ADVERTISED...BUT THE MOISTURE
DRIES OUT VERY QUICKLY ON SATURDAY SUCH THAT I ONLY ADDED A FEW
AREAS OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SW VA ON SATURDAY. 

OTHERWISE...12Z MOS GUIDANCE IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND ALSO IN LINE
WITH PREVIOUS MIN/MAX TEMP GRIDS. IF THE WINDS DIE DOWN ON SATURDAY
NIGHT...THEN PATCHY AREAS OF FROST ARE CERTAINLY POSSIBLE ON SUNDAY
MORNING ACROSS SW VA AND PARTS OF NE TN. THIS WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN
OUR HWO PRODUCT. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER TROUGH 
AMPLIFIES AND CLOSES OFF OVER SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA AND THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION WITH SEVERAL SHORTER WAVELENGTH FEATURES ROTATING 
AROUND THE CLOSED LOW THROUGH ABOUT TUESDAY. THE MODELS INDICATE THE 
MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE PRESSURE TROUGHS WILL IMPACT THE FORECAST 
AREA BEGINNING EARLY MONDAY WITH THE BEST LIFT AND HIGHEST MEAN RH 
IN PLACE ABOUT MONDAY NIGHT INTO MID DAY TUESDAY. TIMING AND 
LOCATION OF BEST LIFT STILL NOT DEALT WITH SIMILARLY BY 
GFS/ECMWF/CMC SO TWEAKED POPS UP A TAD FOR THIS PERIOD OF THE 
FORECAST AWAITING BETTER MODEL AGREEMENT. FOLLOWING THIS SEGMENT OF 
INCLEMENT WEATHER IT APPEARS HIGHER PRESSURES AND DRIER AIR WILL 
BUILD INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ALLOWING A PLEASANT

UPPER JET WILL PLACE THE REGION UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE 
REGION OF THE JET WITH DIVERGENCE ALOFT OVER THE AREA FRIDAY 
MORNING. 

THE DIRECT CIRCULATION WITH THE JET WILL AID IN STRENGTHENING THE 
FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY FOR FRIDAY. 
INSTABILITY IS MARGINAL WITH CAPES NEAR 1000 J/KG...BUT WITH STRONG 
WINDS ALOFT AND FAVORABLE SHEAR...SOME OF THESE STORMS COULD BECOME 
SEVERE WITH THE MAIN THREAT BEING DAMAGING WINDS.

BEHIND UPPER JET/TROUGH AXIS...STRONG DRYING EXPECTED WITH A SHARP 
END OF THE CONVECTION AND CLOUDS FOR LATE FRIDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING.

ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE SYSTEM IS THE COLD AIR MOVING INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH 850MB TEMPERATURES DROPPING TO -1 TO -2 
DEGREES C FOR SATURDAY MORNING. FREEZING TEMPERATURES EXPECTED 
ACROSS THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS SATURDAY MORNING WITH PATCHY FROST 
POSSIBLE NORTHEAST AREAS AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS SUNDAY MORNING.

FRIDAY MORNING. ONGOING CONVECTION AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL MOVE INTO 
THE MRX CWA THURSDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS ON FRIDAY. CONVECTIVE PARAMETERS WHICH ARE FAVORABLE 
WEST OF THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT ARE LESS IMPRESSIVE THIS FAR EAST AS 
CONVECTION ARRIVES. WIND SHEAR IS MODERATE AND STRONG GUSTY WINDS 
AND HEAVY DOWNPOURS LIKELY. ISOLATED SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE 
BUT THREAT IS LOW AT THIS TIME. MODELS TRENDING TOWARD STRONG CAA 
BEHIND FRONT THROUGH THE WEEKEND. UPPER TROUGH DIGS DEEPLY THROUGH 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND TILTS NEGATIVELY OFF THE MID ATLANTIC 
COAST BY SUNDAY. SUNDAY MORNING TEMPERATURES WILL BE WELL BELOW 
NORMAL WITH POCKETS OF UPPER 30S POSSIBLE ACROSS NE AREAS. NEAR 
FREEZING ACROSS THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION. AN 
IMPULSE IN THE MEAN TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE NW ON MONDAY AND 
RECARVES THE UPPER TROUGH BACK TOWARD THE APPALACHIANS. ISOLATED 
SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE THROUGH TUESDAY.

ANOTHER GOOD RADIATIONAL NIGHT IS IN STORE FOR THE TN VALLEY REGION
WITH AT LEAST PATCHY FOG DEVELOPMENT NEAR AND AROUND BODIES OF WATER...
MAINLY DURING THE 06Z-15Z TIME FRAME. MAY NOT BE AS WIDESPREAD AS
THIS MORNING THOUGH...WITH SOME SCT HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS EXPECTED
TO RIDE OVER UPPER LEVEL RIDGING INFLUENCES. LATEST 12Z GUIDANCE
SUGGESTING MORNING FORECAST PACKAGE OVERNIGHT LOWS FOR TONIGHT
STILL IN LINE AND WILL LEAN ACCORDINGLY. CONTINUANCE OF UPPER LEVEL
RIDGING INFLUENCES WED THRU WED NIGHT WILL PROVIDE FOR MOCLR SKIES.
HIGHS ON WED WILL BE IN THE UPPER 70S SW VA TO MID 80S LOWER TN
VALLEY REGION. LOWS WED NIGHT WILL RANGE FROM THE MID TO UPPER 50S
SW VA TO LOWER 60S LOWER TN VALLEY REGION. EXPECT A GRADUAL INCREASE
IN CLOUDINESS AS THE DAY PROGRESSES ON THU AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
OVER S CNTRL CANADA DEEPENS WITH A COLD FRONT EXTENDING SWD TO A
SFC LOW ACROSS THE SRN PLAINS...WHICH IS EXPECTED TO MOVE SLOWLY
EWD. THIS WILL CONTINUE TO PUT THE TN VALLEY REGION IN A WAA PATTERN
WITH HIGHS ACROSS THE AREA MAINLY IN THE LOW TO MID 80S. SYSTEM MIGHT
BE A LITTLE SLOWER MOVING IN THAN PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED...AND HAVE
TAILORED WX AND EXPECTED POPS ACCORDINGLY WITH LOWS GENERALLY SPANNING

ALOFT WITH SFC RIDGING INFLUENCES FROM THE ROCKIES BUILDING INTO

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND TUESDAY/...
CLOUDS ARE SLOWLY BEGINNING TO BREAK UP FROM WEST TO EAST AS A
WEAK UPPER-LEVEL DISTURBANCE CLEARS THE AREA. AS OF MID-AFTERNOON
ALL BUT FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS
AND FOOTHILLS HAVE BECOME MOSTLY TO PARTLY SUNNY. THIS HAS ALLOWED
THE MERCURY TO CLIMB UP INTO THE UPPER 70S TO AROUND 80 DEGREES
ALONG THE PLATEAU AND PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL VALLEYS.
THIS CLEARING WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE LATE AFTERNOON AND
EVENING...RESULTING IN A MOSTLY CLEAR SKY FOR THE FORECAST AREA
LATER TONIGHT. THOUGH MOST LOCATIONS DID NOT RECEIVE MUCH IN THE
WAY OF RAINFALL...A MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER COMBINED WITH THE
CLEAR/CALM CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN WIDESPREAD PATCHY FOG
DEVELOPMENT /SOME PERHAPS LOCALLY DENSE AROUND DAYBREAK/. AS
SUCH...HAVE MAINTAINED THIS IN THE ZONES...AND MAY NEED TO MONITOR
THE POSSIBILITY OF A DENSE FOG ADVISORY LATER THIS EVENING SHOULD
CONDITIONS BECOME APPARENT THAT IS IT WARRANTED.

FOR TUESDAY...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD IN AND PROMOTE
MOSTLY SUNNY AND DRY CONDITIONS. THIS ABUNDANT SUNSHINE ALONG WITH
INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES/TEMPERATURES ALOFT WILL ALLOW FOR
WIDESPREAD HIGHS IN THE LOWER 80S BY THE LATE AFTERNOON ACROSS THE
CENTRAL/SOUTHERN VALLEYS...WITH UPPER 70S EXPECTED OVER SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE OVER THE SOUTHEAST CONUS TO START THE 
PERIOD...THEN THE HIGH WILL SHIFT EASTWARD TO THE COAST ON THURSDAY. 
ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS CAN BE EXPECTED BOTH DAYS UNDER MOSTLY SUNNY 
SKIES. 

A S-SW FLOW WILL ADVECT MOISTURE INTO THE AREA BEGINNING 
THURSDAY...WITH PRECIP DEVELOPING NRN AL/GA IN THE AFTERNOON. STRONG 
LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER JET ENTRANCE REGION AND POTENT 500 MB 
VORT MAX WILL BRING LIKELY POPS AND A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS LATE 
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING. WHILE FORCING SHOWN BY THE GFS 
LOOKS STRONG...OVERNIGHT TIMING AND LACK OF INSTABILITY SHOULD 
PROBABLY MEAN A LOW THREAT OF SEVERE. THE ECMWF IS A BIT FASTER THAN 
THE GFS TO MOVE OUT PRECIP...AND THE LATEST GFS CONTINUES TO TREND 
FASTER FROM PREVIOUS RUNS...SO WILL TREND POPS DOWNWARD A LITTLE 
FASTER THAN PREVIOUSLY FORECAST...ENDING FRIDAY NIGHT. 

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AND A BROAD UPPER TROUGH WILL PROVIDE A COOL 
AND DRY AIR MASS FOR THE WEEKEND...WITH HIGHS IN THE 60S TO LOWER 
70S AND LOWS IN THE 40S TO LOWER 50S. THE GFS BRINGS A WEAK 
DISTURBANCE IN THE NW FLOW NEAR OUR NORTHERN SECTIONS ON 
MONDAY...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW THAT THIS WILL ACTUALLY OCCUR...SO 
WILL GO DRY ON MONDAY WITH TEMPS REBOUNDING TO NEAR NORMAL.

A BROAD UPPER-TROUGH IS SWEEPING THROUGH THE REGION THIS
MORNING...AND WILL USHER OUT THE LAST OF THE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED
LIGHT SHOWERS ALONG THE FOOTHILLS AND MOUNTAINS BY EARLY THIS
AFTERNOON. IN ITS WAKE...DRIER AIR IS QUICKLY MOVING INTO THE
REGION...ALLOWING FOR SOME PARTIAL CLEARING AND THE EROSION OF THE
LOW STRATUS SHIELD PRESENTLY IN PLACE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY.
THINK THAT THIS CLEARING WILL BE GRADUAL AND OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE
DAY FROM WEST TO EAST...SO HAVE BEEN CAUTIOUS IN THE UPDATE TO MOVE
THINGS ALONG TOO QUICKLY. HOWEVER...DO THINK THAT PARTLY/MOSTLY
SUNNY CONDITIONS OVER A GOOD PORTION OF THE AREA SEEM LIKELY BY
21Z...AND POSSIBLY SOONER OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND PORTIONS
OF THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL VALLEY. THIS MAY ALLOW HIGH TEMPERATURES TO
CREEP A DEGREE OR TWO HIGHER THAN PREVIOUS THOUGHT...SO HAVE BUMPED
THEN UP SLIGHTLY IN THOSE AREAS AS WELL. THE OTHER CHANGE WAS TO

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE
CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS...WITH A WARM AND MOIST AIR
MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME SCATTERED
LIGHT SHOWERS OVER THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST
NORTH CAROLINA...BUT NOT MUCH OTHER ACTIVITY WAS OCCURRING
ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. MODEL INDICATE
THAT A BROAD BUT WEAK UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY
WILL SLOWLY DRIFT EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY OVERNIGHT...
WHICH SHOULD INCREASE THE LIFT AND RESULTING SHOWER ACTIVITY OVER
THE FORECAST AREA A LITTLE MORE AFTER MIDNIGHT (ESPECIALLY OVER
THE MOUNTAINS). OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO LOWER POPS A LITTLE FOR THE
REST OF TONIGHT...BUT WILL KEEP LIKELY POPS GOING FOR THE MOUNTAIN
ZONES. OTHERWISE...THE REST OF THE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO
BE ON TRACK...AND WILL MAINLY JUST REMOVE ANY EVENING PRECIP WORDING.

.AVIATION...AN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST FROM THE GREAT
LAKES/MIDWEST TO THE APPALACHIAN SPINE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.
AT THE SAME TIME...A MOISTURE LADEN DISTURBANCE BUILDS EAST
NORTHEAST OUT OF THE GULF OF MEXICO ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC
STATES. THE MODELS INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF A LOW LEVEL TROUGH
WHICH EXTENDS ACROSS THE GREAT VALLEY AT THE START OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD EXTENDING UNTIL AROUND 18Z MONDAY. DUE TO THE SOUTHERN ROUTE
OF THE THE GULF DISTURBANCE AND THE EASTERLY FLOW WITHIN THE WEAK
INVERTED LOW LEVEL TROUGH...IT APPEARS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BE
IN SHORT SUPPLY...ESPECIALLY AT TYS AND TRI. THEREFORE...FLIGHT
CONDITION SHOULD REMAIN VFR AT THESE TERMINALS WITH A POSSIBILITY
FOR A COUPLE DROPS OF RAIN AROUND TYS AROUND 12-17Z MONDAY. THERE
WILL BE A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE FOR SOME MEASURABLE RAINFALL AROUND
09-15Z AT CHA BUT PROBABILITY STILL LOW ENOUGH TO KEEP THIS ACTION
IN THE VICINITY OF THE TERMINAL. AFTER THE SOUTHEAST FEATURE MOVES
AWAY ON MONDAY...WOULD EXPECT LOWER CEILINGS TO IMPROVE FOR THE
LAST SIX TO EIGHT HOURS OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.

314 PM EDT SUN SEP 28 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...THE BIG STORY THROUGH 
THE SHORT TERM IS THE DWINDLING CHANCES FOR ANY SUBSTANTIAL PRECIP. 
THINGS KEEP TRENDING DRIER WITH EACH PASSING MODEL RUN. WE STILL 
HAVE THE INCOMING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OUT OF THE NW AND THE LOW 
COMING NORTH UP OUT OF THE GULF. HOWEVER...IT SEEMS LIKE THE TROUGH 
WILL HELP TO STEER THE LOW TO THE SE OF US FOR THE MOST PART...THUS 
LIMITING THE CHANCES FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT PRECIP. 

THE BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN NOW LOOK TO START LATE TONIGHT INTO 
TOMORROW MORNING AND CONTINUE INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS AS THE UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH ARE AREA. ACCOMPANYING THE TROUGH IS A 
60 TO 70KT 300MB JET THAT WILL HELP TO GENERATE SHOWERS DUE TO UPPER 
LEVEL DIVERGENCE THAT WILL SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA. ALSO PUT IN A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS TOMORROW AFTERNOON DUE TO A COUPLE 
HUNDRED J/KG CAPE SHOWING UP IN THE NAM SOUNDINGS.

PRECIP TOTALS THROUGH THE SHORT TERM LOOK UNIMPRESSIVE COMPARED TO 
WHAT THE MODELS WERE PREVIOUSLY SHOWING ACROSS PARTS OF OUR AREA. 
HIGHEST PRECIP TOTALS SHOULD BE ALONG THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS 
AND DOWN INTO SWNC BUT STILL THESE LOCATIONS WILL ONLY SEE AMOUNTS 
OF THREE TO FOUR TENTHS OF INCH OR LESS. OTHER LOCATIONS ACROSS THE 
CWA MAY SEE A TENTH OR TWO. OVERNIGHT LOWS TONIGHT SHOULD BE A FEW 
DEGREES WARMER DUE TO INCREASED CLOUD COVER. TOMORROWS TEMPS WILL BE 
SIMILAR TO TODAYS.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A FAIRLY BENIGN FORECAST 
FOR THE EARLY TO MIDDLE PART OF NEXT WEEK AS AN UPPER-RIDGE AXIS
BEGINS TO BUILD INTO THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY...AND
WILL PERSIST THROUGH THURSDAY. MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER CONDITIONS WILL
LIKELY RESULT IN SOME WIDESPREAD PATCHY FOG LATE MONDAY NIGHT.
BUT...WITH THE RIDGE BUILDING IN MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS WILL
PREVAIL BY MID-MORNING ON TUESDAY ONCE DAYTIME HEATING COMMENCES.
THE MOSTLY SUNNY/DRY CONDITIONS WILL ALLOW HIGH TEMPERATURES TO
RECOVER BACK INTO THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S THROUGH THURSDAY. LATE
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY ANOTHER MORE POTENT FAST- MOVING UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH/COLD FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH THE AREA...BRINGING A
GOOD CHANCE FOR SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. HOWEVER...MORE
SIGNIFICANTLY...MUCH COOLER AIR WILL FOLLOW AS HIGHS IN THE UPPER
60S AND LOWER 70S WILL BE COMMON THIS WEEKEND AS THIS COOL/DRY
AUTUMN AIR MASS MOVES INTO THE REGION IN ITS WAKE.

.DISCUSSION...PREVIOUS FORECAST MOSTLY ON TRACK BUT AM MAKING SOME
SLIGHT CHANGES. ADDED IN SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN NOW THROUGH
EARLY AFTERNOON FOR CENTRAL VALLEY AND WESTWARD. CURRENT RADAR
IMAGERY SHOWS VERY LIGHT PRECIP ACROSS PORTIONS OF OUR WESTERN CWA.
THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO WEAK UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE ACROSS OUR AREA
ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCOMING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. THIS PRECIP WILL
BE VERY LIGHT AND WILL ONLY RESULT IN TRACE AMOUNTS WITH MOST AREAS
STAYING DRY. FOR THIS AFTERNOON...NUDGED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS A
LITTLE FURTHER NORTH TO INCLUDE THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ALL OTHER
FORECAST ELEMENTS LOOK GOOD AT THIS TIME. NEW ZONES OUT SHORTLY TO
INCLUDE UPDATED PRECIP CHANCES AND WORDING.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...STILL EXPECTING A QUIET
SHORT TERM BUT CHANGES ON THE WAY. OUR HIGH PRESSURE THAT HAS
IMPACTED OUR WEATHER OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS FINALLY MOVES OFF
TO OUR NE OVERNIGHT. THIS WILL RESULT IN MID AND LOW LEVEL FLOW
SHIFTING TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST OUT AHEAD OF A WEAK APPROACHING
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH FROM THE NW AND A WEAK LOW COMING NORTH OUT OF
THE GULF ON SUNDAY.

THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST FLOW WILL HELP TO INCREASE MOISTURE ACROSS OUR 
AREA AND SLOWLY BEGIN TO ERODE THE DRY AIR OBSERVED IN THE 
SOUNDINGS. THIS WILL TAKE SOME TIME THOUGH SO IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL 
STAY DRY THROUGH MOST OF THE SHORT TERM BUT WITH RAIN CHANCES
INCREASING THROUGH OUT THE DAY ON SUNDAY FROM SOUTH TO NORTH AS THE
LOW APPROACHES FROM THE SOUTH.
 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL TONIGHT AND NEAR NORMAL TOMORROW.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...AN UPPER-LEVEL 
DISTURBANCE WILL MOVE THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT
INTO MONDAY...BRINGING THE AREA A GOOD CHANCE FOR WIDESPREAD
PRECIPITATION IN WELL OVER A WEEK. STILL SOME QUESTION WITH THE
LOCATION OF THE BEST LIFT AND THUS HEAVIEST PRECIPITATION BANDS.
THE NAM IS NOW TRENDING A LITTLE MORE TO THE SOUTH AND EAST WITH
THE EARLIER RUNS OF THE GFS...AND IS REALLY FAVORING THE SOUTHERN
VALLEY...AND EAST TENNESSEE/WEST NORTH CAROLINA MOUNTAINS.
THUS...HAVE THE CATEGORICAL POPS ORIENTED THIS WAY LATE SUNDAY
NIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING...BEFORE TAPERING THEM OFF WEST TO EAST
MONDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. AS THE PRECIPITATION ENDS MONDAY
NIGHT...CLEARING WILL OCCUR BY TUESDAY AND AN UPPER-RIDGE AXIS WILL
BUILD IN BRIEFLY THROUGH THURSDAY. THE SUNSHINE/DRY CONDITIONS WILL
ALLOW HIGH TEMPERATURES TO RECOVER BACK INTO THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER
80S. ANOTHER MORE POTENT UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM WILL THEN TRACK
TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY LATE IN THE WEEK...WHICH MAY BRING A
STRONGER FRONT AND MORE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS HEADING INTO
A FRIDAY...FOLLOWED BY MUCH COOLER AIRS AS HIGHS IN THE UPPER 60S
MAY BE COMMON BY NEXT WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND SATURDAY/...
NOT MUCH CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST. HIGH PRESSURE STILL IN
CONTROL TONIGHT BUT WILL START SHIFTING NORTHEAST OUT OF THE AREA
ON SATURDAY. AS THE HIGH MOVES NORTHEAST...MID AND LOW LEVEL FLOW
ACROSS OUR AREA WILL START TO SHIFT TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST. LOWS
OVERNIGHT WILL BE A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...
AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL LIFT OUT OF THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY AND MERGE WITH ANOTHER BROAD TROUGH SWINGING THROUGH THE
OHIO VALLEY ON SUNDAY. THIS WILL BRING NORTH GULF MOISTURE AND GIVE
THE AREA THE FIRST CHANCE AT WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION IN MORE THAN
A WEEK. THERE ARE STILL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODELS ON THE
TIMING AND TRACK OF THE BANDS OF PRECIPITATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
STORM SYSTEM. THE GFS STILL FAVORS A MORE SOUTHEASTERLY TRACK WHICH
WOULD PLACE A BULK OF THE HEAVIEST PRECIPITATION ALONG THE FAR
SOUTHERN ZONES AND ALONG AND EAST OF THE GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. THE NAM STILL MAINTAINS A SLIGHTLY
EARLIER AND MORE NORTHERLY TRACK. THIS PLACES MORE WIDESPREAD
LOCALLY HEAVY PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE REGION SUNDAY EVENING/NIGHT
THROUGH MIDDAY MONDAY...BEFORE TAPERING OFF THAT AFTERNOON/EVENING.

AT ANY RATE...THINK THE MOST FAVORED AREAS FOR RAINFALL WILL BE THE
SOUTHERN/CENTRAL VALLEYS AND THE EAST TENNESSEE/WEST NORTH CAROLINA
MOUNTAINS. HAVE DONE A BLEND OF THE MODELS...AND ORIENTED THE POPS
AS SUCH /WITH THE HIGHEST POPS SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH 18Z MONDAY/.
GIVEN THE AFOREMENTIONED MODEL DIFFERENCES THOUGH...HAVE HELD OFF
ON ANYTHING HIGHER THAN LIKELY TO HIGH-END CHANCE FOR NOW. AS THE
PRECIPITATION TAPERS OFF MONDAY NIGHT...CLEARING WILL OCCUR BY
TUESDAY AND THE AMPLE SUNSHINE SHOULD ALLOW FOR SOME DRYING AND
HIGH TEMPERATURES TO RECOVER BACK INTO THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S
THROUGH THURSDAY AS A RIDGE BUILDS IN. ANOTHER MORE POTENT UPPER-
LEVEL STORM SYSTEM WILL THEN TRACK TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY LATE IN
THE WEEK...WHICH MAY BRING A STRONGER FRONT AND MORE CHANCES FOR
SHOWERS AND STORMS HEADING INTO A FRIDAY/SATURDAY TIME FRAME.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL BE CENTERED TO OUR NORTH AND NORTHEAST.  A WEAK INVERTED 
SURFACE TROUGH WILL LINGER OVER OUR AREA...BUT NOT MUCH MOISTURE OR 
FORCING SO DO NOT EXPECT MUCH MORE THAN SOME ADDITIONAL CLOUDS 
ESPECIALLY SOUTH. DEW POINTS ARE A BIT HIGHER TODAY...SO APPEARS 
THERE WILL BE A BETTER CHANCE FOR SOME PATCHY FOG MOST AREAS.  MAV 
TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE FOR THE MOST PART...SO JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS. 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...AFTER ANOTHER
MOSTLY SUNNY AND WARM/DRY SATURDAY...A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE
WILL DIG OUT OF THE SOUTHWESTERN GULF COAST SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS
WILL INCREASE MOISTURE ACROSS THE REGION AND GIVE THE AREA THE
FIRST CHANCE AT WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION IN MORE THAN A WEEK THIS
SUNDAY. THOUGH THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN TIMING/COVERAGE WITH THE
MODEL GUIDANCE...THE MOST FAVORED AREAS WILL BE THE CENTRAL AND
SOUTHERN VALLEYS...ALONG WITH SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. THIS
ACTIVITY IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY OVERSPREAD THE REGION SUNDAY
AFTERNOON AND INCREASE/CONTINUE OVERNIGHT THROUGH MONDAY MORNING.
ALONG WITH THE MOISTURE/PRECIPITATION...THIS BROAD TROUGH WILL
BRING IN SOME COOLER AIR WHICH WILL DROP HIGH TEMPERATURES BACK
INTO THE LOWER 70S. AS THE SYSTEM PULLS AWAY FROM THE AREA MONDAY
NIGHT... CLEARING/DRYING WILL BEGIN TO OCCUR...AND BY TUESDAY A
WEAK UPPER- RIDGE WILL START TO MOVE BACK IN. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR
MOSTLY FAIR WEATHER TUESDAY-THURSDAY WITH A SLIGHT WARMING TREND
BACK INTO THE UPPER 70S/LOWER 80S.

ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA COMPLIMENTS OF SUBSIDENCE WITHIN A RIDGE OF 
HIGH PRESSURE AND DOWNSLOPING EASTERLY FLOW CROSSING THE MOUNTAINS. 
SPEAKING OF THE MOUNTAINS THERE MAY BE A SPRINKLE OVER THE RIDGES

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
315 AM EDT WED SEP 24 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AREA OF LOW PRESSURE MIGRATES 
NORTH ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH LITTLE 
IMPACT ON THE FORECAST AREA DUE TO MORE THAN ADEQUATE RIDGING AND 
SUBSIDENCE OVER THE MID SOUTH. IN ADDITION...PREVAILING LOWER LEVEL 
EASTERLY FLOW ARGUES AGAINST MUCH IN THE WAY OF CLOUD COVER BELOW 
700 MB. MODELS DO GENERATE SOME SCT TO EVEN BKN AC JUST WEST OF THE 
APPALACHIAN SPINE. THIS WOULD IMPACT MAINLY SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE LATER IN THE DAY INTO THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD AS 
THE LOW PRESSURE CENTER DRIFTS NORTH. AM SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF PRECIP LATER TONIGHT BUT HELD ONTO A SLIGHT CHANCE 
FOR A SHOWER OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE APPALACHIAN BORDER 
COUNTRY WHERE THERE WILL BE SOME OROGRAPHIC LIFT. STAYED CLOSE TO 
GUIDANCE BLEND FOR MAX AND MIN TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...SOME SHOWERS MAY LINGER INTO 
THURSDAY IN EXTREME NORTHEAST PORTIONS OF THE AREA AS LOW PRESSURE 
TRACKS UP THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD...AND WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP 
IN THAT AREA THROUGH THE DAY. OTHERWISE...THE END OF THE WEEK LOOKS 
DRY WITH A WARMING TREND CONTINUING...WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 70S TO 
MID 80S FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.

SOME SIGNIFICANT MODEL DIFFERENCES DEVELOP BETWEEN THE 
GFS...NAM...AND ECMWF BEGINNING SATURDAY NIGHT. ALL SHOW A CLOSED 
LOW DEVELOPING OVER THE PLAINS...BUT THE NAM IS VERY QUICK TO SPREAD 
GULF MOISTURE INTO OUR AREA AS EARLY AS SATURDAY. THE GFS BRINGS 
PRECIP INTO SOUTHERN AREAS LATE SUNDAY...WITH THE ECMWF DOING THE 
SAME SUNDAY NIGHT. WILL FOLLOW THIS SLOWER SOLUTION...WHICH IS MORE 
IN LINE WITH MOST ENSEMBLE MEMBERS. THIS CLOSED LOW IS SLOW TO MOVE 
EAST AS IT BECOMES AN OPEN WAVE...WHICH WILL KEEP POPS IN THE AREA 
THROUGH MONDAY. THE SLOWER ECMWF KEEPS PRECIP INTO TUESDAY...BUT 
WILL TREND DOWN TO A SLIGHT CHANCE BASED ON THE DRIER GEFS MEAN 
SOLUTION. CLOUDS AND PRECIP SHOULD BRING AN END TO THE WARMING 
TREND...WITH HIGHS RETURNING TO THE 70S.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
DRY AND CLEAR CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE AREA TODAY AS HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BE POSITIONED OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY. 
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE CAROLINAS WILL 
STAY EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS. HIGH TEMPS TODAY UNDER FULL SUN SHOULD 
BE CLOSE TO YESTERDAY'S HIGHS...PERHAPS A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER...IN 
THE 70S IN MOST SPOTS OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAINS. COOL TEMPS IN THE 
UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S CAN BE EXPECTED AGAIN TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...LOOKS LIKE AN EXTENDED DRY 
SPELL.  PICKING UP THE LONG TERM FORECAST STARTING 
WEDNESDAY...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE DOMINATING THE EASTERN 
U.S. CONTINUING THE FALL WEATHER.  USUALLY A HIGH WILL STAY OVER THE 
AREA FOR 2-3 DAYS...THEN AS IT MOVES EAST...THE SOUTHERLY RETURN 
FLOW BRINGS MOISTURE FROM THE GULF...BUT THIS TIME A LOW/TROUGH 
MOVING UP THE EAST COAST WILL WILL HAVE ITS COUNTERCLOCKWISE FLOW 
PUSHING NORTHEASTERLY WINDS FROM NY/PA AREA INTO OUR AREA...THAT 
REBUILDS THE HIGH PRESSURE AND KEEPS IT DRY HERE THROUGH THE END OF 
THE WEEK. LOOKS LIKE SUNDAY AT THE EARLIEST BEFORE WE CAN GET A 
CHANCE AT GETTING SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO START HEADING TOWARD 
THE AREA...AND SOME ENSEMBLE MEMBERS DON'T START THE RETURN FLOW 
UNTIL RIGHT ABOUT THE END OF THIS FORECAST PERIOD.  

WILL CONTINUE THE MENTION OF LOCALIZED FOG IN THE LATE NIGHT AND 
EARLY MORNING...DUE TO STEAM FOG BEING PRODUCED AS THE COLD AIR 
RIDES OVER THE WARM LAKES.

FOR TEMPS...WENT ON THE LOW SIDE OF GUIDANCE FOR MOST OF THE MAX 
TEMPS...MINS LOOKED GOOD OVERALL...BUMPED UP THE MIN NEXT MONDAY 
NIGHT AS DECENT CHANCES OF MOISTURE AND AN INCREASE IN BLANKETING 
CLOUDS ACROSS THE AREA SHOULD LIMIT RADIATIONAL COOLING.  FOR DEW 
POINTS...WENT ON THE DRY SIDE OVERALL...LOOKS LIKE WE WILL HAVE A 
DRY FETCH FOR MOST OF THE WEEK...DIDN'T SEE ANY REASON FOR THE 
MOISTURE TO REBOUND AS MUCH AS THE MODELS/MOS SUGGEST.

AIR TEMPS AND WARM WATER TEMPS WILL ALLOW FOR A GOOD SETUP FOR FOG
DEVELOPMENT ALONG AREA LAKES/RIVERS TONIGHT. THUS...HAVE ADDED THIS
TO THE ZONES...THOUGH THINK NORTHERLY WINDS WILL BE JUST PERSISTENT

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT STILL WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA OVER CENTRAL KY AND 
MIDDLE TN...GENERALLY ALONG A CINCINNATI TO NASHVILLE LINE. THIS 
COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA 
DURING THE EARLY EVENING HOURS AROUND SUNSET...WITH ADDITIONAL 
SCATTERED CONVECTION EXPECTED TO DEVELOP ALONG AND BEHIND IT. WINDS 
MAY REMAIN PERSISTENT ENOUGH OVERNIGHT TO INHIBIT ANY FOG 
DEVELOPMENT...BUT SINCE WATER TEMPS REMAIN WARM...WILL CONTINUE TO 
MENTION PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING TOWARDS SUNRISE...BUT MAINLY ALONG THE 
WATERWAYS. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON 
MONDAY...WITH COOLER AND DRIER AIR MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA. AS 
FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES 
WITH MINS FOR TONIGHT...AND WILL GENERALLY COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE 
TWO. ON MONDAY...BOTH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MAXES AND LOOK 
REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SAME STORY AS YESTERDAY...
VERY QUIET EXTENDED PERIOD.
 
MONDAY NIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES BUILDING BEHIND THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE. CLEAR SKIES ALONG WITH DRIER AND COOLER AIR WILL LEAD TO 
OVERNIGHT LOWS 8 TO 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES 
THROUGH THE WEEK WITH TEMPERATURES GRADUALLY WARMING TO NEAR NORMAL 
BY THURSDAY. OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL ALSO SLOWLY WARM BUT WILL REMAIN 
BELOW NORMAL. FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY THE HIGH PRESSURE CENTER THAT HAS 
BEEN TO OUR NORTH ALL WEEK STARTS MOVING FURTHER EAST...THIS WILL 
ALLOW FOR MOISTURE TO SLOWLY BUILD BACK IN ACROSS THE AREA.
 
WILL ADJUST SATURDAYS POPS DOWN FROM CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE AS IT IS 
GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME TO BUILD BACK IN OUR MOISTURE. SUNDAY IS THE 
BEST CHANCE OF RAIN THROUGH THE EXTENDED. ONLY HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE IN 
NOW BUT POPS MAY HAVE TO BE RAISED IN FUTURE FORECASTS. AGAIN...
EXPECT SEVERAL MORNINGS AND EVENINGS TO HAVE A FALL-LIKE FEEL TO THEM
AS WE START THE LONG TERM.

STABLE WITH THIS LINE MOVING IN...WITH NAM SHOWING ALMOST 2000 J/KG 
CAPE VALUES. WINDS ARE UNIFORM THROUGHOUT THE ATMOSPHERE...WITH SOME 
SHEAR IN THE LOW LEVELS. THE NAM ALSO SHOWS DECENT DRY AIR IN THE 
MIDLEVELS IN THE EARLY AFTEROON WHICH COULD ENHANCE DOWNBURST AND 
WIND THREATS. THE FRONT SEEMS TO BE A BIT SEPARATE IN TIMING FROM 
THE UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS...WITH THE MAIN AREA OF DIVERGENCE FOR OUR 
AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT...BUT DUE TO THE STRONG FORCING OF THE 
CONVECTION UPSTREAM...AND THE FACT THAT THE STORMS NOW LOOK TO MOVE 
IN EARLIER AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT DAYTIME HEATING...COULD SEE 
MODERATE TO STRONG STORMS WITH A FEW ISOLATED SEVERE SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MAIN THREATS WITH THESE STORMS IS EXPECTED TO 
BE MODERATE HAIL...STRONG WINDS...AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. 

BEHIND THIS FRONT...HIGH PRESSURE DEVELOPS OVER THE EASTERN US. DRY 
CONDITIONS AND MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES WILL QUICKLY TAKE OVER FOR 
MONDAY...LASTING THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. AS THE HIGH 
PRESSURE MOVES OFF THE EASTERN COAST AROUND FRIDAY...WRAPAROUND 
MOISTURE WILL BE ADVECTED TOWARDS OUR AREA. COULD SEE THE CHANCE FOR 
INCREASING CLOUDS AND PRECIP MAINLY IN SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA...BUT THIS IS TOO FAR OUT TO SAY WITH MUCH CONFIDENCE. 
TEMPERATURES BEHIND THIS FRONT WILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
255 PM EDT FRI SEP 19 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE NORTHEAST...WHICH 
EXTENDS SOUTHWARD ACROSS MOST OF THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. 
THIS HIGH WILL BRING DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...WITH PATCHY FOG EXPECTED TO DEVELOP 
AGAIN OVERNIGHT...MAINLY AROUND THE WATERWAYS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS 
AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH MINS FOR 
TONIGHT...BUT WILL TREND CLOSER TO THE COOLER NAM NUMBERS WHICH HAVE 
VERIFIED BETTER LATELY. ALSO...WILL TREND COOLER THAN BOTH SETS OF 
GUIDANCE WITH MAXES ON SATURDAY (WHICH HAS BEEN THE TREND LATELY).

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...COLD FRONT BRINGING 
SHOWERS AND STORMS SUNDAY EVENING THEN PLEASANT CONDITIONS THROUGH 
THE REST OF THE EXTENDED.

SATURDAY NIGHT WE HAVE AN APPROACHING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT TO OUR NW. CONDITIONS OVER OUR AREA WILL 
REMAINING CALM WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND OVERNIGHT LOWS NEAR OR A 
DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE NORMAL. THE FIRST HALF OF SUNDAY SHOULD BE NICE 
BUT CLOUDS WILL INCREASE FROM NW TO SE DURING THE MID TO LATE 
AFTERNOON HOURS AS THE COLD FRONT APPROACHES. CURRENT NAM AND GFS 
ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT AS FAR AS TIMING AND SUGGEST THAT SHOWERS AND 
STORMS WILL ARRIVE ON THE PLATEAU BETWEEN 19 TO 21Z AND THEN SPREAD 
INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY BY AROUND 00Z. THE NAM AND GFS DO DIFFER ON 
THE AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY HOWEVER. AT 00Z SUNDAY THE NAM SHOWS 1500 
TO 2000 J/KG OF CAPE ACROSS THE AREA WHILE THE GFS ONLY SHOWS 500 TO 
1000 J/KG. OBVIOUSLY IF THE NAM IS CORRECT THEN WE COULD SEE A FEW 
STRONGER STORMS ACROSS THE AREA. THE STRONGEST STORMS THOUGH SHOULD 
STAY TO OUR NORTH WHERE THE BEST SHEAR IS...AS THERE IS A TIGHT 
SHEAR GRADIENT ALONG THE KY/TN STATE LINE. NONETHELESS...IF WE DO 
HAVE THE INSTABILITY THAT THE NAM SUGGESTS THEN A FEW STRONGER 
STORMS COULD DRIFT DOWN OUT OF KY INTO TN. 
 
AFTER SUNDAY NIGHTS CONVECTION THE REST OF THE EXTENDED LOOKS DRY. 
SOME CLOUDS MAY LINGER BEHIND THE FRONT SUNDAY NIGHT BUT SKIES 
SHOULD QUICKLY CLEAR WITH SUNSHINE RETURNING BY LATE MORNING/EARLY 
AFTERNOON ON MONDAY. COOLER AIR BEHIND THE FRONT WILL KEEP MAX TEMPS 
IN THE LOW 70S ACROSS SW VA/NE TN...MID 70S CENTRAL VALLEY...AND
UPPER 70S SOUTHERN VALLEY ON MONDAY. THE TROUGH PUSHES FURTHER NE
ON MONDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE SLOWLY BEGINS TO BUILD BACK IN ACROSS
THE AREA. WITH HIGH PRESSURE SLOWLY BUILDING EXPECT A GRADUAL
WARMING TREND THROUGH THE WORK WEEK. MOISTURE LOOKS TO RETURN BY
FRIDAY/FRIDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND SW NC BUT KEPT
PRECIP OUT FOR NOW. OVERALL...IT SHOULD BE A VERY PLEASANT EXTENDED
PERIOD AFTER THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FOR THIS MORNING...COOL
TEMPERATURES AND RELATIVELY WARM AREA LAKES/STREAMS WILL ALLOW
PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP. LOCALIZED DENSE FOG POSSIBLE.

FOR TONIGHT...RELATIVELY DRY AIRMASS OVER THE AREA WITH PWS AROUND
1 INCH. HOWEVER...AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH WILL DEVELOP OVER THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS/TENNESSEE VALLEY. THE CONVERGENCE ALONG THIS
BOUNDARY MAY FOCUS THE MARGINAL INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE ISOLATED
SHOWERS. SEEMS BEST CHANCE OVER THE FAR EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND
NORTHEAST DUE TO A LITTLE BETTER MOISTURE. FOR TONIGHT...
CONVECTION WILL DISSIPATE EARLY WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKY.

FOLLOWED MOS GUIDANCE CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL
CONTINUE EAST OF THE REGION THROUGH SATURDAY WITH MOSTLY CLEAR
SKIES REMAINING ONE MORE DAY BEFORE A COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE THROUGH THE DAY
SUNDAY...AND THE MAIN AREA OF RAIN LOOKS TO MOVE IN LATE AFTERNOON
INTO EVENING SUNDAY. INSTABILITIES AND WIND PROFILE ARE WEAK WITH
THIS FRONT...WITH LOW PW VALUES THROUGH THE NIGHT. LOOKING AT
ISOLATED TO SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS AND AN OCCASIONAL THUNDERSTORM.
THE RAIN CHANCES WILL QUICKLY MOVE OUT OF THE AREA MONDAY AND SKIES
WILL CLEAR BEHIND THE FRONT. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND DRY WEATHER
WILL REMAIN THROUGH MOST OF THE WEEK. HIGH PRESSURE DEVELOPS AND
MOVES OFF THE EAST COAST AND WITH THE WRAPAROUND MOISTURE FROM
THIS...COULD SEE INCREASE IN CLOUDS AND MOISTURE AT THE END OF THE
WORK WEEK. WILL WAIT FOR FURTHER MODEL RUNS TO ADD MUCH DETAIL TO
THE FORECAST. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR NORMAL SATURDAY AND
SUNDAY...AND AS THE FRONTAL PASSAGE MOVES THROUGH...TEMPS WILL DROP
TO SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. A DEEP TROUGH SETS UP OVER THE
EASTERN US BRINGING MUCH COLDER AIR TO THE ARE THROUGH MUCH OF NEXT
WORK WEEK.

246 AM EDT THU SEP 18 2014

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
AN AREA OF BKN/OVC HIGH CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO PASS OVER THE
REGION EARLY THIS MORNING. THIS CLOUD COVER HAS LIKELY PREVENTED
ANY WIDESPREAD FOG FROM FORMING ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
VALLEYS. HOWEVER...MOSTLY CLEAR AND CALM CONDITIONS OVER SW
VIRGINIA AND NE TENNESSEE HAS PROMOTED SOME PATCHY FOG WHICH WILL
LIKELY PERSIST THROUGH DAYBREAK. THIS CLOUD COVER WILL GRADUALLY
DISSIPATE ONCE HEATING BEGINS AND THE DAYTIME BOUNDARY LAYER BEGINS
TO TAKE SHAPE. A NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL HELP TO REINFORCE THE
SOMEWHAT COOLER AIR MASS IN PLACE...BUT AMPLE SUNSHINE WILL ALLOW
TEMPERATURES TO REACH THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S BY THE LATE
AFTERNOON. A CLEAR AND CALM NIGHT WILL ONCE AGAIN ALLOW FOR PATCHY
FOG DEVELOPMENT AFTER MIDNIGHT...LIKELY MORE WIDESPREAD THAN THE
PREVIOUS FEW NIGHTS WITH LESS CLOUD COVER EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
VERY NICE WEATHER FOR THE 
EXTENDED PERIODS WITH JUST ONE WEAK SYSTEM SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY 
MONDAY. SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO 
VALLEY WILL DRAG A WEAK COLD FRONT THROUGH THE SRN APPALACHIANS BY 
EARLY MONDAY. GFS AND ECMWF SIMILIAR ON TIMING AND CONSISTENT FROM 
12Z RUN...SO CHANCE POPS STILL LOOK GOOD FOR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY MORNING. I DID LOWER THE POPS A BIT FASTER AT 18Z MONDAY. 

OTHERWISE...00Z GFSX MOS CAME IN SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN THE 12Z MOS... 
AND ACTUALLY CLOSER TO THE LATEST ECMWF MOS. SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS MADE 
TO INCREASE MAX TEMPS ON DAYS WHEN THE SFC-850 MB FLOW SHIFTS TO 
WEAK SOUTHERLY. MAX AND MIN TEMPS RUN GENERALLY CLOSE TO SEASONAL 
VALUES THROUGH THE PERIOD.

250 PM EDT WED SEP 17 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE DEEP 
SOUTH...WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH EXTENDING NORTH OF IT OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. RADAR AND SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEAL A 
MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM OVER THE OZARKS...WHICH WAS MOVING 
SOUTHWARD BUT ITS ASSOCIATED HIGH CLOUDS WERE MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD 
ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. ADDITIONAL MOISTURE OVER THE MID MS 
RIVER VALLEY WILL MOVE TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT...SO 
THINK THAT ANY FOG DEVELOPMENT LATER TONIGHT SHOULD BE PATCHY AND 
MAINLY NEAR AREA WATERWAYS. AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE MID 
WEST THIS AFTERNOON IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT EASTWARD INTO THE 
NORTHEAST BY FRIDAY...WHICH WILL PRODUCE AN EASTERLY FLOW OVER THE 
CAROLINAS. MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS EASTERLY UPSLOPE FLOW WILL 
TRIGGER ISOLATED CONVECTION OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS 
ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AFTERNOONS...SO WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE 
POP IN THESE ZONES. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE 
IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE 
BETWEEN THE TWO WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE PERIOD STARTS OUT DRY 
ON SATURDAY AS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION AWAITS ANOTHER 
AMPLIFYING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. MODEL 
FORECASTS HAVE SLOWED THIS FEATURE DOWN WITH THE BRUNT OF THE SYSTEM 
NOT ARRIVING UNTIL SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...SO TWEAKED POPS BACK
A BIT ON THE FRONT END. STILL NOT A GREAT DEAL OF LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE BECOMES ENTRAINED IN THIS SYSTEM...WITH LOW LEVEL RIDGING
REFUSING TO BREAK DOWN TO LARGE DEGREE AHEAD OF THE LOW LEVEL
TROUGH/SURFACE FRONT. SO NOT MUCH MOISTURE AND LIMITED CONVERGENCE
AT THIS TIME ARGUES FOR THE PROBABILITY OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
TO REMAIN IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY. WENT WITH A GO SLOW APPROACH TO
THE DEPARTURE OF THIS SYSTEM ON MONDAY...WITH SOME TRAILING
MOISTURE AN ENERGY BUILDING INTO THE BACK SIDE OF THE DEPARTING
UPPER TROUGH. KEPT TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY DRY. HOWEVER...MODELS ARE
MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INVERTED SURFACE
TROUGH OVER THE MID SOUTH ABOUT TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY...WITH
INCREASING ATLANTIC MOISTURE AROUND THE BASE OF THE EASTERN U.S.
RIDGE.

INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TO KEEP SOME CU FROM POPPING. SOME

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
A QUIET NIGHT ACROSS THE REGION...WITH HIGH PRESSURE SLOWLY
BUILDING EAST INTO THE MID-MISSISSIPPI AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS. THE
FRONT THAT HAS BEEN DRAPED ACROSS THE AREA FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF
DAYS HAS PUSHED WELL TO THE SOUTH. HOWEVER...ABUNDANT BOUNDARY
LAYER MOISTURE HAS ONCE AGAIN LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOW
STRATUS AND PATCHY FOG ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...MOUNTAINS AND
PARTS OF THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN VALLEY. THIS FOG/CLOUD COVER WILL
LINGER UNTIL MID-MORNING...BEFORE DISSIPATING AS DAYTIME
HEATING/MIXING BEGINS. WITH THE FRONT WELL TO THE SOUTH AND
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...A DRY FORECAST IS IN STORE WITH THE
CONTINUED COOLER...POSTFRONTAL AIR MASS PROMOTING HIGHS IN THE MID
70S TO LOWER 80S. TONIGHT...THE MOISTURE IN PLACE MAY RESULT IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF SOME CLOUD COVER/FOG ONCE AGAIN AFTER MIDNIGHT...
WITH LOWS COMFORTABLY IN THE 50S.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
TRANQUIL WEATHER PATTERN SETTING UP AND VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH 12Z
MODEL RUNS. NW FLOW ALOFT AND ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT (DRY) EASES
THROUGH ON THURSDAY.

THE UPPER RIDGE TO OUR WEST SETTLES OVER THE CENTRAL AND SRN PLAINS 
FRIDAY...FLEXING NE INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY REGION SATURDAY...THEN  
SHORTWAVE ENERGY DROPS SE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY. 
THIS CARVES OUT AN UPPER TROUGH TO AFFECT OUR WEATHER GENERALLY FROM 
LATE SUNDAY INTO TUESDAY. THE LATEST ECMWF AND TO SOME DEGREE THE 
00Z GFS...SUPPORT CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...FOLLOWED 
BY DRY AND SLIGHTLY COOLER WEATHER MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. 

FORECAST GRIDS CHANGED VERY LITTLE...OTHER THAN A FEW MAX/MIN TEMP 
AJUSTMENTS. NUDGED MAX TEMPS UP ON THE WARMER DAYS...BUT STAYED JUST 
BELOW GFSX MOS ON DAYS FOLLOWING A FRONTAL PASSAGE. GAVE A BIT MORE 
RANGE IN MINS FROM CHA TO TRI ON A FEW NIGHTS...DUE TO DRY AIRMASS.

CONCERN IS HOW MUCH FOG/LOW CLOUDS DEVELOP BEHIND FRONT SINCE 
ADVECTION OF DRIER AIR IS WEAK. WILL CONTINUE TO CALL FOR LIFR 
CONDITIONS AT ALL TAF SITES DUE TO CEILINGS AT TYS/CHA AND FOG/LOW 
CLOUDS AT TRI.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY
THE COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE ITS SLOW MOVEMENT THROUGH THE FORECAST
AREA THROUGH LATE THIS AFTERNOON. POST FRONTAL CLOUDS WILL REMAIN
THICK THROUGH AT LEAST SUNSET. LOOK FOR SOME CLEARING TO TAKE PLACE
BEFORE PATCHY FOG DEVELOPS AND A LOWER CLOUD DECK DEVELOPS
OVERNIGHT. THESE CLOUDS MAY MAY INHIBIT THICKER FOG AND MAY ALSO
LIMIT OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPERATURES FROM DROPPING TERRIBLY LOW IF IT
WAS OTHERWISE CLEAR. WILL CONTINUE WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS
MAINLY OVER THE TN AND VA MOUNTAINS OVERNIGHT.

WEDNESDAY EXPECT FOG...WHERE IT DEVELOPS...TO CLEAR BY MID MORNING.
IT SHOULD BE A SPECTACULAR LATE SUMMER DAY WITH LIGHT NORTHERLY
WINDS AND BELOW SEASONAL TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...DRY CONDITIONS AND 
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES WILL REMAIN THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK 
WEEK AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN TO THE AREA. FLOW WILL BE FROM THE 
NORTH NORTHWEST, AND WITH A RIDGE OVER THE GREAT PLAINS DURING THIS 
TIME...WILL HAVE COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES. WENT A COUPLE OF 
DEGREES BELOW GUIDANCE FOR THE LOW TEMPERATURES...WITH THE SKY COVER 
AND TEMP ADVECTION...BUT STAYED WITH GUIDANCE FOR THE HIGHS. BY THE 
WEEKEND...A LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND MOVES 
TOWARDS THE GREAT LAKES. A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT LOW WILL 
THEN MOVE THROUGH THE AREA SUNDAY EVENING INTO THE MONDAY MORNING. 
MODELS HAVE DISAGREED TO THE STRENGTH OF THIS SYSTEM...BUT THE 
TIMING HAS BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT THROUGH THE PAST COUPLE OF MODEL 
RUNS. BEHIND THIS FRONT...A DEEP TROUGH WILL THEN SET UP WITH MUCH 
COLDER AIR MOVING INTO THE AREA. HAVE LOWERED TEMPS SEVERAL DEGREES 
BELOW NORMAL AT THE END OF THE PERIOD TO REFLECT THIS.

LINGERING LOW CLOUDS AND SOME VISBY REDUCTIONS DUE TO FOG. RAIN
SEEMS TO BE OVER FOR NOW...EXCEPT FOR PERHAPS SOME PATCHY DRIZZLE
WHERE THE LOWEST CEILINGS AND VISBYS ARE NOTED. 

FORECAST GRIDS WERE ON TRACK WITH ANOTHER CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN
AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING WEAK COLD FRONT. DEW POINT TEMPS REMAIN
QUITE HIGH ACROSS THE SRN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA (NEAR 70 DEGS
AT CHA)...SO I ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE
AFTERNOON HOURS.

A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS THIS EVENING OVER FAR ERN COUNTIES...
THEN DECREASING CLOUDS. BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE MAY BE SUFFICIENT
FOR AT LEAST PATCHY FOG ACROSS THE VALLEYS LATE TONIGHT. LOWERED
MAX TEMPS FOR TODAY TO MESH BETTER WITH NWS NEIGHBORS...GOING NEAR
OR JUST BELOW THE MOS BLEND. GFS MOS MINS WERE CONSISTENT FROM 12Z
DATA AND CLOSELY FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM.../WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL PREVAIL ALOFT WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY...
BEFORE AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO BUILD IN FOR
THE WEEKEND. INITIALLY...THIS DRY BUT COOL NORTHERLY FLOW /ALONG
WITH SOME VERY SUBTLE SHORTWAVES PASSING THROUGH THE AREA/ WILL
HELP TO REINFORCE THE COOLER AUTUMN-LIKE AIR MASS IN PLACE OVER THE
REGION. THIS SHOULD HELP TO KEEP TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES LOWER
THAN THEY NORMALLY MIGHT HAVE BEEN...AND SLIGHTLY BELOW GUIDANCE.
HOWEVER...GIVEN THE EXPECTED DRY CONDITIONS WITH A MOSTLY TO PARTLY
SUNNY SKY...DID NOT GET TOO CARRIED AWAY LOWERING THEM AND HAVE
MOST LOCATIONS REACHING THE MID 70S TO THE LOWER 80S. BY THE
WEEKEND... RIDGING AND THUS INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES/TEMPERATURES
ALOFT ALONG WITH CONTINUED DRY CONDITIONS WILL PROMOTE WARMER
TEMPERATURES AS WINDS VEER TO THE SOUTH AND EAST...PUSHING HIGHS IN
THE LOWER 80S IN MUCH OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. THE NEXT UPPER-
TROUGH AND COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE REGION SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...BRINGING THE ONLY SHOT FOR MEANINGFUL PRECIPITATION IN
OVER A WEEK. THERE ARE STILL SOME DIFFERENCES IN TIMING BETWEEN THE
MODELS...SO DID NOT GET OVERALLY SPECIFIC YET. HOWEVER...THE BEST
WINDOW LOOKS AS IF IT MAY BE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY ATTM.

MOIST AIRMASS OVER THE REGION...CIGS AND VISIBILITIES WERE SLOW TO
IMPROVE THIS MORNING. UPPER SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS WESTERN HALF OF
TN...WILL BE MOVING INTO REGION LATER THIS AFTERNOON...PLACED VCSH
IN ALL 3 SITES FOR LATTER PART OF AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING...THEN
SHORTWAVE WILL PASS AFTERWARDS...LEAVING MAIN ISSUE THE CIGS AND
ESPECIALLY VISIBILITIES OVERNIGHT. COLD FRONT APPROACHING FROM THE
WEST. ONLY A SUBTLE WIND SHIFT ON TUESDAY AS IT WASHES THROUGH. NOT
TAKING CIGS DOWN AS LOW OVERALL AS VEERING WINDS MAKE FOR LESS
ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE REGION AS COMPARED TO THIS MORNING. FOR
TRI...DID NOT GO AS LOW AS GUIDANCE ON THE VSBY DUE TO GOOD CHANCE
OF BLANKETING CIG THAT WILL SUPPRESS RADIATIONAL COOLING.

.DISCUSSION...
COOL AND MOIST AIR MASS CONTINUES ACROSS THE AREA THIS MORNING AS
ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE TOP OF THE OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY KEEPS A
STEADY FLOW OF CONDENSING MOISTURE...IN THE LOWEST 1000-2000 FEET.
SO CONDITIONS WILL BE SLOW TO IMPROVE. HOWEVER...CONDITIONS SHOULD
IMRPOVE THIS AFTERNOON AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PUSHES INTO THE
AREA...THAT SHOULD CAUSE SOME WEAK LIFT THAT WILL HELP TO COOL THE
TRAPPING INVERSION. THIS SHOULD ALLOW MORE VERTICAL MIXING AND HELP
DISPERSE THE MOISTURE THAT IS TRAPPED NEAR THE GROUND.
ADDITIONALLY...VEERING WINDS NEAR THE SURFACE SHOULD BEGIN TO BRING
IN WARMER AIR AT THE SURFACE. KEEPING THE SAME MAX TEMPERATURES
TODAY...BUT HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWED THE HOURLY WARMUP.

WITH THIS SHORTWAVE...WE SHOULD ALSO SEE SHOWERS FORMING DURING THE
AFTERNOON...WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
AREAS. HAVE A MENTION OF SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER AS FAR NORTH AS
KNOXVILLE.

COLD FRONT THAT IS HEADED THIS WAY IS STILL FAR TO THE
WEST...STRETCHING FROM NEAR GREEN BAY...TO KANSAS CITY...TO THE
OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE. BY SUNSET THE FRONT WILL ONLY BE APPROACHING
THE OHIO VALLEY...SO IT WILL NOT BE A PLAYER IN THE THUNDERSTORM
THREAT THIS AFTERNOON...BUT THE SHORTWAVE WILL OFFER SOME LIFT AS
MENTIONED BEFORE. STORMS WILL HAVE SOME SHEAR TO WORK WITH...BUT
VERY WEAK INSTABILITY. SHOWERS/STORMS WILL BE MOVING PRETTY
QUICKLY AS WELL...AS THE MID LEVEL WINDS INCREASE WITH THIS
SHORTWAVE.

FORECAST AREA. TEMPS HAVE FALLEN NICELY OVERNIGHT RESULTING IN SOME 
VERY PLEASANT TEMPS IN THE 50S NORTH TO MID 60S SOUTH. FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THESE CLOUDS WILL BE HARD TO SHAKE TODAY...SO I 
OPTED TO UNDERCUT THE WARMER GFS MOS MAXES AND STAY NEAR OR SLIGHTLY

MINS. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...DRY WEST TO NW FLOW STARTS
THIS PERIOD BUT QUICK MOISTENING AS INVERTED TROUGH DEVELOPS WEST
OF THE APPALACHIANS WITH WEAK RETURN FLOW AND WEAK INSTABILITY.
MAJOR SHORTWAVE MOVING INTO EASTERN US UPPER TROUGH AND RETURN
FLOW TO TRIGGER PRECIPITATION THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO

TROUGH LOCATED OVER THE AREA WILL KEEP MOISTURE IN THE LOW
LEVELS...AND CLOUD COVER MOSTLY OVERCAST THROUGH THE REST OF THE
AFTERNOON. WITH AN INVERSION IN PLACE...AND NO STRONG LIFTING
MECHANISM...HAVE LEFT ANY MENTION OF PRECIP OUT OF THE
GRIDS...EXCEPT IN THE MOUNTAINS WHERE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT

TEMPERATURES TONIGHT...WHICH SEEMS TO HANDLE THE CLOUD COVER WELL.
ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS FOR PATCHY FOG OVERNIGHT...AND
OVERCAST SKIES TO BEGIN THE DAY AGAIN ON SUNDAY. A SLIGHT CHANCE

USED FOR LIFTING. ONLY RAIN SHOWERS EXPECTED AS INSTABILITIES ARE
VERY LOW. WENT A DEGREE OR TWO UNDER GUIDANCE FOR SUNDAY TO ACCOUNT

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...THIS PERIOD BEGINS
SUNDAY EVENING WITH THE AREA AT THE SOUTH END OF A ZONAL
FLOW...SOUTH OF THE GREAT LAKES LOW AND JUST NORTH OF A SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE ALONG THE GULF COAST. WE CONTINUE ON THE COOL SIDE OF THE
FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO THE NORTH. HOWEVER...AS THE SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE BUILDS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS...AN INVERTED
TROUGH IS INDUCED THAT STARTS A WEAK RETURN FLOW ON MONDAY. STILL
LOOKS LIKE A RISK OF THUNDER ON MONDAY...MORESO SOUTH...AS THE WEAK
RETURN FLOW COMES UP THE VALLEY. THE INSTABILITY LOOKS WEAK...BUT
MODELS AGREE ON 30-40 KNOTS OF SHEAR MONDAY AFTERNOON...AS A QUICK
SHORTWAVE RACES THROUGH. SO COULD HAVE A FEW STRONGER
STORMS...SOUTH...WHEREAS INSTABILITY MAY BE TOO WEAK NORTH ...JUST
DEPENDS ON HOW FAR NORTH THE MOISTURE CAN PUSH ON A WEAK SWLY LOW
LEVEL FLOW.

THE INVERTED TROUGH QUICKLY FADES AS A STRONGER LEE TROUGH FORMS ON 
TUESDAY EAST OF THE APPS.  THE NEXT COLD FRONT WASHES THROUGH THE 
AREA LATE MONDAY NIGHT OR EARLY TUESDAY AS WELL...WITH LITTLE TO NO 
FORCING ALONG IT.  ONCE THIS FRONT GOES THROUGH DRIER AIR STARTS TO 
PUSH INTO THE AREA. 

FOR THE REST OF THE PERIOD THE AREA IS UNDER A NORTHWEST FLOW...BUT 
THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY STAYS SOUTH OF THE AREA...MOISTURE STAYS SOUTH 
OR WEST...AND ANY DISTURBANCES IN THE FLOW LOOK VERY WEAK RIGHT 
NOW...SO KEEPING THE REST OF THE PERIOD DRY EXCEPT FOR SLIGHT 
CHANCES FOR SHOWERS IN THE EASTERN AND NORTHEASTERN MOUNTAINS.  WENT

LOWERED PRECIP CHANCES FOR THE REST OF THE MORNING AND EARLY
AFTERNOON...AS THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ENOUGH FORCING TO GENERATE
SHOWER ACTIVITY. ALSO...DUE TO THE CLOUD COVER REMAINING OVER THE
AREA...HAVE LOWERED TEMPS A COUPLE OF DEGREES TODAY. OTHERWISE
CLOUDY AND MOSTLY STABLE AIR THROUGH THE DAY TODAY AS THE LOW

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS WOULD 
PLACE AN INVERTED TROUGH AXIS ACROSS SW NC TO NE TN/SW VA...WITH 
WEAK SURFACE LOW PRESSURE OVER NRN GA. THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT 
APPEARS TO LIE JUST SOUTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA. RADAR TRENDS THIS 
MORNING HAVE BEEN FOR A GRADUAL INCREASE IN SHOWERS OVER NE TN AND 
SW VA...WHILE A MORE SOLID AREA OF SHOWERS CONTINUES TO MOVE EAST 
AWAY FROM THE APPALACHIANS. 

THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SHOULD BE MOVING EAST AND NORTHEAST LATER 
TODAY...WHICH SHOULD LIMIT SHOWERS (SLIGHT CHANCE OF TSRA AFTERNOON) 
TO THIS MORNING IN GENERAL. POP AND WEATHER FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS WERE 
ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY TO LOWER RAIN CHANCES OVER WRN PARTS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA FOR TODAY...AND THEN TO SHOW A FASTER DECREASE FOR
TONIGHT. CLOUDS MAY NOT CLEAR OUT COMPLETELY WITH A GOOD
POSSIBILITY OF LOWER CLOUDS LINGERING OR RE-DEVELOPING.

OTHERWISE...WENT JUST BELOW THE MILDER GFS MOS MAX TEMPS FOR TODAY 
GIVEN THE CLOUDINESS EARLY AND THEN SLIGHT COOLING BEHIND THE COLD 
FRONT BY THIS AFTERNOON. NUDGED UP SKY COVER FOR MOST AREAS TONIGHT
WHICH SUPPORTS THE SLIGHTLY WARMER 00Z MOS MINS.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT
SHOULD BE TO THE SOUTH WITH A WEAK INVERTED TROUGH STILL LYING OVER
THE EAST TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TRAPPING LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE OVER EAST TN SUNDAY. NAM MODEL WANTS TO KEEP THE MOISTURE
OVER AT LEAST THE EASTERN AREAS SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT WITH THE
GFS AND ECMWF SOMEWHAT DRIER. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE JUST TO THE NW
OVER THE OHIO AND WEST TN VALLEYS. WEAK SHORTWAVE ENERGY IN
WESTERLY FLOW COULD TRIGGER A FEW SHOWERS SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT
MAINLY EAST. MONDAY ANOTHER SURGE OF MOISTURE RIDES UP AND OVER THE
FRONT AS LOW PRESSURE MOVES NORTHEAST ALONG THE FRONT. THIS COULD
TRIGGER MORE SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS. ANOTHER WEAK FRONT
SHIFTS SOUTHEAST FROM THE CENTRAL US LATE MONDAY INTO THE TN VALLEY
EARLY TUESDAY AND WEAKENS. WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT KEPT
EASTERN AREAS WITH BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS...CONTINUING WEDNESDAY
NIGHT. KEPT THURSDAYS POPS EXTREME EAST AND DRY THURSDAY NIGHT AND
FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES STAY NEAR NORMAL THROUGH TUESDAY THEN SLIGHTLY
COOLER WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AS UPPER TROUGH DIGS SOUTH OVER THE

PLACE THE COLD FRONT FROM NEAR THE KY-VA LINE SW INTO NRN MIDDLE
TN. FRONTOGENETIC FORCING DOES INCREASE DURING THE AFTERNOON AS THE
FRONT SLIPS SE...AND THE FRONT SHOULD END UP JUST SOUTH AND EAST OF
THE APPALACHIANS AFTER MIDNIGHT. PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER GRIDS
GENERALLY LOOKED ON TRACK WITH TSRA CHANCES SOMEWHAT LIMITED. 

HOWEVER...I DID LOWER MAX TEMPS FOR TODAY DOWN BY A FEW DEGREES
GIVEN THE HIGH POPS PLUS CLOUDS AND SOME MORNING FOG. ALSO...I
OPTED TO LOWER POPS FROM THE WEST AFTER 06Z SATURDAY AND KEPT TYPE
AS JUST SHOWERS. 

OTHERWISE...THE PATCHY AREAS OF FOG ARE LOCALLY DENSE WHERE LESS
CLOUD COVER WAS NOTED EARLIER THIS MORNING. WILL HIGHLIGHT THE FOG

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL
CONTINUE TO OVERSPREAD THE FORECAST AREA LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING ALONG AND AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT PRESENTLY STRETCHING FROM
SOUTHEAST KENTUCKY INTO WEST TENNESSEE. THE PARTIAL CLEARING THAT
HAS OCCURRED OVER MUCH OF THE PLATEAU AND CENTRAL/SOUTHERN VALLEY
HAS ALLOWED FOR AN INSTABILITY AXIS TO DEVELOP. THIS MAY SUPPORT
SOME LOCALIZED STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH
SUNSET AS CAPE VALUES HAVE INCREASED TO AROUND 2000 J/KG. THIS
COMBINED WITH SOME DECENT SHEAR COULD LEAD TO SOME MODEST
CLUSTERS/LINE SEGMENTS WITH THIS ACTIVITY. AN ISOLATED DAMAGING
WIND THREAT WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THESE AREAS ESPECIALLY THROUGH
SUNSET. HOWEVER...THE PRIMARY CONCERN WITH THIS ACTIVITY CONTINUES
TO BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND PERHAPS THE THREAT FOR LOCALIZED
FLASH FLOODING.

DEWPOINTS IN THE EARLY TO MID AFTERNOON ARE IN THE LOW TO MID 
70S...AND PWATS IN THE 2.0 TO 2.25 INCH RANGE /ABOUT 2 TO 3 STANDARD 
DEVIATIONS ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR/. ADDITIONALLY... WITH 
SOUNDING PROFILES EXHIBITING TALL/SKINNY CAPES...A DEEP WARM CLOUD 
AND MEAN FLOW MOVING PARALLEL TO THE SLOW MOVING FRONTAL BOUNDARY... 
A SET-UP FOR TRAINING CELLS AND THUS A LOCALIZED FLOODING/HEAVY 
RAINFALL WILL EXIST THROUGH THE EVENING AND PART OF THE OVERNIGHT 
HOURS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE 850 MB INFLOW INTO THE BOUNDARY 
IS MUCH STRONGER TO THE SOUTH AND WEST...AND SO THE THREAT OF 
FLOODING WILL BE LOCALIZED. THUS...WILL HOLD OFF ON A WATCH BUT WILL 
MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF FLOODING IN THE HWO. 

THE FRONT WILL SAG SOUTH INTO THE REGION OVERNIGHT INTO THE DAY ON 
FRIDAY AND WASH OUT SOMEWHAT. STILL...MODELS DO INDICATE 
PRECIPITATION DEVELOPMENT OCCURRING ALONG THE BOUNDARY WHICH SHOULD 
BE ORIENTED ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHERN VALLEY FOR MUCH OF THE 
DAY. HOWEVER...HOW FAR NORTH AND WEST THESE SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
STORMS WILL GO REMAINS IN QUESTION. FOR NOW...HAVE LIKELY POPS 
CLOSEST TO THE BOUNDARY AND SOLID CHANCE POPS FURTHER TO THE NORTH 
AND WEST. WITH THE CLOUD COVER IN PLACE...HIGHS IN THE UPPER 70S TO 
LOWER 80S SEEMS PLAUSIBLE THOUGH IT WILL FEEL VERY HUMID ONCE AGAIN 
GIVEN THE MOISTURE RICH ATMOSPHERE. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)... FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
SATURDAY MORNING...AN INVERTED TROUGH WILL BE LOCATED ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS PRODUCING LIKELY CHANCE OF RAIN NEAR THE NORTH 
CAROLINA=TENNESSEE STATE-LINE WITH LESSER CHANCES TOWARD THE 
PLATEAU. THIS INVERTED TROUGH IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER JET 
PLACING MOVING ACROSS THE AREA INVOKING PRESSURE FALLS OVER THE AREA.

A ZONAL FLOW IS EXPECTED FOR MOST OF THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT 
WEEK UNTIL A SHORT-WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT A LAKES LATE 
MONDAY/TUESDAY. A SERIES OF WEAK SHORT-WAVES WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
AREA UNDER THE FAST FLOW HELPING TO KEEP A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH OVER 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. WILL MAINTAIN SLIGHT CHANCE/CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS/POSSIBLY THUNDERSTORMS WITH BEST CHANCES OVER THE EASTERN 
SECTIONS.

UPPER FLOW WILL BECOME NORTHWEST AS A MORE SUBSTANTIAL SHORT-WAVE 
MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES BY TUESDAY.  AS FOR TEMPERATURES...WILL 
GO A DEGREE OR TWO LOWER THAN GUIDANCE HIGHS AND CLOSE TO MINS GIVEN 
PAST PERFORMANCE.

VALLEY TODAY. AHEAD OF THE FRONT...A VERY MOISTURE LADEN
ATMOSPHERE IS IN PLACE...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S AND PWAT
VALUES PROGGED TO INCREASE 2 TO 2.25 INCHES BY THIS AFTERNOON. SOME
LOW CLOUDS ARE LINGERING ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING...AND COULD
PERSIST THROUGH MOST OF THE DAY. HOWEVER...SOME BREAKS ARE
EXPECTED TO OCCUR BY EARLY TO MID AFTERNOON WHICH WILL ALLOW
TEMPERATURES TO RISE INTO THE LOW TO MIDDLE 80S AND HELP TO
INCREASE INSTABILITY ACROSS THE REGION. A BULK OF THE PRECIPITATION
IS STILL OFF TO OUR WEST OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE IN THE FORM OF A
BROAD SHIELD OF RAIN. THIS IS PROGGED TO BREAK UP AS IT APPROACHES
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU EARLY AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...SHOULD THE
ATMOSPHERE DESTABILIZE AS PROGGED BY THE MODELS SOME CONVECTION
WILL DEVELOP...BOTH ALONG THE FRONT OVER SW VIRGINIA AND NE
TENNESSEE AND DIURNALLY ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEYS.

MESOSCALE MODELS IN PARTICULAR ARE SHOWING SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS /SOME ORGANIZED/ TO DEVELOP BY EARLY
AFTERNOON. WITH CAPE VALUES ON THE KCHA/KTYS NAM SOUNDING SHOWN TO
BE AOA 1000-1500 J/KG...SOME STORM ORGANIZATION AND THUS AN
ISOLATED DAMAGING WIND THREAT WILL BE POSSIBLE. HOWEVER...THE
PRIMARY CONCERN WITH THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL
AND LOCALIZED FLOODING GIVEN THE AFOREMENTIONED HIGH PWAT VALUES
WHICH ARE CLIMATOLOGICALLY HIGH. COMBINE THIS WITH SOUNDING
PROFILES EXHIBITING TALL/SKINNY CAPES...A DEEP WARM CLOUD AND MEAN
FLOW MOVING PARALLEL TO THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY...AND A SET-UP FOR
TRAINING CELLS AND THUS FLOODING/HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE.
THUS...WILL MONITOR THE POTENTIAL FOR THE NEED OF A FLASH FLOOD
WATCH FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND ESPECIALLY THIS EVENING AS THE FRONT
MOVES INTO THE REGION.

CENTERED OVER LAKE MICHIGAN...WITH ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT
EXTENDING SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY. RADAR AND
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEAL A SOLID LINE OF CONVECTION OVER SOUTHERN
ILLINOIS AND CENTRAL INDIANA AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT. SCATTERED
HIGH CLOUDS WERE PRESENTLY OCCURRING OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS
EVENING...WITH ADDITIONAL HIGH CLOUDS FROM THE CONVECTION OVER THE
MID WEST EXPECTED TO INCREASE OVER THE FORECAST AREA AFTER
MIDNIGHT. OUTFLOW FROM THIS CONVECTION MAY ALSO TRIGGER SOME
ISOLATED CONVECTION OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BEFORE SUNRISE.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT
WILL UPDATE THIS EVENING TO MENTION INCREASING CLOUDINESS. WILL NOT
PLAN TO MENTION ANY FOG OVERNIGHT DUE TO THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN 
OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TONIGHT WITH A COLD FRONT APPRAOCHING 
FROM THE NW LATE ON THURSDAY. THE COLD FRONT WILL BE PUSHED ALONG BY 
A WESTERLY JET SEGEMNT ACROSS THE LOWER OH VALLEY. WARM TEMPERATURES 
AGAIN TONIGHT WITH A SLIGHT RISE IN THICKNESS VALUES. WARM 
TEMPERATURES ON THURSDAY WILL BE MODERATED BY INCREASING CLOUD COVER 
AND THE ARRIVAL OF PRECIPITATION BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON. PWAT VALUES 
ARE HIGH INCREASING TO NEAR 2.00. THE WARM LAYER IS ALSO DEEP SO 
HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE THE MAIN THREAT WITH THE IMPENDING 
CONVECTION. INSTABILITY AND LIFT ARE LOW TO MODERATURE SO STRONG 
GUSTY WINDS ARE POSSIBLE WITH THE AFTERNOON CONVECTION. 

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/... A COLD FRONT WILL 
CONTINUE TO PUSH INTO THE REGION THURSDAY NIGHT... BRINGING 
SCATTERED TO WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA. SOME OF THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY COULD BE STRONG TO LOCALLY 
SEVERE INITIALLY AS IT PUSHES INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AROUND 00Z. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE LIMITED 
INSTABILITY AND SYNOPTIC LIFT...THE PRIMARY IMPACT FROM THIS 
ACTIVITY MAY SIMPLY BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL /WHICH WILL BE AIDED 
BY THE ABUNDANT MOISTURE/HIGH PWATS IN PLACE/. OVERNIGHT...THIS 
ACTIVITY WILL BEGIN TO GRADUALLY WEAKEN AND DISSIPATE AS THE FRONT  
SLOWLY SINKS SOUTH AND BEGINS TO WASH OUT. HOWEVER...WITH THIS WEAK 
BOUNDARY IN PLACE...SCATTERED AFTERNOON CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE 
AGAIN ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...THOUGH COVERAGE WILL BE MORE LIMITED 
GIVEN THE DIFFUSE NATURE OF THE FRONT. THE PRIMARY SYNOPTIC WAVE/ 
TROUGH WILL PUSH THROUGH ON SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...WHICH WILL 
USHER IN A STRONGER COLD FRONT AND A COOLER EARLY-AUTUMN AIR MASS 
INTO THE REGION. TEMPERATURES NEXT WEEK WILL BE NOTABLY COOLER AND 
PEAK INTO THE MID 70S TO LOWER 80S BY THE END OF THE PERIOD. SOME 
ADDITIONAL SHORTWAVES MAY ALSO BRING SOME SLIGHT CHANCES FOR 
PRECIPITATION TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE NEW WORK WEEK...BUT A COOLER

EARLY TO MIDDLE PART OF THE NEXT WEEK.

FRONT DURING THURSDAY AND FRIDAY TIME FRAME. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF 
MODELS SHOW THIS COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...NOT MUCH CHANGE IN THE AIR MASS 
OVER THE REGION FOR THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. EXPECT SOME LOW CLOUDS TO 
BE AROUND FOR THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY...THEN WITH INCREASING 
SUNSHINE EXPECT A VERY WARM AFTERNOON.  ENOUGH INSTABILITY EXPECTED 
TO WARRANT SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON INTO EARLY EVENING.  MAV TEMPS LOOK 
REASONABLE FOR THE MOST PART...SO JUST SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...DIURNAL CONVECTION POSSIBLE 
ACROSS THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY EVENING.  THEN...A FEW 
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAY DEVELOP OVERNIGHT AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT.  THIS COLD FRONT WILL BE THE MAIN WEATHER 
CONCERN FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD.  TIMING IS IN QUESTION WITH THE NAM 
THE FASTEST BRINING ASSOCIATED CONVECTION THROUGH THURSDAY INTO 
THURSDAY EVENING AND THEN DROPPING THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO OUR 
SOUTH.  THE GFS AND ECMWF ARE A BIT SLOWER...BRINGING THE MAIN BAND 
OF ASSOCIATED CONVECTION THROUGH LATE THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE MAP SHOWS AN 
INVERTED TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
TO THE NORTHEAST AND A SURFACE LOW ALONG THE SE COAST FROM GA INTO 
SC. ACROSS NORTHEAST SECTIONS EASTERLY FLOW WAS BRINGING IN SLIGHTLY 
DRIER AIR MASS WITH DEW POINTS IN THE LOWER TO MID 60S. LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE WAS SLOW TO CLEAR OUT FROM CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEYS. 
SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WERE DEVELOPING MAINLY ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHERN PLATEAU. LIKE YESTERDAY EXPECT A 
LITTLE MORE COVERAGE LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS. ADDED PATCHY FOG FOR FORECAST AREA TO LATE NIGHT HOURS AS 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS HIGH. TONIGHT STORMS SHOULD DIE DOWN 
QUICKLY AFTER 00Z SO KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE. TUESDAY DRIER AIR MASS 
SETTLES OVER REGION. KEPT DAY DRY THROUGH 18Z AND AFTERNOON 
CONVECTION MAINLY PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS WITH VALLEYS DRY. MAV 
GUIDANCE LOOKS TOO LOW TONIGHT EXCEPT NORTH SO WENT FOR MAV/MET 
BLEND CENTRAL AND SOUTH WITH POSSIBLE LOW CLOUDS LATE. FOR HIGHS 
TUESDAY PREFER HIGHER MAV HIGHS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...WITH THE MAIN FEATURE BEING THE PASSAGE OF A STRONG COLD 
FRONT ON THURSDAY. ISOLATED DIURNAL CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE 
AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY...AS A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPS OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS THEN SHOW A STRONG 
COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING...WITH A GOOD COVERAGE OF CONVECTION DEVELOPING AHEAD OF IT 
AS A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. 
THIS COLD FRONT WILL LIKELY BE SLOW TO MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA ON FRIDAY...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES NEARLY PARALLEL TO 
THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THUS...WILL LEAVE SOME LOW CHANCE POPS IN THE 
FORECAST ON FRIDAY...AND AGAIN ON SATURDAY AS AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT 
WAVE SWINGS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH 
TEMPS COOLING BACK DOWN TO NEAR NORMAL LEVELS FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. 
AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WEAK INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH 
OVER THE AREA WILL PERSIST FOR MUCH OF THE SHORT TERM PERIOD.  WHILE 
FORCING LOOKS WEAK...IT APPEARS THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY 
TO WARRANT CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ALL ZONES FOR 
TODAY. WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS INTO THE EVENING 
HOURS...THEN DRY LATER TONIGHT. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE...SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE TREND TOWARD A PERIOD OF 
DRIER WEATHER WITH UPPER RIDGING GRADUALLY BUILDING INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION CONTINUES AND THEREFORE WAS ABLE TO 
CONTINUE TO PULL BACK ON PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION BOTH TUESDAY 
AND WEDNESDAY...LIMITING THE POSSIBILITY OF RAIN TO AN ISOLATED 
SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THE MOUNTAINS 
BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA. FOR THURSDAY THE MODELS ARE CONVERGING ON 
AN AFTERNOON ARRIVAL OF CONVECTION WITH THE SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT 
WHICH WILL BRING COOLER...MORE SEASONAL TEMPERATURES FOR MID 
SEPTEMBER TO THE REGION THROUGH THE WEEKEND. TRIED TO ADJUST LIKELY 
POPS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH THE FRONT TO A 2 PM THROUGH 
8 PM PERIOD FOLLOWED BY A RATHER LENGTHY PERIOD OF CHANCE POPS FOR 
SHOWERS WELL INTO FRIDAY EVENING WITH THE ECMWF AND CANADIAN HINTING 
AT A SLOWING OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AS UPPER LEVEL ENERGY BUILDS 
BACK INTO THE CENTER OF THE NATION FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY. THE GFS HAS 
BEEN GRADUALLY MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION DURING THE PAST COUPLE DAYS 
BUT STILL IS MORE PROGRESSIVE WITH THE LATE WEEK ACTION AND HAS LESS 
AMPLIFICATION WITH THE MID AMERICA SHORT WAVE. MAINTAINED THE PAST 
COUPLE DAYS FORECAST IDEOLOGY FOLLOWING THE CONCEPT OF PESSIMISM 
WITH A FEW MORE CLOUDS AND CHANCE POPS FOR A FEW SHOWERS THROUGH 
FRIDAY NIGHT. FORECAST CONFIDENCE SOMEWHAT LOWER THAN USUAL FOR THE 
WEEKEND WITH MODELS INDICATING THERE COULD BE YET ANOTHER SHORT WAVE 
ENTERING THE PICTURE WITH DEVELOPMENT OF AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. FOR NOW WILL KEEP AN OPTIMISTIC 
FORECAST GOING WITH DRY WEATHER ALONG WITH SOME SUNSHINE SATURDAY 
AND SUNDAY AWAITING BETTER FOCUS IN FUTURE MODEL RUNS. STAYED A FEW

THE WEAK FRONT TO OUR NORTH AND WEST TODAY MAY MAKE SLIGHT SOUTHWARD 
PROGRESS TONIGHT. CLOUDS NEAR THE FRONT THIS AFTERNOON WILL LIKELY 
STAY IN PLACE THROUGH THE NIGHT IN SW VA AND THE NORTHERN 
PLATEAU...BUT THE SHALLOW LAYER OF MOISTURE SHOULD NOT RESULT IN 
PRECIP. CLEARING TO THE SOUTH OF THE CLOUDS SHOULD RESULT IN SOME 
FOG DEVELOPMENT. TOMORROW THE FRONT IS MORE DIFFUSE...AND THE NAM 
DEVELOPS SOME AFTERNOON SHOWERS ALONG THE PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS. 
THERE IS SOME WEAK INSTABILITY BUT VERY LITTLE FORCING TO ENHANCE 
LIFT. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS IN THE TERRAIN AREAS WITH A SLIGHT 
CHANCE IN THE VALLEY. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
MOISTURE ADVECTION WILL REMAIN THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK AS A
COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA AT THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. A
SLIGHT CHANCE OF DIURNAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE
ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...MAINLY ALONG THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. A BUILDING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BRING THE
FRONT TO THE AREA BY THURSDAY. MODELS HAVE BEEN IN STRONG AGREEMENT
FOR THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS THAT THE FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THURSDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. CONFIDENCE IS HIGH ON RAIN CHANCES THURSDAY.
HOWEVER...MODELS STILL IN DISAGREEMENT ON WHEN RAIN WILL EXIT THE
AREA. GFS IS STILL HANGING ON TO THE CHANCE OF RAIN FRIDAY...WHILE
ECMWF IS JUST TOO EXCITED ABOUT RAIN THROUGH THE REST OF THE
WEEKEND AND INTO THE NEXT WORK WEEK. HAVE GONE WITH THE GFS SINCE
IT HAS BEEN THE MOST CONSISTENT...BUT STAYED PESSIMISTIC AND KEPT
SLIGHT CHANCE IN THROUGH THE EVENING FRIDAY. THE WIND PROFILE WITH
THIS FRONT THURSDAY IS A BIT WEAK...AND INSTABILITIES ARE LOW.
LOOKS LIKE THE BIGGEST THREAT WITH THIS FRONT IS HEAVY RAIN WITH
THE HIGH PW VALUES EXPECTED. TEMPERATURES LOOK TO BE NEAR NORMAL
THROUGH THE WORK WEEK...AND DROP TO A COUPLE OF DEGREES BELOW
NORMAL BEHIND THE FRONT.

BACKED OFF A BIT ON POPS FOR WEDNESDAY LEAVING JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE 
FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM OVER THE PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS 
BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA WITH ANY ORGANIZED FOCUS FOR PRECIPITATION 
LACKING. BY THURSDAY A STRONGER STORM SYSTEM WILL BE MOVING INTO THE 
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. MODELS GENERALLY AGREE THAT A COLD FRONT WILL BE 
DROPPING SOUTHEAST INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THURSDAY INTO 
THURSDAY NIGHT. THERE ARE STILL SOME MINOR TIMING ISSUES BUT IT 
APPEARS THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE THURSDAY AFTERNOON INTO 
THURSDAY EVENING FOR THE MRX FORECAST AREA. THE STRONGER WIND FIELD 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM COULD ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS. STILL HAD TO HOLD ONTO CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS 
ON FRIDAY AS THE UPPER LEVEL STEERING PARALLELS THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
WHICH COULD SLOW THE BOUNDARY DOWN. KEPT ANY PRECIP OUT OF THE 
FORECAST ON SATURDAY AS DRIER AIR SHOULD BE IN PLACE BY THAT TIME.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
A LINE OF SHOWERS HAS DEVELOPED ALONG A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH ACROSS 
MIDDLE TN AND ERN KY. THE BEST UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT AND INSTABILITY 
IS JUST NORTH OF OUR AREA...SO IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE LINE OF 
STORMS WILL BE BEST MAINTAINED ACROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF OUR AREA 
THROUGH THE EVENING...AND WEAKEN IN SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL PORTIONS 
WHERE OBSERVED SURFACE WINDS ARE DIFFLUENT. DYNAMIC FORCING IS
WEAK WITH THE TROUGH IN OUR AREA...LIKELY TOO WEAK TO MAINTAIN
SHOWERS AFTER MIDNIGHT AFTER DAYTIME HEATING IS LOST...SO WILL DROP
POPS BACK SHARPLY AFTER THAT TIME. THE COLD FRONT ITSELF WILL PUSH
SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH THE AREA ON SUNDAY. SOME SHOWERS COULD
DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE FRONT ACROSS SOUTHERN AND EASTERN
PORTIONS...MAINLY IN THE AFTERNOON...BUT EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER THAT
IS EXPECTED IN THE MORNING WILL PREVENT MUCH DESTABILIZATION...AND
A N-NW FLOW THROUGH THE LOW LEVELS WILL NOT BE CONDUCIVE TO
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT...AT LEAST OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAINS. WILL HAVE
JUST LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EAST AND SOUTH TOMORROW...WITH
TEMPERATURES A LITTLE COOLER THAN MOS GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
BEHIND THE FRONT THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...A SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE
THROUGH THE AREA BRINGING A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY ALONG THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. TUESDAY HAS A
HIGHER PRESSURE IN STORE WITH PRECIP CHANCES LIMITED. WEDNESDAY IS
EXPECTED TO HAVE ENOUGH MOISTURE ADVECTION AND INSTABILITY FOR
INCREASED CHANCES OF DIURNAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THEN MARKS THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEXT COLD FRONT TO
MOVE THROUGH THE AREA. A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DEVELOP
AND SLOWLY MOVE NORTHEAST THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES THROUGH THE END
OF THE WORK WEEK. MODELS STILL IN AGREEMENT FOR THE MAIN FRONTAL
BOUNDARY TO MOVE THROUGH THE REGION THURSDAY EVENING...WITH SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING AHEAD OF THIS FRONT. GFS IS STILL
QUICK TO MOVE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH THE ECMWF WANTING TO
STAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. HAVE AGAIN TRENDED MORE TOWARDS GFS WITH
ITS CONSISTENT THEME. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR NORMAL THROUGH THE
WORK WEEK...AND BEHIND THE FRONT TEMPS WILL DROP TO BELOW NORMAL AS
A DEEP TROUGH SETTLES OVER THE EASTERN CONUS BRINGING NORTHERN AIR
TO THE FORECAST AREA.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE OHIO

CONVECTION TO DEVELOP ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT ESPECIALLY AFTER 
18Z...PERSISTING TIL AROUND 03Z BEFORE DIURNALLY DIMINISHING 
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. A WARM AND HUMID DAY TODAY WITH VALLEY HIGHS IN 
THE MID TO UPPER 80S WITH DEWPOINTS AROUND 70. WITH COMPRESSIONAL

PERSISTENT AFTERNOON SUNSHINE MAY SQUIRT UP TO LOWER 90S. NOT 
EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF SEVERE WEATHER AT THIS TIME BEYOND THE

UP TOWARD THE NORTHEAST PART OF THE COUNTRY.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...EVEN THOUGH THE CALENDAR SAY'S 
IT IS SEPTEMBER...TYPICALLY ONE OF THE DRIEST MONTHS OF THE 
YEAR...IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WON'T BE ANY EXTENDED DRY SPELLS IN THIS 
FORECAST. THE JET STREAM STAYS GENERALLY ACTIVE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY 
WITH A HINT OF CONTINUED ACTION ON TUESDAY. SATURDAY'S COLD FRONT 
SLIPS SOUTH OF THE REGION BY SUNDAY MORNING BUT A SHORT WAVE TROUGH 
INDUCES A WAVE OF LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE BOUNDARY SLOWING ITS 
PROGRESS WHILE ANOTHER SHORT WAVE RIDES ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY ON 
MONDAY . THE MODELS SUGGEST THE MRX FORECAST AREA WILL BE ON THE 
EDGE OF DEEPER MOISTURE OVER THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES DURING THIS 
PERIOD. THESE UPPER TROFS WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY LIFT TO 
GENERATE A FEW SHOWERS AND EVEN A THUNDERSTORM OR TWO...MAINLY OVER 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER CLOSER TO THE 
DEEPER MOISTURE. TRIED TO BACK OFF ON PRECIP CHANCES TUESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY AS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION AWAITS THE ARRIVAL OF A 
STRONGER STORM SYSTEM DUE IN THE REGION SOMETIME LATER THURSDAY INTO 
FRIDAY. MODEL FORECASTS INDICATE A RATHER AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH AND 
STRONGER COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY BUILDS THROUGH THE REGION DURING THIS 
LATE PORTION OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST GENERATING WIDESPREAD SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS. TWEAKED POPS UP A BIT FOR THIS SYSTEM WITH THE 
ECMWF AND GFS EACH AGREEING ON THE STRENGTH OF THE STORM SYSTEM. 
TIMING IS A LITTLE OFF BETWEEN THE MODELS BUT SHOULD COME INTO 
BETTER FOCUS IN SUBSEQUENT FORECASTS.

FRONT TOWARD OUR AREA. UNTIL THEN...A MOIST AIR MASS WILL LINGER

INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE ADVECTION FOR DIURNAL SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS EACH AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR NORMAL

FRONT PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK
WEEK. MODELS IN FAIRLY DECENT AGREEMENT FOR TIMING OF THE FRONT
MOVING THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...BUT DIFFER ON THE

SET UP OVER THE AREA BEHIND THIS FRONT. THE AIRMASS DOES NOT YEILD
MUCH CHANGE IN THE WAY OF COOLER TEMPERATURES SUNDAY THROUGH THE
END OF THE PERIOD. BUT DOES HAVE DRIER AIR ADVECTED IN THE
MIDLEVELS. THIS ALONG WITH THE AFTERNOON HEATING...EXPECTING TO SEE
DIURNAL THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY. UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE
TO INCREASE THROUGH THIS PERIOD...SO WILL ONLY SEE PARTLY CLOUDY
SKIES FOR A DAY OR TWO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK WEEK. THE NEXT
BIG FEATURE MOVING INTO THE AREA IS ANOTHER COLD FRONT SET TO MOVE
IN TOWARDS THE END OF NEXT WEEK. MODELS DIFFER ON TIMING AND
STRENGTH OF THIS SYSTEM...SO SETTLED FOR CHANCE POPS THURSDAY AND
FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A COUPLE OF DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL FOR
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER PATTERN SINCE
YESTERDAY. EAST TN REMAINS IN A VERY MOIST AIR MASS WITH A MIDLEVEL
SHEAR/DEFORMATION ZONE ALOFT. ONE SLIGHT CHANGE IS THAT SURFACE
DEWPOINTS ARE A LITTLE HIGHER TODAY ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS. THE
LATEST SHORT TERM MODELS POINT TOWARD GREATER COVERAGE OF
CONVECTION IN NORTHERN AREAS TODAY...AND WILL MAKE SOME SLIGHT
ADJUSTMENTS TO AFTERNOON/EVENING POPS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. HIGH PW
CONTENT AND SLOW STORM MOVEMENT COULD RESULT IN LOCALLY HEAVY
RAINFALL...BUT THE INSTABILITY AND SHEAR APPEAR TOO LOW TO SUPPORT
ANY THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS. FORECAST HIGHS TEMPS APPEAR REASONABLY
ON TRACK.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FOR THIS MORNING...ENOUGH BREAKS
IN THE MID-LEVEL CLOUDS...CALM WINDS AND WET GROUND WILL ALLOW
PATCHY DENSE FOG TO DEVELOP.

A WEAK SHEAR AXIS WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE AREA TODAY WITH THE MAIN
STORY BEING PERSISTENT PLUME OF TROPICAL MOISTURE OVER THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. GFS AND NAM SHOW WEAK BOUNDARY LAYER CONVERGENCE OVER
EAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TODAY WHICH WILL HELP FOCUS
THE RICH MOISTURE.

ENOUGH BREAKS TODAY TO ALLOW FOR MARGINAL INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE
SCATTERED TO BROKEN AREAS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. MAIN
CONCERN WILL BE THE LOCAL TORRENTIAL RAINS WITH LOCALIZED FLASH
FLOODING POSSIBLE. WILL HIGHLIGHT IN THE HWO.

CONVECTION WILL BE MAINLY DIURNAL IN NATURE WITH COVERAGE AND
INTENSITY OF STORMS DIMINISHING QUICKLY AFTER SUNSET.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WITH 
THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT FEATURE AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA BEING A 
WEAK COLD FRONT ON SATURDAY. AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AND HUMID AIR MASS 
WILL LINGER OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...WITH SCATTERED 
CONVECTION DEVELOPING AGAIN...ESPECIALLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING HOURS. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS THEN REVEAL A BROAD AND 
FAIRLY FLAT UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION BY FRIDAY NIGHT...WHICH WILL HELP PUSH A WEAK COLD FRONT INTO 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON SATURDAY. THIS COLD FRONT SHOULD GENERATE A 
BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY... 
AS A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPS AHEAD OF IT. TEMPS AND 
DEWPOINTS ARE EXPECTED TO ONLY SLIGHTLY DECREASE BEHIND THIS FRONTAL 
PASSAGE ON SUNDAY...WITH UNSEASONABLY WARM CONDITIONS LINGERING 
THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. ISOLATED CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE 
TO POSSIBLE EACH DAY AFTER THE FRONTAL PASSAGE...AS A MARGINALLY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS CONTINUES TO DEVELOP EACH AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
THE APPALACHIAN REGION WILL CONTINUE TO BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A 
MOIST AIR MASS PINCHED BETWEEN AN OFFSHORE RIDGE AND A RIDGE OVER 
THE OZARK REGION. STORMS HAVE BEGUN TO DEVELOP NEAR THE GA 
BORDER...AND WITH SLOW MOVEMENT IN THE MOIST AIR MASS...LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE. MOST ACTIVITY SHOULD REMAIN SOUTH OF 
KNOXVILLE WHERE THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS SHOW BETTER INSTABILITY 
TROUGH THE AFTERNOON/EVENING. STORMS SHOULD DISSIPATE BY MIDNIGHT AS 
DAYTIME HEATING IS LOST. SOME FOG AND LOW CLOUDS CAN BE EXPECTED 
AGAIN TONIGHT. A MIDLEVEL DEFORMATION ZONE OVER OUR AREA WILL MEAN 
ANOTHER DAY OF NUMEROUS TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON 
THURSDAY. THE BEST CHANCES APPEAR IN EAST AREAS...PARTICULARLY SW NC 
DUE TO THE SE LOW LEVEL FLOW. WHILE INSTABILITY AND SHEAR APPEAR TOO 
WEAK FOR ANY THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS...HIGH PW VALUES AND DEEP CAPE 
SUGGEST SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL AGAIN.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
SUMMER TIME TEMPS AND MOISTURE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PERIOD...SO
HARD TO RULE OUT DIURNAL CONVECTION EACH AFTERNOON AND EVENING.
HOWEVER...MODELS DO CONTINUE TO AGREE ON THE BEST THREAT OF
CONVECTION ON SATURDAY INTO SATURDAY NIGHT...AS A COLD FRONT
APPROACHES FROM THE NW. KEPT POPS IN THE 20 TO 40 PERCENT RANGE
PRIOR TO SATURDAY AS IN PREVIOUS GRIDS.

FAVORING THE SLIGHTLY DRIER ECMWF FOR THE LATER PERIODS...AS THE 
ECMWF PUSHES THE COLD FRONT JUST SOUTH AND EAST OF OUR FORECAST AREA 
BY SUNDAY...PERHAPS HANGING UP OVER NE GA AND WRN NC. BASED ON THIS 
SENSIBLE SCENARIO...I LOWERED POPS BY 10 TO 20 PERCENT ACROSS WRN 
AND NRN PARTS OF OUR REGION...AWAY FROM THE ERN MTNS AND SW NC 
COUNTIES FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY. 

WEAK SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW MAY RETURN BY TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY 
AHEAD OF THE NEXT FRONT/SYSTEM...BUT I DON'T SEE A FOCUS FOR 
CONVECTION OTHER THAN DAYTIME HEATING AND OROGRAPHIC LIFT. OPTED FOR 
A BROAD BRUSH OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NOW THAT FAR OUT IN TIME.

MOS TEMPS WERE CLOSE MOST PERIODS WITH GFS/GFSX MOS CONSISTENT FROM 
00Z TO 12Z MODEL RUNS. THE ONE OUTLIER WAS THE UNUSUALLY COOL NAM 
MOS MAX TEMPS FOR FRIDAY...WHICH I CHOSE TO DISREGARD AND STAY CLOSE 
TO PREVIOUS GRIDS AND NWS NEIGHBORS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WARM AND VERY MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH A WEAK
COLD FRONT OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY WHERE A LARGE MCS WAS
OCCURRING AHEAD OF IT. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY
APPROACH THE TN RIVER VALLEY LATE THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A
MODERATELY TO POSSIBLY VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING AHEAD OF
IT OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODEL SOUNDINGS FOR THIS AFTERNOON
REVEAL A FAIRLY STEEP LAPSE RATE UP TO AROUND 700 MB...WITH NOT
MUCH CONVECTIVE INHIBITION ABOVE THAT. THUS...THE POTENTIAL FOR
SEVERE STORMS APPEARS TO BE BETTER TODAY WITH CAPE VALUES IN THE
2000 TO 2500 J/KG RANGE...A DECENT MID LEVEL WIND FLOW AROUND 25
KT...AND AN INVERTED-V PROFILE BELOW 850 MB WHERE DRY AIR MAY HELP
TO ENCOURAGE STRONG DOWNDRAFTS. THE COLD FRONT SHOULD THEN SLOWLY
DRIFT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...WITH CONVECTION GRADUALLY
WEAKENING AFTER MIDNIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND ARE
ESSENTIALLY A PERSISTENCE FORECAST.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...A FAIRLY ZONAL UPPER FLOW 
ACROSS THE UNITED STATES...EXCEPT FOR A SHORT-WAVE TROUGH MOVING 
THROUGH SOUTHERN CANADA/NORTHERN GREAT LAKES FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. 
THIS FAST MOVING TROUGH WILL PULL A FRONT INTO THE AREA FOR SATURDAY.

FOR WEDNESDAY...A STATIONARY FRONT WILL BE LOCATED NEAR THE 
TENNESSEE/GEORGIA STATE-LINE WITH UPSLOPE FLOW INTO THE MOUNTAINS. 
BEST CHANCES OF CONVECTION WILL BE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST AND FAR 
EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS. THIS BOUNDARY LIFTS NORTH OVER THE AREA 
THURSDAY PULLING MOISTURE/INSTABILITY BACK INTO THE REGION. MAIN 
FORCING FOR STORMS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WILL MAINLY BE THE LOCAL 
TERRAIN.

FOR SATURDAY...COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA BEFORE STALLING AS 
BOUNDARY BECOMES PARALLEL WITH THE UPPER FLOW. THIS BOUNDARY REMAINS 
OVER THE AREA FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY. HIGH CHANCE/LIKELY POPS 
EXPECTED SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...ESPECIALLY OVER THE HIGH TERRAIN.

MAIN CONCERN THROUGH THE PERIOD WILL BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS...BUT 
ISOLATED TO STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY FOR 
SATURDAY.

IT APPEARS STORMS ARE FIRING ON THE TERRAIN BUT WEAKEN LACKING 
OROGRAPHIC SUPPORT IN THE VALLEY. STAYED WITH ISOLATED PROBABILITY 
INTO THE EVENING MOST SPOTS AS SOME OF THE STORMS DRIFT INTO THE 
VALLEY BEFORE WEAKENING. PERHAPS A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE FOR A SHOWER 
OR THUNDERSTORM ON TUESDAY AS NORTH CENTRAL AMERICA UPPER TROUGHING 
CONTINUES TO GRADUALLY WORK ITS WAY EAST ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST. 
AS THIS OCCURS A WEAK COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL DROP SOUTH INTO THE 
NORTHERN REACHES OF THE FORECAST AREA ENHANCING CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL 
MAINLY NORTH OF I-40. STAYED VERY NEAR GUIDANCE BLEND FOR MINS/MAXES.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...WEAK RIDGING ALOFT WILL 
BE THE DOMINANT FEATURE THROUGH THE PERIOD. THE WARMTH ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE RIDGE WILL WORK UPON LOW LEVEL MOISTURE THAT WILL REMAIN IN 
PLACE...TO PROMOTE DIURNAL CONVECTION EACH DAY. BUT A WEAK FRONTAL 
PASSAGE EARLY THIS COMING WEEKEND WILL PROBABLY BRING A BIT BETTER

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...AIR MASS WAS SLUGGISH TO
DE-STABILIZE THIS AFTERNOON DUE TO EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER. HOWEVER
STARTING TO SEE SCATTERED CONVECTION (SOMEWHAT STRONG) DEVELOP
OVER NE AL AND SRN PLATEAU...WHERE MESO PAGE SHOWS 30 KTS OF SHEAR.
BASED ON THIS NEW ACTIVITY WENT IN LINE WITH LATEST HRRR AND RAP
MODELS. THUS...KEPT A SLIVER OF LIKELY POPS FOR LATE AFTERNOON
ACROSS SEQUATCHIE VALLEY AND NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES.

OTHERWISE...FOR THIS EVENING...CARRIED CHANCE POPS FROM W TO E
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH HIGHER CHANCES WEST. DROPPED BACK TO
MOSTLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AFTER MIDNIGHT AND ALLOWED FOR PATCHY FOG
AREAWIDE LATE.

RIDGING IS NOTED BRIEFLY ACROSS THE REGION FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY
NIGHT...BEFORE MODELS ADVERTISE ANOTHER APPROACHING SHORTWAVE FOR
TUESDAY. LOWERED POPS A BIT MORE FOR MONDAY AND CARRIED JUST
MINIMAL POPS IN HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS FOR MONDAY EVENING. CHANCE
POPS FOR NOW ON TUESDAY...MORE LIKELY IN THE AFTERNOON. I THINK
FOG COULD BE MORE OF AN ISSUE MONDAY NIGHT GIVEN AN APPARENT LACK
OF CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS.

FOR TEMPS...MOS MINS CLOSE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED. FAVORED THE
WARMER MAXES MONDAY AND STAYED A BIT BELOW THE WARMER GFS MAXES ON
TUESDAY.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
IS PROGGED TO DROP SOUTH ACROSS THE VIEWING AREA WEDNESDAY INTO 
THURSDAY GENERATING A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE FOR SOME SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE REGION. THE MODELS DON'T SHOW MUCH DRYING 
AND STABILIZING BEHIND THIS WEAK FEATURE SO KEPT CHANCE POPS FOR 
CONVECTION GOING AREA WIDE ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. ANOTHER LOW 
AMPLITUDE UPPER TROUGH PASSAGE ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF 
THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN MODELED FOR LATE IN THE WEEKEND SO RAISED POPS 
IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY FOR SUNDAY AS A SURFACE COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...GULF MOISTURE CONTINUES TO
STREAM NORTHWARD FROM THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO THIS AFTERNOON.
AIR MASS IS BECOMING SLIGHTLY TO MODERATELY UNSTABLE WITH SPOTTY
CONVECTION POPPING OVER SE TN...AND MORE SO TO OUR SW OVER NE AL. 
I ADJUSTED THE SHORT TERM GRIDS FOR LATE AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING
IN LINE WITH THE SIMILAR HRRR AND RAP MODELS...WHICH SUPPORTS
LIKELY POPS OVER WRN AREAS. THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES EAST ACROSS
THE WRN GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY REGION OVERNIGHT...WHICH SHOULD
KEEP HIGHER POPS IN ORDER AFTER MIDNIGHT ACROSS OUR NRN PLATEAU AND
EXTREME WRN SW VA COUNTIES. 

FOR SUNDAY...STAYED WITH OUR LOW END OF LIKELY POPS...WHICH ARE
HIGHER THAN 12Z MOS GUIDANCE...SINCE THE SRN END OF THE UPPER
TROUGH WILL BE PASSING EAST ACROSS THE TN VALLEY AND SRN
APPALACHIANS DURING PEAK HEATING. LOWERED POPS FROM THE WEST
SUNDAY NIGHT WITH PASSAGE OF THE TROUGH AXIS. MONDAY ALSO SHAPING
UP DRIER THAN PREVIOUS GRIDS...SO CUT POPS BACK TO 20 TO 30
PERCENT...AND PUSHED MAX TEMPS BACK UP TO THE SIMILAR UPR 80S TO
LWR 90S FROM 12Z MOS. OTHERWISE...12Z NAM AND GFS MOS TEMPS WERE IN
GENERAL AGREEMENT AND CLOSELY FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...NOT MUCH FOCUS FOR 
CONVECTION THROUGHOUT THE LONG TERM PERIOD OTHER THAN INTENSE SOLAR 
HEATING AND OROGRAPHIC LIFT ON THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES. 
HOWEVER...THERE WILL BE SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY MAKING ITS WAY 
ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION LATER TUESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY AND THIS CONFIGURATION MAY COAX A WEAK COOL FRONT INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. THIS BOUNDARY 
MAY ALLOW FOR A SLIGHT INCREASE IN PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION 
MAINLY ON WEDNESDAY IF IT CAN MAKE IT FAR ENOUGH SOUTH. OTHERWISE 
GENERALLY KEPT POPS AROUND 20-25 PERCENT AS UPPER RIDGING HANGS 
AROUND THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. TRENDED MAX TEMPS A LITTLE CLOSER TO 
SUGGESTED HIGHS FOR THE UPCOMING WEEK AS THE ANNUAL LATE SUMMER LAG 
IN HEATING DUE TO LONG WAVE RE-RADIATION FINALLY CATCHES UP TO US. 
STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO MINS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH DEWPOINTS IN
THE MID TO UPPER 60S. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A DEEP
SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO BRING MORE GULF MOISTURE INTO
THE TN RIVER VALLEY TODAY...WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS
DEVELOPING BY THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. IN ADDITION...A WEAK UPPER-
LEVEL SHORT WAVE OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY WILL COMBINE WITH THIS
INSTABILITY TO TRIGGER SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST AREA
TODAY AND TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE
IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL DISTURBANCE
WILL TRACK THROUGH THE REGION SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...GIVING THE
REGION A GOOD CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION. SCATTERED SHOWERS/STORMS
WILL INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON SUNDAY...WITH ANOTHER ROUND
EXPECTED ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU DURING THE EVENING HOURS
/BEFORE THINGS SLOWLY BEGIN TO TAPER OFF AFTER MIDNIGHT/.
REASONABLE CHANCE POPS WILL EXIST ON MONDAY GIVEN THE ABUNDANT
MOISTURE IN PLACE BUT...STARTING NEXT WEEK THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE
MUCH MORE DIURNALLY DRIVEN AS THE CENTER OF THE RIDGE WILL THEN
BUILDS BACK INTO THE SOUTHERN U.S. THE ONE EXCEPTION COULD BE EARLY
NEXT WEEK AS ANOTHER WEAK FRONT MAY APPROACH THE REGION ON
TUESDAY...WHICH MAY PROMOTE SOME SLIGHTLY BETTER PRECIPITATION
CHANCES. HOWEVER...DO NOT THINK IT WILL MAKE FAR ENOUGH SOUTH TO

MOISTURE INCREASING FROM SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...BUT LIFT WILL BE
GRADUAL AS THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS OVER THE MID-UPR MS VALLEY REGION

NEEDED ESPECIALLY FOR WRN AREAS BY SATURDAY NIGHT...THEN AREA-WIDE

THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SHOWERS ON THE FRINGES OF THE AREA THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...SPC MESO PAGE SHOWS ANY 
REMAINING CAPPING INVERSION HAS ERODED AT MID AFTERNOON. HOWEVER NOT 
SEEING MUCH IF ANY LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE ACROSS THE TN VALLEY...AND 
ACTUALLY JUST WEAK CONVERGENCE NOTED ON THE PLATEAU AND ACROSS WRN 
NC. OPTED TO LEAVE IN A SLIVER OR TWO OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OVER THE 
ERN MTNS AND NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES FOR THIS EVENING. DRY ELSEWHERE 
OVERNIGHT WITH PATCHY AREAS OF FOG...SIMILAR TO WHERE FOG OCCURRED 
LAST NIGHT. WENT CLOSE TO LAST NIGHT'S MINS FOR FRIDAY MORNING LOWS 
IN LINE WITH 12Z GFS MOS.

OUR DIFFUSE FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO LIE OVER NRN AREAS AND 
LIFT NORTH BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON...SO LEFT LOW POPS IN PLACE GENERALLY 
NORTH OF I-40 ON FRIDAY. NO REAL FOCUS FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT 
FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT I KEPT SPOTTY MINIMAL EVENING POPS FOR NRN HIGH 
TERRAIN AND SW VA. 

MODELS ALL SHOW AN INCREASE IN SHOWERS AND STORMS BY SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON...AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES EAST ACROSS THE MID AND UPR 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION. NOT COMPLETELY SOLD ON MEASURABLE RAINS 
AS FAR NE AS TRI AND SW VA BY 31/00Z. PREFERRED TO HOLD OFF A BIT 
FOR THOSE AREAS...IN LINE WITH THE DRIER GFS AND ECMWF FOR NOW. 
PUSHED POPS AROUND CHA VICINITY UP TO 50 PERCENT BY SAT AFTERNOON. 

FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS MOS GUIDANCE WAS CLOSE AND GENERALLY 
FOLLOWED. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MOISTURE AND 
INSTABILITY WILL BE ON THE INCREASE WITH A NICE DEEP COLUMN IN PLACE 
OVER THE WEEKEND. THIS CONFIGURATION SHOULD RESULT IN A DECENT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LATER SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY 
NIGHT AS A SHORT WAVE DRIVES NORTHEAST OUT OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY. RAISED POPS TO LIKELY FOR THE LATE WEEKEND EVENT TAPERING 
BACK TO SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY WHILE THE 
FORECAST AREA AWAITS ANOTHER SHORT WAVE AND POSSIBLE SURFACE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY BY WEDNESDAY. RAISE PROBABILITY OF PRECIP TO MEDIUM CHANCE 
FOR THE MID WEEK PERIOD FOR THIS POSSIBILITY. STAYED A COUPLE 
DEGREES UNDER MEX MOS MAXES WHILE TRENDING QUITE CLOSE TO SUGGESTED 
MINS.

.DISCUSSION...FINDING THE LOCATION OF THE WEAK COLD FRONT IS 
DIFFICULT THIS MORNING BASED ON SURFACE ANALYSIS...WITH SOME 
INDICATION OF THE BOUNDARY ON 850 MB UPPER AIR PLOTS. THE MOST 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN OUR AIRMASS IS THE HIGHER DEW POINT TEMPS 
ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN TODAY...WHILE PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ALSO  
SHOW AN INCREASE ON OHX AND RNK 12Z SOUNDINGS. 

HOWEVER...INCREASED MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WON'T NECESSARILY 
EQUATE TO A LOT OF CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. NAM MODEL LIKELY 
OVERDOING THE AMOUNT OF SHOWERS AND STORMS...WHILE GFS MODEL 
ACTUALLY NOT BAD WITH SOME DIURNAL CONVECTION IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
AREAS BY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON. SHORT TERM MODELS...RAP AND HRRR... 
SHOW VERY SPOTTY ACTIVITY THIS AFTERNOON...FAVORING MIDDLE TN AND 
WRN KY AREAS FOR BEST COVERAGE.

FORECAST GRIDS GENERALLY LOOK ON TRACK FOR TODAY...SO NO CHANGES 
PLANNED FOR NOW. I WILL UPDATE THE ZFPMRX PRODUCT TO DROP THE EARLY 
MORNING LINE...AND MAY TWEAK HOURLY TEMP GRIDS LATER IF NEEDED.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DECIDED TO ADD PATCHY FOG TO
FORECAST FOR EARLY THIS MORNING FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND
NORTHERN PLATEAU AS LATEST OBS INDICATE AN AREA OF HIGHER
DEWPOINTS. ALSO ADDED IN SOME CLOUDS TO THE NORTHERN PORTION OF OUR
VA COUNTIES AS SHOWERS HAVE BEEN DISSIPATING OVER THE PAST FEW
HOURS JUST TO THE NORTH BUT CLOUD COVER WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE
SOUTHWARD.

REGARDING THE REST OF TODAY...NOT MUCH CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS 
FORECAST. A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY ASSOCIATED WITH A TROUGH OVER NEW 
ENGLAND WILL BE APPROACHING THE KY/TN LINE BY AROUND 12Z THIS 
MORNING AND WILL MOVE FURTHER DOWN INTO THE CENTRAL/NORTHERN VALLEY 
BY THIS AFTERNOON. MODELS STILL SHOWING ISOLATED CONVECTION MAY 
DEVELOP ALONG THIS BOUNDARY DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. SOUNDINGS 
NOT OVERLY MOIST BUT ENOUGH MOISTURE PRESENT TO SUPPORT CONVECTION. 
CAPES WILL BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT WITH VALUES ROUGHLY AROUND 2000 
J/KG BY THIS AFTERNOON. WIND PROFILES QUITE WEAK FOR TODAY SO THIS
SHOULD PREVENT ANY ORGANIZED STORMS. ANY STORMS THAT DEVELOP WILL
HAVE A SLOW STORM MOTION DUE TO WEAK WIND PROFILES. MOVEMENT SHOULD
BE IN THE 5 TO 10 MPH RANGE.
 
HAVING SAID ALL THAT...WILL STILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN PLACE 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN VALLEY AND HIGH TERRAIN AREAS. AGAIN...BEST 
CHANCE OF SEEING AN ISOLATED STORM WILL BE ALONG THE BOUNDARY AND 
ALSO ACROSS THE TERRAIN....BECAUSE OF DIURNAL HEATING AND OROGRAPHIC 
LIFT. AREAS FROM KNOXVILLE AND SOUTH SHOULD STAY DRY...ESPECIALLY 
DOWN TOWARD CHATTANOOGA.
 
FOR TEMPS...CONTINUED TO STAY CLOSER TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER NAM MOS 
FOR MAX TEMPS TODAY.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE MAIN CHALLENGE THIS
FORECAST PERIOD WILL BE DETERMINING HOW STRONG THE RIDGE ALONG THE
EAST COAST REMAINS THROUGH THE WEEKEND. TONIGHT/S MODEL RUNS
INDICATE THAT SHORTWAVES WILL BE FARTHER WEST AFFECTING MIDDLE TN
MORE THAN E TN. HOWEVER...LOW LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW SHOULD
INDUCE SOME OROGRAPHIC SHOWERS AND STORMS TO DEVELOP OVER SW
VA...NORTHERN TN PLATEAU FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND A LITTLE MORE
SCATTERED ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA ON SATURDAY. THE WEAKNESS IN THE
RIDGE BY SUNDAY SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO BRING THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO THE FORECAST AREA...DIMINISHING
SOMEWHAT BY MID EVE. LOWER CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
WILL CONTINUE INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...DRY WEATHER EXPECTED TO LAST 
AT LEAST OVERNIGHT AND QUITE POSSIBLY FOR MOST AREAS THROUGH 
TOMORROW AFTERNOON. THE WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO SAG 
SOUTH AS A MINOR SHORTWAVE PASSES EAST ACROSS THE NE STATES THIS 
EVENING. DON'T REALLY SEE ANY THREAT OF PRECIPITATION AT ALL WITH 
THIS FEATURE OVERNIGHT. BOUNDARY LAYER LOOKS TOO DRY FOR ANY 
SIGNIFICANT AREAS OF FOG...ALTHO I DID CARRY BRIEF 4SM AND FOG AT 
TRI TAF. 

MOISTURE SHOULD BE LIMITED...BUT PROBABLY JUST ENOUGH INSTABILITY 
AND WEAK CONVERGENCE IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND MTNS BY MID TO LATE 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON. THUS...I CONTINUED THE 15 TO 20 PERCENT POPS AS 
IN PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR THOSE AREAS...GOING AROUND 10 PERCENT OR LESS 
AT TYS AND CHA. 

FOR TEMPS...THE MOS BLEND LOOKED BEST FOR MIN TEMPS...WHILE I STAYED 
CLOSER TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER NAM MOS FOR MAX TEMPS THURSDAY. NOTING 
THAT I HAD TO LOWER 18Z TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO TODAY FROM FORECAST 
GRID VALUES. 


.LONG TERM.../THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THIS PERIOD THE WESTERN EDGE OF AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE IS STILL IN 
PLACE OVER THE AREA.  BY FRIDAY THE RIDGE IS GETTING SHOVED TO THE 
EAST AS A LONGWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES THE AREA FROM THE WEST.  
HOWEVER...BY SATURDAY THE RIDGE HOLDS FIRM ALONG THE CAROLINA COAST 
AND DEFLECTS/WEAKENS MUCH OF THE TROUGH AS IT TRIES TO MOVE THROUGH 
THE AREA.  STILL THE UPPER TROUGH INTRUDES ENOUGH TO GET US IN THE 
SOUTHERN EDGE OF WESTERLY FLOW AND ALLOW SOME SHORTWAVES TO MOVE 
THROUGH THE AREA. OVER THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.  THIS 
SITUATION WILL KEEP THE WEATHER PATTERN FOR THOSE DAYS FAIRLY 
UNSETTLED.  BY THE END OF THE PERIOD A COLD FRONT SHOULD BE SAGGING 
SOUTHWARD FROM THE NORTH AND SHOULD BE CLOSE TO THE AREA BY 
WEDNESDAY.  FOR TEMPERATURES...STARTING WHEN THE MOISTURE GETS 
DEEPER THIS WEEKEND AND THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD...WENT 1-2 
DEGREES COOLER ON THE MAX TEMPS...FOR DEEP MOISTURE AND PERIODS OF 
LIFT...THESE TEMPERATURES SEEMED TOO WARM.

MUCH CHANGE IN THE AIR MASS. TEMPERATURES THIS MORNING ABOUT THE 
SAME AS YESTERDAY IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S NE SECTIONS AND 
MOUNTAINS AND MID TO UPPER 60S CENTRAL AND SOUTH LOWER ELEVATIONS. 
CHATTANOOGA IS THE EXCEPTION AS TEMPERATURES STILL AROUND 70. HIGHS 
TUESDAY ONLY REACHED THE MID TO UPPER 80S WHICH WAS ABOUT THE SAME 
AS MONDAY. DRIER AIR MASS AND LOWER DEW POINTS SHOULD CONTINUE ONE 
MORE DAY AND NIGHT BEFORE RISING THURSDAY. ADJUSTED HIGHS DOWN A FEW 
DEGREES BUT STILL SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN TUESDAY WHERE NAM GUIDANCE 
WAS CLOSER TO ACTUAL HIGHS. WEDNESDAY NIGHT LOWS CREEP UP A FEW 
DEGREES. ALSO COULD BE MORE CLOUDS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS WEAK 
FRONT SINKS SOUTH OVERNIGHT FROM OHIO VALLEY. NAM MODEL PUTS SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF RAIN OVER SW VA TONIGHT WITH APPROACH OF FRONT BUT OTHER 
MODELS KEEP IT DRY. PREFER TO KEEP THINGS DRY. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...BY THURSDAY THE
UPPER RIDGE BREAKS DOWN AND A RATHER DIFFUSE WEAK BOUNDARY SETS UP
ACROSS THE REGION. WEAK SURFACE FLOW...SOUTHERLY IN THE SOUTH AND
WEAK NORTHEASTERLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA
SHOULD LEAD TO OROGRAPHICALLY DRIVEN AFTERNOON ISOLATED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. THESE STORMS WILL GENERALLY BE DIURNAL SO THEY ARE
EXPECTED TO END AROUND SUNSET.

FOCUS SHIFTS TO THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH TRANSLATING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS ON FRIDAY. WHILE THE MAIN ENERGY FROM THIS SYSTEM WILL TRACK 
TOWARDS THE GREAT LAKES...WE SHOULD WATCH THE SERIES OF SHORTWAVES 
THAT DEVELOP OVER THE LA COAST. THESE WILL TRACK ACROSS MS/AL AND 
EVENTUALLY INTO TN ESPECIALLY BY SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. SO 
EXPECT INCREASINGLY MUGGY CONDITIONS AS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MOVES 
BACK INTO THE TN VALLEY. HAVE INCREASED POPS FOR SUNDAY AS THE 
STRONGEST SHORTWAVE IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE AREA BY MID DAY WITH 
MODEL CONSENSUS. 

ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL REMAIN IN THE REGION EARLY NEXT 
WEEK. AS SUCH...WILL CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT CHANCE/CHANCE POPS THROUGH

LAYER SHOULD LIMIT ITS TO DEVELOPMENT TO THOSE USUAL PRONE AREAS. 
ABUNDANT SUNSHINE WILL BRING HIGHER TEMPERATURES ON TUESDAY...IN 
THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S BY THE AFTERNOON...AND A STRONG CAP 
ALOFT WILL PREVENT ANY CONVECTION FROM FIRING...SO HAVE A 
KEPT A DRY FORECAST AS WELL. 

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PERIOD THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE IS STILL IN 
PLACE...AND THIS RIDGE LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE THE DOMINATING 
INFLUENCE IN THE EARLY PART OF THE FORECAST...THROUGH THE END OF THE 
WEEK.  OVER THE WEEKEND...THE RIDGE GETS SHOVED TO THE EAST AS A 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH PUSHES TOWARD THE AREA FROM THE WEST.  THIS SHOULD 
INCREASE THE CHANCES FOR PRECIP...BUT THE POSITIVE TILT TO THE 
TROUGH LEADS TO A CONFLUENT FLOW ACROSS THE AREA...THAT SHOULD TEND 
TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF LIFT AND OVERALL RAINFALL AMOUNTS. THE WEAK 
TROUGH AXIS SHOULD BE EAST OF THE AREA BY AROUND MONDAY...AND ALLOW 
THE RIDGE TO START BUILDING AGAIN TOWARD THE END OF THIS FORECAST.  

STILL LOOKS LIKE PRECIP THAT IS FORECAST IN THE NORTHEASTERN AREAS 
FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING IS OVERDONE BY THE MODELS...THE 
MAJORITY OF THE ENSEMBLE MOS KEEPS KTRI BELOW MENTIONABLE POPS.  MOS 
TEMPS LOOKED GOOD OVERALL...SO HAVE KEPT PRETTY CLOSE TO THEM.

AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE CONTINUES TO REMAIN ENTRENCHED
ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY TODAY. THIS HAS RESULTED IN A MOSTLY
SUNNY DAY ACROSS THE REGION...WITH SOME SCT MID TO HIGH CLOUD
MOVING ACROSS THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN VALLEYS AND THE PLATEAU.
HOWEVER...AN INTERESTING FEATURE JUST TO OUR WEST IS A LOW-STRATUS
SHIELD CURRENTLY IN PLACE OVER MUCH OF MIDDLE TENNESSEE. ITS
CURRENT MOTION IS PUSHING IT AWAY FROM OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES AND IT
WILL CONTINUE TO DISSIPATE OVERTIME WITH DAYTIME HEATING. THUS...
HAVE KEPT THE SKY GRIDS MOSTLY CLEAR ALONG THE PLATEAU THIS
MORNING. WITH THE MOISTURE UNDERNEATH THE RIDGE...LIGHT EAST TO
NORTHEAST FLOW AND SOME CLOUD COVER...THINK HIGHS IN THE 85 TO 90
DEGREE RANGE ARE A GOOD BET /ABOUT A DEGREE OR SO HIGHER THAN
YESTERDAY/. GIVEN THE STRENGTHENING CAP DEVELOPING ALOFT THOUGH...A
DRY FORECAST IS EXPECTED WITH NO DIURNAL CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON.

A DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD IN OVER THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY TONIGHT...WHICH WILL PROMOTE A CLEARING SKY WITH 
THE DRIER AIR THAT WILL BEGIN TO TAKE HOLD. LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND  
EVENING...THE CLOUD COVER CURRENTLY PRESENT ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN VALLEYS WILL GRADUALLY BEGIN TO DISSIPATE...ALONG WITH AN
ISOLATED SHOWERS ALONG THE PLATEAU. AS A RESULT OF THE MOSTLY
CLEAR/CALM CONDITIONS LATE TONIGHT...AND THE DRIER AIR IN PLACE...
TEMPERATURES WILL BE A BIT COOLER TONIGHT AND BOTTOM OUT IN THE LOW
TO MID 60S. SOME PATCHY FOG WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE ALONG AREA
LAKES/RIVERS...SO HAVE INCLUDED A MENTION OF THIS IN THE FORECAST
AFTER 06Z. ABUNDANT SUNSHINE WILL BRING HIGHER TEMPERATURES ON
TUESDAY...IN THE 85 TO 90 DEGREE RANGE BY THE AFTERNOON. A STRONG
CAP ALOFT WILL ALSO PREVENT ANY CONVECTION FROM FIRING...SO HAVE A
KEPT A DRY FORECAST AS WELL.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PERIOD AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE IS ESTABLISHED 
OVER THE AREA AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE HAS ALSO BUILT INTO THE
AREA...MAKING FOR QUIET WEATHER. LOOKS LIKE THIS PATTERN IS SLOW TO
CHANGE...BUT FINALLY LATE IN THE WEEK...AS THE SURFACE RIDGE SLIDES
TO THE EAST...MOIST AIR FROM THE GULF SURGES NORTHWARD AHEAD OF THE
NEXT FRONT. THE BEST CHANCES FOR PRECIP LOOK TO ROUGHLY BE SATURDAY
NIGHT...SUNDAY...AND INTO SUNDAY NIGHT. TIMING IS A LITTLE
IFFY...MODELS AGREE THAT THE MOISTURE WILL SURGE NORTHWARD...BUT
WHEN THE MOIST AXIS WILL BE OVER THE AREA ALONG WITH THE LIFT IS
NOT WELL-AGREED UPON. NOT LOOKING LIKE SEVERE STORMS AS THE
DYNAMICS IS VERY WEAK WITH THIS SYSTEM. FOR QPF IN THESE
PERIODS...HELD OFF ON THURSDAY FOR ANY QPF...DEEPER MOISTURE IS NOT
IN THE AREA YET...AND MOST ENSEMBLE MEMBERS KEPT THE AREA DRY.

FOR TEMPS...LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE HEATING UP PRETTY WELL UNDER THE 
RIDGE THIS WEEK...THEN COOLING DOWN SOME OVER THE WEEKEND DUE TO 
CLOUDS AND WETTER CONDITIONS.

MONDAY...BUT ACROSS SOUTH AND WEST ZONES THE CAP MAY BE WEAK ENOUGH

POPS THERE MONDAY AFTERNOON. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE SO 
WILL STAY CLOSE.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH
PRESSURE RIDGE WILL BECOME CENTERED OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY
THROUGH THE MIDDLE PART OF THE WEEK...PROMOTING MOSTLY SUNNY...WARM
AND DRY CONDITIONS THANKS TO STRONGER CAP THAT WILL SUPPRESS
DIURNAL CONVECTION THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THE CENTER OF THE RIDGE WILL
BRIEFLY RETROGRADE TO THE WEST ON THURSDAY WHICH COULD ALLOW FOR
SOME CONVECTION TO DROP SOUTH INTO THE AREA FORM THE OHIO VALLEY
DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING HOURS. HOWEVER...THE RIDGE WILL
THEN BUILD BACK INTO THE REGION FOR AT FRIDAY AND POSSIBLY THE
FIRST HALF OF THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...BEFORE A BROAD TROUGH SWEEPS A
COLD FRONT INTO THE AREA AND GIVES THE REGION ITS BEST SHOT AT
RAINFALL IN OVER A WEEK. MODELS STILL DIFFER ON THE TIMING OF THIS
SYSTEM...SO HAVE REMAINED CAUTIOUS WITH POPS FOR DAYS 6 AND 7.
BUT...GIVEN THAT THE GFS CONTINUES TO TREND SLOWER AND CLOSER TO

EXPECTED OM MONDAY AS A STRONG UPPER RIDGE SHIFTS EAST INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION.  AS THE HIGH STRENGTHENS OVER THE 
AREA...STRONG SUBSIDENCE AND CAP DEVELOP...SUPPRESSING CONVECTION 
FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.  THE RIDGE BEGINS TO FLATTEN OVER THE

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY
OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS...WITH A VERY
WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH DEWPOINTS IN
THE 70S. AREA RADARS REVEAL A LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION OVER CENTRAL
KY MOVING SOUTHWARD TOWARDS MIDDLE TN. IT APPEARS THAT SOME OF THIS
CONVECTION MAY AFFECT THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES THIS EVENING...
WITH OUTFLOW FROM IT POSSIBLY TRIGGERING ISOLATED CONVECTION
ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WHERE A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR
MASS SHOULD LINGER OVERNIGHT.

CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK FOR THE MOST
PART...BUT WILL UPDATE THIS EVENING TO MENTION ISOLATED CONVECTION
MOST AREAS WITH HIGHER POPS ON THE PLATEAU...AND TO MENTION PATCHY
FOG DEVELOPING AFTER MIDNIGHT.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND SUNDAY/...
TONIGHT AND SUNDAY THIS AFTERNOON SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS
DEVELOPED. SHOWERS AND STORMS SHOULD SUBSIDE A LITTLE AFTER
SUNRISE. HOWEVER VERY WEAK UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS AND LITTLE SURFACE
BOUNDARY FOCI MAKE THIS FORECAST DIFFICULT. WEAK AND GENERALLY
VARIABLE FLOW THROUGH THE ENTIRE TROP. CERTAINLY SEE ELEVATED
INSTABILITY ALONG WITH ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WHICH MAKES IT
TOUGH TO DISCOUNT SOME CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS OVERNIGHT. SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PROBABLY BE DRIVEN BY THE TERRAIN. AS
SUCH...HAVE PLAYED UP SLIGHT HIGHER CHANCES FOR THE PLATEAU AND
PARTS OF SW VA AND NE TN IN THE MOUNTAINS. AREAS OF FOG WILL LIKELY
DEVELOP EARLY THIS EVENING AND PERSIST INTO EARLY MORNING TOMORROW
PARTICULARLY FOR NE TN AND SW VA.

HOT AND MUGGY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE OVERNIGHT AND INTO SUNDAY. 
DAYTIME TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY BE HINDERED A LITTLE BY WHERE 
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP. CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
REMAIN IN THE FORECAST THROUGH THE DAY SUNDAY.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL REMAIN THE DOMINANT WEATHER 
FEATURE ACROSS THE REGION FOR MUCH OF THE UPCOMING WEEK...PROMOTING
CONTINUED VERY WARM AND HUMID CONDITIONS ACROSS THE AREA. AS THIS
RIDGE BECOMES MORE CENTERED OVER THE REGION DURING THE MIDDLE OF
THE WEEK...PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL BEGIN TO WANE AS DIURNAL
CONVECTION BECOMES MUCH MORE ISOLATED IN NATURE BY MONDAY EVENING...
AND BELOW MENTIONABLE LEVELS IN THE FORECAST BY TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY AS A CAPPING INVERSION STRENGTHS ALOFT. HIGHS WILL REMAIN
IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S DURING THIS TIME PERIOD AS ABUNDANTSUNSHINE
AND DRY WEATHER PREVAILS. BY THURSDAY...A RETURN OF SOME ISOLATED
TO DIURNAL CONVECTION WILL OCCUR AS THE RIDGE BEGINS TO FLATTEN AND
SHIFT OFF TO THE SOUTH AND EAST. A BROAD UPPER-TROUGH THEN WILL
APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA LATE IN THE WEEK...THOUGH THE MODEL
GUIDANCE DIFFERS ON WHEN THIS...AND ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT/RAIN
CHANCES WILL OCCUR. THE GFS IS MORE BULLISH AND SHOWS A FRIDAY INTO
SATURDAY TIME-FRAME...WHILE THE ECMWF INDICATES CLOSER TO A
SUNDAY/MONDAY TIME FRAME. HAVE LOW-END MENTIONABLE POPS GOING FOR
NOW...FOR DAYS 6 AND 7 AND WILL WAIT FOR BETTER MODEL CONSENSUS.

THE POSSIBILITY OF AN MCS AFFECTING AT LEAST NORTHEAST ZONES. WILL 
CARRY LIKELY POPS FOR NORTHEAST...TAPERING OFF TO THE SOUTHWEST.  ON 
SATURDAY...APPEARS INSTABILITY WILL BE WEAKER BUT MAY ALSO HAVE MORE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...THE AXIS OF THE UPPER RIDGE 
WILL CONTINUE TO BE CENTERED TO OUR WEST.  WEAK IMPULSES SLIDING 
DOWN THE EAST SIDE OF THE RIDGE WILL KEEP THE BEST CHANCES FOR 
PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE NORTH. ANY CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON IS 
EXPECTED TO DIMINISH THIS EVENING...THEN THE NEXT WEAK IMPULSE 
SHOULD AFFECT ESPECIALLY NORTHERN AREAS FRIDAY AFTERNOON.  WILL GO 
WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SOUTH AND HIGH CHANCE NORTH ON FRIDAY.  
APPEARS CAPE VALUES WILL BE HIGH AGAIN FRIDAY AFTERNOON...AND STRONG 
TO SEVERE STORMS WILL AGAIN BE POSSIBLE WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND HAIL 
THE PRIMARY THREATS.  WILL GO CLOSE TO MAV TEMPS FOR LOWS 
TONIGHT...BUT WILL UNDERCUT MAV TEMPS ESPECIALLY NORTH FOR HIGHS 
TOMORROW.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER LEVEL HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BRING HOT TEMPERATURES AND DAILY CHANCES OF DIURNAL 
CONVECTION. HOWEVER...NW FLOW ACROSS THE REGION WILL ALSO PERMIT A 
CHANCE OF NOCTURNAL MCS EVENTS...AND MAYBE THE WEEKEND WILL BE AN 
OCCASION FOR SUCH A THING...MAYBE LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY 
MORNING FOR STARTERS. 

PRECIP CHANCES WILL WANE AS DRIER AIR MOVES IN FROM NORTH MIDWEEK... 
REDUCING US TO MOSTLY ISOLATED AFTERNOON HIGHER ELEVATION

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STAYED WITH HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR 
CONVECTION ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE 
TAPERING BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. MODELS 
STILL PROG RATHER HIGH CAPE ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA TODAY 
AND CONTINUE TO INDICATE THE BEST CHANCE FOR BETTER COVERAGE OF 
STORMS WILL BE ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA 
CLOSER TO A CORRIDOR OF DEEPER MOISTURE AND MORE ORGANIZED LIFT AS 
SHORT WAVE FEATURES SPILL OVER THE TOP OF THE BUILDING RIDGE. THIS 
RIDGE AND ITS DRYING AND WARMING ABILITIES MAY KEEP SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE OUT OF MOST OF THE ACTION TODAY AND TONIGHT. WENT JUST A 
LITTLE BELOW MOS MAX TEMPS FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA TODAY WHILE 
STAYING QUITE CLOSE TO SUGGESTED MINS TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A BLOCKING RIDGE WILL BE THE 
DOMINANT FEATURE THROUGH MOST OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD. WITH THE 850-
500 MB HIGH BEING CENTERED OVER THE LOWER MS REGION THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...EAST TN WILL BE ON THE PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE...AND UPPER 
LEVEL DISTURBANCES IN THE N-NW FLOW WILL CROSS THE AREA. THE NAM 
TARGETS FRIDAY EVENING FOR A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSAGE. WILL HAVE 
HIGHEST POPS IN THIS TIME FRAME...AND NAM SOUNDINGS SHOW ENOUGH 
INSTABILITY IN NORTHERN AREAS FOR SOME POTENTIAL FOR STRONG TO 
SEVERE STORMS. 

FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...CONFIDENCE OF TIMING DISTURBANCES IN THE 
FLOW DROPS...AND WILL GO WITH A MORE DIURNAL PATTERN FOR SCATTERED 
TO ISOLATED CONVECTION. ACCORDING TO THE GFS...THE RIDGE BEGINS TO 
SHIFT TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK 
WEEK...SUGGESTING LOWERING PRECIP CHANCES. BUT THE ECMWF KEEPS THE 
RIDGE WELL TO THE WEST. GIVEN UNCERTAINTIES THIS FAR OUT...WILL 
CONTINUE TO HAVE LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EACH AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING.

DISSIPATE AS WE LOSE OUR DAYTIME HEATING SINCE THE ACTIVITY WILL BE
MAINLY DIURNALLY DRIVEN...ALTHOUGH A FEW SHOWERS AND STORMS MAY
LINGER AROUND UNTIL MIDNIGHT AS WE CONTINUE TO REMAIN MOIST AND
UNSTABLE. ANOTHER MILD NIGHT IS EXPECTED WITH IN THE MID TO UPPER
60S NORTH...NEAR 70 CENTRAL...AND LOWER 70S ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
VALLEY. THE BEST CHANCES OF RAIN AFTER MIDNIGHT APPEAR TO ACROSS
NETN AND SWVA AS THEY WILL STILL BE FIRMLY IN A NW FLOW PATTERN AND
WILL BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THESE LITTLE IMPULSES COMING DOWN OUT OF THE
NW AND GENERATING SHOWERS AND STORMS.

TOMORROW THE RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD AND MOVES FURTHER EAST AND 
INTO OUR AREA. THE BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN AND STORMS TOMORROW WILL 
ONCE AGAIN BE ACROSS NETN AND SWVA AS THEY STILL HANG ON TO THE NW 
FLOW. AFTER A FEW SHOWERS AND STORMS TOMORROW MORNING...SPOTTY 
AFTERNOON CONVECTION LOOKS TO ONCE AGAIN DEVELOP IN THE HEAT OF THE 
DAY ACROSS THESE AREAS. AS THE RIDGE BUILDS OVER OUR AREA SO WILL THE 
TEMPS. TOMORROWS TEMPS WILL BE IN THE LOW TO MID 90S FOR THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TOMORROW)...
TONIGHT...THERE MAY BE A FEW ONGOING ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM THIS AFTERNOONS ACTIVITY TO START THE TONIGHT 
PERIOD. THIS ACTIVITY WILL LINGER AROUND THROUGH PART OF THE NIGHT 
AS WE STAY RELATIVELY UNSTABLE AND CONTINUE TO HAVE A MOIST 
ENVIRONMENT. MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD STAY IN SHOWER FORM AS 
WARMER AIR IN THE MIDLEVELS SHOULD PREVENT ANY STRONGER UPDRAFTS 
FROM DEVELOPING THUS ONLY ALLOWING FOR A STRAY LIGHTNING STRIKE HERE 
AND THERE.

THE BIG QUESTION DURING THIS PERIOD IS REGARDING TOMORROW MORNINGS 
POTENTIAL ACTIVITY. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT LAKES IS 
SUPPOSED TO GENERATE A LINE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON ACROSS ILLINOIS AND INDIANA...AND CONTINUE TO PROGRESS SE 
TOWARD OUR AREA OVERNIGHT. THE NAM SHOWS THIS ACTIVITY FIZZLING OUT 
BEFORE IT REACHES OUR AREA TOMORROW MORNING BUT THEN REDEVELOPS 
SHOWERS AND STORMS BY AROUND 15Z ALONG THE FRONT. THE GFS IS A BIT 
MORE BULLISH AND DOES BRING THE INITIAL ACTIVITY ALL THE WAY INTO 
OUR AREA. HOWEVER IT UNFOLDS THOUGH...IT DOES LOOK LIKE THERE WILL 
BE SHOWERS AND STORMS AROUND TOMORROW MORNING...WHETHER IT IS FROM 
THE INITIAL LINE OR FROM REDEVELOPMENT. MEANWHILE...500MB HEIGHTS 
ARE QUICKLY BUILDING OVER THE PLAINS AS HIGH PRESSURE IS BEGINNING 
TO TAKE A STRONG HOLD. THESE BUILDING HEIGHTS WILL FORCE US INTO A 
NW FLOW PATTERN BY WED AFTERNOON. SHOWERS AND STORMS CONTINUE 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON TOMORROW AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH. 

SLIGHTLY COOLER OVERNIGHT LOWS NORTH DUE TO LESS CLOUD COVER BUT 
STILL WARM. TEMPS IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S NORTH TO NEAR 70 SOUTH. 
DID INCLUDE PATCHY 2SM MILE FOG AGAIN FOR THE NORTHERN AREAS AND 
INTO SWVA. WARMER TOMORROW WITH SOUTHERN AREAS LOW 90S...CENTRAL 
NEAR 90 AND NETN AND SWVA LOW TO MID 80S.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...THE UPPER LOW OVER 
THE NE STATES...ASSOCIATED FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND DAYTIME HEATING WILL 
WARRANT MORE WIDESPREAD POPS EARLY IN THE LONG TERM PERIODS. KEPT 
THE 40 TO 50 PERCENT CHANCES NORTH DOWN TO 15 TO 20 PERCENT SOUTH.

LET RAIN CHANCES DECREASE BY SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY AS THE UPPER 
RIDGE AMPLIFIES FROM THE SE STATES NORTH TO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. 
MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW STEEP LAPSE RATES WITH NOT MUCH OF A 
CAPPING INVERSION DURING THIS PART OF THE LONG TERM. THUS...CAN'T 
RULE OUT DIURNAL CONVECTION FOR THOSE DAYS...MAINLY IN THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN AREAS. 

FOR TEMPS...WENT CLOSER TO GFS MOS OR A BLEND WITH NAM FOR WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT TO THURSDAY NIGHT. ADJUSTED MAX TEMPS UP FOR THE WEEKEND TO 
TUESDAY...IN LINE WITH THE GFSX MOS AND SIMILAR ECMX MOS...GIVEN THE 
RISING HEIGHTS ALOFT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
TODAY...A MOIST ENVIRONMENT WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA. SHORT TERM 
MODELS SHOW SOME CONVECTION DEVELOPING DURING THE MORNING IN 
RESPONSE TO A 500 MB VORT MAX...WITH A LITTLE BETTER COVERAGE IN THE 
AFTERNOON ONCE WE GET BETTER DESTABILIZATION. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS 
AREA WIDE THROUGH THE DAY. MLCAPE VALUES IN THE 1800-2200 J/KG RANGE 
AND STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES COULD RESULT IN SOME STRONG STORMS 
WITH GUSTY WINDS THIS AFTERNOON. TONIGHT...BETTER RAIN CHANCES SHIFT 
TO NORTHERN AREAS AS UPSTREAM CONVECTION THAT IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP 
THIS AFTERNOON OVER IL/IN TRACKS SE ACROSS KY. THE NAM IS PRETTY 
AGGRESSIVE IN MAINTAINING THE CONVECTION AS IT MOVES INTO OUR AREA 
LATE TONIGHT/WED MORNING. IT MAY BE A BIT OVERDONE...BUT WILL RAISE 
POPS TO HIGH CHANCES NORTH LATE TONIGHT. LINGERING OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES AND GOOD INSTABILITY WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF TSTMS GOING 
THROUGH THE DAY WEDNESDAY. 

THE RIDGE OVER MS/AL WILL BUILD NORTHWARD THROUGH THURSDAY...WHICH 
WILL SHIFT THE AREA OF CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT FARTHER NORTH AND EAST 
TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY. WITH THE MIDLEVEL STEERING FLOW 
BECOMING NE...MOST OF THIS UPSTREAM CONVECTION WILL MOVE EAST OF OUR 
AREA...BUT COULD CLIP OUR NE SECTIONS. WILL KEEP SOME CHANCE POPS IN 
SW VA/NE TN...BUT SOUTHERN AREAS WILL LIKELY BE CAPPED UNDER THE 
INFLUENCE OF THE STRONG RIDGE. TEMPERATURES WILL ALSO BE WARMING 
INTO THE LOWER AND MIDDLE 90S IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY ON 
THURSDAY.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
THE BIG NEWS IS THAT IT APPEARS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION
MAY ACTUALLY SEE AN UPPER RIDGE GRADUALLY BUILD OVER THE REGION
FROM WEST THROUGH EAST ABOUT SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY. THIS SCENARIO
WOULD HEAT UP THE FORECAST AREA AND LEAD TO A DRIER REGIME AS
SUBSIDENCE DRIES OUT THE ATMOSPHERE...LEAVING ONLY A SLIGHT
POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION ON THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES. PRIOR TO
THIS THOUGH...ON FRIDAY...A LONG WAVE TROUGH WILL BE DROPPING
SOUTHEAST FROM THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES INTO THE NORTHEASTERN
ATLANTIC BY SATURDAY. MODEL FORECASTS SHOW THERE WILL BE A MEDIUM
CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE IN AN AXIS OF DEEPER MOISTURE ALONG A WEAK
AIRMASS BOUNDARY WITH SLIGHTLY COOLER AND DRIER AIR EAST AND WARMER
AND MORE HUMID AIR TO THE WEST. TWO OR THREE WEAK IMPULSES MAY AID
LIFT AS THEY ROUND THE BASE OF THE EASTERN U.S. UPPER TROUGH. KEPT
LOWER POPS FOR CENTRAL EAST AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE THROUGH THE
PERIOD DUE TO FARTHER PROXIMITY FROM THE "RING OF FIRE". STAYED
UNDER MEX MOS MAXES AND A LITTLE ABOVE MINS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...ANOTHER SHORTWAVE MOVES IN
TONIGHT FROM OUT OF MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA. THIS WILL BRING THE
NEXT ROUND OF POTENTIALLY HEAVY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
PORTIONS OF THE EXTREME SOUTHERN VALLEY AND SWNC. THE BEST CHANCES
FOR PRECIP APPEAR TO BE FROM THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH MIDNIGHT.
SOUNDINGS SHOW PWS FROM 1.5 TO 2 INCHES ACROSS THE FORECAST
AREA....THIS COMBINED WITH DEEP WARM LAYER CLOUD DEPTHS WILL
PROMOTE AN EFFICIENT RAINFALL PROCESS. UNIDIRECTIONAL WESTERLY FLOW
MAY ALSO CAUSE TRAINING OF STORMS. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR MARION
COUNTY FOR POSSIBLE FLOODING AS WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE COUNTY
RECEIVED 2 TO 3 INCHES OF RAIN THIS MORNING WITH A FEW AREAS SEEING
UP TO 4 INCHES.
 
AFTER MIDNIGHT RAIN CHANCES START DECREASING AS THE SHORTWAVE MOVES 
FURTHER TO OUR EAST. WITH A VERY MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER AND A FEW 
CLOUD BREAKS TOWARD MORNING...WILL INCLUDE PATCHY 6SM FOG IN 
FORECAST AREA WIDE AFTER MIDNIGHT AND 2SM PATCHY FOG UP INTO NETN 
AND SWVA. BY TOMORROW MORNING THE WAVE SHOULD ALMOST BE INTO SOUTH 
CAROLINA. THERE MAY BE A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS LINGERING AROUND
TOMORROW MORNING BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT.
TOMORROW AFTERNOON ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND STORMS LOOK TO
DEVELOP BUT IT APPEARS TO BE DIURNALLY DRIVEN AS THERE IS NO
SIGNIFICANT FORCING PRESENT. SO TYPICAL SUMMER TIME AFTERNOON
THUNDERSTORMS. THE EXACT TIMING OF TOMORROWS CONVECTION DEPENDS ON
HOW QUICKLY WE CAN GET RID OF THE EARLY MORNING CLOUD COVER. SOME
OF THE STORMS COULD BE STRONG AS SOUNDINGS SHOW CAPES ROUGHLY
AROUND 2000 J/KG BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. LOWS WILL BE MILD TONIGHT
DUE TO CLOUD COVER WITH TEMPS IN THE UPPER 60S NORTH TO NEAR 70
SOUTH.
 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...THERE WILL BE RAIN 
CHANCES AREAWIDE FOR THE EARLY PARTS OF THE EXTENDED...AS AN UPPER 
LOW LINGERS TO OUR NORTH OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY. 
SHORTWAVE ENERGY...DAYTIME HEATING AND OROGRAPHIC LIFT SHOULD EQUATE 
TO SOLID CHANCE POPS AND PERHAPS LIKELY IN A FEW SPOTS. 

BY FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...UPPER RIDGING DOMINATES THE SOUTHERN 
STATES NORTH INTO THE OHIO VALLEY...WHILE UPPER TROUGHS ARE 
POSITIONED ACROSS THE ROCKIES AND NORTHEASTERN STATES. HOWEVER... 
WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY CHANCE POPS ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN...DUE TO A 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND AN OCCASIONAL SHORTWAVE ON THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF 
THE UPPER LOW. TAPERING POPS TO LESS THAN 15 PERCENT OR SLIGHT 
CHANCE FOR SE TN AND SW NC...WHERE I KEPT MAX TEMPS SLIGHTLY CLOSER 
TO THE LOWER TO MID 90S AS ADVERTISED BY GFSX AND ECMX MOS. HIGHS 
MOSTLY IN THE 80S DURING THIS PERIOD FOR OUR NRN COUNTIES...WITH 
LOWS EACH NIGHT ALSO RUNNING MUCH CLOSER TO SEASONAL NORMALS THERE

.DISCUSSION...PREVIOUS FORECAST DISCUSSION STILL VALID. A SHORTWAVE 
TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS CENTRAL KY THIS MORNING AND 
SHOULD BE JUST OFF TO OUR NE BY THIS AFTERNOON. THE AREA OF ONGOING 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY SHOULD PERSIST FOR ANOTHER HOUR 
OR TWO...AND UP TO THREE ACROSS SWNC. THE HEAVIEST RAIN HAS OCCURRED 
ACROSS MARION COUNTY WHERE THREE HOUR PRECIP ESTIMATES FROM HTX 
RADAR INDICATE A LARGE AREA OF 1 TO 2 INCHES OF RAIN HAS ALREADY 
FALLEN. AREAS TO THE WEST OF JASPER AND SOUTH OF MONTEAGLE THAT 
BOARDER FRANKLIN COUNTY HAVE SEEN 2 TO 3 INCHES WITH ISOLATED AREAS  
UP TO 4 INCHES. THERE WAS AN URBAN AND SMALL STREAM FLOOD ADVISORY 
IN EFFECT THROUGH 845 AM EDT BUT THAT WAS ALLOWED TO EXPIRE AS 
MARION COUNTY DISPATCH REPORTED NO PROBLEMS ACROSS THE AREA AND AS 
THE HEAVIEST RAIN HAS MOVED OUT. WILL HAVE TO CLOSELY WATCH MARION 
COUNTY LATER TODAY FOR POTENTIAL FLOODING PROBLEMS IN CASE ANY MORE 
HEAVY RAINFALL MOVES ACROSS. 

ANOTHER SHORTWAVE THAT IS CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER SOUTHERN AK IS SET 
TO MOVE INTO NORTHERN ALABAMA AND SOUTHERN MIDDLE TN LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON. THIS SHORTWAVE WILL BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF POTENTIALLY 
HEAVY RAIN AS PWS OF 1.5 TO 2 INCHES ARE IN PLACE ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
FORECAST AREA...ALONG WITH DEEP WARM CLOUD LAYERS IN EXCESS OF 12K 
FEET. 

INCREASED POPS ACROSS THE EXTREME SOUTHERN VALLEY FOR THE NEXT FEW 
HOURS TO CATEGORICAL THEN LEFT CATEGORICAL IN PLACE ACROSS PORTIONS 
OF THE SOUTHERN VALLEY OVER TO SWNC UP UNTIL 2PM. LOWERED MAX TEMPS 
BY A DEGREE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY DUE TO EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
CONFIDENCE IN THE MODELS THROUGH THE SHORT TERM IS LOW AS THEY DO 
NOT SEEM TO BE RESOLVING THE CURRENT PRECIP AREAS VERY WELL. PRECIP 
DOES SEEM TO BE INCREASING IN NRN AL AND MIDDLE TN...BUT MUCH LESS 
THAN MODELS HAVE SHOWN. BEST RAIN CHANCES TODAY APPEAR TO BE IN 
NORTHERN AREAS CLOSER TO THE MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH...BUT PW 
VALUES ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA ARE HIGH. IT WILL NOT TAKE MUCH LIFT 
TO GET RAIN GOING...SO LIKELY POPS APPEAR WARRANTED AREA WIDE TODAY. 
THE TROUGH MOVES EAST OF THE AREA TONIGHT...BUT MOIST CONDITIONS 
REMAIN IN PLACE WITH ONLY SOME SLIGHT MIDLEVEL DRYING COMING LATE 
TONIGHT FROM THE WEST. WILL LOWER POPS DOWN TO THE CHANCE 
RANGE...WITH BEST CHANCES NORTHEAST.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...AN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE
GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY WITH A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES MOVING THROUGH
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. PERIODS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CAN BE
EXPECTED.

FOR THURSDAY INTO THE WEEKEND...LONG-WAVE UPPER TROUGH WILL 
ESTABLISH ITSELF ACROSS THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES WITH AN UPPER 
RIDGE OVER THE MID-SECTION OF THE NATION. A BATTLE GROUND BETWEEN 
AIR-MASSES WILL SETUP OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE 
WITH DAILY SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED THROGUH SATURDAY.

FEEL THAT GFS IS UNDER-ESTIMATING THE CAPE VALUES GIVEN THE EXPECTED 
HOT/VERY HUMID AIR ANTICIPATED OVER TENNESSEE. SOME OF THESE STORMS 
COULD BE SEVERE WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY WITH THE MAIN CONCERN 
BEING DAMAGING WINDS AND TORRENTIAL RAINS. WILL CONTINUE TO INCLUDE 
THIS POTENTIAL IN THE HWO.

GENERALLY WENT A DEGREE OR TWO COOLER THAN MOS HIGHS DUE TO RECENT

AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE INTO THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS EVENING...GIVING THE
AREA A GOOD SHOT OF WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION OVERNIGHT. SCATTERED
ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE EVENING...BEFORE LIFT
INCREASES OVERNIGHT AND HELPS TO GENERATE SOME ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF
MORE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS/STORMS. THE BEST CHANCE FOR RAINFALL WILL
BE ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLATEAU/CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS...AND PORTIONS
OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WHERE AN INCREASE TO CATEGORICAL POPS WAS
WARRANTED LATE TONIGHT. HAVE LIKELY POPS ELSEWHERE AFTER MIDNIGHT
AS MOST LOCATIONS SHOULD RECEIVE SOME RAINFALL OVERNIGHT. WITH
LIMITED INSTABILITY...THINK SHOWERS WILL BE THE PRIMARY MODE...BUT
SOME EMBEDDED SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS COULD ALSO PERSIST THROUGH
THE NIGHT AS WELL. THE CLOUDS AND MOISTURE WILL HELP TO KEEP LOWS
IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S AREAWIDE TONIGHT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER MO/IL OVERNIGHT WILL SLOWLY PROGRESS E-SE 
ACROSS KY THROUGH TODAY AND TONIGHT. A WEAK VORT MAX AHEAD OF THE 
SYSTEM WILL BRING SOME ISOLATED LIGHT SHOWERS TO SW VA...BUT 
PROBABLY NOT MUCH OF IT WILL BE MEASUREABLE. FORECAST SOUNDINGS LOOK 
PRETTY DRY IN THE LOW LEVELS...WITH MOST OF THE MOISTURE ABOVE 
500MB...WHICH SHOULD ALSO KEEP BROKEN HIGH CLOUDS OVERHEAD. BASED ON 
THIS...WILL UNDERCUT MOS GUIDANCE TEMPS TODAY BY A DEGREE OR TWO.  
CHANCES OF MEASUREABLE PRECIP INCREASE FROM THE WEST THIS AFTERNOON 
WHEN BETTER MOISTURE ADVECTION ARRIVES. STILL...THE NAM AND GFS SHOW 
THAT THE BEST Q-G FORCING DOES NOT ARRIVE UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT 
TONIGHT...AND WILL RAISE POPS INTO THE LIKELY RANGE IN NORTHERN 
AREAS AFTER THAT TIME. SOME HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL INTO MONDAY WILL
BE MENTIONED IN THE HWO AS THE SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH RATHER SLOWLY.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW AN UNSETTLED EXTENDED PERIOD. A SERIES OF
SHORT-WAVES MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO/TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR
MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT AND GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY FOR
TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY. FIRST WAVE WILL BRING LIKELY CHANCE OF SHOWERS
AND EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS FOR MONDAY.

FOR TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...MODELS SHOW GREAT LAKES LOW 
DEVELOPING A CONVECTIVE COMPLEX OVER LOWER OHIO VALLEY LATE 
TUESDAY...AND THEN MOVING SOUTHEAST INTO THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY MORNING.

FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK...GFS/ECMWF AGREE WITH UPPER RIDGE  
BUILDING OVER THE MID-SECTION OF THE NATION WITH A UPPER TROUGH OFF 
THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES PRODUCING NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. THE 
UPPER FLOW WILL PLACE THE NORTHEAST HALF OF THE AREA UNDER THE GUN 
FOR PERIODS OF THUNDERSTORMS. SOME OF THESE STORMS COULD BE STRONG 
WITH HEAVY RAINS...GUSTY WINDS AND FREQUENT LIGHTNING THE MAIN 
CONCERN. LOCALIZED FLASH FLOODING POSSIBLE.

HAS SINCE DIMINISHED WITH THE LOSS OF HEATING. THUS...HAVE REMOVED
MENTIONABLE POPS FROM THE FORECAST TONIGHT. SOME DECENT RADIATIONAL
COOLING WILL TAKE PLACE THIS EVENING...ESPECIALLY OVER THE SOUTHERN
VALLEY WHERE CLOUD COVER WILL NOT BE AS DENSE. HOWEVER...THE
PRESENCE OF A SOME CLOUD COVER COULD HELP TO KEEP LOWS A DEGREE OR
TWO HIGHER ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA.
ADDITIONALLY...WITH MOISTURE PRESENT IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER...THINK
THAT PATCHY FOG WILL ONCE AGAIN BE POSSIBLE AFTER MIDNIGHT...ESPECIALLY
NEAR BODIES OF WATER AND IN THE USUAL FOG PRONE SHELTERED AREAS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY STRETCHING 
FROM WEST TO EAST OVER EASTERN KY AND SOUTHWEST VA...WITH AREA 
RADARS REVEALING A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS BEGINNING TO DEVELOP OVER 
SOUTHWEST VA. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT 
SOUTHWARD TONIGHT...BUT ACTUALLY MAY NOT MAKE MUCH PROGRESS SINCE 
THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW WILL BECOME MORE ZONAL. MODEL SOUNDINGS 
INDICATE THAT DRIER AIR ALOFT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON 
SATURDAY...WITH A MID-LEVEL STABLE LAYER BECOMING DEEPER OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. THUS...WILL NOT MENTION ANY CHANCE FOR CONVECTION ON 
SATURDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF THE WEAK FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY. AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING OVER THE MID MS RIVER 
VALLEY TONIGHT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY ON SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL HELP 
TO CREATE A SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY SUNDAY... 
RESULTING IN A GRADUAL INCREASE IN MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY. IN 
FACT...A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON...WITH SCATTERED CONVECTION 
EXPECTED TO DEVELOP INTO SUNDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT 
WILL TREND TOWARDS THE COOLER NAM NUMBERS SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN 
VERIFYING BETTER LATELY AND A GRADUAL INCREASE IN MOISTURE AND 
CLOUDS IS EXPECTED THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...WILL BE IN A RATHER ACTIVE
WEATHER PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED...AS A SERIES OF SHORT WAVES
MOVES THROUGH THE UPPER FLOW. THE STRONGEST OF THE WAVES MOVES IN
ON MONDAY. THE MAIN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL TRACK TO OUR NORTH...
BUT IT WILL PULL A BOUNDARY THROUGH THE MRX CWA...WHILE INCREASING
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND PROVIDE OUR BEST CHANCE OF ORGANIZED
CONVECTION. OTHER WEAKER WAVES MOVE THROUGH PRETTY MUCH EACH DAY
TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...KEEPING UNSETTLED CONDITIONS IN PLACE.
CONFIDENCE LOW BY FRIDAY...BUT MODELS HINTING AS A RIDGE BEGINNING
TO NUDGE INTO THE REGION AND WILL KEEP POPS LOW FOR NOW.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK AND DIFFUSE FRONTAL BOUNDARY
STRETCHING FROM WEST TO EAST OVER EASTERN KY AND SOUTHWEST VA...WITH
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALING SOME HIGH CLOUDS OVER THESE AREAS. THIS
FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTHWARD INTO THE
FORECAST AREA TODAY...AS A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE
EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION PRODUCES NORTHWEST FLOW OVER THE FORECAST
AREA. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A MID-LEVEL STABLE LAYER AROUND 600
MB OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WHICH MAY SUPPRESS MOST CONVECTIVE
DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...THERE STILL REMAINS SOME
INSTABILITY BELOW THIS CAP WHICH COULD ALLOW ISOLATED CONVECTION TO
DEVELOP. MODELS ARE ALL INDICATING SOME POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED
CONVECTION OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS
AFTERNOON...SO WILL INTRODUCE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THESE AREAS
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS MORNING TO ADD A
SLIGHT CHANCE OF CONVECTION FOR THE NORTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE

SOME CLOUDS ARE MOVING ACROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA THIS 
MORNING IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE NOSE OF AN UPPER JET STREAK AND WEAK 
500 MB VORT MAX. THE NAM CONTINUES TO SHOW SOME PRECIP IN NORTHERN 
AREAS THROUGH THE DAY...BUT THIS APPEARS OVERDONE WITH NO 
SIGNIFICANT UPSTREAM VORT MAXES OF NOTE IN WV IMAGERY AND A FORECAST 
SOUNDING THAT APPEARS TO BE WELL CAPPED. THE GFS AND RAP ARE 
DRIER...AND WILL GO IN THAT DIRECTION FOR TODAY. A WARMING TREND 
WILL CONTINUE AS THE 850 MB RIDGE BUILDS IN FROM THE WEST...WITH 
HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS. SOME THIN 
HIGH CLOUDS MAY MOVE IN TONIGHT IN THE NW FLOW ALOFT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVE TROUGHS WILL MOVE FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS
INTO THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. THESE
WAVES WILL HELP PULL MOISTURE/INSTABILITY BACK INTO THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY KEEPING THE WEATHER UNSETTLED AS WELL AS PULLING OUTFLOW
BOUNDARIES INTO THE AREA. WILL CALL FOR CHANCE POPS BEGINNING
SUNDAY AFTERNOON. BEST CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE
ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND NORTHERN
PLATEAU DUE TO PROXIMITY TO UPPER DYNAMICS.

EVEN THOUGH SHORT-WAVES HAVE EXITED BY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY... 
PLENTY OF MOISTURE/INSTABILITY REMAINS WITH MAINLY DIURNAL TERRAIN

OVER NORTHERN KY AND SOUTHERN WV. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO 
SLOWLY DRIFT TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...AND ULTIMATELY 
BECOME MORE DIFFUSE AS IT NEARS SOUTHWEST VA. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL 
A SLIGHT INCREASE IN MOISTURE AROUND 850 MB THIS EVENING...BUT A MID-

CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT AS THIS COLD FRONT APPROACHES SOUTHWEST VA. 
THUS...WILL INCREASE CLOUD COVER OVER SOUTHWEST VA...BUT WILL LEAVE

DISSIPATE SHORTLY AFTER SUNSET. A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS 
PROGGED TO LINGER OVER THE NORTHEAST THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH 
NORTHWEST FLOW LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL A ZONAL 
PATTERN DEVELOPS ON SATURDAY. MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE NOW INDICATING 
THAT THE MID-LEVEL STABLE LAYER OVER THE FORECAST AREA WILL WEAKEN 
AND RISE TO AROUND 500 MB ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. THIS WEAKER AND 
HIGHER STABLE LAYER MAY ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME ISOLATED 
CONVECTION DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS OVER THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. THUS...WILL INTRODUCE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS

RIDGING MOVES TO OUR EAST...THE NEXT SYSTEM WILL APPROACH FROM THE
WEST. CLOUDS BEGIN TO INCREASE AND ISOLATED CONVECTION COULD REACH
INTO THE AREA LATE IN THE DAY SUNDAY. PRECIP CHANCE INCREASE SUNDAY
NIGHT INTO MONDAY AS THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF DISTURBANCES MOVES

A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL DROP OUT OF THE OHIO VALLEY TOWARD THE

MID-LEVEL STABLE LAYER ALSO HELPING TO INHIBIT ANY CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT WITH THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...AND 
WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE ATMOSPHERE VERY SLOWLY 
MOISTENS AND DESTABILIZES DURING THE WEEKEND AS THE LOW LEVEL FLOW 
BECOMES SOUTHERLY. MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN SYNC WITH THE SUNDAY 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY PERIOD...BUT IT APPEARS A SHORT WAVE TROUGH SHIFTS
EAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY DURING THIS PART OF THE LONG TERM. WENT
CLOSER TO THE ECMWF...WHICH PLACES THE GREATEST CHANCE FOR CONVECTION
ABOUT MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. STAYED CLOSER TO NATIONAL GUIDANCE TEMPS
FOR THE EXTENDED.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE CAROLINA
COAST...WITH A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE BEHIND IT CENTERED OVER
THE CENTRAL PLAINS. A SLIGHTLY COOLER AND DRIER AIR MASS WILL
CONTINUE TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...WITH SATELLITE
IMAGERY STILL SHOWING SOME POST-FRONTAL CLOUDS LINGERING OVER THE
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. WITH A NORTHWESTERLY WIND FLOW OVER THE
FORECAST AREA...EXPECT THESE MID-LEVEL CLOUDS TO LINGER OVER THE
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST VA...AND THE NORTHEAST TN
MOUNTAINS...BUT DOWNSLOPING EFFECTS SHOULD SLOWLY DIMINISH THESE
CLOUDS OVER THE GREAT TN VALLEY.

OVERALL..CURRENT FORECAST FOR TODAY APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT

MORE PESSIMISTIC WITH CLOUD COVER OVER THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
IN WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT THAT MOVED THROUGH THE REGION ON 
TUESDAY... A NORTHERLY FLOW CONTINUES TO PUSH A COOLER/DRIER AIR 
MASS INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. A FEW 
REMNANT LOW CLOUDS ARE LINGERING ALONG THE MOUNTAINS OF EAST 
TENNESSEE...BUT OTHERWISE MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS ARE PREVAILING 
AREAWIDE EARLY THIS MORNING. SOME MOISTURE IN THE LOW-LEVEL BOUNDARY 
LAYER COULD RESULT IN SOME POCKETS OF FOG AROUND DAYBREAK...BUT IT 
WILL QUICKLY DISSIPATE WITH THE RISING SUN. THIS WILL RESULT IN A 
MOSTLY SUNNY BUT COOLER DAY THANKS TO THE NORTHERLY FLOW...WITH 
HIGHS PEAKING IN THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S. THE CLEAR/DRY 
CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AND RESULT IN GOOD 
RADIATIONAL COOLING THIS EVENING AND A TASTE OF EARLY FALL WITH 
HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 50S IN MANY AREAS ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND 
CENTRAL VALLEY. 

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
REBUILDING THE GRIDDED DATABASE THIS MORNING AFTER UPGRADE TO
AWIPS 14.1.1. AM GRIDS PUBLISHED AND SHOULD BE REACHING NDFD.

FORECAST MODELS STILL SUPPORTING A DRY FORECAST AT LEAST THROUGH 
SATURDAY NIGHT. ANOTHER COOL NIGHT IN STORE FOR THURSDAY NIGHT...AS 
WEAK SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW DOES NOT RETURN UNTIL QUITE LATE 
FRIDAY NIGHT TO WESTERN MOST AREAS. MIN TEMPS MODERATE BACK UP TO 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE CLIMO BY SATURDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. 

GFS MODEL IS TRENDING WETTER FOR SUNDAY AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES 
ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. THE ECMWF LOOKS 
MORE MOISTURE STARVED AND SHOWS MUCH LESS QPF. THUS...I KEPT 
CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS OF JUST LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY 
AND SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SUNDAY NIGHT. NO CHANGES FOR MONDAY WITH AGAIN 
ONLY MINIMAL POPS.

MODELS ADVERTISE A DEEPER TROUGH BY TUESDAY OVER THE CENTRAL 
PLAINS...WITH PERHAPS A DECENT INFLUX OF GULF MOISTURE FOR OUR 
REGION BY LATE TUESDAY. TOO SOON TO ACCEPT THIS TIMING JUST YET
SO I CONTINUED LOW CHANCE POPS FOR NOW ON DAY 7.

HOWEVER...THE COLD FRONT REMAINS WELL TO OUR WEST ACROSS WRN TN AND
WRN KY AT 07Z. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW PLENTY OF INSTABILITY AND
MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT TODAY...WITH INCREASING
FRONTOGENETIC FORCING NOTED FROM NAM MODEL AS THE FRONT MOVES
THROUGH REGION FROM MID AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS. 

COORDINATED WITH NEIGHBORING NWS OFFICES AND OPTED TO BUMP POPS UP
TO SOLID CHANCE WITH A FEW AREAS OF LOW LIKELY POPS. LESSER CHANCES
STILL LOOK GOOD FOR SE TN COUNTIES. FRONT DOES NOT CLEAR THE TN-NC
LINE UNTIL AROUND 06Z WEDNESDAY...SO CARRIED CHANCE POPS FOR THOSE
AREAS A BIT LONGER THAN PREVIOUS GRIDS. MAY MENTION ISOLATED STRONG
STORMS...BUT THE MAIN CONCERN WILL BE ADDITIONAL LOCALLY HEAVY
RAINS IN ANY SPOTS THAT GOT SOAKED MONDAY EVENING. 

FOR TEMPS...TRENDED MORE IN LINE WITH NAM MOS AND ADJACENT GRIDS
FOR MAX TEMPS TODAY...WHILE SIMILAR MOS MINS LOOKED IN LINE FOR
TONIGHT.


.LONG TERM.../WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...FAIRLY QUIET FORECAST
IN THE EXTENDED AS A DRY/COOL NORTHWEST FLOW FILTERS INTO THE

LOWER 80S THROUGH THURSDAY. A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE
REGION LATE THURSDAY...BUT WITH LITTLE LIFT AND MOISTURE WITH IT AM
EXPECTING A DRY FORECAST TO PREVAIL THROUGH AT LEAST THE END OF THE
WORK WEEK. MOISTURE WILL EVENTUALLY BE ON THE INCREASE THIS WEEKEND
AS AN UPPER-RIDGE AXIS MOVES OVER THE REGION AND THE FLOW VEERS TO
THE SOUTH. THIS WILL RESULT IN A SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCE FOR SHOWERS

SURFACE LEE TROUGH DEVELOPS IN THE CAROLINAS.  STORMS TUESDAY COULD 
HAVE GUSTY OUTFLOW WINDS AS MID AND UPPER LEVELS DRY OUT.   FRONT 
SHOULD BE THROUGH THE AREA BY SUNSET TUESDAY EVENING.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN DECENT 
AGREEMENT FOR THE LONG TERM PERIOD...AND FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS A 
TICK ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR FOR THE LONG TERM PERIOD. 
MAY BE A LINGERING SHOWER INTO TUESDAY NIGHT...SO WILL CARRY SLIGHT 
CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN 
PROVIDING A DRIER PERIOD BEHIND THE FRONT WEDNESDAY INTO AT LEAST 
THE FIRST PART OF THE WEEKEND...WITH COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPS EARLY 
FOLLOWED BY SOME GRADUAL WARMING.  A SECONDARY COLD FRONT IS 
FORECAST TO PUSH TOWARD THE AREA THURSDAY/THURSDAY NIGHT...BUT 
APPEARS THIS FRONT WILL BE DISSIPATING AS IT APPROACHES SO WILL NOT 
CARRY ANY PRECIP WITH THIS FEATURE. BY SUNDAY AND/OR 
MONDAY...MOISTURE IS FORECAST TO BE ON THE INCREASE AND THE NEXT 
UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE MAY BE APPROACHING...SO WILL CARRY LOW POPS 
FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BOTH DAYS. WILL UNDERCUT GFS 
MOS TEMPS A BIT FOR QUITE A FEW HIGHS...WITH GENERALLY MORE MINOR 
TWEAKS TO GFS MOS MIN TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SPOTTY RANDOM CONVECTION LINGERS 
THIS MORNING NORTH OF I-40 AND I-81. HOWEVER...I FINALLY HAVE SOME 
CONFIDENCE IN SHORT RANGE MODELS HIGH POPS...DUE TO THE WARM FRONT 
WHICH WILL BE LIFTING NE TODAY AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT OVER W TN. A 
SPEED MAX...AT THE BASE OF THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH...WILL MOVE ACROSS 
THE MID MS VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON AND PROVIDE SOME UPPER LEVEL 
DIVERGENCE INTO THIS EVENING. NOT OVERLY IMPRESSIVE AND MOSTLY 
ACROSS NRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

POP AND WEATHER GRIDS WERE GENERALLY ON TRACK FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT 
ALTHO I DID NEED TO LOWER POPS JUST A BIT FOR EARLY AND MID MORNING 
TODAY. THE THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS LOOKS MINIMAL. WIND PROFILES ARE 
UNI-DIRECTIONAL WITH WIND SHEAR LESS THAN 20 KNOTS. PRECIPITABLE 
WATER VALUES REMAIN QUITE HIGH...BUT STORM MOVEMENT SHOULD BE 
SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO ONLY POSE A THREAT OF JUST LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL. MAY MENTION A FEW STRONG STORMS WITH GUSTY WINDS IN THE 
HWO PRODUCT.

THE HIGHER POPS AND CLOUDINESS DID NOT FAVOR THE WARMER GFS MOS 
MAXES...WHILE MINS TONIGHT COULD BE A DEGREE OR TWO HIGHER THAN THE 
GFS MOS MINS...BASED ON TIMING OF COLD FRONT LATER ON TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...COLD FRONT ACROSS MIDDLE TN
WITH SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA EARLY
TUESDAY. SHOWERS AND STORMS MORE NUMEROUS NORTH AND NORTHEAST.
MODELS HAVE SPED UP SYSTEM NOW WITH FRONT MOVING TO THE EASTERN
BORDER AROUND THE 00Z TO 06Z TIMEFRAME. THERE COULD BE ENOUGH
DESTABILIZATION AHEAD OF THE FRONT FOR A FEW STRONG STORMS OVER NE
TN AND SW VA IN THE AFTERNOON OTHERWISE PRECIPITATION WILL END FROM
SW TO NE LATE IN THE DAY TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT AS FRONT MOVES
EAST. FORECAST HIGHS A DEGREE OR SO BELOW GUIDANCE TUESDAY. TUESDAY
NIGHT SHOWERS END WITH SKIES CLEARING. UPPER TROUGH BEHIND FRONT
WEDNESDAY WILL DRY OUT ATMOSPHERE AND LOWER DEW POINTS INTO THE
50S. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING SOUTHEAST FROM CANADA AND THE NORTHERN
PLAINS WILL KEEP SKIES MOSTLY SUNNY TO MOSTLY CLEAR THROUGH AT
LEAST FRIDAY. THE COLD FRONT TUESDAY WILL MOVE SOUTH TO NEAR THE
GULF COAST THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AND THEN START MOVING BACK NORTH
AS A WARM FRONT SATURDAY. AS HIGH SHIFTS EAST SATURDAY SOME
UPSLOPE FLOW WILL START ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS LATE
SATURDAY. AS AIR MASS MOISTENS SUNDAY WITH HIGH CENTERED TO THE
EAST A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL RETURN. TEMPERATURES WILL
BE MOSTLY BELOW NORMAL WITH LOWS IN THE 50S THURSDAY THROUGH
SATURDAY MORNINGS.

WILL BE DAYTIME HEATING AND OROGRAPHIC CONVERGENCE. THERE IS A WEAK 
SURFACE LOW OVER NRN MIDDLE TN AND WRN KY WITH A DEW POINT TEMP 
DISCONTINUITY ACROSS WRN PARTS OF EAST TN THIS MORNING. UPPER 
RIDGING STILL INDICATED SO DON'T SEE MUCH IN THE WAY OF UPPER LEVEL 
SUPPORT. LATEST RAP MODEL RUN DEVELOPS A GREAT DEAL OF CONVECTION 
LATER THIS MORNING IN THE VICINITY OF THIS BOUNDARY...WHILE HRRR 
SHOWS JUST RANDOM ACTIVITY FOR TODAY. 

BASED ON POOR MODEL PERFORMANCE...TAKING A PERSISTENCE APPROACH AND 
TRIMMING BACK POPS FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. KEPT LIKELY POPS THIS 
AFTERNOON ACROSS MAINLY WRN HALF OF OUR FORECAST AREA...DOWN TO 
CHANCE WITH SCATTERED WORDING ELSEWHERE. RADAR TRENDS SUPPORT JUST 
SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THIS MORNING. TOSSED IN SOME

LOOKED GOOD FOR TONIGHT.

ONLY MOVED NORTH SLIGHTLY INTO THE OHIO VALLEY WITH A STATIONARY
FRONT ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND DRAPED SOUTHEAST ACROSS GA. HIGH
PRESSURE REMAINS ALONG NE US COAST. ANOTHER FRONT LIES BEHIND THE

INCREASING SHOWERS AND STORMS MONDAY INTO TUESDAY AS SURFACE LOW
MOVES THROUGH OHIO VALLEY AND COLD FRONT TO THE NW CATCHES UP WITH
STATIONARY FRONT. SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVING THROUGH OHIO AND TN
VALLEYS WILL SET OFF SHOWERS AND STORMS MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
NIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY. SKIES CONTINUE PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. MINOR UPDATE TO DEW POINTS AND 
HUMIDITY. VERY MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE. CONVECTION EXPECTED TO 
INCREASE IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS. SLOW MOVING CELLS WILL PRODUCE HEAY 
RAINFALL. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION: 

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHORTWAVE RIDGING IN PLACE PLUS 
THE TYPICAL STABILIZATION OVERNIGHT...HAS LED TO VERY SPARSE 
CONVECTION THIS MORNING. THIS RIDGING ALOFT FLATTENS LATER TODAY AND 
THE WARM FRONT FROM NRN PLATEAU TO SE TN SHOULD AID IN INCREASED 
CONVECTION BY THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...ONLY THE POORLY PERFORMING 
GFS MODEL IS VERY AGGRESSIVE IN HOW MUCH CONVECTION OCCURS EVEN THIS 
AFTERNOON. THE RAP AND HRRR MODELS REALLY DON'T ADVERTISE MORE THAN 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND TSRA. HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO DOWNPLAY POPS FOR 
THE MORNING HOURS...THEN BLEND INTO SIMILAR HIGHER POPS FOR THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS.

EXPECT CONVECTION TO DIMINISH AFTER MIDNIGHT...WHICH WAS GENERALLY 
THE TREND IN PREVIOUS POP GRIDS. ADDED SOME PATCHY FOG LATE TONIGHT 
WHICH HAS A BETTER CHANCE TO DEVELOP THAN THIS MORNING. 

A FEW STRONG TO MARGINALLY SEVERE STORMS COULD OCCUR THIS AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING. AIR MASS WILL BE AT LEAST MODERATELY UNSTABLE
TODAY... BUT FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW LESS SHEAR TODAY THAN
YESTERDAY. SO MIGHT JUST SEE ISOLATED PULSE TYPE STRONG STORMS.
WILL MENTION THIS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS IN OUR HAZARDOUS WEATHER
PRODUCT.

OTHERWISE...AIR MASS LOOKS TOO MOIST TO GO ANY HIGHER THAN NAM MOS
MAXES. GFS MOS MAXES PROBABLY TOO WARM BUT LOOKED GREAT FOR
TONIGHT'S MINS.

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...WET PERIOD CONTINUES SUNDAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY. SLOW MOVING SHORTWAVE WILL BE MOVING SLOWLY EAST 
SUNDAY MORNING AND AFTERNOON. HIGHEST RAIN CHANCES EASTERN AND 
NORTHERN AREAS. WEAK SURFACE LOW PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. EVENING SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL GIVE WAY TO A BREAK IN 
RAIN...THEN ANOTHER SHORTWAVE MOVES INTO TN VALLEY WITH BROAD UPPER 
TROUGH OVER REGION MONDAY. WITH DAY TIME HEATING SHOWERS AND STORMS 
LIKELY NORTHEAST SECTIONS. DRYING OUT MONDAY NIGHT. ON TUESDAY 
SURFACE LOW DEEPENS TO THE NORTH AND A COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE TN 
VALLEY. SHOWERS AND STORMS INCREASE OUT AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND NEXT 
SHORTWAVE. PRECIPITATION CHANCES THEN LOWER TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY AS COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH. DRIER NW FLOW LATER WEDNESDAY 
THROUGH FRIDAY WITH NO RAIN EXPECTED. BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES 
ENTIRE FORECAST PERIOD. HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S MOUNTAINS AND 
PARTS OF SW VA TO THE LOWER TO MID 80S LOWER ELEVATIONS.

320 PM EDT FRI AUG 8 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...SURFACE WARM FRONT EXTENDS NE 
THROUGH SOUTHEAST TN AND CONTINUES THROUGH N MIDDLE TN. A SHORT WAVE 
WILL MOVE SLOWLY INTO MIDDLE TN THROUGH THE PERIOD. SURFACE LOW 
PRESSURE WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONT. WARM AND MOST AIRMASS IN PLACE. 
PWAT VALUES NEAR 2.00 AND DEEP WARM CLOUD LAYER WILL MAKE CONDITIONS 
FOR HEAVY RAINFALL AND LOCALIZED FLOODING POSSIBLE. TIMING AND 
PLACEMENT OF EXTENDED PERIODS OF RAINFALL REMAIN UNCERTAIN WITH 
RELATIVELY WEAK SYNOPTIC FEATURES. MOST FAVORABLE AREAS ARE ACROSS 
NE TN AND SW VA MAINLY DUE TO STORM MOTION AND LOCATION NORTH OF 
WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE CONFINED INSIDE CLIMO 
DUE TO DEEP MOISTURE.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...OVERALL...LONGTERM 
PERIOD STILL LOOKS FAIRLY WET WITH MAX TEMPS SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW 
GUIDANCE DUE TO CLOUD COVER AND RAIN. AS WITH YESTERDAY...MODELS 
STILL LOOK TO BE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE OVERALL PATTERN. 
DRIER AIR STILL PROGGED TO RETURN BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY.

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD BE ONGOING TO START THE PERIOD ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT AS AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE CONTINUES MOVING THROUGH. 
INGREDIENTS STILL IN PLACE TO WHERE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR 
THE POTENTIAL FOR A FLOODING THREAT DURING THIS TIME. IT REALLY 
DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH PRECIP ACTUALLY FALLS THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
DAY TODAY (FRIDAY) AND UP UNTIL THE START OF THE LONGTERM. 
ALSO...WITHOUT A DISTINCT FOCUSING MECHANISM IN PLACE...IT IS VERY 
DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT WHICH AREAS WILL SEE THE GREATEST RAINFALL 
SINCE THE SHOWERS AND STORMS ARE MORE SCATTERED IN NATURE. UPPER 
LEVEL SHORTWAVE STILL MOVING THROUGH ON SUNDAY. SO FROM SATURDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...SEVERAL ROUNDS OF SHOWERS AND STORMS SHOULD 
CONTINUE AS SOUNDINGS ARE STILL VERY SATURATED WITH ELEVATED PWS 
RANGING FROM NEAR 1.75 TO 2 INCHES. PRECIP EFFICIENCY DURING THIS 
TIME WILL REMAIN HIGH DUE TO WARM LAYER DEPTHS REMAINING BETWEEN 11 
AND 12K FEET ALONG WITH MARGINAL CAPE AND WEAK SHEAR.

SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY ANOTHER SHORTWAVE ADVANCES DOWN OUT 
OF THE NW. THIS ADVANCING WAVE WILL HELP TO PUSH THIS SLOW MOVING 
LOW OFF TO OUR NE. FOR THIS REASON...IT LOOKS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE A 
BREAK IN THE PRECIP FROM SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH EARLY MONDAY WHILE 
IN BETWEEN THESE TWO FEATURES. BY MONDAY AFTERNOON MODELS SHOW NEW 
CONVECTION AND SHOWERS DEVELOPING WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE 
AFOREMENTIONED SHORTWAVE. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD PERSIST INTO THE 
OVERNIGHT HOURS OF MONDAY AND EARLY TUESDAY MORNING. 

THEN WE MAY HAVE YET ANOTHER BREAK IN PRECIP FROM LATE TUESDAY 
MORNING THROUGH AFTERNOON AS SOMEWHAT DRIER AIR STARTS TO WORK ITS 
WAY IN...BUT THEN WE HAVE THE WEAK COLD FRONT TO DEAL WITH. THE 
FRONT BEGINS TO MOVE IN BY TUESDAY EVENING INTO 
WEDNESDAY...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS ARE EXPECTED WITH THE 
ARRIVAL OF THE FRONT. WILL CONTINUE ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS ON 
WEDNESDAY AS THE FRONT CONTINUES TO PUSH THROUGH THE AREA. 

FINALLY BY THURSDAY...AND MORE SO ON FRIDAY...DRIER AIR LOOKS TO 
FILTER IN BEHIND THE FRONT WITH A DRY END TO THE WORK WEEK.

SYSTEM IS MOVING ACROSS OVER THE WEEKEND...A FEW UPPER LEVEL 
SHORTWAVES WILL ALSO BE MOVING DOWN INTO OUR AREA FROM OUT OF THE 
NORTHWEST...THUS FURTHER REINFORCING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. SOUNDINGS REMAIN VERY SATURATED FROM FRIDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH SATURDAY WITH PWS RANGING FROM 1.5 TO 2 INCHES. THESE PW 
VALUES ARE ABOVE THE 75 PERCENTILE BUT BELOW 2 STANDARD DEVIATIONS 
FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. SO PWS NOT NEAR MAX VALUES...BUT STILL HIGH 
ENOUGH TO MAKE FOR A VERY MOIST ATMOSPHERE FOR EARLY/MID AUGUST. 
SHEAR VALUES REMAIN QUITE WEAK THROUGH THIS TIME SO NOT MUCH 
CONVECTIVE ORGANIZATION IS EXPECTED. GENERALLY JUST GARDEN VARIETY 
STORMS WITH PERIODS OF POTENTIALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. 

THE LAST OF THESE SHORTWAVES MOVES IN SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY...THIS LAST WAVE WILL HELP PUSH THE AFOREMENTIONED LOW OFF TO 
THE NORTHEAST AND OUT OF OUR AREA. THIS LAST UPPER LEVEL WAVE WILL 
ALSO BRING MORE SHOWERS AND STORMS THROUGH TUESDAY. BEHIND THIS 
WAVE...A WEAK COLD FRONT MOVES DOWN OUT OF THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
INTO OUR REGION ON WEDNESDAY PROVIDING ANOTHER SHOT OF SOME SHOWERS 
AND STORMS. MODELS STILL NOT COMPLETELY AGREEING ON THE TIMING OF 
THIS FRONT AS THE ECMW HAS IT OUT OF OUR AREA BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON 
WHILE THE GFS DOESN'T PUSH IT THROUGH UNTIL WEDNESDAY NIGHT. WHEN 
THE FRONT DOES FINALLY MOVE OUT...MUCH DRIER AIR AND LOWER DEWPOINTS 
WILL FILTER IN BEHIND IT. THURSDAY LOOKS TO BE THE ONLY DRY DAY AT 
THIS POINT THROUGH THE LONGTERM BEHIND THE FRONTAL PASSAGE.
 
CONTINUED THE TREND OF STAYING SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW THE MAX TEMPS 
GIVEN EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP.

.AVIATION...A WEAK COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE SLIPPING SOUTH
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD WITH
LITTLE FANFARE. THE ATMOSPHERE IS JUST NOT BUOYANT ENOUGH FOR MUCH
IN THE WAY OF CONVECTION WITH A LITTLE TOO MUCH DRY AIR ON
NORTHWEST TO NORTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW. THAT SAID...THERE MAY BE A
COUPLE SHOWERS AROUND TRI EARLY IN THE FORECAST PERIOD BEFORE
DISSIPATION. MUCH OF THE FORECAST FOR THE TERMINALS WILL BE VFR
WITH LIMITED CHANCE OF ANY PRECIPITATION. HOWEVER...THERE MAY BE A
BRIEF PERIOD OF LIGHT FOG AROUND TYS TOWARD SUNRISE. AT TRI THE FOG
MAY BE A BIT MORE OF A PROBLEM DUE TO PASSAGE OF A MODERATE SHOWER
AT THE AIRPORT A COUPLE HOURS AGO. MVFR VSBY COULD DEVELOP BY 04Z
TONIGHT WITH POSSIBILITY OF IFR VSBY AND CEILING BY 08Z. WOULD

CONVECTION THROUGH SUNSET. SHORT WAVE UPPER RIDGING MOVES EAST 
ACROSS THE AREA ON THURSDAY WITH A DRIER AIRMASS FILTERING INTO THE

CONTINUES. 
 
.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...

A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL TRACK THROUGH THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE 
VALLEYS FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY...PUSHING A WEAK COLD FRONT INTO THE 
REGION WHICH WILL SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR SOME SCATTERED TO PERHAPS /AT 
TIMES/ MORE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE END OF 
THE WEEK. A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE OVER THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO WILL 
CONTINUE TO NOSE ITS WAY NORTH WHICH WOULD SUPPORT A MORE DIURNALLY 
DRIVEN CONVECTION PATTERN FOR SUNDAY INTO THE NEW WORK WEEK. 
HOWEVER...A COUPLE OF MODEL SOLUTIONS WANT TO BRING A BROAD TROUGH 
INTO THE REGION ON MONDAY WHICH WOULD FAVOR SOME SLIGHTLY BETTER 
STORM CHANCES ALONG WITH SLIGHTLY COOLER CONDITIONS INTO NEXT WEEK. 
REGARDLESS...THINK A 30 TO 40 POP FOR DIURNAL CONVECTION SEEMS 
PLAUSIBLE FOR NOW...WITH HIGHS SEASONABLE IN THE 85 TO 90 DEGREE

DEVELOP AROUND THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY EACH DAY...WHICH WILL RESULT IN 
SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING THROUGH THE PERIOD. A COUPLE OF 
UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVES ARE PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE TN RIVER

REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE EXACT TIMING OF THESE SHORT WAVES

NOW...WILL KEEP POPS IN THE HIGH CHANCE CATEGORY FOR THE END OF THE

WILL NOT ARGUE MUCH WITH MAV TEMPS FOR TODAY...BUT WILL GO A BIT 
HIGHER THAN MAV TEMPS FOR MINS TONIGHT ESPECIALLY SOUTH AND CENTRAL.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...FORECAST CONTINUITY PERSISTS 
THROUGH THE LONG TERM AS THE MODELS CONTINUE TO POINT TOWARD MINIMAL 
CONVECTIVE ACTION TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY WITH RELATIVELY DRY 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. IN THIS REGIME THERE IS JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE 
FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER SOME OF THE MAJOR TERRAIN 
FEATURES. WITH GRADUAL AMPLIFICATION OF AN UPPER TROUGH OVER THE 
NORTHEASTERN U.S. A COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL HAVE MADE PROGRESS 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY THURSDAY REQUIRING AN INCREASE IN 
PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION DUE TO CONVERGENCE ALONG THE FRONT. THE 
FRONT REMAINS IN THE AREA ON FRIDAY KEEPING MEDIUM CHANCE POPS GOING 
THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK BUT THE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING AREA WIDE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION MAY BE ON SATURDAY AS THE MODELS GENERALLY AGREE ON PASSAGE 
OF A RATHER SIGNIFICANT SHORT WAVE. MOIST...BUOYANT AIR WILL BE 
AVAILABLE AHEAD OF THE FRONTAL WAVE FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ON 
SATURDAY SO ADJUSTED POPS INTO THE GOOD CHANCE CATEGORY HERE WHILE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
A DRIER PATTERN HAS SETTLED OVER THE AREA TODAY...AND THAT WILL 
CONTINUE THROUGH MONDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES EAST INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY. A BROAD UPPER TROUGH WILL STILL LINGER OVER THE REGION...BUT 
MOST MOISTURE REMAINS EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. A FEW ISOLATED 
SHOWERS MAY BE POSSIBLE TOMORROW AFTERNOON IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF 
THE SMOKIES AND SW NC...BUT MOVEMENT WILL BE S-SE AND AWAY FROM THE 
VALLEY. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO TREND WARMER...IN THE 
UPPER 80S IN MOST OF THE VALLEY WITH MID 80S NORTH. LOWER DEWPOINTS 
THIS AFTERNOON AND LESS RAINFALL SHOULD MEAN LESS DENSE FOG 
POTENTIAL THAN WE SAW LAST NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
STILL NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO THE THINKING OF THE PAST SEVERAL
DAYS. UPPER TROUGH SLOWLY DEPARTS TO THE EAST AND ZONAL PATTERN
REPLACES IT. A WEAK LATE-WEEK DISTURBANCE IN THE FLOW MAY BE THE
FOCUS FOR THE BEST PRECIP CHANCES...PERHAPS FRI EVENING. FOR THE
NUMBERS...WARM AND MOSTLY DRY TUESDAY...THEN RAIN CHANCES START
CREEPING UP FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE WEEK...AND TEMPS RESPOND BY
DROPPING A LITTLE. THE UNSETTLED PATTERN FOR LATE WEEK AND WEEKEND
WILL HAVE US KEEP THE CHANCE-TYPE POPS IN FOR THURS-SUNDAY.

SCENARIO APPLIES WITH WEAK...MAINLY OROGRAPHIC LIFT WITH MARGINAL 
INSTABILITY GENERATING A COUPLE SHOWERS AND A THUNDERSTORM OR TWO 
ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY. BY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY THE PREVAILING EASTERN U.S. UPPER 
TROUGH RELOADS WITH SHORT WAVE ENERGY DRIVING SOUTHEAST AROUND THE

ACROSS THE AREA WITH OVERNIGHT SHOWERS SLOWLY INCREASING. SHOULD
HAVE SCATTERED SHOWERS THIS MORNING...BUT THIS AFTERNOON...CHANCES
FOR STORMS EXISTS...ESPECIALLY OVER THE NORTHERN PLATEAU. MIGHT
HAVE SOME STRONG OUTFLOW WINDS FROM STORMS THERE. MLCAPE VALUES
THERE WILL BE APPROACHING 1000 J/KG AND DEEP SHEAR VALUES WILL
LIKELY GET ABOVE 30 KT...BUT CHAOTIC LOW LEVEL WIND WILL NOT OFFER
GOOD INFLOW. SO...A STRUGGLE FOR STORMS TO GET SEVERE...MIGHT GET A
COUPLE THAT NEED A WARNING OR TWO...BUT NOT MUCH BEYOND THAT. MAX
TEMPS TODAY WILL STILL HOVER A LITTLE BELOW NORMAL VALUES...WENT
CLOSE TO GUIDANCE FOR BOTH MAX AND MIN.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...WENT A LITTLE CLOSER TO AN 
ECMWF/CANADIAN SOLUTION FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD WITH THE GFS THE ODD 
MAN OUT. WEAK UPPER TROUGH HOLDS POSITION ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. 
WITH DEEPEST MOISTURE PROGGED IN THE VICINITY OF THE APPALACHIAN 
CHAIN AND POINTS EASTWARD THROUGH TUESDAY. LITTLE IN THE WAY OF 
ORGANIZED LIFT DURING THIS PERIOD SO STAYED WITH SLIGHT AND SMALL 
CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WITH SOME 
OROGRAPHICS IN PROXIMITY OF THE BETTER MOISTURE SUPPLY. THUS KEPT 
SOME POPS ON THE MOUNTAINS BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA. THE CANADIAN 
AND ECMWF HAVE SYNCHRONIZED TIMING ON AMPLIFICATION OF THE EASTERN 
U.S. UPPER TROUGH FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY ALONG WITH DECENT 
TIMING ON ANOTHER SYNOPTIC COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY DROPPING SOUTH INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA ABOUT THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. HELD ONTO THE GRADUAL

DEVELOPMENT OVER THIS AREA OVERNIGHT...SO WILL KEEP 20-30 POPS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...
SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE DEVELOPING OVER THE TERRAIN AREAS THIS 
AFTERNOON. WITH WEAK STEERING FLOW ALOFT...THERE SHOULD NOT BE MUCH 
ACTIVITY MOVING INTO THE VALLEY...EXCEPT MAYBE SOUTH. A LACK OF 
SYNOPTIC FORCING SHOULD RESULT IN SHOWERS DISSIPATING AFTER SUNSET. 
WILL HAVE A MENTION OF PATCHY FOG LATE TONIGHT AS ALL GUIDANCE 
POINTS IN THAT DIRECTION...AND WE SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR AND CALM.
 
THROUGH SATURDAY...WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE UNDER ABROAD UPPER TROUGH 
PATTERN...BUT MOST OF THE MID/UPPER ENERGY WILL PASS TO OUR 
NORTH...WITH THE DEEP MOISTURE TO OUR EAST. AS A RESULT...SCATTERED 
AFTERNOON SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED ONCE AGAIN TO DEVELOP OVER THE 
PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS...WITH A FEW POSSIBLY DRIFTING INTO THE 
VALLEY. WILL HAVE POPS IN THE LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE...LOWER 
THAN PREVIOUSLY FORECAST. WILL ALSO RAISE TEMPERATURES...BUT STILL 
STAY BELOW THE WARM GFS MOS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...

YOU SEE THE GLASS AS HALF FULL...THAT MEANS WE COME TO FIND

EAST OF MODELS PATHS...SO THIS SHOULD HAVE MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE
AREA...NOT PLANNING ON ANY FLOOD WATCH ON THIS SIDE OF THE

TO AT LEAST WARRANT LOW POPS OVER THE REST OF THE AREA TODAY AS
ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL LIKELY DEVELOP OVER THE AREA.
WILL ALSO INCLUDE ISOLATED THUNDER. TONIGHT...STILL SLIGHTLY
UNSETTLED AS UPPER TROUGH HAS YET TO PASS...AND MODELS SHOW SEVERAL
SMALL UPPER WAVES OF LIFT RACING THROUGH PARTS OF THE AREA...SO
WILL KEEP AT LEAST LOW POPS IN OVERNIGHT. FOR TEMPS...WENT VERY
CLOSE TO GUIDANCE OVERALL.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...EASTERN U.S. LONG 
WAVE TROUGH HOLDS ITS POSITION INTO THE WEEKEND AS SEVERAL SHORT 
WAVE IMPULSES SWING EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE 
NATION. PERHAPS THE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE 
SATURDAY INTO SATURDAY NIGHT AS MODEL FORECASTS AGREE SHORT WAVE 
LIFT IN CONCERT WITH SUFFICIENTLY DEEP MOISTURE COULD ALLOW FOR 
DEVELOPMENT. FOLLOWING THIS SYSTEM ANOTHER COUPLE SHORT WAVELENGTH 
FEATURES BUILD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY BUT MODELS INDICATE POPS WILL BE A BIT LOWER WITH THE HIGHER 
DEWPOINT AIRMASS FARTHER SOUTHEAST OF THE FORECAST AREA. BY TUESDAY 
AND WEDNESDAY HEIGHTS START TO BUILD IN THE WAKE OF THE DEPARTING 
UPPER TROUGH ALLOWING WARMER...AND DRIER AIR TO RETURN TO THE MID 
SOUTH. THEREFORE...MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA COULD BE FREE FROM THE 
THREAT OF A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM AT MID WEEK. ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE 
AND INSTABILITY WILL BE ON THE INCREASE BY THURSDAY WITH THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SHORT WAVE LIFT RIDING IN AHEAD OF ANOTHER FRONTAL 
SYSTEM. WITH THIS IN MIND MAINTAINED THE RETURN TO AREA WIDE CHANCE 
POPS FOR CONVECTION ON THURSDAY. MET MOS TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AN UPPER JET WILL MOVE ACROSS THE
OHIO VALLEY/CENTRAL APPALACHIANS LATE TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY. THE
RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET WILL BE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. PRESSURE FALLS ASSOCIATED WITH THE JET WILL HELP PULL
SURFACE RIDGE NORTHEAST OF THE AREA. AS SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LIFTS NORTHEAST...EASTERLY
WINDS WILL INCREASE INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. UPSLOPE FLOW
INTO THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND SYNOPTIC LIFT WILL PRODUCE
WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. BEST CHANCES OF RAIN
WILL BE ACROSS THE EASTERN/NORTHERN COUNTIES WHERE LIFT IS BEST.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT 
DIFFER SOME ON THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE AND RESULTING CONVECTIVE 
COVERAGE OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY AN SATURDAY. AN 
UNSEASONABLY STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL LINGER OVER THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE NATION THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WITH A SHORT WAVE TROUGH 
AMPLIFYING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY WITHIN 
THE LONG WAVE UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN. THIS SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL PULL 
SOME ATLANTIC MOISTURE NORTHWESTWARD OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...RESULTING IN A GOOD COVERAGE OF CONVECTION 
EACH OF THESE DAYS. THE LONG WAVE UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN IS PROGGED TO 
WEAKEN BY SUNDAY...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO LINGER OVER THE EASTERN HALF 
OF THE NATION THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AS A RESULT...ISOLATED 
CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE TO POSSIBLE EACH DAY THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF 
NEXT WEEK...ESPECIALLY AROUND THE MOUNTAINS. AS FOR TEMPS... WILL 
TREND COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...WHICH IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE OVERNIGHT AS A 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH NOW OVER KS/OK WILL APPROACH THE AREA. IN
RESPONSE TO THE APPROACHING LOW...850-700 MB WINDS WILL BECOME
S-SE...ADVECTING MOISTURE INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TOMORROW.
THE NAM AND GFS AGREE THAT THE MOST CLOUDS AND BEST PRECIP CHANCES
APPEAR TO BE IN THE MOUNTAINS AND SW NC TOMORROW AFTERNOON. A
DOWNSLOPE WIND COMPONENT SHOULD PREVENT PRECIP FROM COMING INTO THE
VALLEY. LIFT IS FAIRLY WEAK HOWEVER...AND APPEARS TO BE ASSOCIATED
WITH A 500 MB VORT MAX AND ISENTROPIC LIFT. THUS POPS WILL STAY IN
THE LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE...AND ANY RAINFALL AMOUNTS SHOULD BE
LIGHT...LESS THAN A TENTH OF AN INCH.

TRI APPEARS LIKELY TO SEE ANOTHER RECORD LOW TONIGHT (RECORD IS 56) 
AS NORTHERN AREAS SHOULD REMAIN CLEAR OVERNIGHT WITH CALM WINDS.
TYS WILL BE CLOSE (58)...AND THE CHA RECORD SHOULD BE SAFE (58)
WHERE HIGH/MID CLOUDS SHOULD BE THICKER.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
AN UPPER TROUGH WILL REMAIN OVER THE EASTERN U.S. FOR MUCH OF THE
EXTENDED. THE TROUGH AXIS WILL SHIFT TO OUR WEST EARLY IN THE
PERIOD...PLACING US UNDER SOUTHWEST FLOW. THIS WILL AID THE RETURN
OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO THE AREA. A DISTURBANCE TRACKING ALONG THE
UPPER FLOW FRIDAY AND SATURDAY WILL ALSO BRING WEAK DYNAMICS AND
WEAK INSTABILITY. THIS WILL ADD TO NORMAL DIURNAL CONVECTION AND
PROVIDE A CHANCE OF CONVECTION TO DEVELOP EACH PERIOD...ESPECIALLY
OVER THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING.
THE DISTURBANCE PULLS AWAY FROM THE AREA ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY AND
ASSOCIATED CONVECTION SHOULD DIMINISH TO ISOLATED CONVECTION. A
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO BUILD IN BY WEDNESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A
STRONG COLD FRONT ALONG THE CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS AND NORTHERN
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...WITH A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH ALONG THE SOUTHERN
TN BORDER. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE
FORECAST AREA AROUND SUNRISE...WITH A DRIER AIR MASS MOVING INTO THE
REGION. AN UNSEASONABLY STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO
AMPLIFY OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION TODAY...WITH AN UPPER-
LEVEL SHORT WAVE ROTATING OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THIS LONG
WAVE TROUGH. MODELS AGREE THAT THIS SHORT WAVE WILL TRIGGER SOME
ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS
AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS
ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A BROAD UPPER-TROUGH WILL BE THE
DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE THIS PERIOD...WHICH WILL SET UP THE FORECAST
PATTERN FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK ACROSS THE EASTERN CONUS. THIS
AUTUMN-TYPE TROUGH WILL PROMOTE ABNORMALLY LOW TEMPERATURES OF UP TO
10 TO PERHAPS 15 DEGREES BELOW THAN NORMAL AS THE THE MERCURY IS
PROGGED TO ONLY REACH THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S FOR MOST OF THE
PERIOD. ADDITIONALLY...A PREVAILING NORTHERLY FLOW WILL HELP TO
KEEP THE REGION FAIRLY DRY FOR MOST OF THE WORK WEEK...WITH ONLY
SPOTTY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS POSSIBLE THROUGH THURSDAY...AND
MAINLY ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE MOUNTAINS. ANOTHER AREA OF
LOW PRESSURE WILL ROTATE AROUND THAT PARENT LOW ON FRIDAY...SENDING
ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT TOWARD THE REGION. THIS WILL PUSH ANOTHER
SHOT OF COOLER AUTUMN-LIKE AIR INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND PROVIDE
THE NECESSARY LIFT FOR SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
THIS WEEKEND. GIVEN THE BETTER CONFIDENCE IN THIS...HAVE INCREASED
POPS SLIGHTLY IN DAYS 6 AND 7 TO A SOLID CHANCE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MAIN FOCUS THIS 
AFTERNOON IS ON THE CLUSTER OF SUPERCELL STORMS TRACKING SE OUT OF
ERN KY. SEEING SOME ROTATIONS AT TIMES...AND THESE STORMS MAY MOVE
NEAR AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM EARLIER STORMS. THE BOUNDARY MAY JUST
BE DUE TO DIFFERENTIAL HEATING...SINCE REMNANTS OF LATE NIGHT
STORMS KEPT CLOUDS OVER SW VA AND EXTREME NE TN TODAY. 

RAP MODEL AND HRR DATA GENERALLY AGREE WITH NAM/GFS SOLUTIONS IN
THIS CONVECTION AFFECTING NRN AREAS INTO EARLY EVENING. KEPT AT
LEAST SCATTERED CONVECTION GOING BEYOND MIDNIGHT SINCE THE COLD
FRONT HAS TO DROP THROUGH THE REGION OVERNIGHT. 

FRONTAL PASSAGE OCCURS EARLY MONDAY...SO COOLER TEMPS ARE ON THE
WAY. HOWEVER...NW FLOW ALOFT DOES HINT AT SOME PASSING WEAK
CONVECTION AND VERY LIGHT RAINFALL IN A FEW AREAS THROUGH TUESDAY.
THIS WAS PRETTY MUCH ALREADY IN THE GRIDS...SO I KEPT FOR NOW. 

FOR TEMPS...GFS MOS LOOKED GOOD FOR MOST PERIODS...OR A BLEND WITH
NAM MOS.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE FORECAST AREA SHOULD 
CONTINUE TO ENJOY A BREAK IN THE PRECIPITATION TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
MUCH OF THURSDAY AS DRIER NORTHWEST FLOW REMAINS IN PLACE. MOISTURE 
WILL VERY SLOWLY RETURN TO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION LATER 
THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY AS THE EASTERN U.S. UPPER TROUGH STRENGTHENS. 
SHORT WAVE FEATURES WILL BE ROTATING THROUGH THE BASE OF THE EASTERN 
TROUGH ENHANCING PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION IN THE FORM OF SHOWERS 
WITH THUNDER MORE LIKELY DURING THE DAYTIME HOURS WITH SUFFICIENTLY 
WARM SURFACE THROUGH LOW LEVEL TEMPERATURES OVERLAIN BY CHILLY UPPER 
LEVEL AIR UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE UPPER TROUGH. PERHAPS BEST 
CHANCE OF RAIN WOULD BE FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY WITH A SLIGHT DECREASE 
IN PROBABILITY BY SUNDAY AS THE OFFENDING TROUGH WEAKENS A BIT. 
GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES ARE GETTING A LITTLE BETTER BUT STILL HAD TO 
UNDERCUT BY SEVERAL DEGREES IN THE COOL PATTERN IN STORE THIS WEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A

A VERY WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. A COLD FRONT
OVER THE MID WEST THIS MORNING WILL MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD TODAY...AS AN
UNSEASONABLY STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE EASTERN
HALF OF THE NATION. THIS UPPER TROUGH IS PROGGED TO CREATE A MODERATELY
TO POTENTIALLY HIGHLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS AND STRONG WIND FIELD OVER THE

FAIRLY STEEP THROUGHOUT THE TROPOSPHERE OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH DECENT 0-3 KM HELICITY VALUES (AROUND
300 M2/S2) AND LOW LCL HEIGHTS CONDUCIVE FOR TORNADO DEVELOPMENT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...IN WAKE OF A STRONG COLD FRONT
THAT IS PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT...ANY REMNANT
STORM/SHOWER ACTIVITY FROM THE EARLIER SQUALL LINE/MCS WILL QUICKLY
DISSIPATE AND SHIFT OFF THE EAST AS SOME PARTIAL CLEARING BEGINS TO
OCCUR WITH DRIER AND COOLER AIR FILTERING INTO THE AREA. THIS WILL
SET UP THE FORECAST PATTERN FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK AS A STALLED
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE EASTERN CONUS THROUGH
THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. THIS WILL PROMOTE ABNORMALLY LOW TEMPERATURES
OF UP TO 10 TO PERHAPS 15 DEGREES LOWER THAN NORMAL /WITH THE MERCURY
PEAKING IN THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S FOR MOST OF THE WEEK/. THOUGH
THIS COOL/DRY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW SHOULD LIMIT PRECIPITATION CHANCES

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...QUIET WEATHER SHOULD
LAST FOR MOST THE NIGHT...EXCEPT FOR SW VA LATE WHERE AN MCS COULD
HOLD TOGETHER AND CLIP THAT AREA TOWARD DAYBREAK. THE STRONG WIND
FIELDS AND SEVERAL FAVORABLE SEVERE WEATHER PARAMETERS FOR SUNDAY
INTO SUNDAY NIGHT...MAKE ONE QUESTION THE LOW MOS PROBABILITIES FOR
THOSE 2 PERIODS. THE GFS MODEL SOLUTION SEEMED QUITE REASONABLE TO
ME...BUT EVEN THE GFS MOS POPS WERE LESS THAN 50 PERCENT FOR THIS
EVENT. I OPTED TO KEEP SOME SWATHS OF LIKELY POPS GOING...ALTHO THE
INITIAL LATE NIGHT CONVECTION SHOULD DISSIPATE...LEAVING A FEW
HOURS FOR STRONG CONVECTION TO DEVELOP AT LEAST BY NOON OVER THE
NRN PLATEAU AND SW VA. DON'T SEE WHY THIS NEW CONVECTION WOULDN'T
THEN SWEEP ESE ACROSS THE BULK OF THE FORECAST AREA INTO SUNDAY
EVENING. ACTUAL TIMING AND COVERAGE MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY
POTENTIAL OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM THE EARLY MORNING CONVECTION.

MINOR CHANGES MADE TO THE POP AND WEATHER GRIDS TO BE MORE IN LINE
WITH GFS MODEL SOLUTION...AS WELL AS TO MESH WITH NEIGHBORING NWS
GRIDS. CLOSELY FOLLOWED THE GFS MOS MINS FOR BOTH NIGHTS...BUT THE
HOT MAX TEMPS FROM GFS MOS FOR SUNDAY LOOKED SUSPECT. 

SEVERE WEATHER THREAT LOOKS FAVORABLE...AS ADVERTISED EARLIER.
MIGHT SEE MORE HAIL THAN USUAL GIVEN THE COOLING MID LEVEL TEMPS
AND OTHER SEVERE PARAMETERS. SHEAR AND HELICITY INCREASE AS
WELL...SO CAN'T RULE ISOLATED TO A FEW TORNADOES. WEBINAR TODAY
WITH GRAPHICS POSTED TO HIGHLIGHT THIS SEVERE THREAT...AND ALSO
CONTINUED A MENTION OF SEVERE THREATS IN THE ZFP PRODUCT.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MUCH OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST 
ACTUALLY LOOKS MORE LIKE A WINTER TYPE PATTERN WITH A PERSISTENT 
EASTERN U.S. UPPER TROUGH WITH NEVER ENDING NORTHWEST FLOW AND 
PLENTY OF MOISTURE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF PRECIPITATION. THE PERIOD 
STARTS OUT ON MONDAY WITH THE EARLY DEPARTURE OF THE SYNOPTIC COLD 
FRONT POSSIBLY BRINGING A SHOWER TO SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA EARLY IN THE DAY. MOISTURE WRAPS BACK INTO 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION DURING THE DAY MONDAY AND THIS TREND 
CONTINUES INTO TUESDAY WITH TWO TO THREE WEAK SHORT WAVELENGTH 
FEATURES BUILDING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. KEPT SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS AND A 
THUNDERSTORM GOING THROUGH TUESDAY...MAINLY FOR HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS 
OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EASTERN TENNESSEE. WEDNESDAY AND MUCH OF 
THE AREA WILL REMAIN DRY ON THURSDAY. HOWEVER...HAD TO KEEP THE 
CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ALIVE FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY 
AS THE LONG WAVE TROUGH HOLDS ITS POSITION ACROSS THE EASTERN STATES 
AS A COUPLE OF RELATIVELY SIGNIFICANT SHORT WAVES BUILD THROUGH THE 
BASE OF THE TROUGH INTO THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEEKEND. OF COURSE 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE WELL BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THE EXTENDED. IT WILL 
BE SO COOL THAT IT WILL FEEL MORE LIKE EARLY FALL RATHER THAN THE 
PEAK OF SUMMER WARMTH.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS
SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL
APPALACHIANS...WITH A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER CENTRAL
GA AND THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS
BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA TODAY...BUT MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A CAPPED ATMOSPHERE
OVER THE FORECAST AREA WHICH SHOULD SUPPRESS ANY POSSIBLE CONVECTIVE
DEVELOPMENT ALONG THIS FRONT. A COLD FRONT OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER
VALLEY THIS MORNING WILL MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD TODAY...AND IS EXPECTED TO
TRIGGER AN MCS OVER THE MID WEST BY THIS EVENING. THIS MCS SHOULD THEN
MOVE EAST-SOUTHEASTWARD OVER THE UPPER OHIO RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT...AND
MAY AFFECT SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN BEFORE AND SHORTLY AFTER
SUNRISE ON SUNDAY MORNING. AS A RESULT...SOME STRONG TO SEVERE
CONVECTION MAY BE POSSIBLE OVER THESE AREAS ON SUNDAY MORNING...WITH
THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGING WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL.

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT AN UNSEASONABLY STRONG UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH WILL AMPLIFY OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION ON SUNDAY
BEHIND THIS COLD FRONT...WHICH WILL HELP TO CREATE A MODERATELY
UNSTABLE AIR MASS AND STRONG WIND FIELD OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY
SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. LAPSE RATES APPEAR TO BECOME FAIRLY
STEEP THROUGHOUT THE TROPOSPHERE OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY SUNDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH 0-3 KM HELICITY VALUES CONDUCIVE FOR
TORNADO DEVELOPMENT (AROUND 300 M2/S2). THUS...IT APPEARS THAT THERE
WILL LIKELY BE A GOOD COVERAGE OF SEVERE CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST
AREA SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF WIDESPREAD
DAMAGING WINDS...VERY LARGE HAIL...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL...AND
ISOLATED TORNADOES. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MINS FOR TONIGHT AND SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT
REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH MAXES FOR TODAY AND SUNDAY. WILL
GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS THE COOLER NAM MAXES SINCE THIS HAS BEEN
THE TREND LATELY...AND AN EXPECTED INCREASE IN MOISTURE AND CONVECTIVE
ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE THIS TREND.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...PERSISTENT TROUGHING WILL KEEP
COOLER THAN NORMAL CONDITIONS THROUGH THE NEW WORK WEEK. SHOULDN/T
SEE MUCH IN THE WAY OF ORGANIZED OR SIGNIFICANT PRECIP AFTER THE
MONDAY MORNING FRONTAL PASSAGE...BUT SOME LOW POPS WILL BE POSSIBLE
AT TIMES. BEYOND THE VALID PERIOD...MAY ACTUALLY GET A BROAD CLOSED
LOW OVER THE OHIO VALLEY NEXT WEEKEND...WHICH MAY MAKE US A LITTLE
MORE SHOWERY. STAY TUNED.

MORNING INTO MID AFTERNOON AHEAD OF COLD FRONT NOW LOCATED OVER
MIDDLE TN INTO EASTERN KY. KEPT CHANCE POPS FOR TODAY...SLIGHTLY
HIGHER NE TN MOUNTAINS. RAINFALL AMOUNTS TODAY OVERALL MOSTLY LESS
THAN ONE HALF INCH BUT IN THUNDERSTORMS AND SLOW MOVING SHOWERS 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS COULD BE AN INCH OR MORE.

SOME PATCHY DENSE FOG IN A FEW SPOTS IN THE MOUNTAINS EARLY THIS
MORNING. DRIER AIR BEHIND FRONT TO END SHOWERS AND STORMS FROM NW
TO SE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. HIGHS REACHING ONLY UPPER
70S SW VA TO LOWER TO MID 80S TN AND SW NC THIS AFTERNOON. TONIGHT
FOLLOWED CLOSE TO FORECAST GFS/NAM BLEND WITH UPPER 50S NE TN AND
SW VA TO LOWER AND MID 60S FARTHER SOUTH LOWER ELEVATIONS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FAIR WEATHER EXPECT FOR THE 
WEEKEND. ATLANTIC SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGES INT THE SOUTH. UPPER 
HIGH RIDGES INTO THE TN VALLEY FROM THE WEST. UPPER JET PUSHES 
EASTWARD THROUGH THE OH VALLEY. WARMING TREND INTO SUNDAY. UPPER JET 
SLIDES SOUTH INTO THE TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON MONDAY. 
SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SE THROUGH THE AREA AND THROUGH THE 
SMOKIES BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. GOOD LIFT AND PRE FRONTAL INSTABILITY
WILL BE IN PLACE AS FRONT MOVES IN SUNDAY NIGHT. LIMITING FACTOR
WILL BE AVAILABLE MOISTURE SO CONVECTIVE COVERAGE AND QPF ARE IN
QUESTION WHILE FRONT MOVES THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON. THIS IS
FOLLOWED BY A DRY AND COOL AIR MASS AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
SETTLES IN THROUGH THE MID WEEK. MORNING LOWS WILL BECOME SEVERAL

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...MORNING CONVECTION WORKED 
SOUTHEAST AND GENERALLY DISSIPATED...WHILE NEW ACTIVITY HAS BEEN 
DEVELOPING MAINLY DUE TO OROGRAPHIC FORCING ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU AND WRN NC. SHORT RANGE MODELS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT ON AT 
LEAST SCATTERED CONVECTION OVERNIGHT...AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES SE 
AND THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHES. NOT SURE IF THE FAR EASTERN 
AND FAR SOUTHERN AREAS WILL GET 60 PERCENT COVERAGE...BUT SOME 
CATEGORICAL POPS LOOKED LIKE A GOOD BET FOR SW VA AND NRN PARTS OF 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. KEPT FAR SRN VALLEY AND SW NC POPS AROUND 50 
PERCENT FOR NOW.

PREVIOUS WEATHER AND POP GRIDS FOR THURSDAY STILL LOOKED ON TRACK... 
SO NO CHANGES MADE. HARD TO FIND ANY MODEL THAT DOES NOT MOVE THE 
RAIN OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA BY EARLY THURSDAY EVENING. WENT QUITE 
CLOSE TO THE GFS MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT...BUT TRENDED MUCH CLOSER TO 
THE COOLER NAM MOS HIGHS FOR THURSDAY. THIS WAS ALSO IN LINE WITH 
PREVIOUS MAX TEMP GRID AND ADJACENT NWS OFFICES. 


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS IN FAIRLY 
GOOD AGREEMENT FOR THIS PERIOD. A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE ALONG THE MOUNTAINS IN E TN AND SW VA WITH THE EXITING 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY. FRIDAY AND SATURDAY LOOK LIKE OUTSTANDING DAYS 
WITH DAYTIME TEMPERATURES IN THE 80S ON FRIDAY AND A FEW DEGREES 
WARMER ON SATURDAY. FRIDAY MORNING LOW TEMPERATURES MAY DIP INTO THE 
UPPER 50S IN SOME AREAS AND LOWER TO MID 50S IN THE MOUNTAINS. 
UNFORTUNATELY THIS PLEASANT WEATHER WILL NOT STICK AROUND LONG 
ENOUGH. MODELS SUGGEST A STRONGER SHORTWAVE MOVING IN THE NW FLOW 
AND AHEAD OF THE NEXT FRONT WILL PRODUCE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS ON 
SUNDAY WITH THE BETTER BET BEING IN THE AFTERNOON. OVERNIGHT SUNDAY 
THE FRONT WILL SLOWLY SWEEP ACROSS THE STATE OF TN BRINGING RAIN 
CHANCES INTO MONDAY. ANOTHER SHOT OF COOL AIR WILL INFILTRATE THE 
REGION ON TUESDAY BRINGING MORE UNSEASONABLY COOL CONDITIONS. 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL LIMIT PRECIPTIATION CHANCES THROUGH AT 
LEAST WEDNESDAY.

ALABAMA STILL THE DOMINANT FEATURE FOR OUR AREA...ALTHOUGH THE UPPER 
RIDGE OFF THE FLA COAST IS ACTUALLY GAINING MORE INFLUENCE OVER OUR 
NORTHERN SECTIONS.  THIS MAY EXPLAIN WHY IT HAS BEEN RELATIVELY 
QUIET OVER THE NORTHERN PARTS OF OUR REGION.  WILL HAVE LOWER POPS 
TONIGHT AS THIS SYSTEM FOR THE LAST 24 HOURS HAS LOOKED DIURNAL WITH 
RESPECT TO CONVECTION.  STILL GOING WITH DECENT POPS FOR 
WEDNESDAY...AS FRONT GETS CLOSER WOULD EXPECT INCREASING 
ORGANIZATION WITH WIND STRUCTURE AS WELL AS THE START OF SOME 
COOLING ALOFT.  GFS MOS GUIDANCE LOOKS VERY GOOD OVERALL FOR THESE 
TWO PERIODS...ONLY WENT ABOUT 1 DEG COOLER FOR WEDNESDAY MAX TEMP.

POPS FOR THAT PERIOD. THE NAM AND GFS AGREE ON SOME PRECIP LINGERING 
IN EASTERN SECTIONS THU MORNING AS THE SURFACE FRONT MOVES 
THROUGH...BUT WE SHOULD HAVE THE POST-FRONTAL AIR MASS BUILDING IN 
BY THE EVENING. WILL REMOVE ALL POPS FROM THURSDAY NIGHT. 

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE ORIGINATING FROM CENTRAL CANADA AND A NW FLOW

SUNDAY...PRODUCING FALLING HEIGHTS ALOFT AND PUSHING ANOTHER FRONT 
TOWARD THE AREA FROM THE NW. GFS AND ECMWF AGREE FAIRLY WELL WITH

WEDNESDAY NIGHT TAPERING OFF THURSDAY. MODELS PUSH FRONT THROUGH

DRIER THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT AS AIR MASS FROM CANADA
MOVES SOUTH INTO THE TN VALLEY. SATURDAY FRONT LOOKS TO MOVE BACK

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...THE AIR MASS OVER THE REGION 
CONTINUES TO MOISTEN THIS AFTERNOON AND SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH 
TUESDAY AS A LOBE OF DEEPER MOISTURE MOVES OVER THE AREA ON TUESDAY. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER AMOUNTS APPROACH 2 INCHES OVER MUCH OF THE AREA 
DURING THE AFTERNOON.  THIS WILL LIKELY ELEVATE RAINFALL 
AMOUNTS...ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOT A LOT OF LIFT OR FOCUS EXPECTED TO 
ACCOMPANY THIS MOISTURE.  IMPACTS SHOULD BE MINIMAL...JUST LOCALIZED 
STREET FLOODING IN SOME OF THE MORE INTENSE DOWNPOURS.  THIS 
MOISTURE SHOULD MUTE THE OVERALL WARMING TUESDAY AS WELL...WENT ON 
THE COOL SIDE OF GUIDANCE FOR MAX TEMPS TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
A MOIST ENVIRONMENT WITH A BROAD TROUGH OVERHEAD WILL CONTINUE TO 
KEEP UNSETTLED WEATHER OVER THE AREA THROUGH THURSDAY. ORGANIZED 
SYNOPTIC FORCING FOR LIFT REMAINS WEAK TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY...SO 
SHOWERS/TSTMS SHOULD BE MAINLY DIURNALLY DRIVEN. BETTER LIFT COMES 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN A SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND UPPER JET APPROACH FROM 
THE NW. THIS TIMING IS SIMILAR IN THE NAM AND GFS...AND FASTER THAN 
PREVIOUS RUNS OF BOTH MODELS. WILL MOVE LIKELY POPS INTO WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...THEN LOWER TO CHANCES THROUGH THURSDAY AS THE TROUGH EXITS. 
THE SURFACE FRONT IS DELAYED BEHIND THE TROUGH...SO WILL KEEP JUST A 
SLIGHT CHANCE UNTIL MIDNIGHT THURSDAY NIGHT. DRY AIR ALOFT WILL 
BRING AND END TO POPS AFTER MIDNIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL BE BELOW 
NORMAL AND BELOW GFS MOS GUIDANCE CONSIDERING CLOUD COVER AND 
EXPECTED PRECIP. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT...PROVIDING 
SUNNY SKIES FOR FRIDAY. TEMPS LOOK TO REMAIN BELOW NORMAL DESPITE 
AMPLE SUNSHINE AS THE AIR MASS ORIGINATES FROM CNTRL CANADA AND THE 
MID/UPPER TROUGH IS QUITE DEEP TO OUR EAST. THE GFS AND ECMWF 
INDICATE SOME DISTURBANCES COMING OUR WAY IN THE NW FLOW FOR SUNDAY 
AND MONDAY...SO WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS THOSE DAYS...THOUGH THERE IS 
CONSIDERABLE SPREAD IN THE PRECIP DEPICTIONS OF THE GEFS MEMBERS.

AFTERNOON...WITH BEST CHANCES OVER THE SOUTH AGAIN...AS WELL AS THE
MOUNTAINS...AND TO A LESSER EXTENT ON THE PLATEAU. WEAK EASTERLY
FLOW SHOULD TRY TO BRING MOUNTAIN STORMS INTO THE VALLEY...SO
KEEPING SOME POPS IN THE VALLEY AS WELL. SHAVED OFF 1-2 DEGREES

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE WARM FRONT NEAR SE TN 
BORDER IS SHUNTED SOUTH AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS DOWN THE 
APPALACHIANS. UPPER LOW SLOWLY DEVELOPS OVER GA. WRAP AROUND 
MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE INTO THE AREA FROM THE SE. 
LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND SOME OROGRAPHIC LIFT WILL AID IN 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT TODAY AND MAINLY THIS AFTERNOON. STORMS WILL 
BE SLOW MOVING. ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE TONIGHT BUT WITH LESS 
COVERAGE AND FAVORING THE SOUTH. TEMPERATURES NEAR NORMAL. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...EARLY IN THE EXTENDED...A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GULF COAST AREA WILL CARRY LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION...WITH WEAK DYNAMICS 
REACHING IN AS WELL.  THIS COMBINED WITH NORMAL DIURNAL CONVECTIVE 
PATTERN WILL ALLOW ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP 
EACH PERIOD TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  MAIN CONCERN DURING 
THE EXTENDED WILL BE A COLD FRONT PROGGED TO MOVE IN ON THURSDAY.  
MODELS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH THIS OVERALL PATTERN BUT 
THERE HAS BEEN SOME DIFFERENCES WITH THE DETAILS...ESPECIALLY IN 
TIMING AND MOISTURE AVAILABLE.  AS THIS BOUNDARY MOVES THROUGH...IT 
WILL BRING THE BEST CHANCE OF ORGANIZED CONVECTION TO THE AREA FOR 
LIKELY TO HIGH CHANCE POPS THURSDAY.  A FEW SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS 
MAY LINGER INTO FRIDAY.  WILL TRANSITION BACK TO THE NORMAL 
SUMMERTIME DIURNAL CONVECTION PATTERN FOR THE WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE

OVER THE AREA. WHILE NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF ORGANIZED FORCING IS 
EXPECTED...STILL MAY SEE A FEW SHOWERS AROUND AT ANY TIME. IN 
ADDITION...ENOUGH INSTABILITY EXPECTED DURING MONDAY AFTERNOON TO 
WARRANT THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE TO 
CHANCE POPS TONIGHT...CHANCE ALL ZONES MONDAY.  WILL CONTINUE TO GO 
A BIT LOWER THAN MAV FOR MAX TEMPS MONDAY...BUT NOT MUCH ARGUMENT 
WITH MIN TEMPS TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...FAIRLY UNSETTLED WEATHER 
WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD. A WEAKNESS IN THE UPPER 
RIDGE WILL REMAIN OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY WITH MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION ANTICIPATED WITH THE MAIN 
FORCING BEING OROGRAPHIC LIFT.

FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...AN UPPER TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE 
GREAT LAKES/NORTHEAST UNITED STATES WILL PULL A COLD FRONT INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. FAIRLY WIDESPREAD CONVECTION ANTICIPATED FOR 
THURSDAY WITH HIGH CHANCE/LIKELY POPS AREA-WIDE. THIS BOUNDARY MOVES 
SLOWLY SOUTH AND EAST OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR THURSDAY 
NIGHT AND FRIDAY. WILL MAINTAIN CHANCE OF STORMS OVER THE FAR 
EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS/SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA FOR FRIDAY.

FOR SATURDAY BOUNDARY STALLS JUST SOUTH AND EAST OF THE AREA WITH 
UPSLOPE FLOW INTO THE WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA. MOUNTAINS WILL 
CONTINUE WITH LOW CHANCE OF CONVECTION FOR THE FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE 
MOUNTAINS.

FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...LATEST GFS CONTINUES TO SHOW ANOTHER 
FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT UPPER TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. 
PRESSURE FALLS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUGH SHIFTS WINDS BACK FROM THE 
SOUTH PULLING MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. 
CONFIDENCE WITH TIMING AND EVOLUTION OF UPPER TROUGH LOW...SO WILL 
ONLY CALL FOR LOW-CHANCE POPS.

ADDITIONAL CLOUD COVER/PRECIPIATION WILL FORM OVER THE CAROLINAS
AND COULD MOVE INTO THE AREA TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY ON TOP OF THE
DIURNAL ACTIVITY THAT FORMS.

WEDNESDAY NIGHT...ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT LAKES 
WILL PUSH A COLD FRONT INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND EVENTUALLY THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY THURSDAY. MORE ORGANIZED SHOWERS AND STORMS 
WILL BE POSSIBLE DURING THIS TIME PERIOD...WITH GREATER COVERAGE 
EXPECTED. THUS...HAVE INCREASED POPS ACCORDINGLY. DRIER AIR WILL

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...SURFACE WARM FRONT ALONG 
SOUTHERN TN BORDER WILL MOVE NORTHWARD TODAY INTO THE SOUTHERN 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AS INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDS NORTH INTO 
MIDDLE TN. EMBEDDED SHORT WAVE TROUGH OVER MIDDLE TN THIS MORNING 
WILL DAMPEN AND MOVE INTO THE SMOKIES BY THIS AFTERNOON. GOOD 
ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL CONTINUE EARLY WITH MODERATELY STRONG H85-H50 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW NEAR 45 KTS. PWAT VALUES REMAIN HIGH NEAR 1.85 
THIS MORNING. LIFT WILL WEAKEN THIS AFTERNOON AS MID LEVEL FLOW 
BECOME MORE WESTERLY WITH PASSAGE OF SHORT WAVE BUT RAINFALL SHOULD 
PERSIST MUCH OF TODAY. WEAK SURFACE TROUGH WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA 
INTO SUNDAY MORNING. LIFT WILL NOT BE AS IMPRESSIVE BUT LAYER 
MOISTURE WILL REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL WITH CONTINUED PRECIPITATION 
CHANCES CONTINUING INTO SUNDAY AFTERNOON. COOL TEMPERATURES WILL 
LINGER TODAY. LOW LEVEL THICKNESS VALUES RISE SOME ON SUNDAY WHICH 
WILL AID IN DESTABILIZATION AND THE CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE EARLY PART OF THE 
EXTENDED WILL SEE AN UPPER RIDGE BUILDING OVER THE CENTRAL U.S 
HOWEVER...THE MAIN WEATHER FEATURE TO EFFECT THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION WILL BE AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE MOVING THROUGH GA 
AND INTO THE CAROLINAS...ALLOWING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND WEAK 
DYNAMICS INTO THE REGION.  THIS COMBINED WITH THE NORMAL SUMMERTIME 
DIURNAL PATTERN WILL BRING ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION SUNDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY.  MODELS SHOW DIFFERENCES IN TIMING BUT THE 
MAIN SYSTEM OF THE EXTENDED WILL BE A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVING 
IN AROUND THE THURSDAY TIME FRAME FOR OUR BEST CHANCE OF ORGANIZED 
CONVECTION.  DRY AIR SHOULD FILTER IN BEHIND THIS SYSTEM FOR FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...THE UPPER TROUGH TO OUR WEST 
WILL SHIFT EAST INTO THE AREA...WITH A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT WELL 
TO OUR SOUTH. SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO PULL MOISTURE INTO THE 
AREA DURING THE SHORT TERM...ESPECIALLY TONIGHT AND THE FIRST PART 
OF SATURDAY. ALL AREAS SHOULD SEE SIGNIFICANT RAIN...SO WILL CARRY 
CAT POPS BOTH TONIGHT AND SATURDAY. WHILE LOCALIZED FLOODING IS
POSSIBLE...THE RISK FOR MORE WIDESPREAD FLOODING DOES NOT LOOK
HIGH ENOUGH TO WARRANT A FLOOD WATCH AT THIS TIME. NO THUNDER
MENTIONED FOR TONIGHT...BUT INSTABILITY MAY INCREASE A BIT ON
SATURDAY...BUT EXPECTED TO REMAIN WEAK. WILL MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE
OF THUNDER ON SATURDAY.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...

AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL DEPART THE REGION ON SUNDAY NIGHT 
ALLOWING FOR AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE TO GRADUALLY BUILD INTO THE AREA 
FROM THE WEST. BEFORE THAT OCCURS THOUGH...AN ADDITIONAL ROUND OF 
PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED /ESPECIALLY ALONG THE MOUNTAINS/ SATURDAY 
NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING. THE PRIMARY CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS 
FORECAST HAS BEEN THE DRIER MODEL SOLUTIONS SHOWN...ESPECIALLY BY 
THE NAM ON SUNDAY AS THE BEST LIFT WILL BE DISPLACED TO THE SOUTH 
AND EAST OF THE AREA.  AS A RESULT...ONLY SCATTERED SHOWERS FAVORING 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN MAY OCCUR ON SUNDAY...BEFORE COMPLETELY TAPERING 
OFF BY SUNDAY NIGHT.

HOWEVER...WITH A SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW IN PLACE GULF MOISTURE WILL 
REMAIN IN ENTRENCHED OVER THE REGION. THIS WILL PROVIDE A SOLID 
CHANCE FOR SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION AND CLOUD COVER EACH DAY FOR 
MOST OF THE WEEK AHEAD. STILL...WITH DECENT SUNSHINE/HEATING 
OCCURRING...TEMPERATURES WILL RETURN TO NEAR NORMAL LEVELS IN THE 85 
TO 90 DEGREE RANGE. LATER IN THE WEEK...ANOTHER DISTURBANCE OVER THE 
GREAT LAKES WILL DROP A FRONT SOUTHWARD INTO THE AREA...GIVING A 
SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCE FOR MORE ORGANIZED SHOWERS AND STORMS BY 
THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS

FRONT WELL SOUTH NEAR THE GULF COAST. BROAD UPPER TROUGH PARKED OVER 
THE NATIONS MID SECTION WILL SLOWLY MOVE EAST INTO THE TN VALLEY 
THROUGH THE PERIOD. SOUTHWESTERLY MID LEVEL FLOW WILL INCREASE TODAY 
EAST OF THE TROUGH. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE FAIRLY RAPIDLY ACROSS THE 
EAST TN VALLEY THROUGH SATURDAY. CURRENT PWAT VALUES NEAR 1.00 WILL 
JUMP TO NEAR 2.00 BY TONIGHT. INSTABILITY IS WEAK BUT LIFT WILL BE 
VERY GOOD LATER TODAY AND ESPECIALLY TONIGHT. SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND 
LIFT SLOWLY WEAKEN AND MOVE NE ON SATURDAY. SOME MID LEVEL DRYING 
WILL OCCUR. AIRMASS BECOMES MORE UNSTABLE WITH BETTER CHANCE FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS ON SATURDAY. THE LAYER IS DRIER ON SUNDAY. ABOVE 
NORMAL CHANCE FOR CONVECTION CONTINUES FAVORING THE EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS. GRADUAL WARMING TREND WILL BE MODERATED BY CLOUD COVER 
AND PRECIPITATION. 
 
.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...AN UPPER RIDGE BUILDS 
INTO THE CENTRAL U.S. EARLY IN THE EXTENDED.  THIS PLACES THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION UNDER NORTHWEST FLOW WITH THE LOWER 
LEVELS BECOMING MORE SOUTHERLY WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR 
EAST.  THIS WILL ALLOW LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO RETURN TO THE REGION 
AND BRING US IN A MORE NORMAL SUMMERTIME PATTERN WITH WARMING 
TEMPERATURES AND DIURNAL CONVECTION...FAVORING HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  
THIS PATTERN WILL DOMINATE THROUGH MUCH OF THE EXTENDED.  HOWEVER... 
A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLIDE IN ON THURSDAY FOR OUR BEST

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...A SLOW MOVING UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH WILL APPROACH DURING THE PERIOD.  LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL TURN 
MORE SOUTHERLY AND INCREASE...BRINGING INCREASING MOISTURE TO THE 
AREA STARTING TONIGHT. SHOWERS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVERNIGHT 
ESPECIALLY CENTRAL AREAS...AND AFFECT ALL AREAS ON FRIDAY. 
INSTABILITY LOOKS LIMITED...BUT MAY BE ENOUGH FOR AT LEAST SOME 
THUNDER SO WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS MOST ZONES WITH A CHANCE OF 
THUNDER ALL ZONES FRIDAY. ONLY SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A WET/UNSETTLED
PATTERN CONTINUES THIS WEEKEND AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH TRACKS
THROUGH THE MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. THE COMBINATION OF THIS UPPER-LEVEL
SUPPORT...ISENTROPIC LIFT AND THE ABUNDANT MOISTURE IN PLACE WILL
GENERATE MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY
EVENING INTO SATURDAY...AND AGAIN SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST
SUNDAY EVENING. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD BE MORE SCATTERED IN NATURE
FRIDAY EVENING AND THEN BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD THROUGH THE NIGHT
INTO SATURDAY AS THE AFOREMENTIONED LIFT INCREASES. THEN...AS THE
BASE OF THE TROUGH ROTATES THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT INTO
SUNDAY...ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL
OCCUR...BEFORE TAPERING OFF SUNDAY NIGHT. AS A RESULT...HAVE
INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY FRIDAY NIGHT AND LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL ON
SATURDAY.

THOUGH SOME DEEPER CONVECTION WILL OCCUR...MOST OF THE THUNDER 
ACTIVITY WILL REMAIN UNORGANIZED...SO AM EXPECTING LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL TO BE THE PRIMARY IMPACT FROM THE PERSISTENT RAINFALL /DUE 
TO TRAINING AND AN ENVIRONMENT THAT WILL BE EFFICIENT FOR HEAVY RAIN 
PRODUCING CELLS/. THE THREAT FOR SOME LOCALIZED FLOODING WILL NEED 
TO BE EXAMINED...ESPECIALLY SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY SHOULD THE 
HEAVIEST PRECIPITATION LINGER. IN ADDITION TO THE HIGH PRECIPITATION 
CHANCES...COOLER MORE FALL-LIKE DAYTIME TEMPERATURES IN THE 70S TO 
AROUND 80 DEGREES ARE EXPECTED THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 

THEREAFTER...A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO THE EAST WILL BEGIN TO BUILD 
INTO THE AREA...BUT UNDERNEATH THE INFLUENCE OF SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW 
THE CHANCE FOR SCATTERED CONVECTION AND CLOUD COVER WILL LINGER 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE WEEK AHEAD. TEMPERATURES WILL RETURN TO NEAR 
NORMAL LEVELS IN THE 85-90 DEGREE RANGE. LATER IN THE WEEK...ANOTHER 
DISTURBANCE OVER THE GREAT LAKES WILL DROP A FRONT SOUTHWARD INTO

400 AM EDT THU JUL 17 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...ONE FINAL DAY FREE FROM RAIN TODAY 
AS DRY NORTHERLY FLOW CONTINUES WITH A SURFACE RIDGE IN PLACE. 
CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE TONIGHT AHEAD OF A SHORT WAVE OVER 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE MAX/MIN TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH NOW 
OVER THE ROCKIES WILL DROP SE AND AMPLIFY TODAY...WITH MOISTURE 
AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM SPREADING NORTHWARD INTO OUR AREA ON FRIDAY. IT 
WILL BE VERY SLOW TO MOVE EAST...SO DEEP MOISTURE WILL REMAIN IN 
PLACE THROUGH SUNDAY. MODELS HAVE SOME BIG DIFFERENCES IN QPF 
AMOUNTS THROUGH THIS PERIOD...WITH THE GFS BEING A DRY OUTLIER. WILL 
LEAN TOWARD THE WETTER NAM/SREF/ECMWF SOLUTION...AND HAVE LIKELY 
POPS SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT WHEN THE NAM SHOWS THE A 500 MB 
TROUGH/VORT MAX CROSSING MIDDLE AND EAST TN. HIGH CHANCES CONTINUE 
INTO SUNDAY AS THE NAM SHOWS A CONVECTIVE LINE DEVELOPING WITH A 850-
700 MB CONVERGENCE ZONE...WITH POPS DECREASING SUNDAY NIGHT.

THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD WILL FEATURE A BROAD UPPER 
TROUGH ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST. THIS WILL KEEP POPS IN THE FORECAST 
EACH DAY...BUT WITH A LACK OF SYNOPTIC FORCING FOR ORGANIZED 
LIFT...WILL HAVE POPS MAINLY DIURNALLY  BASED WITH CHANCES DURING THE 
DAY AND SLIGHT CHANCES AT NIGHT. WE SHOULD ALSO SEE A SLOW WARMING 
TREND AS THE AIR MASS MODERATES...BUT WILL STILL HAVE TEMPERATURES A 
FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL EACH DAY BENEATH THE TROUGH...AND WELL 
BELOW GFS MOS WHICH IS ON THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE OF ENSEMBLE 
MEMBERS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE 
TO PROVIDE DRY AND COOL (FOR JULY) AIR FOR THE SHORT TERM.  SHOULD 
BE CLEAR/MOSTLY CLEAR. SOME FOG MAY DEVELOP TONIGHT MAINLY NEAR 
LAKES.  WILL GENERALLY STAY CLOSE TO MAV TEMPS BUT WILL TRIM A 
DEGREE OR TWO FROM MOST HIGHS TOMORROW.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LONGWAVE TROUGH 
SHIFTS EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT. THE COOLER AND DRY 
PATTERN WILL BEGIN TO CHANGE AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS/LOWER MS VALLEY MOVES INTO THE TN VALLEY BY FRIDAY MORNING. 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BEGINS TO INCREASE THURSDAY NIGHT. AS A RESULT 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD RISE A FEW DEGREES. A SECONDARY SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
APPROACHES FROM THE WEST FRIDAY. MODELS ARE STILL VARYING IN THE 
AMOUNT OF QPF WITH THIS TROUGH. INSTABILITY INCREASES SO SHOWERS AND 
A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE MAINLY DURING THE PEAK 
HEATING HOURS. THE NAM HAS HIGH RAIN CHANCES AS COMPARED TO THE GFS 
WITH THE NEW ECMWF IN THE MIDDLE. MODELS THEN BRING EVEN MORE 
MOISTURE IN FRIDAY NIGHT AND ESPECIALLY SATURDAY. WILL ONLY SLOWLY 
INCREASE RAIN CHANCES FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT. SATURDAY STILL HAVE 
HIGH CHANCES. INSTABILITY INCREASES AS WELL SO MORE THUNDERSTORM 
ACTIVITY WITH HEAVY RAINFALL A THREAT AND POSSIBLE STRONG STORMS 
AHEAD OF A WEAK COLD FRONT. THIS FRONT DISSIPATES OVER THE REGION 
SUNDAY BUT A BROAD TROUGH REMAINS KEEPING SKIES PARTLY TO MOSTLY 
CLOUDY AND GOOD CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND STORMS. THE ECMWF EVEN TRIES 
TO SHOW A WEAK UPPER LOW FORMING OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES AND TN 
VALLEY EARLY TO MID WEEK. PATTERN SUGGESTS CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND 
STORMS EACH AFTERNOON AND EVENING DECREASING OVERNIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL STAY NEAR TO SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL AS 
WELL.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...NORTHWESTERLY WINDS ON THE BACK 
SIDE OF AN UPPER TROUGH IN PLACE ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. WILL 
CONTINUE TO BRING FRESH...COOL CANADIAN AIR INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION. THE DRY...STABLE AIR WILL KEEP THE CU RATHER 
FLAT TODAY AS WELL. DESPITE A FAIR AMOUNT OF MID JULY 
SUNSHINE...HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW NORMAL 
TOPPING OUT IN THE 70S ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA 
WITH LOWER 80S OVER THE SOUTH. THE SURFACE MAY RADIATE EFFICIENTLY 
TONIGHT IN THE DRY AIR AND LIGHT WIND ENVIRONMENT WHICH MAY LEAD TO 
THE FORMATION OF FOG IN SOME OF THE SHELTERED VALLEYS AND ALONG 
WATERWAYS SO KEPT THIS IDEA GOING FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)... THE MID/UPPER LONGWAVE 
TROUGH AXIS WILL BE EAST OF THE AREA ON THURSDAY. A SECONDARY 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE WEST ON FRIDAY. MODEL QPF 
DEPICTIONS WITH THIS TROUGH VARY WIDELY...WITH THE ECMWF BEING QUITE 
WET AS EARLY AS FRIDAY...WHILE THE NAM STAYS DRY UNTIL SATURDAY. 
GIVEN THE LOW CONFIDENCE...WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE FRIDAY 
AND FRIDAY NIGHT...RISING TO LIKELY SATURDAY WHEN THERE IS BETTER 
CONSENSUS AMONG THE MODELS AND AMONG GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS. 

A BROAD AND WEAK TROUGH LINGERS OVER THE REGION FOR THE REST OF THE 
FORECAST PERIOD. THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE IN THE WAY OF FORCING 
FOR LIFT...SO CONFIDENCE IS LOW. PRECIP CHANCES WILL LIKELY DEPEND 
ON DIURNAL HEATING. THUS WILL HAVE LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EACH 
DAY...AND STAY MAINLY DRY AT NIGHT. WILL HAVE A GENERAL WARMING 
TREND EACH DAY...BUT WILL STAY BELOW THE GFS MOS GUIDANCE WHICH 
SEEMS TOO WARM.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...PASSAGE OF TODAY'S 
COLD FRONT WILL BRING IN THE ADVERTISED PLEASANT RATHER UNLIKE JULY 
WEATHER INTO THURSDAY EVENING. MODELS STILL AGREE IN GENERAL ON A 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH DEVELOPING IN THE CENTRAL PLAINS ON THURSDAY... 
THEN MOVING SE INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION BY FRIDAY. 
THERE ARE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AND STRENGTH...SUCH THAT 
I THINK DIURNAL CONVECTION WITH THIS FEATURE MAY END TO OUR WEST 
THURSDAY NIGHT. THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH WOULD APPEAR TO TRACK NE LATE 
FRIDAY...SO INCREASING RAIN CHANCES WOULD OCCUR FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY. MADE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS TO THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY GRIDS 
TO REFLECT THIS SCENARIO.

UPPER PATTERN KEEPS RIDGING IN THE WESTERN STATES AND SOME DEGREE OF 
TROUGHING EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.  
THUS...I HAD TO ALLOW FOR AT LEAST DIURNAL CONVECTION FROM SUNDAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY. CHANCE POPS DAYTIME AND SLIGHT CHANCE NIGHTTIME 
LOOKED REASONABLE FOR NOW. CLOSELY FOLLOWED THE 12Z GFSX MOS TEMPS

THE FRONT...LIMITING DIURNAL CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. THIS
EVENING AS THE INVERSION WEAKENS...SOME ADDITIONAL STRONG STORMS
SHOULD CONTINUE TO DEVELOP OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS WHILE
INSTABILITY VALUES WILL STILL BE APPRECIABLE. MOST OF THIS
ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE INTO THE REGION FROM MIDDLE
TENNESSEE/CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND TRACK ALONG AND NORTH OF THE I-40
CORRIDOR.

LATER ON TONIGHT...THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD BEGIN TO INCREASE IN
COVERAGE AS THE FRONT PUSHES SOUTH AND SERVES AS A FOCUS FOR THE
ABUNDANT GULF MOISTURE IN PLACE. HOWEVER...THE HRRR IN PARTICULAR
IS STILL VERY PESSIMISTIC ON THE WIDESPREAD HEAVIER PRECIPITATION
CHANCES TONIGHT...AND SHOWS THE COMPLEX OVER WESTERN/MIDDLE
TENNESSEE MOVING SOUTH INTO ALABAMA AND NOT FILLING IN BACK NORTH
AND EAST. THE NAM IS A BIT MORE OPTIMISTIC ON PRECIPITATION
CHANCES...BUT DOES NOT SHOW ANY ROBUST QPF SIGNALS UNTIL LATER
TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING ALONG THE FRONT ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS
AND SOUTHERN VALLEY. WITH PWATS BETWEEN 1.5 TO 1.8 INCHES AND A
SOLID BOUNDARY IN PLACE TO FOCUS THE MOISTURE...STILL FEEL THAT
LIKELY POPS WERE WARRANTED OVER MUCH OF THE AREA THIS EVENING AND
LOW-END CATEGORICAL ALONG THE SOUTHERN ZONES LATE TONIGHT.
HOWEVER... GIVEN THE RECENT TRENDS HAVE LOWERED POPS CONSIDERABLY
AREAWIDE IN THE EVENING AND ACROSS THE NORTHERN ZONES LATER
TONIGHT. 

SHOULD COVERAGE INCREASE LATE TONIGHT THERE WILL BE A FAVORABLE
SET-UP FOR LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL GIVEN THE HIGH PWAT VALUES...
BOUNDARY...AND A DEEP WARM CLOUD LAYER. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE LACK
OF STORM COVERAGE TO THIS POINT THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...DO NOT
EXPECT ANY WIDESPREAD FLOODING ISSUES ATTM. BUT...WILL CONTINUE TO
MONITOR SHOWER/STORM COVERAGE AND PRECIPITATION TRENDS OVERNIGHT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...A LINE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING IN ADVANCE OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT.  THE AIR MASS IS 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE AND CAPES ARE APPROACHING 2500 J/KG.  
ADDITIONALLY...ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS IN PLACE WITH PWS 1.5 
TO 2 INCHES.  WITH ALL THIS...A FEW STORMS ANY BECOME STRONG TO 
SEVERE.  THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE STRONG AND DAMAGING WINDS BUT 
MARGINAL HAIL IS ALSO POSSIBLE.  ALSO...HEAVY RAIN MAY CAUSE 
LOCALIZED FLOODING.  ADDITIONAL BANDS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.  850MB JET 
DYNAMICS IMPROVES OVERNIGHT BUT AIR MASS WILL BE STABILIZING AND 
EXPECT THE MAIN THREAT FROM THE OVERNIGHT CONVECTION TO BE HEAVY 
RAIN AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING.  THE SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
SLOWLY EXIT THE AREA ON TUESDAY WITH DRIER AND COOLER AIR SLOWLY 
FILTERING IN LATE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...DRIER AND COOLER WEATHER 
TO START OUT THE LONG TERM BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. THIS LEADS TO A 
COUPLE OF VERY NICE DAYS FOR BOTH WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...WITH LOWS 
IN THE 50S AND HIGHS MOSTLY IN THE 70S TO LOWER 80S.

HOWEVER...AN UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN QUICKLY SETS UP FOR FRDIAY 
INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...AS A TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE MID MS VALLEY 
FRIDAY THEN MOVES SLOWLY EAST TOWARD THE OHIO AND TN VALLEYS OVER 
THE WEEKEND.

RAIN CHANCES WERE REQUIRED FOR JUST ABOUT EVERY PERIOD FOR FRIDAY 
THROUGH MONDAY...BUT MY CONFIDENCE WAS TOO LOW TO GO LIKEY ON POPS 
JUST YET. MODELS CONSISTENT IN ADVERTISING BEST RAIN CHANCES FOR 
FRIDAY OR SATURDAY...BUT PREFER TO WAIT ANOTHER MODEL RUN OR TWO 
BEFORE CHOOSING THE BETTER DAY FOR LIKELY POPS.

ONGOING CONVECTION ACROSS KY WILL SLOWLY MAKE ITS WAY SOUTH TODAY. 
ACTIVITY IN OUR CWA IS EXPECTED TO BLOSSOM AROUND OR SHORTLY AFTER 
18Z. NAM FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW MLCAPE VALUES AROUND 2500 J/KG...SO 
THERE WILL BE A THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS. WITH A LARGE SURFACE-TO-
MIDLEVEL THETA-E DIFFERENCE...DOWNBURST WINDS APPEAR TO BE THE
BIGGEST THREAT. MARGINAL HAIL MAY BE POSSIBLE GIVEN THE HIGH
CAPE...THOUGH FREEZING LEVEL HEIGHTS ARE QUITE HIGH. THE HIGHEST
THREAT AREA THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SW
VA...THEN SHIFT SOUTHWARD IN THE EVENING. THE BEST SYNOPTIC FORCING
OCCURS OVERNIGHT WHEN UPPER DIVERGENCE IS ENHANCED BY THE JET AND
THE SURFACE FRONT DRAWS NEAR. WITH PW VALUES NEARING 2
INCHES...HEAVY RAIN IS EXPECTED WITH LOCALIZED FLOODING POSSIBLE.
POPS WILL BE CATEGORICAL ALL NIGHT GIVEN THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF THE
SYSTEM.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
UNSETTLED DURING THE EXTENDED FORECAST. FOR TUESDAY...COLD FRONT
AND UPPER FORCING DUE TO RIGHT ENTRACE REGION OF THE JET WILL MOVE
EAST WITH WIDESPREAD MORNING SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS DIMINISHING
DURING THE AFTERNOON/EVENING HOURS MAIN CONCERN WILL BE POTENTIAL
OF LOCALIZED FLASH FLOODING ISSUES AS 2 TO 3 INCH RAINFALL
POSSIBLE.

UNSEASONALLY STRONG FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA WITH PLEASANTLY 
COOL AND DRIER AIR ANTICIPATED FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. ANOTHER 
UPPER TROUGH MOVES INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. UPPER FORCING DUE TO ANOTHER JET WILL PULL 
SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS BACK INTO THE AREA. INITIALLY INSTABILITY IS 
LACKING...BUT WILL INCREASE BY SATURDAY. UNCERTAIN ON AMOUNT OF 
MOISTURE/INSTABILITY AVAILABLE FOR POTENTIAL OF SEVERE WEATHER FOR

A QUIET EVENING CONTINUES ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AS HIGH
PRESSURE HAS GENERALLY SUPPRESSED ANY AFTERNOON CONVECTION...
RESULTING IN A MOSTLY DRY DAY ACROSS THE REGION. THERE ARE A FEW
SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS NORTHERN MIDDLE TENNESSEE THAT COULD MOVE
INTO THE NORTHERN PLATEAU BEFORE MIDNIGHT...BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING
THE WEATHER WILL REMAIN DRY FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT. TO THE NORTH...A
SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT HAS KICKED OFF A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS ALONG
THE OHIO RIVER. THIS ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE TO GRADUALLY PUSH
SOUTH TOWARD THE KENTUCKY/VIRGINIA/TENNESSEE STATE BORDERS LATE
TONIGHT...AND CREATE THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND
STORMS MOVING INTO THE NORTHERN ZONES AROUND DAYBREAK. GIVEN THE
LATEST SPEED AND TRAJECTORY OF THIS ACTIVITY...THINK THAT IT WILL
MOSTLY STAY OUT OF THE REGION UNTIL AFTER 12Z...BUT HAVE A SOLID
CHANCE POPS ALONG THE NORTHERN ZONES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE POTENTIAL
OF THIS ACTIVITY ARRIVING EARLIER. ADDITIONALLY...HAVE REMOVED
MENTIONABLE POPS FROM THE FAR SOUTHERN PLATEAU/VALLEY AND SOUTHWEST

THUS...IT APPEARS THAT STRONG TO SEVERE TSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE

WINDS...LARGE HAIL...AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL BEING THE MAIN
THREATS. THE FORECAST AREA WILL ALSO BECOME LOCATED UNDER THE RIGHT

THESE FAVORABLE UPPER- LEVEL JET DYNAMICS INCREASING THE SYNOPTIC-

AN ACTIVE EXTENDED TIME-FRAME WITH AN USUALLY STRONG UPPER TROUGH

VALLEY UNDER FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION FOR LATE MONDAY THROUGH
TUESDAY. FOR MONDAY...PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND/OR CONVECTIVE COMPLEX
INITALLY OVER THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY WILL LIKELY BE A FOCUS FOR
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT DURING THE AFTERNOON/EVENING. SOME OF
THESE STORMS WILL LIKELY BE SEVERE DUE TO MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOWING
MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS...INCREASING BOUNDARY FLOW AND MID-
LEVEL DRY AIR. ALSO...FAVORABLE HAIL CAPE AND WET-BULB ZERO HEIGHTS
TO PRODUCE MARGINAL SEVERE HAIL.

DUE TO PRO-LONG RIGHT ENTRACE REGION PRODUCING DIVERGENCE ALOFT OVER

WITH DEWPOINTS RISING INTO THE MID-UPPER 60S IN THE PAST FEW HOURS AND
ONLY A 5 DEGREE TEMP-DEWPOINT SPREAD AT TRI...FOG APPEARS TO BE
LIKELY...WITH AT LEAST MVFR CONDTIONS EXPECTED AT TRI. HOWEVER
THERE ARE SOME CLOUDS APPROACHING FROM THE NW THAT COULD HAMPER FOG
DEVELOPMENT. THE REST OF THE DAY WILL SEE BROKEN MIDLEVEL CLOUD
COVER MOVING IN FROM THE NORTH...WITH SW WINDS 5-10 KTS. THERE
COULD BE A FEW SHOWERS AROUND BUT CHANCES OF ONE HITTING A TAF SITE
ARE TOO LOW TO WARRANT A MENTION IN THE TAFS NOW.

.DISCUSSION...
DIURNALLY DRIVEN CONVECTION HAS QUICKLY DISSIPATED THIS EVENING
WITH THE LOSS OF THE SUN...RESULTING IN A PARTLY CLOUDY SKY. THIS
CLOUD COVER SHOULD GRADUALLY CONTINUE TO DISSIPATE FURTHER
RESULTING IN A MOSTLY CLEAR NIGHT ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. AS A
RESULT...TEMPERATURES SHOULD DROP OFF FAIRLY QUICKLY AFTER
SUNSET...THOUGH LOWS WILL BE WARMER TONIGHT IN THE MID 60S TO LOWER
70S. THE MOSTLY CLEAR AND CALM CONDITIONS ALONG WITH THE MOIST
BOUNDARY LAYER WILL ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME PATCHY FOG
TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY ALONG AREA RIVERS AND LAKES. THUS...HAVE
ADDED THIS TO THE FORECAST LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY SUNDAY MORNING.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS
SHOWS A WEAK AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS...WITH A WARM AND HUMID AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA.
AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION DEVELOPING AROUND THE
APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS AND CUMBERLAND PLATEAU THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH
SHOULD GRADUALLY DIMINISH AFTER THE SUN SETS. CONVECTION IS EXPECTED
TO DEVELOP AGAIN BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...BUT WITH INSTABILITY PROGGED
TO INCREASE A LITTLE MORE ON SUNDAY...THINK THAT THE CONVECTIVE
COVERAGE WILL BE A LITTLE BETTER OVER THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. AN
UNSEASONABLY STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS THEN PROGGED TO AMPLIFY
OVER THE EASTERN HALF THE NATION BY SUNDAY NIGHT...WHICH WILL PUSH
A COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY. MODELS INDICATE
THAT A VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS COULD DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA
BY MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...ALONG WITH FAIRLY STRONG (FOR THIS
TIME OF YEAR) UPPER- LEVEL WINDS. THUS...IT APPEARS THAT AN FAIRLY
EXTENSIVE LINE OF STRONG TO SEVERE TSTORMS WILL DEVELOP OVER THE OHIO
RIVER VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT...AND WILL THEN EVENTUALLY BRING DAMAGING
WINDS...LARGE HAIL...AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL ACROSS THE FORECAST
AREA BY MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...AND
WILL COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE
NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE AREA ON TUESDAY.  HOWEVER...BEFORE IT PULLS THROUGH LATE 
IN THE DAY...WILL CONTINUE TO SEE SCATTERED CONVECTION ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ESPECIALLY DURING THE MORNING HOURS.  
BEHIND THE FRONT...SEASONALLY COOL AND DRY AIR WILL MOVE IN.  ONLY 
CONCERN WILL BE THE EXITING FRONT.  IT IS EXPECTED TO PUSH THROUGH 
THE MRX CWA AND STALL TO OUR SOUTH EARLY IN THE EXTENDED.  A SERIES 
OF WEAK DISTURBANCES WILL MOVE ALONG IT...TRACKING JUST TO OUR SOUTH

WITH A LARGE MIDLEVEL RIDGE REMAINING IN PLACE OVER THE SE TODAY...A 
PERSISTENCE FORECAST WILL BE FOLLOWED. AS WAS THE CASE 
YESTERDAY...SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO 
DEVELOP OVER SW NC AND THE SMOKIES THIS AFTERNOON. THE LATEST NAM 
ALSO SHOWS DEVELOPMENT IN SW VA ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK VORT MAX. 
THIS MAY BE OVERDONE...BUT WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP THERE AS 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS ARE NOT QUITE AS CAPPED AS YESTERDAY. ANY 
CONVECTION SHOULD DISSIPATE WITH SUNSET. TEMPERATURES TODAY SHOULD 
TOP OUT AROUND 90 IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS AGAIN TODAY...WITH LOWS 
TONIGHT BETWEEN 65 AND 70.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)... 
AN UNUSUALLY STRONG UPPER TROUGH WILL DIVE INTO THE GREAT LAKES
FOR SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. THIS TROUGH WILL PULL A COLD FRONT
THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR MONDAY
NIGHT AND TUESDAY. A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH WILL LIKELY MOVE THROUGH
LATE MONDAY. MODELS SHOW SOME DIFFERENCES IN RESPECT TO
STRENGTH/LOCATION OF THE UPPER JET OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WITH
ASSOCIATED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION.

THE NAM SHOWS FAIRLY STRONG UPPER DIVERGENCE OVER THE AREA FOR 
MONDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. AIRMASS AHEAD OF THE BOUNDARY WILL BECOME 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE. INCREASING LOW-LEVEL JET DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF 
THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND SOME MID-LEVEL DRY AIR WILL SET THE STAGE 
FOR POTENTIAL OF DAMAGING WINDS FOR LATE MONDAY. ALSO...ENOUGH HAIL 
CAPE AND FAVORABLE WBZ HEIGHTS FOR LARGE HAIL. WILL CONTINUE TO 
HIGHLIGHT THE POTENTIAL OF SEVERE WEATHER MONDAY AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING.

FOR THE REST OF THE EXTENDED...AN UPPER TROUGH WILL DOMINATE WITH 
PLEASANT AIRMASS FOR JULY OVER THE AREA. RETURN MOISTURE/INSTABILITY 
FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY TO INCLUDE A CHANCE OF MAINLY

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS
SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT STRETCHING GENERALLY ALONG THE EASTERN
FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A DRIER AIR MASS OVER
THE FORECAST AREA (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY). AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME
ISOLATED CONVECTION DEVELOPING OVER WESTERN NC AND NORTHEAST GA THIS
AFTERNOON...AND THINK THIS CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SHOULD STAY CONFINED
TO THE NC SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS THIS EVENING. ISOLATED DIURNAL
CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AGAIN OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND
SOUTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU ON SATURDAY...AS A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE
AIR MASS DEVELOPS DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. INSTABILITY
IS PROGGED TO INCREASE SOME MORE ON SUNDAY...AS MOISTURE SLOWLY
INCREASES OVER THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL
A MID-LEVEL STABLE LAYER BETWEEN 700 AND 500 MB...WHICH SHOULD HELP
TO LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF CONVECTION. THUS...FOR NOW WILL ONLY MENTION
ISOLATED CONVECTION ON SUNDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE
NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH MINS FOR TONIGHT (WHERE A
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO SEEMS BEST)...BUT BOTH ARE THEN IN GOOD
AGREEMENT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD 
FRONT...WILL SEE A LINE OF CONVECTION DEVELOP AND MOVE THROUGH THE 
AREA LATE ON MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT...AND EVEN CONTINUE INTO TUESDAY
FOR HIGH CHANCE/LIKELY POPS. THE AIR MASS WILL BE MOIST...AND WEAK TO
MODERATELY UNSTABLE. THIS COMBINED WITH A 850MB JET WILL ALLOW A
LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP AND MOVE THROUGH THE AREA. SOME OF
THESE STORMS MAY BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS. A FEW SHOWERS MAY

A FLAT RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY
FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WITH A GRADUAL INCREASE IN
MOISTURE/INSTABILITY. ONLY FORCING FOR CONVECTION WITH BE
OROGRAPHIC..SO WILL HAVE POPS MAINLY OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY...AN UNUSUALLY STRONG UPPER LOW WILL DROP 
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION. STRONG UPPER TROUGHING WILL BE OVER 
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH A COLD FRONT PASSAGE 
FOR LATE MONDAY NIGHT/TUESDAY. INCREASING INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THE

NIGHT AND TUESDAY. DUE TO THE STRENGTH OF THE FRONT FOR JULY AND 
DECENT INSTABILITY...I AM CONCERNED FOR STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS FOR 
MONDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. MAIN CONCERN WILL BE DAMAGING WINDS.

WILL CALL FOR HIGH CHANCE/LIKELY POPS FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH 
TUESDAY. AS TIMING OF FROPA AND POTENTIAL OF PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH 
BECOMES MORE CLEAR...CATEGORICAL POPS WILL LIKELY BE NEEDED.

AN UNSEASONABLY COOL AIRMASS SPILLS INTO THE AREA FOR WEDNESDAY AND

PLATEAU AND CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS...WITH A VERY HUMID AIR MASS
LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH DEWPOINTS STILL IN THE MID TO
UPPER 60S. AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION DEVELOPING
ALONG THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND ALONG THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. THIS
WEAK COLD FRONT WILL ONLY SLOWLY DRIFT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA
THIS EVENING...AND WILL PROBABLY STALL OUT SOMEWHERE AROUND THE
APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. AS A RESULT...ISOLATED
DIURNAL CONVECTION SHOULD DEVELOP OVER THE MOUNTAINS ON FRIDAY AND
SATURDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD
AGREEMENT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL TREND A LITTLE WARMER
THEN GUIDANCE WITH MINS TONIGHT SINCE THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS MOVING
SLOWER THAN THE MODELS EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THOUGH THURSDAY)...ZONAL FLOW ALOFT ON SUNDAY INTO
MONDAY WITH A WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVING THROUGH WILL ALLOW FOR A CHANCE
OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS WITH BEST CHANCE OVER NORTHERN LOCATIONS AND
EASTERN MOUNTAINS. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE IN MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY.
THIS WILL PROVIDE OUR BEST CHANCE OF ORGANIZED CONVECTION THROUGH THE
PERIOD. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO SETTLE TO OUR SOUTH
THROUGH THE REST OF THE EXTENDED...AND WILL ACT AS A FOCUS FOR
ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
A WEAK COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO SLOWLY EASE ITS WAY INTO THE REGION
THIS MORNING...AND HAS ALLOWED FOR A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS ALONG
THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. THIS ACTIVITY WILL
LINGER THROUGH DAYBREAK AND THEN BRIEFLY DISSIPATE AS THE FRONT
MIXES OUT FURTHER TO THE SOUTH DURING THE DAY. HOWEVER...WITH THIS
REMNANT BOUNDARY IN PLACE SOME ADDITIONAL SCATTERED CONVECTION IS
EXPECTED LATE THIS MORNING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE
MOST FAVORED AREAS FOR THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE ALONG TN/NC MOUNTAINS
AND SOUTHWEST VA THANKS TO OROGRAPHIC LIFT AND DAYTIME
HEATING...BUT SOME AT LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION WILL
BE POSSIBLE AREAWIDE ONCE AGAIN. AS DRIER AIR FILTERS INTO THE
REGION...CLOUDS AND STORM COVERAGE WILL BE LESS WHICH WILL ALLOW
FOR MORE HEATING AND HIGHS RETURNING TO THE MID TO UPPER 80S ONCE
MORE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. CLEARING WILL BEGIN
OVERNIGHT...WHICH WILL ALLOW LOWS TO DROP INTO THE LOWER 60S IN
MANY AREAS...ALONG WITH PATCHY FOG DEVELOPMENT NEAR BODIES OF
WATER.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
UPPER HEIGHTS RISING EARLY IN THE LONG TERM PERIOD...SO KEEPING
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY DRY FOR MOST AREAS. SOME DIURNAL CONVECTION
LOOKS POSSIBLE BY SUNDAY...AS THE UPPER RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS WESTWARD
WITH THE UPPER LOW/TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER THE GREAT LAKES INTO
EASTERN CANADA. HOWEVER...POPS IN THE 20 TO 30 PERCENT RANGE SHOULD
BE SUFFICIENT.

NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT NOTED BY MONDAY WITH A COLD FRONT ALSO 
APPROACHING. LONG RANGE MODELS DIFFER SLIGHTLY ON TIMING THESE 
FEATURES...WHICH COULD LEAD TO HIGHEST RAIN CHANCES ON EITHER MONDAY 
OR TUESDAY. MOS TRENDING A BIT HIGHER ON TUESDAY POPS...SO NUDGED 
RAIN CHANCES UP BY AROUND 10 PERCENT. A LITTLE DRIER AND COOLER FOR 
WEDNESDAY. 

FOR TEMPS...GFSX AND ECMX MOS TEMPS SIMILAR THROUGH THE LONG TE

SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER CENTRAL KY...STRETCHING GENERALLY ALONG
A LINE FROM CLARKSVILLE TN TO LEXINGTON KY TO HUNTINGTON WV. A WARM

MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT...AS IT SLOWLY

A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE EASTERN U.S. UPPER
TROUGH WILL HAVE LIFTED OUT THROUGH THE CANADIAN MARITIMES BY THE

IN PLACE. GRADUALLY SUNDAY INTO MONDAY THE HIGH RETROGRADES BACK
THROUGH THE WESTERN STATES WHILE ANOTHER LONG WAVE TROUGH PREPARES
TO TAKE UP RESIDENCE OVER THE MUCH OF THE EASTERN U.S. MOISTURE AND
INSTABILITY WILL INCREMENTALLY INCREASE SUNDAY FOR SOME DIURNAL
CONVECTION SO KEPT POPS IN A LOW CHANCE RANGE WHILE ADJUSTING
PROBABILITIES A LITTLE HIGHER MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT AS MODELS BRING
A SHORT WAVE ACROSS THE REGION ENHANCING THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION.
TAPERED POPS BACK ONLY SLIGHTLY ON TUESDAY AS A COOL FRONT WILL BE
MAKING ITS WAY SOUTH TOWARD THE REGION AND THIS BOUNDARY COULD
SPARK SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. TRIED TO KEEP JUST A SLIGHT
CHANCE FOR CONVECTION GOING ON WEDNESDAY AS MODELS HINT AT THE

PROGRESSIVE INITIAL PARTS OF SYSTEM WILL SWEEP THROUGH...THEN AS 
FRONT SAGS INTO AREA RICHER MOISTURE WILL BE SOUTH OR EAST OF THE 
AREA.  SO A COUPLE OF CHANCES FOR PRECIP...THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS 
EVENING WITH ADVANCING STRONG STORMS THAT MARCH ACROSS TO THE 
EAST...THEN ALSO ANOTHER CHANCE TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS THE MAIN 
AXIS OF THE SYSTEM MOVE THROUGH THE AREA FROM THE NORTH/NORTHWEST. 

DEEP CONVECTION STRUGGLING FINALLY GETTING STARTED.  MLCAPE VALUES
GETTING PRETTY HIGH...SO STILL THINK SEVERE THREAT EXISTS. ALSO
WONDERING ABOUT HOW STRONG ANY STORMS THAT DEVELOP CLOSER TO THE
FRONT MIGHT BE IF THEY MAKE THEIR WAY CLOSER TONIGHT...THINKING THE
STORMS THIS AFTERNOON ARE OUR BEST CHANCE FOR SEVERE OVERALL.

FOR TEMPERATURES KEEPING PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE FOR MINS TONIGHT 
AND ON THE COOL SIDE OF MAXES FOR WEDNESDAY...CONSIDERING THE 
LIMITED SUNSHINE...ESPECIALLY SOUTH.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO 
BE IN FAIR AGREEMENT OVERALL WITH DECENT RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY. 
HOWEVER...GIVEN UNCERTAINTIES IN MODEL HANDLING OF POSSIBLE WEAK 
IMPULSES IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS AT BEST 
AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. THE FRONT SHOULD FINALLY EXIT THE 
AREA EARLY THURSDAY...BUT A WEAK IMPULSE STILL COULD HELP TO TRIGGER 
SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION INTO THURSDAY AFTERNOON.  
DRIER AIR SHOULD KEEP THINGS PRECIP FREE THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
FRIDAY NIGHT...THEN MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE AGAIN DURING THE 
WEEKEND.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SATURDAY AND CHANCE POPS 
SUNDAY.  ANOTHER FRONTAL SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO AFFECT THE AREA EARLY 
IN THE WEEK...SO CHANCE POPS BOTH MONDAY AND TUESDAY.

WEAK CONVECTION OVER MIDDLE TN CONTINUING TO FURTHER WEAKEN.
LOOKING MORE AND MORE LIKE THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE FOR THIS LINE
AND THEN NEW CONVECTION EXPECTED TO DEVELOP ON OR NEAR THE PLATEAU
IN EARLY AFTERNOON HEATING OR ALONG LEFT OVER BOUNDARIES. UPPER
FLOW SHOULD BRING THIS CONVECTION OUT INTO THE VALLEY DURING THE
AFTERNOON. SOME SEVERE THREAT THIS AFTERNOON AS MOIST UNSTABLE AIR
MASS WILL BE IN PLACE AS THE STORMS MOVE INTO THE AREA. BEST WIND
PROFILE WILL BE NORTH OF THE AREA...SO STORMS WILL LIKELY BE MOSTLY
ONLY MODERATELY ORGANIZED MULTICELL SEVERE. STILL GOOD CHANCE OF
DAMAGING OUTFLOW WINDS FROM STRONGER CELLS...ALONG WITH SEVERE
HAIL...ROUGHLY UP TO 1 OR 1.5 INCH. FLOODING THREAT NOW SEEMS LESS
THAN EARLIER...AS SYSTEM IS LOOKING MORE PROGRESSIVE. TORNADO

CAPES OF AT LEAST 1500 TO 2000 J/KG. WIND SHEAR IS MINIMAL IN
GENERAL...BUT POSSIBLY GREATER THAN 25 KNOTS OVER NRN PARTS OF E TN
AS WELL AS SW VA. SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE STORMS OVER THE BULK OF

LIKELY POPS OR BETTER LATE TODAY FOR NRN AREAS...WITH THIS SWATH OF
HIGH POPS SPREADING SE THIS EVENING. DEFINITELY A FEW DEGREES
COOLER THIS AFTERNOON FOR SW VA AND NE TN...WITH A MOS BLEND
CLOSELY FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM.../WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
A WEAK COLD FRONT IN ASSOCIATION WITH A BROAD UPPER-TROUGH OVER THE 
GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY WILL CONTINUE TO SAG INTO THE REGION ON 
WEDNESDAY...BRINGING ANOTHER SOLID CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS 
AREAWIDE. AS A RESULT...HAVE INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY DURING THIS 
PERIOD GIVEN THIS BOUNDARY AND THE ABUNDANT MOISTURE IN PLACE... 
ALONG WITH GOOD MODEL CONFIDENCE. THIS ACTIVITY WILL GRADUALLY SAG 
SOUTH OF THE REGION AND DISSIPATE BY WEDNESDAY EVENING/NIGHT WITH 
THE FRONT BEFORE ANOTHER ROUND OF SCATTERED ACTIVITY MAY BE POSSIBLE 
ON THURSDAY WITH ANOTHER WEAK IMPULSE MOVING THROUGH THE REGION. IN 
ADDITION TO THE PRECIPITATION CHANCES...CLOUD COVER WILL ALSO LIMIT 
HEATING AND RESULT IN SOME SLIGHTLY COOLER HIGHS WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY. 

A SLIGHT WARMING AND CLEARING TREND WILL BE IN STORE FOR FRIDAY AND 
THE WEEKEND AS DRY AIR INITIALLY FILTERS IN ALOFT AND AN UPPER RIDGE 
BUILDS IN FROM THE WEST. THIS WILL ALLOW HIGHS TO ONCE AGAIN REACH 
THE UPPER 80S AND LOWER 90S...WITH A MAINLY QUIET POP FORECAST 
THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. MOISTURE WILL GRADUALLY WORK ITS WAY BACK

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...TONIGHT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY 
CALM. THERE MIGHT BE A STRAY SHOWER OR STORM LINGER ACROSS SWNC BUT 
THEY SHOULD DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET. LOOK FOR CLOUDS TO SLOWLY BE ON 
THE INCREASE OVERNIGHT INTO TOMORROW MORNING FROM N TO S OUT AHEAD
OF OUR NEXT SYSTEM. TEMPS WILL BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER TONIGHT AREA
WIDE.

THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE SHORT TERM WILL BE ON TOMORROW. HIGH
PRESSURE HAS FINALLY MOVED OFF TO OUR EAST AS A BROAD UPPER LEVEL
TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE NW. CURRENT
MODELS ARE A LITTLE SLOWER WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE FRONT SO WILL
TRIM BACK POPS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE NIGHT TO ONLY INCLUDE OUR
NORTHERN AREAS INSTEAD OF THE WHOLE CENTRAL VALLEY. MIDLEVEL FLOW
REVEALS A SUBTLE SHORTWAVE OUT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT THAT WILL BE
THE REASON FOR THE ONSET OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS LATE TONIGHT INTO
EARLY TUESDAY MORNING.

MODELS ARE INDICATING THAT THERE COULD BE A DECAYING MCS ACROSS THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY DOWN INTO CENTRAL KY BY TOMORROW MORNING. HOW FAR 
SOUTH THIS ACTIVITY MOVES COULD EFFECT OUR STORMS TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON. MODELS SHOW THAT THIS DECAYING MCS COULD YIELD SOME 
SHOWERS AND A FEW STORMS TOMORROW MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON WITH 
THE MAIN ACTIVITY TO FOLLOW LATER. MODELS THEN SHOW A REGENERATION 
OF CONVECTION THAT SHOULD ARRIVE TUESDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING FROM OUT 
OF THE NW JUST AHEAD OF THE FRONT. THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT LOOKS TO 
TAKE PLACE SOMEWHERE ACROSS CENTRAL KY AND WILL MOVE SOUTH INTO OUR 
AREA FROM THERE. THEREFORE...POP CHANCES WILL INCREASE STARTING 
TUESDAY MORNING AND CONTINUE TO DO SO THROUGH THE DAY AS WE AWAIT 
THE NEW AFTERNOON DEVELOPMENT. DEPENDING ON YOUR MODEL OF 
CHOICE...CAPE FIELDS SHOULD BE IN THE 1500 TO 2000 J/KG RANGE BY 
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

HAVING SAID ALL THAT...THE BEST DYNAMICS APPEAR TO BE JUST TO OUR 
NORTH AS FAR AS MID/UPPER LEVEL FLOW AS WELL AS SHEAR AND HELICITY 
FIELDS...SO THE BEST CHANCE OF SEVERE STORMS APPEARS TO BE JUST TO 
OUR NORTH. HOWEVER...BEING RIGHT ON THE EXTREME SOUTHERN FRINGE OF 
THESE DYNAMICS WILL STILL BEAR KEEPING AN EYE ON AS SOME STRONG TO 
SEVERE STORMS COULD STILL OCCUR ACROSS PARTS OF OUR AREA. BASED ON
THE AFOREMENTIONED SETUP....THE NORTHERN PLATEAU...NORTHERN
VALLEY...AND NETN AND SWVA LOOK TO HAVE BETTER CHANCES OF SEEING
STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS THAN THE REST OF OUR CWA. AS OF NOW...THE
MAIN THREATS WITH TOMORROWS STORMS APPEAR TO BE DAMAGING STRAIGHT
LINE WINDS AND HAIL. SPC HAS AREAS FROM KNOXVILLE NORTHWARD
INCLUDED IN THEIR SLIGHT RISK AREA FOR TOMORROW.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT 
AGREEMENT EARLY ON...WITH MORE DISAGREEMENT TOWARD THE END OF THE 
PERIOD.  FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS ABOUT AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. 
THE COLD FRONT APPROACHING TUESDAY NIGHT IS FORECAST TO PUSH THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY/WED NIGHT. EXPECT SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF THIS FRONT. DRIER AIR EXPECTED TO PUSH IN 
BEHIND THE FRONT...AND WILL GO WITH A PRECIP FREE FORECAST FOR 
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. ENOUGH MOISTURE/INSTABILITY MAY 
RETURN BY SATURDAY TO WARRANT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS...AT LEAST IN THE 
MOUNTAINS...AND ALL ZONES BY SUNDAY.  ECMWF HAS ANOTHER FRONT 
SAGGING TOWARD THE AREA BY MONDAY...ALTHOUGH GFS KEEPING IT FURTHER 
NORTH.  GIVEN UNCERTAINTY THAT FAR OUT WILL LEAN TOWARD A COMPROMISE 
AND JUST GO WITH CHANCE POPS MONDAY.

BROAD UPPER TROUGH AND COLD FRONT APPROACHING FROM THE NORTHWEST. 
THIS FEATURE SHOULD STAY JUST OFF TO OUR NW ON MONDAY AND WILL 
THEREFORE KEEP MONDAY DRY. WILL STAY CLOSER TO MEX GUIDANCE FOR 
HIGH TEMPS TOMORROW.
 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...NOT MUCH CHANGE FROM THE 
PREVIOUS THINKING...BUT THERE IS MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE POSSIBILITY 
OF NICE WEATHER FOR FRIDAY-SUNDAY. AS YOU RECALL...A WEAK FRONT WILL 
MOVE INTO THE AREA FOR THE MIDWEEK PERIOD...KEEPING OUR AREA UNDER 
SCATTERED CONVECTION TUES-THURS...BUT PEAKING TUESDAY NIGHT-WED. MAX 
TEMPS DURING THE EXTENDED SHOULD BE NEAR OR SLGTLY ABOVE NORMAL... 
WITH WET WEDNESDAY LIKELY BEING THE DAY WITH THE LEAST HEAT.

NOTED. MIN TEMPS WILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW NORMAL OVERALL... 
ALTHO PATCHY AREAS OF CLOUDS AROUND 7000 FEET HAVE BEEN KEEPING

SHOW A LARGER DIFFERENCE IN BOTH MAX AND MIN TEMPS...SUCH AS FROM 
RHP TO CHA.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...NEAR AVERAGE TEMPERATURES
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK. THE COOLER AND DRIER THAN AVERAGE
PATTERN THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE LATE LAST WEEK AND THIS WEEKEND WILL
CHANGE AS COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY MONDAY. SURFACE
HIGH MOVES EAST INTO THE GULF AND WARMER MOIST AIR MASS MORE
TYPICAL OF SUMMER REPLACES IT. MAV TEMPERATURES MUCH WARMER THAN
MET MONDAY. WILL FORECAST HIGHS UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S. DEW POINTS
RISE INTO THE LOWER TO MID 60S WITH THE GREATEST INCREASE IN
MOISTURE NORTHEAST. HAVE REMOVED RAIN CHANCES MONDAY NIGHT AS FRONT
WILL ONLY SLOWLY APPROACH FORECAST AREA AND NOT AFFECT REGION
UNTIL TUESDAY AT THE EARLIEST.

LOW PRESSURE AREA TO MOVE INTO GREAT LAKES TUESDAY AND THEN INTO
NE CANADA WEDNESDAY. THIS SYSTEM WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT INTO WEST
TN AND EASTERN KY BY WEDNESDAY. LOW RAIN CHANCES TUESDAY BUT BECOME
LIKELY MOST AREAS WEDNESDAY. AN UPPER TROUGH DIGS SOUTH ACROSS THE
EASTERN STATES THURSDAY WHICH MAY BE ENOUGH TO PUSH THE FRONT
THROUGH BY THURSDAY NIGHT WITH A DRY PERIOD THURSDAY NIGHT INTO
FRIDAY NIGHT. WILL HAVE ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FRIDAY. SATURDAY
UNCERTAIN IF FRONT MOVES BACK NORTH OR ANOTHER FRONT MAY MOVE SOUTH
AS UPPER TROUGH STAYS OVER EASTERN STATES. KEPT 20 PERCENT CHANCE
OF SHOWERS AND STORMS BECAUSE OF THIS UNCERTAINTY. TEMPERATURES
WILL STAY COOLER WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY WITH GOOD CHANCE OF
PRECIPITATION WEDNESDAY AND THEN WITH DRIER AND COOLER AIR MASS
BEHIND FRONT AND WITH UPPER TROUGH AT END OF FORECAST PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...SURFACE TROUGH MOVING EAST

THIS WILL RESULT IN A PREFRONTAL WESTERLY WIND SHIFT IN ADVANCE OF 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT. UPPER TROUGH...WITH RELATIVELY STRONG JET 
SEGMENT SWINGING THROUGH...WILL MOVE INTO MIDDLE TN TONIGHT PUSHING 
SURFACE COLD FRONT INTO E TN BY EARLY THU. AVAILABLE MOISTURE NOT

NORTHERN AREAS THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT. DRIER AIRMASS BUILDS INTO 
THE AREA ON THURSDAY WITH DEW POINTS FALLING INTO THE 50S. 
TEMPERATURES NEAR NORMAL. 

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/... 

A WEAK FRONT AND SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL CLEAR THE REGION THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...RESULTING IN A BEAUTIFUL SET-UP FOR INDEPENDENCE 
DAY WEEKEND. A COOLER AND DRIER POST FRONTAL AIR MASS WILL FILTER 
INTO THE REGION IN WAKE OF THIS BOUNDARY...AND RESULT IN CLEAR/SUNNY 
CONDITIONS WITH HIGHS IN THE 80 TO 85 DEGREE RANGE AND RH VALUES AT 
A VERY COMFORTABLE 30 TO 40 PERCENT IN THE AFTERNOON. THE WEATHER 
WILL BE PERFECT FOR OUTDOOR FAMILY ACTIVITIES AND FOR VIEWING 
FIREWORKS LATER ON IN THE EVENING...A VAST IMPROVEMENT FROM THE 
GLOOMY, COOL AND RAINY CONDITIONS WE EXPERIENCED LAST YEAR ON THE 
4TH! THESE CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST INTO SATURDAY...BEFORE A WEAK 
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE INITIATES A RETURN FLOW FROM THE GULF... 
INCREASING MOISTURE ACROSS THE REGION...AND ALLOWING FOR A SLIGHT 
WARMING TREND INTO THE UPPER 80S/LOWER 90S. HOWEVER...WITH A WEAK 
TROUGH AND FRONT STALLED OUT ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY FOR SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY...THE MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST INTO EARLY NEXT 
WEEK. EVENTUALLY THOUGH...THIS UPPER-WAVE WILL KICK THE FRONT SOUTH

MAIN CONCERN TODAY WILL BE CENTERED AROUND AN APPROACHING WEAK COLD 
FRONT.  IN ADVANCE OF THIS FEATURE... WILL SEE A FEW BANDS OF CLOUDS

MUGGY DAY. AS THE FRONT BEGINS TO MOVE IN LATE AFTERNOON AND INTO 
THE EVENING...A LINE OF CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AND MOVE 
THROUGH THE AREA.  THE FRONTAL DYNAMICS IS RATHER WEAK BUT THE AIR 
MASS HAS GOOD LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND WILL BE WEAK TO MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AND COULD SEE A STRAY STRONG TO SEVERE STORM DEVELOP.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT FOR MUCH OF THE PERIOD...ALTHOUGH MORE SOLUTION DIVERGENCE 
SHOWS UP LATE.  FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS A BIT ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS 
TIME OF YEAR.  COLD FRONT WILL BE EXITING THURSDAY AS UPPER TROUGH 
CONTINUES TO DIG IN.  MAY STILL BE SOME LINGERING CONVECTION MAINLY 
NORTHEAST ZONES ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE DAY.  COOLER AND DRIER AIR 
WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE FRONT AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN.  SHOULD BE 
QUITE PLEASANT FOR INDEPENDENCE DAY...WITH A GRADUAL WARMING TREND

WEEKEND...THEN MOISTURE WILL INCREASE ENOUGH FOR SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
BY MONDAY. BY TUESDAY ECMWF IS FASTER BRINGING THE NEXT UPPER TROUGH 
IN WITH A BETTER CHANCE FOR PRECIP...BUT GIVEN UNCERTAINTY THAT FAR 
OUT AND MODEL DISAGREEMENT WILL JUST KEEP THE CURRENT FORECAST OF 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TUESDAY.  WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM GFS MOS TEMPS.

A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD.
THE CONVECTION APPROACHING OVERNIGHT WILL BE LIMITED DUE TO LOW
INSTABILITY...SO HAVE LEFT MENTION OF RAIN OUT OF TAF AT THIS
TIME. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL INCREASE WITH FOG POSSIBLE AT EACH
SITE IN THE EARLY MORNING. KCHA AND KTYS COULD EXPERIENCE MVFR
CONDITIONS WITH KTRI AT IFR CONDITIONS. CONVECTION WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN AROUND 18Z...BUT LOW CONFIDENCE ON
THE COVERAGE WILL CAUSE VCTS TO REMAIN FOR NOW.

350 PM EDT TUE JUL 1 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...CAP HOLDING STRONG SO FAR THIS 
AFTERNOON.  EXPECTED TO WEAKEN SLOWLY OVERNIGHT...SO WILL KEEP SOME 
LIGHT POPS FOR STORMS IN NORTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS FOR TONIGHT. FOR
WEDNESDAY...BETTER CHANCES OF STORMS AS FRONT MOVES CLOSER TO AND
THROUGH THE AREA...BUT LEE TROUGH IN CAROLINAS WILL INDUCE PRE FRONTAL
VEERING OF WINDS AND WILL GREATLY LESSEN THE FOCUS ALONG THE FRONT.
THINKING THAT TERRAIN MAY BE AS MUCH OR MORE OF A FACTOR THAN THE
FRONT FOR WEDNESDAY. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW DECENT INSTABILITY FOR
WEDNESDAY IN THIS HOT/HUMID AIR MASS...SO STORMS COULD FLIRT WITH
SEVERE CRITERIA FOR THUNDERSTORM OUTFLOW WIND. WENT CLOSE TO GFS MOS
ON POPS DURING THIS PERIOD...AND NOT QUITE AS HOT FOR THE MAX TEMPS
ON WEDNESDAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND REVEAL A FAIRLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPING 
OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. 
THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL PUSH A WEAK COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AND WILL ALSO PUSH TROPICAL STORM ARTHUR AWAY 
FROM THE FORECAST AREA. SCATTERED CONVECTION IS EXPECTED AHEAD OF 
THE COLD FRONT ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY MORNING...WITH COOLER 
AIR MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY BEHIND THE FRONT. HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL THEN SETTLE OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION FOR 
THE WEEKEND...WITH ISOLATED DIURNAL CONVECTION RETURNING BY EARLY 
NEXT WEEK AS SOUTHERLY WINDS DEVELOP ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE DEPARTING
HIGH (WHICH WILL INCREASE MOISTURE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA). AS FOR
TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH
THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE
MEANS.

.DISCUSSION...A VERY MILD START THIS MORNING WITH A WARM AND HUMID
AIR MASS. TEMPERATURES WERE IN THE MID 70S WITH DEW POINTS IN THE
LOWER 70S IN MOST LOCATIONS. ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL CLOUDINESS HAS
LINGERED OVER THE FORECAST AREA SINCE SUNRISE. CLOUDS ARE STARTING
TO DECREASE AS WARMER AND DRIER AIR MOVES IN FROM THE WEST AND
SOUTHWEST AT THE 850 TO 700 MB LEVEL. RAISED HIGHS A DEGREE IN
KNOXVILLE AND BRISTOL AND A FEW OTHER LOCATIONS. INCREASED SURFACE
WINDS A FEW MPH TO WITH MOST LOCATIONS SW 5 TO 10 MPH. ISOLATED
STORMS LOOK POSSIBLE LATE THIS AFTERNOON. LOCAL WRF SOUNDINGS SHOW
THE CAP BREAKING LATE THIS AFTERNOON...BUT NAM SHOWS IT HOLDING.
CAPE VALUES ARE 2500 TO 3000 J/KG AND WITH INTENSE HEATING DO NOT
WANT TO TAKE OUT PRECIPITATION THIS AFTERNOON. WEAK COLD FRONT WILL
MOVE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY BY THIS EVENING SO THE BEST CHANCE OF
STORMS LATE TODAY AND TONIGHT WILL BE ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...SKIES ARE STILL FOR THE MOST PART
MOSTLY CLOUDY OVER THE FORECAST AREA AS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
MOSTLY SCATTERED DEVELOP AROUND THE BORDER OF A BROAD UPPER RIDGE
CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHWEST AND SOUTH CENTRAL STATES. SHORT WAVE
ENERGY KEEPS MOVING SOUTHEAST FROM THE PLATEAU INTO THE SOUTHERN
VALLEY AND NC. ONE COMPLEX OF STORMS FORMED JUST BEFORE SUNRISE ON
THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND MOVED ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC THIS MORNING.
THE NEXT AREA FORMED OVER THE NORTHERN PLATEAU LATE THIS MORNING AND
MOVED INTO THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY IN THE LAST HOUR OR SO.
HEAVY RAINFALL IS POSSIBLE IN SOME OF THE STORMS AS THEY MOVE SLOWLY
SOUTHEAST TOWARD GA AND NC IN THE NEXT COUPLE HOURS. THIS SHORT WAVE
MOVES OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA EARLY TONIGHT WHICH WILL BRING A QUICK
END TO THE SHOWERS AND STORMS. LOCALLY DENSE FOG LIKELY TO FORM LATE
TONIGHT AS SKIES CLEAR AND THE MOISTURE FROM THE GROUND RISES. UPPER
LEVEL RIDGING STRENGTHENS OVER AREA TUESDAY. AIR MASS WILL REMAIN
MOIST AND UNSTABLE. SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL BRING IN WARMER AIR FROM THE
WEST AND SOUTHWEST. ISOLATED STORMS POSSIBLE WITH SOME STRONG TO
POSSIBLY SEVERE...MAINLY AROUND PEAK HEATING IN LATE AFTERNOON AND
EARLY EVENING. HIGHS MUCH WARMER MOSTLY LOWER TO MID 90S LOWER
ELEVATIONS...AND 80S HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND REVEAL A FAIRLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPING 
OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION DURING THE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
THURSDAY NIGHT TIME PERIOD. THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL PUSH A WEAK COLD 
FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT OR THURSDAY 
MORNING...AND SHOULD ALSO KEEP ANY TROPICAL STORM DEVELOPMENT OVER 
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AWAY FROM THE FORECAST AREA. A VERY UNSTABLE 
AIR MASS IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT...DUE TO THE 
VERY MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER ALREADY IN PLACE AND COLD UPPER-LEVEL 
TEMPS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH. AS A RESULT...EXPECT 
SCATTERED CONVECTION AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT DURING THE TUESDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY TIME PERIOD...WITH SOME STRONG TO SEVERE 
STORMS POSSIBLE EACH DAY WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN SETTLE OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN VERY 
MOIST THROUGH THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. A WEAKENING UPPER TROUGH TO OUR 
WEST WILL SHIFT EAST OVER THE AREA TODAY...ALTHOUGH FORCING WILL BE 
WEAK. WILL CARRY HIGH CHANCE POPS ALL ZONES TODAY...WITH CHANCE POPS 
CONTINUING INTO EARLY TONIGHT BEFORE TAPERING TO SLIGHT CHANCE. 
INSTABILITY MAY BE A BIT BETTER THAN YESTERDAY BUT STILL LOOKS 
LIMITED. VERY HEAVY RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE AND LOCALIZED FLOODING MAY 
OCCUR...WILL MENTION THREAT IN HWO.  WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV 
TEMPS.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A BROAD UPPER-TROUGH
OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS WILL FLATTEN AS IT TRACKS OFF THE NORTHEAST
INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION EARLY THIS WEEK. THIS WILL LEAD TO
ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND EVEN SOME LIGHT RIDGING ACROSS THE REGION WITH
AN UPPER-HIGH SITUATED TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE AREA. THOUGH
THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT GULF MOISTURE IN PLACE TO SUPPORT SHOWER
AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY...MORE WIDESPREAD DRIER CONDITIONS ARE
EXPECTED GIVEN THE HIGHER TEMPERATURES ALOFT EARLY IN THE WEEK. ANY
ACTIIVTY THAT FORMS SHOULD BE ISOLATED TO PREHAPS SCATTERED IN
NATURE AND FAVOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE MOUNTAINS. HIGHS WILL BE
A BIT WARMER THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK AND REACH THE LOW TO
MID 90S IN MANY AREAS ACROSS THE VALLEY.

BY WEDNESDAY...THE RIDGE WILL SLIDE OFF TO THE EAST A BROAD UPPER-
TROUGH SWINGS INTO THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEY. THIS SHOULD 
INCREASE STORM COVERAGE QUITE A BIT BY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON...AND RESULT IN SOME DECENT RAIN CHANCES AREAWIDE. 
THUS...HAVE INCREASED POPS TO THE 40-50 PERCENT RANGE FOR NOW...AND 
MAY NEED TO GO HIGHER SHOULD TRENDS CONTINUE. THIS TROUGH WILL SWING 
THOUGH THE REGION AND CLEAR THE AREA BY FRIDAY MORNING...JUST IN 
TIME FOR INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATIONS. THERE MAY BE A FEW STRAY

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
A MOIST ENVIRONMENT WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH THE SHORT 
TERM PERIOD. THE ONGOING SHOWER ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BEING TO 
DIMINISH AFTER SUNSET AS THE MIDLEVEL TROUGH EXITS AND DAYTIME 
INSTABILITY IS LOST. HOWEVER...THE MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE SOME 
LIGHT QPF AMOUNTS OVERNIGHT...SO WILL KEEP A MENTION OF ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AFTER MIDNIGHT. SOME PATCHY FOG MAY OCCUR TONIGHT WHERE IT 
RAINS TODAY...BUT MIDLEVEL CLOUDS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE BROKEN 
WILL WORK AGAINST DENSE FOG DEVELOPMENT. 

TOMORROW...A 500 MB SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL BE APPROACHING THE AREA 
FROM THE WEST. ALTHOUGH FORCING IS WEAK WITH THE TROUGH...IT WILL 
NOT TAKE MUCH LIFT TO GET SHOWERS GOING IN THE MOIST 
ENVIRONMENT...SO WILL HAVE HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR THE AFTERNOON. HEAVY 
RAIN WILL ONCE AGAIN BE THE MAIN FACTOR WITH THE SHOWERS/STORMS AS 
PW VALUES REMAIN IN THE 1.7 INCH RANGE. TEMPS MAY BE A LITTLE WARMER 
WITH A BIT LESS CLOUD COVER EXPECTED THAN TODAY...BUT WILL STAY 
BELOW GFS MOS WHICH HAS BEEN TOO WARM OF LATE.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)... 
SHORWAVE TROUGH FLATTENS OUT AS IT MOVES TO THE EAST SUNDAY NIGHT.
VERY MOIST AIR MASS WILL REMAIN OVER THE REGION SO AFTERNOON SHOWER
AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE WELL INTO THE EVENING.
RIDGING TO THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST IN THE UPPER LEVELS TRIES TO
BUILD NORTH MONDAY BUT MOIST AIR MASS COMBINED WITH HEATING WILL
STILL CAUSE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS TO DEVELOP. LOWEST CHANCES
SOUTHWEST...HIGHEST NORTHEAST. MODELS SHOW RIDGING STRONGER MONDAY
NIGHT AND TUESDAY AS COLD FRONT APPROACHES IN THE OHIO VALLEY.
LOWER POPS TUESDAY WITH ONLY ISOLATED STORMS EXPECTED LOWER
ELEVATIONS. LOWS MID 60S TO LOWER 70S SUNDAY AND MONDAY NIGHTS.
HIGHS SLIGHTLY WARMER MONDAY IN THE MID 80S TO NEAR 90 MOST
LOCATIONS AND THEN EVEN WARMER TUESDAY IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER
90S LOWER ELEVATIONS. COOLER MOUNTAINS BOTH DAYS WITH MORE CLOUD
COVER. TUESDAY EVENING A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION AS
COLD FRONT APPROACHES. BEST RAIN CHANCES IN EXTENDED STILL LOOK
LIKE WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY AS SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT MOVES OUT
OF THE OHIO AND MS VALLEYS TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS TRYING
TO SLOW SYSTEM DOWN WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE POSSIBLY NOT UNTIL LATE
THURSDAY. KEPT FORECAST WETTER WEDNESDAY WITH LOWER POPS THURSDAY
THEN CLEARING THURSDAY NIGHT. LATER SHIFTS MAY HAVE TO INCREASE
RAIN CHANCES THURSDAY IF SLOWING OF FRONT CONTINUES. FRIDAY AND
SATURDAY LOOK DRY WITH LOWER DEW POINTS. TEMPERATURES A LITTLE
BELOW NORMAL AT NIGHT AND NEAR NORMAL DAYTIMES WITH LESS CLOUD
COVER.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN VERY 
MOIST THROUGH THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. HIGH PW VALUES...LIMITED 
INSTABILITY AND SLOW STORM MOVEMENT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO VERY HEAVY 
RAINS IN SOME LOCATIONS.  PLAN TO MENTION POSSIBILITY OF LOCALIZED 
FLOODING IN THE HWO.  WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS 
DURING THE TIME OF MAX HEATING...AND WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS THROUGH

FLOW WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE SHOWERS AND PERHAPS THUNDER GIVEN 
MOIST ENVIRONMENT. WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE PERIOD STARTS OUT WITH 
RELATIVELY HIGH POPS NORTH HALF AS WEAKENING SHORT WAVE PRESSES 
NORTHEAST THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY. SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW KEEPS A MOIST

BUILDS EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. AGAIN KEPT POPS HIGHER 
NORTH CLOSER TO THE STRONGER LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHORT WAVE. 
TUESDAY MAY BE A DAY WITH A RELATIVE MIN IN PROBABILITY OF 
PRECIPITATION AS THE FORECAST AREA COULD BE IN BETWEEN WEATHER 
SYSTEMS. MODELS BASICALLY IN THE SAME BALLPARK WITH THE PERIOD 
WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY AS A LONG WAVE TROUGH AMPLIFIES AS IT SHIFTS 
FROM MID AMERICA INTO THE EASTERN UNITED STATES BY THURSDAY. 
ALTHOUGH MODELS DIFFER SLIGHTLY ON TIMING...TRIED TO CRANK UP POPS 
FOR CONVECTION ON WEDNESDAY AS A SYNOPTIC COLD FRONT SHIFTS SLOWLY 
SOUTHWARD INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. UNCERTAINTY ABOUNDS 
CONCERNING HOW FAST THE FRONT MOVES SO HELD ONTO SOME CHANCE POPS 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND EVEN KEPT SOME SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITIES ON 
THURSDAY FOR THIS REASON. BY FRIDAY MODELS GENERALLY AGREE THAT MOST 
OF THE HIGHER DEWPOINT AIR WILL HAVE BEEN SWEPT SOUTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA AND THEREFORE WENT WITH AN OPTIMISTIC 4TH OF JULY 
COMPLETE WITH SUNSHINE AND SEASONABLY WARM TEMPERATURES. SPEAKING OF 
TEMPERATURE...GUIDANCE MAXES LOOKED A LITTLE TOASTY TOWARD THE END

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...
A MOIST AIR MASS WILL REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE 
SHORT TERM PERIOD. BEST SHOWER COVERAGE THROUGH THE EVENING WILL BE 
IN SOUTHERN SECTIONS...WITH DECREASING ACTIVITY AFTER SUNSET. THE 
SLOW-MOVING STORMS WILL NEED TO BE MONITORED FOR LOCALIZED FLOODING 
THROUGH THE EVENING. 

THERE IS LITTLE FORCING FOR LIFT OVERNIGHT...BUT A CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
CONTINUES AS EVEN THE SLIGHTEST FORCING COULD PRODUCE A SHOWER IN 
THE MOIST ENVIRONMENT. PRECIP CHANCES RISE TO LIKELY TOMORROW AS THE 
MODELS SHOW A 500 MB VORT MAX NOW IN THE WESTERN GULF LIFTING NE AND 
AFFECTING THE TN VALLEY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. PW VALUES TOMORROW WILL 
BE AROUND 1.7 INCHES WITH TALL/SKINNY CAPE PROFILES IN FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS...SO HEAVY RAIN AND LOCALIZED FLOODING WILL BE THE MAIN 
THREATS. WITH GREATER CLOUD COVER EXPECTED TOMORROW...HIGHS SHOULD 
BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN WHAT WE ARE SEEING TODAY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
OVERALL...CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EXIST EACH DAY
THROUGH MOST OF THE EXTENDED WITH A DRIER PATTERN IN STORE TOWARD
THE END. IT IS LOOKING LIKE THE FOURTH OF JULY IS SHAPING UP TO BE
A DRY AND PLEASANT ONE WITH A LITTLE LOWER HUMIDITY VALUES DUE TO A
FRONTAL PASSAGE ON WED/THURSDAY.

SATURDAY NIGHT...UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE WILL CONTINUE TO LIFT NORTH 
OF OUR AREA PROVIDING A GOOD CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 
AS THE NIGHT PROGRESSES...SHOWERS AND STORMS SHOULD BEGIN TO 
DISSIPATE. A FEW SHOWERS AND STORMS MAY LINGER THROUGH THE NIGHT. 
WITH HIGH PRESSURE STILL IN PLACE ON SUNDAY...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
WILL APPROACH FROM THE WEST AND BECOME EXTREMELY NEGATIVELY TILTED 
THE CLOSER IT GETS TO OUR AREA. OUT AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE...SHOWERS 
AND STORMS ARE POSSIBLE SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THE WEAK ASSOCIATED 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVES THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. THE HIGH 
PRESSURE THAT WAS OVER US DURING THE WEEKEND STARTS SHIFTING EAST ON 
MONDAY WITH AGAIN MORE DIURNAL CONVECTION MONDAY AFTERNOON. LITTLE 
IF ANY LIFT PRESENT WITH THE PASSING FRONTAL BOUNDARY...SO SHOWERS 
AND STORMS WILL MAINLY BE DIURNAL. 

BY TUESDAY A DEEPER TROUGH IS APPROACHING THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND 
WILL SWING THROUGH OUR REGION ON TUES NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON LOOKS DRY BUT BY TUESDAY EVENING A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE DEEPER TROUGH MOVES INTO OUR AREA TRIGGERING SHOWERS AND 
STORMS. THERE IS SOME MODEL DISAGREEMENT ON HOW FAST THE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY MOVES THROUGH. THE GFS HANGS THE FRONT UP ACROSS OUR AREA 
ON WEDNESDAY...PROVIDING A TRIGGER FOR MORE SHOWERS AND STORMS 
BEFORE MOVING THE BOUNDARY OUT BY THURSDAY MORNING. WHEREAS THE 
ECMWF HAS THE BOUNDARY TO OUR SOUTH AND EAST BY WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON...THUS KEEPING US MORE DRY. WILL COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE 
TWO MODELS AND KEEP SOME CHANCE OF POPS IN FOR WEDNESDAY UNTIL THE 
MODELS CAN BETTER RESOLVE THE TIMING.

THURSDAY...MUCH DRIER AIR FILTERS IN BEHIND THE FRONT ALLOWING FOR A 
MOSTLY PRECIP FREE DAY...WILL STILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN BUT 
POPS MAY BE ABLE TO BE DROPPED WITH FUTURE FORECAST ISSUANCES. 
FRIDAY...THE 4TH OF JULY...APPEARS TO BE DRY AS WELL AS DRIER AIR IS

ALL TAF SITES WITH A SHOWER WITHIN 15SM. THUS A VCSH WILL BE
INCLUDED AT ALL SITES. BETTER INSTABILITY NEAR CHA COULD PRODUCE
SOME TS...AND RAIN CHANCES WARRANT THE MENTION OF A TEMPO THERE FOR
MVFR CONDITIONS. MOST SHOWERS SHOULD END BY MIDNIGHT. A VERY MOIST
AIR MASS OVER THE AREA COULD LEAD TO SOME MVFR CIGS DEVELOPING LATE
TONIGHT...BUT DUE TO UNCERTAINTY...WILL MENTION JUST SCATTERED
LOW CLOUDS FOR NOW. ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE COULD BRING
ANOTHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS TOMORROW MORNING.

WITH PLENTY OF MOISTURE ACROSS THE REGION AS SEEN IN REGIONAL 12Z
SOUNDINGS...CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO BLOSSOM THIS AFTERNOON.
SOUTHERN AREAS WILL LIKELY TO SEE THE BEST COVERAGE BASED ON THE
REDUCING CLOUD COVER SEEN IN SATELLITE AND ON THE LATEST HRRR AND
RAP RUNS. THE TREND OF DECREASING CLOUDS AREA WIDE SHOULD ALLOW
TEMPS TO RISE TO NEAR FORECAST HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S. WEAK
WINDS ALOFT AND TALL SKINNY CAPE PROFILE SUGGEST SOME LOCALIZED

LIMITED GIVEN EXPECTED CLOUD COVER. WILL GENERALLY GO ABOVE MAV POPS 
TODAY...WITH POPS RANGING FROM 30 NORTH TO 50 SOUTH.  WILL KEEP

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE SLOWLY 
BUILDS INTO THE AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WITH DIURNAL CONVECTION 
DEVELOPING EACH DAY. THE ATMOSPHERE IS VERY MOIST BUT INSTABILITY IS 
LOW. THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK WEEK...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH

ADVECT WITH A STRENGTHENING OF THE WINDS THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE FOR

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...
THE GENERAL TREND FOR THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS WILL BE INCREASING 
MOISTURE AS PW VALUES RISE FROM AROUND 1.5 TODAY TO AROUND 1.8 BY 
LATE TOMORROW AFTERNOON. MODELS INDICATE A NUMBER OF WEAK VORT MAXES 
APPROACHING THE AREA FROM THE SW. THESE DISTURBANCES SHOULD BE
ENOUGH TO SUPPORT SHOWERS AT ANY TIME TONIGHT AND TOMORROW IN THE
MOIST ENVIRONMENT. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS SOUTH TONIGHT WITH SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS NORTH AND CENTRAL...INCREASING TO LIKELY SOUTH AND
CENTRAL/CHANCE NORTH TOMORROW. WILL LEAN ON THE COOL SIDE OF MOS
GUIDANCE FOR HIGH TEMPS TOMORROW GIVEN EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND
PRECIP.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
NOT MUCH CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. TYPICAL SUMMERTIME
PATTERN IN STORE OVER OUR REGION THROUGH THE EXTENDED WITH UPPER
LEVEL RIDGING BUILDING ACROSS THE AREA...ALONG WITH TWO WEAK
FRONTAL PASSAGES THAT WILL MOVE THROUGH.

FRIDAY NIGHT...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING BEGINS BUILDING AND CONTINUES 
THROUGH SUNDAY. POP-UP CONVECTION ON FRIDAY SHOULD BEGIN TO WEAKEN 
AND DISSIPATE FRIDAY NIGHT AS WE LOSE OUR DAYTIME HEATING...BUT A 
FEW SHOWERS AND STORMS MAY LINGER THROUGH A GOOD PORTION OF THE 
NIGHT. SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY THE DIURNAL CONVECTION CONTINUES AS 
WE HEAT UP EACH DAY...WITH AGAIN SHOWERS ANS STORMS SLOWLY 
DISSIPATING AFTER SUNSET. THE BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS 
OVER THE WEEKEND LOOKS TO BE ON SATURDAY DUE TO HIGH PRESSURE JUST 
TO OUR SOUTHEAST PROVIDING MOISTURE TO STREAM INTO OUR AREA FROM THE 
GULF...SOUNDINGS LOOK PRETTY SATURATED.

SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY A WEAK FRONT MOVES THROUGH. THIS FRONT WILL 
BRIEFLY PUT US BACK INTO A MORE ZONAL FLOW. FORCING IS MINIMAL WITH 
THIS FEATURE SO WILL ONLY SLIGHTLY INCREASE PRECIP CHANCES AS IT 
MOVES THROUGH. TUESDAY LOOKS DRIER IN THE WAKE OF THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE BUT PRECIP CHANCES STILL EXIST FOR THE AFTERNOON DUE TO 
DIURNAL CONVECTION. PRECIP CHANCES START TO INCREASE AGAIN ON 
WEDNESDAY AS A SOMEWHAT MORE ROBUST UPPER LEVEL TROUGH BEGINS TO 
SWING THROUGH THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL 
MAKE ITS WAY ACROSS OUR AREA WEDNESDAY/WED NIGHT. THE FRONT SHOULD 
DRIFT SOUTH OF OUR AREA SOMETIME ON THURSDAY. THE SILVER LINING IS 
THAT A LITTLE BIT OF COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL BE BRIEFLY IN STORE 
BEHIND THIS FRONTAL PASSAGE. 

AS WITH THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...A PERSISTENCE FORECAST ON TEMPS 
SEEMS BEST THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...SINCE A STAGNANT PATTERN

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...SHOWERS AND A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO BUILD IN THE WEAKLY UNSTABLE BUT VERY 
MOIST AIRMASS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. AS THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ADVANCES EAST TONIGHT THE WEAK CONVECTIVE ACTION 
SHOULD CONTINUE DEEP INTO THE NIGHT. MODELS INDICATE THE UPPER 
TROUGH AND A WEAK SURFACE FRONT WILL PRESS EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA EARLY IN THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY THUS ALLOWING POPS TO BE LOWERED 
FROM WEST TO EAST THROUGH THE DAYTIME PERIOD. MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE 
NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE LATE TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY WITH A SATURATED 
COLUMN AND THEN WARMING ALOFT BUILDING INTO THE REGION. THEREFORE 
TRIED TO USE SHOWERS AS THE MAIN FORECAST ELEMENT WITH A CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS. TRENDED MINS UP A DEGREE OFF GUIDANCE TONIGHT WHILE 
STAYING IN THE MIDDLE OF SUGGESTED MAX TEMPS FOR WEDNESDAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY 
AGREE ON SOME DRYING FOR WED NIGHT AND THURSDAY BEHIND A DEPARTING 
WEAK FRONT.  WILL CARRY NO MORE THAN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS WED NIGHT 
THROUGH THU NIGHT.  REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD LOOKS LIKE A TYPICAL 
SUMMER PATTERN WITH SCATTERED CONVECTION ESPECIALLY IN THE 
AFTERNOON/EVENING.  MAY BE ENHANCED PRECIP CHANCES AT TIMES BUT 
THOSE LIKELY DUE TO SMALLER SCALE FEATURES UNLIKELY TO BE RESOLVED 
WELL BY MODELS AT THESE TIME RANGES. WILL GO NO HIGHER THAN CHANCE

DEEP MOIST ATMOSPHERE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUBBLE UP INTO A NICE
PATTERN OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TODAY. SOUNDINGS HAVE A MOIST
ADIABATIC LOOK TO THEM BUT THERE SHOULD STILL BE SOME NICE
CONVECTION AROUND. HRRRR IS ALREADY PICKING UP ON THE TOWERING CU
ALONG LINE OF LIGHT TO MODERATE SHOWERS ADVANCING ONTO THE
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND MOVING ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. SUPPOSE
THIS FILLS IN A LITTLE AS IT MOVES INTO THE SUN DRENCHED EASTERN
HALF OF THE VIEWING AREA. MAX TEMPS PROBABLY IN THE BALL PARK RANGE
IN THE MID 80S WITH A CONVECTIVE DAY IN STORE SO WON'T MESS WITH

MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST

INSTABILITY WILL BE GREATER. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL 
COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE WILL
CONTINUE TO FLATTEN AND SHIFT SOUTH AND EAST AS A BROAD TROUGH
SWINGS INTO THE UPPER GREAT LAKES AND OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THIS WILL
DRAG A WEAK FRONT TOWARD/INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY TUESDAY INTO
WEDNESDAY. DUE TO THE ENHANCED LIFT FROM THIS TROUGH AND BOUNDARY...
MORE WIDESPREAD CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION ARE EXPECTED FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE WEEK...ESPECIALLY ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. AS A
RESULT...HAVE LIKELY POPS ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON...AND AGAIN ON
WEDNESDAY AS MODELS /ESPECIALLY THE NAM/ ARE HINTING AT AN ADDITIONAL
ORGANIZED COMPLEX OF STORMS MOVING THROUGH THE REGION AS THE BASE
OF THE TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH.

MODELS DIFFER LATER ON IN THE WEEK INTO THE WEEKEND...WITH THE GFS 
SUPPORTING A WETTER SET-UP WITH SEVERAL LITTLE SHORTWAVES MOVING 
ANOTHER THE NORTHERN EDGE OF THE RIDGE. THE ECMWF INDICATES A MORE 
ESTABLISHED RIDGE AND A DRIER SOLUTION WITH A MORE DIURNALLY DRIVEN 
CONVECTION POTENTIAL. REGARDLESS...THINK COVERAGE WILL BE AROUND 30 
TO PERHAPS 40 PERCENT MOST DAYS THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK...
SO HAVE REFLECTED THIS IN THE GRIDS. GIVEN THE MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY
IN PLACE...THESE STORMS WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR PRODUCING LOCALIZED
GUSTY/DAMAGING WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. TEMPERATURES DURING
THIS TIME PERIOD WILL BE COOLER DUE TO THE LOWER THICKNESS 
VALUES/TEMPERATURES ALOFT AND CLOUD COVER...AND PEAK IN THE MID 80S

EVENING...LIMITING CONVECTION AND STRENGTH OF ANY THUNDERSTORMS. 
THIS CONVECTION WILL BE DIURNAL IN NATURE...WEAKENING AROUND SUNSET. 
THE INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE OVERNIGHT WILL CAUSE FOG

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WARM AND VERY HUMID AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH SATELLITE 
IMAGERY REVEALING QUITE A BIT OF CLOUDS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. A 
MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING...BUT MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A WARM STABLE LAYER AROUND 
500 MB AND A DRIER VERTICAL MOISTURE PROFILE (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY).
WHILE THIS MID-LEVEL STABLE LAYER MAY NOT FULLY INHIBIT CONVECTIVE
DEVELOPMENT TODAY...IT SHOULD HELP TO DECREASE THE AREAL COVERAGE
OF CONVECTION. THUS...EXPECT ONLY AN ISOLATED COVERAGE OF CONVECTION
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MAXES FOR TODAY...BUT REVEAL SOME
DISCREPANCIES WITH MINS FOR TONIGHT. WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A
PERSISTENCE FORECAST FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE WILL
GRADUALLY SLIDE TO THE EAST ON MONDAY...ALLOWING FOR MORE GULF
MOISTURE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ITS WAY INTO THE REGION. THIS WILL LEAD
TO MORE WIDESPREAD DIURNAL CONVECTION THROUGHOUT THE DAY...ESPECIALLY
ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU. THE STORM MODE
WILL GENERALLY BE MULTICELL CLUSTERS...AND THEY COULD BECOME STRONG
TO PERHAPS LOCALLY SEVERE. GIVEN THE ABUNDANT GULF MOISTURE IN PLACE...
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH THE
STRONGEST ACTIVITY...ALONG WITH A DAMAGING CONVECTIVE WIND THREAT.

TUESDAY THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK...THE RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO 
FLATTEN AND SHIFT SOUTH AND EAST AS A BROAD TROUGH SWINGS INTO THE 
UPPER GREAT LAKES. DUE TO THE ENHANCED LIFT PROVIDED BY THE 
AFOREMENTIONED UPPER-TROUGH...AND A SERIES OF ADDITIONAL SHORTWAVE
DISTURBANCES THAT WILL TRACK ALONG THE NORTHERN EDGE OF THE RIDGE
ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY...MORE WIDESPREAD COVERAGE IS EXPECTED DURING
THIS PERIOD. GIVEN THE MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY IN PLACE...THESE
STORMS WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR PRODUCING LOCALIZED GUSTY/DAMAGING
WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. AS A RESULT...HAVE INCREASED POPS
TO A SOLID 40-50 PERCENT DURING THE DAY-PERIODS THROUGH THURSDAY.
TEMPERATURES DURING THIS TIME PERIOD WILL BE COOLER DUE TO THE LOWER
THICKNESS VALUES/TEMPERATURES ALOFT AND CLOUD COVER...AND PEAK IN THE
MID 80S DURING THE LATER HALF OF THE WEEK. THE UPPER- RIDGE LOOKS
TO BUILD BACK IN FOR THE WEEKEND...BUT MOISTURE UNDERNEATH IT SHOULD
RESULT IN SCATTERED CONVECTION EACH DAY...WITH PERHAPS A SLIGHT
WARMING TREND.

"FLY IN THE OINTMENT" INVOLVES THE EVOLUTION OF AN MCS OVER THE MID

COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. PREVIOUS GRIDS WITH HIGH 
CHANCE SW VA AND NE TN DOWN TO 20 TO 30 PERCENT CHANCE ACROSS SE TN 
AND SW NC...APPEARS TO BE RIGHT ON TRACK. 

12Z OHX SOUNDING SHOWS PLENTY OF INSTABILITY WITH RATHER WEAK WINDS 
ALOFT. HOWEVER...I WOULD EXPECT A FEW STRONG TO MARGINALLY SEVERE 
STORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAINFALL THE MAIN CONCERNS.

NOT SEEING THE NEED FOR AN UPDATE TO ANY FORECAST GRIDS OR PRODUCTS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
NORTHWEST-TO-SOUTHEAST ORIENTED FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER EASTERN KY AND 
SOUTHWEST VA...WITH SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALING QUITE A BIT OF CLOUDS
OCCURRING ALONG IT. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN QUASI-
STATIONARY AROUND THE TRI-CITIES THROUGH TONIGHT...WITH A MODERATELY
UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. AS A RESULT...
EXPECT SCATTERED STRONG CONVECTION TO DEVELOP... ESPECIALLY NEAR THE
FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. AS FOR TEMPS...
GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND
TONIGHT...WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A PERSISTENCE FORECAST.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...THE UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE THAT
PROMOTED THE VERY WARM AND FAIRLY DRY CONDITIONS EARLIER IN THE
WEEK WILL CONTINUE TO FLATTEN AND RETROGRADE BACK TO THE SOUTHWEST
ON SATURDAY. THIS WILL PROMOTE A MORE NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT...AND
ALLOW FOR A SHORTWAVE/WEAK FRONT TO DROP THROUGH THE REGION. SCATTERED
STRONG TO PERHAPS LOCALLY SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE
FROM THE MID/LATE MORNING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. THE MOST FAVORED
AREA LOOKS TO BE NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA WHERE
MODELS ARE HINTING AT THE POTENTIAL FOR THE DEEPEST CONVECTION.
GIVEN THE ABUNDANT GULF MOISTURE IN PLACE...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL
AND FLOODING WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH THE STRONGEST ACTIVITY...ALONG
WITH THE USUAL DAMAGING CONVECTIVE WIND THREAT.

SUNDAY INTO NEXT WEEK...THE RIDGE WILL GRADUALLY BUILD BACK INTO THE 
REGION AND THEN FLATTEN ONCE AGAIN AS A BROAD TROUGH SWINGS INTO THE 
UPPER GREAT LAKES BY MIDWEEK. INITIALLY...THE MOISTURE UNDERNEATH 
THIS RIDGE AND A WEAKER CAP WILL ALLOW FOR ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
CONVECTION /ESPECIALLY ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU/ EARLY IN THE 
WEEK. THEN...AS ADDITIONAL LIFT IS PROVIDED BY THE AFOREMENTIONED 
UPPER-TROUGH...MORE WIDESPREAD COVERAGE IS EXPECTED BY TUESDAY AND 
ESPECIALLY WEDNESDAY. THESE STORMS WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR 
PRODUCING LOCALIZED GUSTY/DAMAGING WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. 
TEMPERATURES DURING THIS TIME PERIOD WILL BE NEAR/AT NORMAL VALUES 
IN THE 85 TO 90 DEGREE RANGE IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...THE PERIOD WILL BE
NOTED BY SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY
DIURNALLY DRIVEN. HOWEVER...MODELS HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF AGREEMENT
THAT A MORE ORGANIZED BATCH OF CONVECTION WILL BE COMING IN FRIDAY
AFTERNOON/EVENING IN ASSOCIATION WITH A DISTURBANCE IN THE
NORTHWESTERLY STEERING FLOW ALOFT. THUS LIKELY POPS ARE MAINTAINED
FOR THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SW VA FOR FRI AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...THE RIDGE CONTINUES TO 
BECOME SUPPRESSED FARTHER SOUTH AND WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY COMPLIMENTS OF AN AMPLIFYING UPPER TROUGH OVER 
EASTERN CANADA AND THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. IN THIS PATTERN THE MODELS 
SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY OF SCATTERED CONVECTION DUE TO SHORT 
WAVELENGTH ENHANCEMENT AND A SLOW COOL FRONTAL PUSH THROUGH THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. BY MONDAY THE 
BOUNDARY SHOULD BE SOUTH OF THE VIEWING AREA. THEREFORE ADJUSTED 
POPS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DOWN TO SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY 
BASICALLY SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. MODEL FORECASTS HINT AT 
THE ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH AROUND THE TUESDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME SO TWEAKED PROBABILITIES UP A BIT HERE. STAYED 
A FEW DEGREES BELOW MAX TEMP GUIDANCE FOR THE SOUTHERN VALLEY

.SHORT TERM...(THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT)...COLD FRONT OVER OHIO 
VALLEY TODAY WILL MOVE SOUTH AND EAST BY TONIGHT TO REACH THE MID 
ATLANTIC AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS JUST NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
RING OF SHOWERS AND STORMS NOW OVER OHIO AND MID ATLANTIC COAST AND 
THEIR OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES SLOWLY SLIP SOUTH. AS A RESULT THERE WILL 
BE A LITTLE MORE COVERAGE NORTHEAST SECTIONS AS STORMS FORM OFF OF 
THE BOUNDARIES THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. AS AIR MASS BECOMES 
UNSTABLE SOME STORMS MAY BECOME STRONG WITH ISOLATED DAMAGING WINDS 
AND LARGE HAIL SIMILAR TO WEDNESDAY. THE EXCEPTION WILL BE A LITTLE 
BETTER CHANCE IN NORTHERN SECTIONS THAN IN THE SOUTH. FARTHER SOUTH 
COVERAGE WILL BE ISOLATED IN THE VALLEYS AND CHANCE MOUNTAINS AND 
PLATEAU. HIGHS SIMILAR TODAY BUT SLIGHTLY COOLER NORTHEAST. TONIGHT 
FOLLOWED CLOSER TO MET LOWS. SHOWERS AND STORMS SHOULD DECREASE AS 
SUN SETS WITH PATCHY FOG WHERE RAIN HAS FALLEN.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A LONG-WAVE UPPER TROUGH
OVER SOUTHEAST CANADA WILL HELP PULL A FRONT INTO THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHAINS FOR THIS WEEKEND AND WEAKENING UPPER RIDGE OVER THE
AREA. END RESULT WILL BE INCREASING COVERAGE OF MAINLY AFTERNOON
AND EVENING CONVECTION. AIRMASS WILL REMAIN MOIST AND UNSTABLE
THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH HIGH PW VALUES FOR SATURDAY...NEARLY 2
INCHES. FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS ARE
POSSIBLE WITH THE MAIN CONCERN BEING DAMAGING DOWNBURSTS WINDS...
TORRENTIAL RAINS AND FREQUENT LIGHTNING. LOCALIZED FLASH FLOODING
IS POSSIBLE.

QUASI-STATIONARY BOUNDARY WILL BE OVER THE AREA FOR SUNDAY AND
MONDAY BEFORE RETREATING NORTH. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF SHOW ANOTHER
WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE NATION HELPING TO PULL
BOUNDARY BACK NORTH. HOWEVER...ANOTHER FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVES INTO
THE AREA LATE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. MEDIUM RANGE MODELS DIFFER
ON HOW FAR SOUTH BOUNDARY GOES. ANOTHER THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER
POSSIBLE FOR TUESDAY AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND UPPER TROUGH MOVES
ACROSS THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...DIURNAL THUNDERSTORMS
FORMED AS EXPECTED OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS...AND A COUPLE OF
STORMS BRIEFLY INTENSIFIED NEAR OAK RIDGE TN AND ALSO OVER CHEROKEE
COUNTY NC WITH SMALL HAIL AT MARBLE NC AROUND 215 PM.

THE STORMS ARE WEAKENING AND SMOKY MTN STORMS WILL BE MOVING
SLOWLY EAST AWAY FROM OUR AREA. HOWEVER...CUMBERLAND PLATEAU STORMS
HAD DRIFTED EAST PUSHING AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY TOWARD THE SMOKY MTN
CONVECTION. GIVEN THE FEW MORE HOURS OF HEAT AND THESE OUTFLOW
BOUNDARIES...I OPTED TO CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE EVENING
HOURS OVER ALL BUT THE SRN VALLEY COUNTIES OF E TN. 

OTHERWISE...NO CHANGES MADE OVERALL FOR TONIGHT WITH PATCHY FOG
LATE. COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS TOMORROW SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY
GREATER OVER SW VA AND EXTREME NRN PARTS OF EAST TN...AS THE OHIO
RIVER VALLY FRONTAL BOUNDARY SAGS SOUTH A BIT CLOSER.

MOS MINS CLOSELY FOLLOWED FOR TONIGHT. I DID NUDGE THURSDAY MAX
TEMPS DOWN A COUPLE OF DEGREES OR SO...ESPECIALLY OVER SW VA AND
NE TN WHERE MORE CONVECTIVE CLOUDINESS IS LIKELY.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SUMMER REGIME SEEMS 
TO BE IN PLACE. THE UPPER RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WILL 
TRANSITION FARTHER WEST AS SHORTWAVE TROUGHS MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION/OHIO VALLEY. LOOK FOR DIURNAL CONVECTION TO SLOWLY 
DISSIPATE THURSDAY AFTERNOON WITH A FEW LINGERING INTO THE OVERNIGHT 
HOURS PERHAPS ACROSS SW VA. TOUGH TO FORECAST THE MOVEMENT/LOCATION 
OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY FRIDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND. HOWEVER 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER THE 
WEEKEND WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES OCCURRING ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON 
PARTICULARLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VA AND NE TN. CONFIDENCE IS 
LOW ON THE EXACT LOCATION SINCE FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS NOT WELL HANDLED 
BY THE MODELS. SCATTERED AFTERNOON CONVECTION LOOKS LIKE A GOOD BET 
THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK AS THE UPPER RIDGE FLATTENS OUT BY 
THE WEEKEND.

TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. LOOK 
FOR SOME BRIEF RELIEF OVER THE WEEKEND IF STORMS MATERIALIZE SINCE 
THICKER CLOUD COVER SHOULD INHIBIT TOO MUCH WARMING.

WEAKENING UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA. HIGH CHANCE POPS AREA-WIDE.

FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A FAIRLY UNSTABLE AIRMASS FOR SATURDAY
THROUGH MONDAY...SO MORE ORGANIZED STRONG TO POSSIBLE SEVERE STORMS
ARE POSSIBLE. MAIN CONCERN BEING DAMAGING DOWNBURSTS WINDS...
HEAVY RAINS AND FREQUENT LIGHTNING.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...FOLLOWED MOS CLOSELY FOR THURSDAY AND
FRIDAY...BUT WENT A DEGREE OR TWO COOLER THAN MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE
GUIDANCE DUE TO EXPECTED INCREASE COVERAGE OF STORMS AND CLOUDS.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A BERMUDA HIGH CENTERED OVER THE
WESTERN ATLANTIC...WHICH EXTENDS OVER THE ENTIRE SOUTHEAST REGION.
AREA RADARS REVEAL THAT THE EARLIER ISOLATED CONVECTION AROUND THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS HAS DISSIPATED WITH THE SETTING OF THE SUN. AS A
RESULT...EXPECT MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS OVERNIGHT WHICH
WILL ALLOW PATCHY AREAS OF FOG TO DEVELOP TOWARDS SUNRISE.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT
WILL UPDATE TO REMOVE ANY EVENING PRECIP WORDING AND TO TWEAK TEMPS
A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY/...
A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE REMAINS ENTRENCHED OVER THE REGION
JUST OVER THE NORTH CAROLINA/GEORGIA BORDER...WHICH HAS PROMOTED A
MOSTLY SUNNY DAY ONCE AGAIN. TEMPERATURES ARE RUNNING A COUPLE OF
DEGREES WARMER THAN THEY WERE YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME AT 2 PM EDT
AND SHOULD CLIMB INTO THE 90 TO 95 DEGREE RANGE ACROSS THE ENTIRE
VALLEY REGION BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON. THESE WARMER TEMPERATURES
ALOFT HAVE HELPED TO STRENGTH THE CAP...AND AS A RESULT CONVECTION
HAS BEEN MUCH SLOWER TO DEVELOP TODAY...WITH MOSTLY SCT
SHALLOW/FLAT CU ACROSS THE REGION. A FEW ISOLATED STORMS MAY STILL
DEVELOP ACROSS WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA AND THE MOUNTAINS LATE THIS
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...THANKS TO SOME OROGRAPHIC LIFT AND THE
MOISTURE IN PLACE...BUT THEY WILL BE VERY UNORGANIZED AND REMAIN
OVER THE TERRAIN.

MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL TONIGHT AS CLOUD COVER
DISSIPATES...BUT THE CALM/CLEAR CONDITIONS WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR SOME
PATCHY FOG ALONG THE LAKES ONCE AGAIN...SO HAVE ADDED THIS TO THE
ZONES LATE TONIGHT. WEDNESDAY WILL GENERALLY BE A CARBON COPY OF
TODAY AS THE RIDGE FURTHER BECOMES ENTRENCHED OVER THE REGION AND
THICKNESS VALUES AND TEMPERATURES ALOFT REMAIN STEADY. THIS WILL
RESULT IN ANOTHER MOSTLY SUNNY DAY WITH TEMPERATURES RUNNING
REACHING THE 90 TO 95 DEGREE PLATEAU ONCE AGAIN. THUS...CONVECTION
WILL BE LIMITED TO BEING MOSTLY ISOLATED IN NATURE AND CONFINED TO
THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
THE TREND OVER THE LONG TERM PERIOD WILL BE FOR THE RIDGE OVER THE 
SE CONUS TO BREAK DOWN AND RETROGRADE...WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR 
DISTURBANCES IN THE WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT TO AFFECT THE AREA. WE 
SHOULD ALSO BE A GRADUAL COOLING TREND TO TEMPERATURES AS WELL 
THROUGH THE PERIOD. 

WITH THE RIDGE REMAINING IN PLACE...CHANCES OF SHOWERS/TSTMS SHOULD 
BE MAINLY DIURNALLY-DRIVEN ON THURSDAY. BY FRIDAY THE RETREATING 
RIDGE AND THE RESULTING NW MIDLEVEL FLOW WILL BRING UPSTREAM VORT 
MAXES TO CROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA...SUPPORTING OVERNIGHT 
CHANCE POPS NORTH. THE CONTINUED SUPPRESSION OF THE RIDGE WILL 
EXPAND CHANCE POPS SOUTHWARD...COVERING THE ENTIRE AREA BY SATURDAY. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES RISE TO AROUND THE 1.5 INCH MARK...WITH 
VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF CAPPING. THERE COULD BE SOME POTENTIAL FOR 
ISOLATED FLOODING...BUT THE THREAT OF ORGANIZED SEVERE STORMS LOOKS 
LOW. THIS PATTERN WILL CONTINUE INTO TUESDAY. FINER DETAILS OF 
UPSTREAM MCVS ARE UNCLEAR THIS FAR OUT...BUT THERE WILL BE THE 
POTENTIAL FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY AND NIGHT.

AN UPPER-RIDGE WILL FURTHER ESTABLISH ITSELF OVER THE REGION
TODAY...PROMOTING VERY WARM CONDITIONS AS THICKNESS VALUES AND
TEMPERATURES ALOFT INCREASE. AS A RESULT...HIGHS MAY BE A DEGREE
OR TWO WARMER TODAY...AND REACH THE LOWER 90S ACROSS NEARLY ALL OF
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY. LOCATIONS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
VALLEY COULD REACH THE MID 90S. IN ADDITION...THESE WARMER
TEMPERATURES ALOFT WILL HELP TO STRENGTH/REINFORCE THE CAPPING
INVERSION. AS A RESULT...DO NOT EXCEPT MUCH IN THE WAY OF
CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED
CONVECTION WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG OR NEAR THE HIGHER TERRAIN
OF THE EAST TENNESSEE/WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA MOUNTAINS THROUGH
SUNSET. A ROGUE STORM MAY BE POSSIBLE IN THE VALLEY IN THE
EVENING...BUT DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO PLACE MENTIONABLE
POPS IN ALL BUT THE MOUNTAIN ZONES AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA ATTM.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL
REMAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WHICH WILL TEND TO SURPRESS
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER...OROGRAPHIC LIFT WILL ONCE AGAIN
PRODUCE WIDELY SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS...ESPECIALLY OVER THE FAR EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW ISOLATED STRONG
TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE WITH THE MAIN CONCERN BEING
DAMAGING DOWNBURSTS WINDS. CONVECTION WILL DISSIPATE AGAIN SOON
AFTER SUNSET.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BOTH 
SURFACE AND ALOFT TO REMAIN STRONG THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK. AIR 
MASS MOIST AND UNSTABLE WITH AFTERNOON AND EVENING CONVECTION SLOWLY 
INCREASING EACH DAY. WEDNESDAY BEST CHANCE OF STORMS WILL BE IN THE 
HIGHER EASTERN MOUNTAINS AS MAIN FORCING IS OROGRAPHIC.  THURSDAY 
THROUGH SATURDAY CHANCE OF STORMS HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU BUT MORE ISOLATED IN THE VALLEY. STRONG TO 
ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLE EACH DAY WITH THE MAIN CONCERN BEING 
HIGH WINDS...AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS. 

BY SATURDAY AND ESPECIALLY SUNDAY UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES THE GREAT 
LAKES WHICH SUPPRESSES THE UPPER RIDGE. A BETTER CHANCE OF STORMS 
WILL OCCUR SUNDAY INTO MONDAY AS A COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY SUNDAY AND THEN GETS CLOSE TO THE TN VALLEY MONDAY. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER TO 
POSSIBLY MID 90S THROUGH SATURDAY AND THEN A LITTLE COOLER MOSTLY

WITH EVEN WARMER TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S IN SOME 
SPOTS AS OF 2:30 PM CDT. THE WEAK SOUTHWEST FLOW HAS ALSO ALLOWED 
FOR SOME GULF MOISTURE TO GET UNDERNEATH THIS RIDGE WHICH WILL ALLOW 
FOR SOME ISOLATED TO PERHAPS SCATTERED STORMS ALONG THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY SO 
FAR HAS DEVELOPED EAST OF THE MOUNTAIN IN NORTHERN GEORGIA AND 
WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA...AND WITH THE WEAK STEERING FLOW BEING FROM 
THE SOUTHWEST...AM NOT EXPECTING THIS ACTIVITY TO CROSS THE 
MOUNTAINS INTO EAST TENNESSEE. STILL SOME DEVELOPMENT MAY OCCUR WEST 
OF THE MOUNTAINS...SO HAVE LOW-END CHANCE POPS FOR OUR MOUNTAIN 
ZONES THROUGH 00Z THIS EVENING. SOME ISOLATED STRONG STORMS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE AND MAINLY BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING SOME BRIEF GUSTY WINDS 
AND HEAVY DOWNPOURS. 

TUESDAY WILL GENERALLY BE A CARBON COPY OF TODAY AS THE RIDGE 
FURTHER BECOMES ENTRENCHED OVER THE REGION AND THICKNESS VALUES AND 
TEMPERATURES ALOFT INCREASE SLIGHTLY. THIS WILL RESULT IN ANOTHER

VALLEY. THE CAP MAY ACTUALLY BE A LITTLE STRONGER TOMORROW WHICH 
WILL LIMIT CONVECTION TO BEING MOSTLY ISOLATED IN NATURE AND 
CONFINED TO THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU ONCE AGAIN. HOWEVER...GIVEN 
THE MOISTURE IN PLACE...FELT CHANCE POPS WAS WARRANTED FOR THE 
TERRAIN ONCE AGAIN GIVEN THE ENHANCED OROGRAPHIC LIFT THERE. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...A RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE BOTH SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL REMAIN THROUGH FRIDAY. AIRMASS
WILL CONTINUE TO BE MOIST AND UNSTABLE WITH MAINLY AFTERNOON AND

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN
OVER THE REGION WITH LOW LEVEL FLOW FROM THE SOUTH. PLENTY OF
MOISTURE WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA THROUGH THE WEEK...WITH DIURNAL
CONVECTION POSSIBLE EACH DAY. EXPECTING THE MAIN DEVELOPMENT ALONG
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND
PLATEAU...WITH MOVEMENT INTO THE VALLEY IN THE LATE AFTERNOON.
TEMPERATURES WILL FOLLOW A GRADUAL WARMING TREND...WITH HIGHS A FEW
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...

AN UPPER-RIDGE WILL REMAIN THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE ACROSS THE 
REGION FOR THIS WEEK...PROMOTING MOSTLY TO PARTY SUNNY AND WARM 
TYPICAL SUMMER-LIKE CONDITIONS. THIS RIDGE WILL CONTINUE BUILDING 
DIRECTLY OVERHEAD FOR TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...WHICH WILL INCREASE 
THICKNESS VALUES/TEMPERATURES ALOFT. AS A RESULT...HIGHS IN THE 
LOWER 90S WILL BE COMMON AREAWIDE THROUGH THURSDAY...WITH SOME 
LOCATIONS OVER THE SOUTHERN VALLEY REACHING THE MID 90S. MOISTURE 
UNDERNEATH THIS RIDGE WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR ISOLATED TO PERHAPS 
SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING EACH 
DAY. HOWEVER...THE WARM TEMPS ALOFT/CAPPING INVERSION WILL HELP TO 
LIMIT THIS DEVELOPMENT SOMEWHAT AND PRIMARILY KEEP THEM CONFINED TO 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU. 

LATE IN THE WEEK THE CENTER OF THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL SINK TO 
THE SOUTH AND WEST WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR SOME SLIGHTLY COOLER 
TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S...AS WELL AS A BETTER 
SHOT FOR SOME MORE WIDESPREAD DIURNAL CONVECTION. THUS...HAVE 
SCATTERED/CHANCE POPS AREAWIDE DURING IN THIS TIME PERIOD IN THE 
AFTERNOON/EVENING. ALSO...THIS WEEKEND SOME ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY 
ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY COULD MOVE SOUTH INTO THE REGION /ESPECIALLY  
INTO THE NORTHEAST ZONES/ AS NORTHWEST ALOFT ALOFT BEGINS TO TAKE 
SHAPE ALONG THE NORTHEASTERN EDGE OF THIS RIDGE. THE UNORGANIZED 
NATURE OF THIS CONVECTION WILL NOT WARRANT MUCH IN THE WAY OF SEVERE 
WEATHER CONCERNS...THOUGH THE INSTABILITY/MOISTURE PRESENT WILL 
ALLOW FOR SOME STRONG MULTICELL CLUSTERS CAPABLE OF GUSTY WINDS AND 
HEAVY RAINFALL.

SO WE MAY SEE SOME DIURNAL CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY THIS AFTERNOON AND

POSSIBLE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...AN UPPER RIDGE WILL DOMINATE 
AREA WEATHER THROUGH MUCH OF THE EXTENDED.  THIS WILL BRING 
SUMMERLIKE LIKE TEMPERATURES AS HIGHS REACH INTO THE UPPER 80S AND 
90S ACROSS MUCH OF THE TN VALLEY.  ADDITIONALLY...SOUTHERLY WINDS 
WILL CARRY MOISTURE INTO THE REGION.  THIS COMBINED WITH THE STRONG 
DIURNAL HEATING WILL GENERATE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION... 
MAINLY DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS AND MAINLY OVER 
HIGHER TERRAIN.  THIS PATTERN WILL CONTINUE THROUGH AT LEAST 
THURSDAY.  THE RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS WEST AROUND THE FRIDAY/SATURDAY

REMAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHAINS. MODELS DO SHOW A GRADUAL
INCREASE IN BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY. RADAR IS
SHOWING SOME WEAK SHOWERS TRY TO DEVELOP OVER SOUTHWEST NORTH
CAROLINA. THIS ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP/INCREASE THIS
AFTERNOON...THEN DIMINISH LATE THIS EVENING.

CALM WINDS AND MOSTLY CLEAR SKY WILL ALLOW FOR GOOD RADATIONAL
COOLING OVERNIGHT WITH PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING...MAINLY NEAR AREA
LAKES AND STREAM AND OVER SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA.

FOR SUNDAY...OVERALL MOSTLY SUNNY/WARMER FOR THE VALLEY...BUT
OROGRAPHIC LIFT AND INCREASING INSTABILITY WILL ALLOW WIDELY
SCATTERED/SCATTERED STORMS TO DEVELOP OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...

AN UPPER-RIDGE WILL REMAIN THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR MOST OF THE WEEK 
AHEAD...PROMOTING MOSTLY TO PARTY SUNNY AND WARM TYPICAL SUMMER-LIKE 
CONDITIONS FOR MID-JUNE. THIS RIDGE WILL BUILD DIRECTLY OVERHEAD 
THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK...WHICH WILL INCREASE THICKNESS 
VALUES/TEMEPRATURES ALOFT. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL CLIMB INTO THE LOW 
90S IN MANY LOCATIONS...AND PREHAPS THE MID 90S OVER PORTIONS OF THE 
SOUTHERN VALLEY FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. SOME MOISTURE WILL EXIST 
UNDERNEATH THIS RIDGE WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR SOME ISOLATED TO PREHAPS 
SCATTERED CONVECTION DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING EACH DAY. 
HOWEVER...GIVEN THE WARM TEMPERATURES/STRONG CAP ALOFT... THIS 
ACTIVITY SHOULD MAINLY STAY CONFINED TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE 
EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS/PLATEAU...WITH MANY VALLEY AREAS STAYING 
DRY. 

LATER ON IN THE WEEK...THE CENTER OF THE RIDGE WILL RETROGRADE 
WEST WHICH WILL PLACE THE AREA UNDER A MORE NORTHWESTERLY FLOW 
ALOFT. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR A GREATER COVERAGE OF DIURNAL 
CONVECTION...AS WELL AS SOME ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY ACROSS THE OHIO 
VALLEY TO MOVE SOUTH INTO THE REGION /ESPECAILLY INTO THE NORTHEAST 
ZONES/. GIVEN THIS...HAVE CHANCE POPS AREAWIDE FOR THE LATER HALF OF

WARRENT MUCH IN THE WAY OF SEVERE WEATHER CONCERNS...THOUGH THE 
INSTABLITY/MOISTURE PRESENT WILL ALLOW FOR SOME STRONG MULTICELL

MOISTURE.  THIS COMBINED WITH STRONG DIURNAL HEATING WILL ALLOW FOR

ISOLATED WITH BEST CHANCES OVER HIGHER TERRAIN.  THE WEATHER PATTERN 
WILL CHANGE LITTLE THROUGH THE PERIOD...THOUGH THE RIDGE DOES DAMPEN

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS
A WEAK COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE WESTERN SLOPES OF THE CUMBERLAND
PLATEAU...WITH SCATTERED CONVECTION OCCURRING AHEAD OF IT OVER THE
FORECAST AREA. AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL HELP TO PUSH THIS FRONTAL
BOUNDARY THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...WITH MOST OF THE
CONVECTION EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE SHORTLY AFTER SUNSET. WITH CLEAR
SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS DEVELOPING BEHIND THE FRONTAL PASSAGE...EXPECT
AREAS OF FOG TO DEVELOP OVER THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT.
MODELS INDICATE THAT A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL DEVELOP
OVER THE SMOKIES AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA DURING THE AFTERNOON
ON SATURDAY...SO WILL MENTION ISOLATED CONVECTION IN THESE AREAS. AS
FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR
TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SOME UPPER-RIDGING WILL
CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE REGION FOR SUNDAY INTO MOST OF NEXT WEEK...
WHICH WILL PROMOTE MOSTLY TO PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS AND A WARMING
TREND THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. HIGHS WILL CLIMB FROM THE MID TO
UPPER 80S ON SUNDAY TO THE LOWER 90S IN MANY AREAS BY TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY...THANKS TO INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES/TEMPERATURES ALOFT...
AS THE RIDGE BUILDS IN DIRECTLY OVER EAST TENNESSEE. DURING THIS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...EASTERN STATES TROUGH CONTINUES TO 
SHIFT VERY SLOWLY EAST BUT WILL STILL BE A MAJOR PLAYER IN TODAY'S 
WEATHER FOR THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. TROPICAL MOISTURE WILL 
CONTINUE TO STREAM ACROSS THE REGION TODAY. MODELS PROG SUFFICIENT 
INSTABILITY TO KEEP MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST. 
CONVECTION SHOULD REMAIN NON-SEVERE ACROSS THE REGION TODAY ALTHOUGH 
SLOW MOVING SHOWERS OR STORMS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE HEAVY 
DOWNPOURS DUE TO RELATIVELY SLOW MOVEMENT IN DEEP MOIST ENVIRONMENT. 
STAYED CLOSE TO A GUIDANCE BLEND FOR MAX TEMPS TODAY WITH EASTERN 
SECTIONS REMAINING A DEGREE OR TWO COOLER ON AVERAGE UNDER MORE 
PERSISTENT CLOUD COVER WHILE WESTERN SECTIONS ENJOY A LITTLE MORE IN 
THE WAY OF INSOLATION. WENT ABOUT ONE TO TWO DEGREES ABOVE SUGGESTED 
MINS WHICH LOOKED OPTIMISTICALLY COOL IN THE RATHER HUMID AIRMASS 
PRESENT OVER THE REGION.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS 
PERIOD THE UPPER TROUGH IS STILL IN THE AREA BUT SWEEPING 
EASTWARD...AND A COLD FRONT SHOULD BE APPROACHING THE AREA.  DURING 
THE DAY ON FRIDAY...THE COLD FRONT AND AN UPPER SHORT WAVE WILL BE 
SWEEPING THROUGH THE AREA...WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE A DECENT 
CHANCE AT A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO MARCH THROUGH THE 
AREA...BUT DEVELOPING LEE TROUGH EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS WILL BE 
INDUCING MORE OF A WESTERLY PRE-FRONTAL WIND OVER OUR AREA...THEREBY 
REDUCING THE FOCUS ALONG THE FRONT...SO KEEPING POPS MAINLY IN 
CHANCE CATEGORY. 
 
BY SATURDAY...FRONT IS THROUGH THE AREA...THE UPPER TROUGH HAS MOVE 
AWAY TO THE EAST AND THE UPPER RIDGE IS BUILDING IN...SO KEEPING 
SATURDAY DRY.  ALSO KEEPING DRY FOR SATURDAY NIGHT...THEN LETTING 
SOME POPS BACK INTO THE EASTERN AND SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA AS 
THE SYSTEM ALONG THE GULF BEGINS TO SPREAD MOISTURE BACK TOWARD THE 
AREA FROM THE SOUTHEAST.  BY MONDAY MOISTURE IS BACK IN THE 
AREA...BUT NO ORGANIZED LIFT WILL BE IN THE AREA...WILL ONLY GO WITH 
SLIGHT POPS FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT.  BY TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY...LOOKS LIKE DEEPER MOISTURE AND SOME WEAK LIFT WILL BE 
MOVING IN...SO PUMPING UP POPS TO CHANCE CATEGORY FOR DAY...AND 
SLIGHT CHANCE AT NIGHT AS DIURNAL HEATING GETS BETTER COVERAGE OF 
SHOWERS/STORMS.  FOR TEMPERATURES...WENT CLOSE TO GUIDANCE IN MOST

340 AM EDT WED JUN 11 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A RIVER OF MOIST AIR WILL CONTINUE 
TO FLOW NORTH FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO TODAY AND TONIGHT DUE TO THE 
POSITION OF AN UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE MIDWEST. A COUPLE OF SHORTER 
WAVELENGTH FEATURES WILL RIDE NORTHEAST INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS GENERATING SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS 
MAINLY TODAY. HOWEVER THERE WILL STILL BE A FEW SHOWERS EXITING 
ACROSS THE EASTERN PART OF THE VIEWING AREA TONIGHT. STAYED CLOSER 
TO THE LOWER MET MOS MAXES TODAY WHILE EDGING ABOUT A DEGREE ABOVE 
THE MILDEST GUIDANCE FOR MINS TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...THE SLOW-MOVING MID/UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH AXIS WILL BE DIRECTLY OVER THE AREA TO START THE 
PERIOD. THIS WILL PLACE HIGHEST RAIN CHANCES...IN THE LIKELY 
RANGE...FOR THE EASTERN HALF OF THE AREA. A WEAK RIDGE BETWEEN 
SYSTEMS MOVES THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...LOWERING POPS TO LOW TO 
SLIGHT CHANCES BEFORE RISING AGAIN ON FRIDAY IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT AND LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT DEVELOPS ON THE 
FRONT TO OUR SW. MODELS DIFFER ON THE POSITION OF THE FRONT THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND...SO CONFIDENCE BEYOND FRIDAY IS LOW. WITH THE FRONT 
EXPECTED TO BE SOMEWHERE IN THE VICINITY...WILL KEEP AT LEAST SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS THROUGH SATURDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL STAY CLOSE TO CLIMO.

SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY WILL FEATURE A LOW LEVEL SW FLOW DOMINATED BY 
THE ATLANTIC RIDGE...AND A MID/UPPER RIDGE POSITIONED OVER TX AND 
THE LOWER MS REGION. ORGANIZED FORCING FOR PRECIP APPEARS TO BE 
LACKING IN THIS PATTERN...BUT THERE WILL PROBABLY BE ENOUGH LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE SUPPLY TO HAVE AT LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF DIURNALLY-
DRIVEN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY. BETTER CHANCES WILL 
DEPEND ON CONVECTIVELY-INDUCED UPSTREAM DISTURBANCES THAT THE MODELS 
CANNOT RESOLVE THIS FAR OUT. WILL HAVE A GENERAL WARMING TREND 
THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...AN APPROACHING UPPER LOW PRESSURE HAS BROUGHT MOIST 
SOUTHWEST FLOW TO THE AREA.  ACCOMPANYING THIS WILL BE A UPPER LEVEL 
JET.  THIS COMBINED WITH A WEAKLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL LEAD TO 
AFTERNOON CONVECTION ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION.  THE 
JET DYNAMICS WILL AID THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT.  THE MAIN FOCUS WILL BE OVER SOUTHERN LOCATIONS AND 
WELL AS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU.  BEST CHANCE FOR ORGANIZED 
DEVELOPMENT WILL BE LATE IN THE AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS.  
SOME OF THE STORMS MAY BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE.  ALL HANDLED WELL IN

.DISCUSSION...
AFTER ANOTHER FAIR WEATHER DAY...MOSTLY CLEAR AND CALM CONDITIONS
ARE PREVAILING FOR NOW ACROSS THE EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY AND THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. TO THE SOUTH AND WEST...ALONG THE BORDER OF
ALABAMA...GEORGIA AND TENNESSEE A WEAK THETA-E AXIS/STATIONARY
FRONT REMAINS FIXED. TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THIS BOUNDARY...A
MODERATELY UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT STILL EXISTS WHICH HAS ALLOWED
ANOTHER MCS TO FORM/HOLD TOGETHER ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH INTO THE
SOUTHERN TENNESSEE VALLEY. TO THE NORTHEAST AND EAST...A MUCH MORE
STABLE ENVIRONMENT EXISTS...WHICH WILL PROHIBIT MUCH IN THE WAY OF
THUNDER ACTIVITY ONCE THE AFOREMENTIONED SQUALL LINE APPROACHES
THE CENTRAL VALLEY LATER TONIGHT. THE LATEST RUN OF THE
HRRR INDICATES A LINE OF STRONG/SEVERE CONVECTION MAINTAINING
ITSELF WELL INTO SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND EVEN INTO SOUTHWEST NORTH
CAROLINA LATER TONIGHT BETWEEN 03-06Z...BEFORE IT SPREADS NORTHWARD
INTO THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY AND BEGINS TO DISSIPATE
BETWEEN 06-12Z.

THUS FOR THE FORECAST...HAVE INCREASED POPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
PLATEAU AND VALLEY TO LIKELY BETWEEN 03-09Z AND HIGH-END CHANCE
AREAWIDE AFTER 06Z. THINK THAT THE INTENSITY OF THESE STORMS AND
HOW LONG THEY CAN KEEP GOING WILL BE TIED TO A FAIRLY STOUT 850-700
MB JET WHICH IS ACCELERATING THE LINE TOWARD THE I-65 CORRIDOR AS
OF 9:30 PM EDT. WHILE SOME WEAKENING IS EXPECTED WITH THE LOSS OF
HEATING AND SLIGHTLY WEAKER INSTABILITY...THINK THAT THE THREAT FOR
STRONG TO ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND
VALLEY WILL BE POSSIBLE THROUGH 06Z OR SO. THE PRIMARY IMPACT WILL
BE GUSTY CONVECTIVE THUNDERSTORM WINDS AND SOME LOCALLY HEAVY
RAINFALL WITH THE LINE...AS WELL AS SOME GUSTY WINDS FOR AN HOUR OR
SO IN WAKE OF THE LINE. THUS...WILL ADD A MENTION OF THIS TO THE
HWO.

LOCATIONS ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WILL LIKELY JUST EXPERIENCE
SOME SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS AROUND DAYBREAK AS THIS ACTIVITY
CONTINUES TO WANE. OTHERWISE...CLOUDS WILL EXPAND QUICKLY OVER THE
ENTIRE AREA BETWEEN 03-06Z WHICH WILL HELP MAINTAIN TEMPERATURES IN
THE 60S OVERNIGHT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...BROAD...DIFFUSES BOUNDARY WILL 
CONTINUE TO SLOWLY LIFT NORTH ACROSS THE AREA THIS EVENING.  A STRAY 
SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM WILL BE POSSIBLE AS THIS BOUNDARY MOVES THROUGH. 
WE WILL SEE A BETTER CHANCE OF CONVECTION DEVELOP OVER THE AREA ON 
TUESDAY AS SHORT WAVE OUT AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING UPPER LOW MOVES IN 
FROM THE WEST. INSTABILITY IS RATHER WEAK BUT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS 
SUFFICIENT AND LIFT FROM THE SHORT WAVE SHOULD ALLOW FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS.  HOWEVER...THERE IS A 
QUESTION AS TO THE TIMING OF THIS DEVELOPMENT.  EXPECT ISOLATED TO 
SCATTERED CONVECTION TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM BUT THE MAIN 
BAND MAY NOT MOVE INTO UNTIL LATE AFTERNOON OR EVENING.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...ECMWF AND GFS SIMILAR 
WITH WEATHER PATTERN OVERALL...ESPECIALLY THROUGH MID TO LATE WEEK. 
RAIN CHANCES LOOK TO RUN 50 PERCENT OR BETTER FOR MUCH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...POSSIBLY INTO THURSDAY. 
THE UPPER LOW TO OUR WEST LIFTING NE...THEN TRACKING EASTWARD 
THROUGH THE APPALACHIANS...SHOULD PROVIDE UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT TO 
INCREASE COVERAGE. RAISED POPS SLIGHTLY FOR THOSE PERIODS BELOW 
CATEGORICAL VALUES. 

GFS MODEL CREATES HEAVIER RAINS AND MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION FOR 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY THAN THE ECMWF...AS ANOTHER UPPER LOW OR TROUGH 
DROPS IN BEHIND THE MID WEEK SYSTEM. FOLLOWED ECMWF SOLUTION FOR NOW 
AND KEPT POPS JUST IN THE SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE CATEGORY THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND. ALSO...FAVORED THE SLIGHTLY COOLER MAX TEMPS FROM ECMX 
MOS OVER THE GFSX MOS FOR FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY PERIODS. INTRODUCED 
MONDAY (NEW DAY 7) AS PARTLY CLOUDY AND 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
THE POOR PERFORMANCE OF THE MODELS OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS AND THE 
LACK OF ANY WELL-DEFINED FORCING MECHANISMS TODAY AND TONIGHT RESULT 
IN A LOW CONFIDENCE FORECAST FOR THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. THE 
CONVECTION OVER W TN IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN BY THE TIME IT REACHES 
OUR AREA AS IT ENCOUNTERS A LOW LEVEL RIDGE AND MORE STABLE AIR. 
STILL...SOME SHOWERS COULD MOVE ACROSS WESTERN AND SOUTHERN PORTIONS 
OF THE AREA THIS MORNING...AND WILL INCLUDE CHANCE POPS IN THOSE 
AREAS. THE CLOSED LOW OVER THE PLAINS DIRFTS SLOWLY EAST TO THE 
OZARKS BY TONIGHT. THERE MAY BE SOME WEAK VORT MAXES INDUCED BY 
UPSTREAM CONVECTION THAT COULD BRING SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND STORMS...BUT FORCING REMAINS WEAK. GIVEN THE TREND OF 
MODELS TO BE TOO WET LATELY...WITH UNDERCUT MOS POPS TONIGHT AND 
STAY IN THE CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE. INCREASING MOISTURE TODAY 
SHOULD PROVIDE BROKEN CLOUD COVER MOST OF THE DAY...AND WILL LEAN 
TOWARD THE COOLER SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
PER NCEP DISCUSSION...WILL TREND THE EXTENDED FORECAST TO THE
ECMWF MODEL. MAIN WEATHER FEATURE WILL BE UPPER TROUGH THAT MOVES
ACROSS THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY BEFORE
LIFTING NORTHEAST INTO THE GREAT LAKES FOR THURSDAY IN RESPONSE TO
ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS. IN RESULT WILL BE A
GOOD DEAL OF SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY FOR TUESDAY THROUGH
THURSDAY.

MODELS SHOW DECENT UPPER LEVEL JET DYNAMICS OVER THE 
PLATEAU/SOUTHEAST FOR WEDNESDAY. WOULD NOT BE SUPRISED TO SEE 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL FOR MID-WEEK WITH LOCALIZED FLASH FLOOD 
PROBLEMS.

EVEN THOUGH UPPER TROUGH MOVES NORTH OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT/THURSDAY...A GOOD DEAL OF MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL REMAIN 
FOR SCATTERED STORMS. FOR FRIDAY...ANOTHER FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL 
PULL INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS PRODUCING SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS. THIS BOUNDARY WILL PULL JUST SOUTH OF THE AREA FOR

LOW PRESSURE WILL BE MOVING EAST JUST NORTH OF THE OHIO RIVER 
TODAY...WITH A TRAILING FRONT/TROUGH MOVING ACROSS OUR AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW CONFLICTING SIGNALS REGARDING 
SHORT TERM CONVECTIVE TRENDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT. THE NAM AND 
RAP SHOW PRECIP DEVELOPING IN ERN KY AND SW VA LATER THIS 
MORNING...WHILE THE HRRR SHOWS NOTHING. SREF PLUMES OF QPF SHOW A 
WIDE SPREAD BETWEEN MEMBERS TODAY. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE MEAN AND 
HAVE POPS RISING TO HIGH CHANCES NORTH AFTER 12Z...THEN DECREASING 
AFTER 18Z. THERE ARE ALSO BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE NAM AND GFS 
REGARDING HOW UNSTABLE IT WILL BE TODAY. WITH QUITE A BIT OF HIGH 
CLOUD COVER TO START THE DAY...INSTABILITY AND THUS SEVERE POTENTIAL 
WILL LIKELY BE LOW. STAYED ON THE COOL SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE FOR 
TEMPERATURES TODAY. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE BUILDING INTO THE AREA 
FROM THE NW TONIGHT...WITH DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIR ALOFT ENDING 
ANY PRECIP CHANCES BEFORE MIDNIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
MAIN WEATHER FEATURE FOR THE EXTENDED IS AN UPPER TROUGH INITIALLY
OVER THE MID-SECTION OF THE COUNTY. THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS DO HAVE
SOME MINOR DISAGREEMENTS AND WILL BASE THE FORECAST ALONG WITH A
COMPROMISE OF THE GFS AND ECMWF.

FOR MONDAY...FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE SOUTH OF THE AREA WITH MOST OF 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS DRY. BOUNDARY LIFTS NORTHEAST FOR TUESDAY 
AS BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS BECOME SOUTHERLY. 

FOR TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...UPPER TROUGH LIFTS NORTHEAST TOWARD 
THE GREAT LAKES WITH STREAM OF MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIR OVER THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. SCATTERED-BROKEN 
COVERAGE OF STORMS ANTICIPATED. SOME OF THESE THUNDERSTORMS COULD BE 
STRONG TO ISOLATED SEVERE.

FOR FRIDAY...UPPER TROUGH HAS EXITED THE GREAT LAKES...BUT PLENTY OF 
MOISTURE REMAINS WITH FRONTAL BOUNDARY NEAR THE AREA...SO WILL 
CONTINUE WITH CHANCE OF STORMS. FOR SATURDAY...FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
LOOKS TO BE ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE...BUT CONFIDENCE QUITE LOW ON 
LOCATION OF BOUNDARY.

AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORTWAVE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE REGION
TONIGHT...BRINGING A DECENT CHANCE FOR SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION TO
THE FORECAST AREA. TO THE WEST ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE...SCT BANDS
OF STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ARE SLOWLY CONTINUING TO DRIFT
EASTWARD. THIS ACTIVITY IS LARGELY UNORGANIZED DUE TO THE WEAK
WIND SHEAR AND IS IN THE MODE OF MULTICELL CLUSTERS. A THETA-E
AXIS/STATIONARY FRONT IS DRAPED ROUGHLY ALONG A LINE FROM
MADISONVILLE TO HARRIMAN...WHICH SEPARATES A MODERATELY UNSTABLE
ATMOSPHERE FROM A MOSTLY STABLE ENVIRONMENT TO THE NORTH AND EAST.
IN ADDITION...THE INSTABILITY THAT DOES EXIST TO THE SOUTH AND WEST
IS BEGINNING TO WANE WITH THE LOSS OF SOLAR HEATING. STILL...THINK
THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME LOCALLY STRONG STORMS WILL EXIST ACROSS THE
PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE THROUGH MIDNIGHT OR SO GIVEN THE
MODEST INSTABILITY IN PLACE. THOUGH THESE SHOWERS WILL ALSO BEGIN
TO DISSIPATE IN COVERAGE AS THEY MOVE INTO EAST TENNESSEE
OVERNIGHT...STILL THINK A 50-60 POP IS WARRANTED ACROSS THE ENTIRE
AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT AS THESE SPOTTY SHOWERS WILL LINGER THROUGH
DAYBREAK DUE TO THE UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT. INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND
POPS BEFORE MIDNIGHT AS WELL ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF THE REGION

ANDREWS NC LINE. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH SCATTERED
CONVECTION BEGINNING TO REDEVELOP OVER THE OZARKS REGION AHEAD OF ITS
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. BOTH THE NAM AND HRRR MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS

WEAKEN TOWARDS MIDNIGHT AS IT MOVES INTO A MORE STABLE AIR MASS OVER

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
CURRENT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER MIDDLE TN MAY CLIP OUR SW 
COUNTIES LATER THIS MORNING. RESIDUAL OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES MAY HELP 
INITIATE MORE SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON IN SOUTHERN AREAS...OTHERWISE 
THERE WILL BE LITTLE IN THE WAY OF FORCING FOR CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT TODAY. AS WAS THE CASE YESTERDAY...THE GREATER 
INSTABILITY IS IN SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA...AND WILL HAVE 
CHANCE POPS IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY WITH NO POPS FROM KNOXVILLE 
NORTH. WENT BELOW THE GFS MOS GUIDANCE FOR HIGH TEMPS DUE TO ITS 
WARM BIAS THE PAST FEW DAYS. 

THE MODELS PROJECT THAT THE REMNANTS OF UPSTREAM MCS ACTIVITY WILL 
MOVE INTO OUR AREA TONIGHT...THOUGH IN A MUCH WEAKENED STATE. THE 
RIDGE AXIS TO OUR WEST THAT HAS STEERED MOST UPSTREAM CONVECTION TO 
OUR SOUTH THE PAST FEW DAYS WILL MOVE EAST...ALLOWING THE MIDLEVEL 
MCV TO MOVE ACROSS THE AREA. WILL HAVE INCREASING POPS 
OVERNIGHT...WITH HIGH CHANCES AFTER MIDNIGHT IN WESTERN SECTIONS. 
WITH THE LACK OF HEATING TO PROVIDE GOOD INSTABILITY AND WEAK 
SHEAR...THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE STORMS TONIGHT LOOKS LOW.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
THE 00Z ECMWF AND GFS ARE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH EVOLUTION
OF SHORT-WAVES MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS THROUGH
THE EXTENDED WITH A FRONTAL BOUNDARY PULLING BACK-AND-FORTH ACROSS
THE AREA. THESE SYSTEMS WILL KEEP CHANCE-LIKELY POPS GOING EACH DAY
WITH THE BEST CHANCES DURING THE AFTERNOON-EVENING DUE BETTER
INSTABILITY. STRONG TO ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLE ALMOST EACH
DAY...BUT BEST CHANCE FOR ORGANIZED SEVERE WITH MORE SUBSTANTIAL
UPPER TROUGH FOR MID-WEEK.

GENERALLY WENT A DEGREE OR TWO COOLER THAN GFS MEX HIGHS DUE TO 
CLOUD AND RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH CONVECTION. FOLLOWED GFS LOWS CLOSELY.

A WEAK BOUNDARY APPEARS TO BE LOCATED BETWEEN TYS AND 
TRI...EVIDENCED BY A DEWPOINT GRADIENT. THIS BOUNDARY SHOULD MAKE 
SLOW SOUTHWARD PROGRESS THROUGH TONIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE TO THE 
NORTH DRIFTS EAST. CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO BE SOUTH OF 
THIS BOUNDARY TODAY. THERE ARE BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODEL 
DEPICTIONS OF HOW MUCH ACTIVITY WILL DEVELOP IN OUR AREA...WITH THE 
NAM AND LOCAL WRF SHOWING VERY LITTLE...AND THE RUC AND HRRR SHOWING 
QUITE A BIT OF COVERAGE IN SOUTHERN AREAS. WILL HAVE HIGHEST POPS 
SOUTH...BUT STAY IN THE CHANCE RANGE. MCS ACTIVITY OVER THE OZARKS 
THIS MORNING IS EXPECTED TO MAINLY STAY SOUTH OF THE AREA...WHICH IS 
ALSO WHERE THE THREAT FOR SEVERE WEATHER THREAT WILL BE. THUS MOST
CONVECTION IN OUR AREA SHOULD BE DIURNALLY DRIVEN...AND WILL DROP
POPS BACK AFTER SUNSET.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THUSRDAY)... WEAK BOUNDARY WILL BE 
QUASI-STATIONARY ACROSS FAR SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE FOR SATURDAY WITH 
UPSLOPE FLOW INTO THE WESTERN CAROLINAS. WILL CONTINUE TO CALL FOR 
CHANCE POPS NEAR BOUNDARY AND FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE 
MOUNTAINS/SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA.

FOR SUNDAY...GFS SHOWS A SHORT-WAVE AND CYCLO-GENESIS MOVING INTO 
THE OHIO VALLEY WITH BOUNDARY PULLING BACK NORTH. NAM/ECMWF DOES NOT 
SHOW THIS SURFACE REFLECTION. WILL CALL FOR INCREASING 
MOISTURE/INSTABILITY WITH BEST CHANCES OF CONVECTION ACROSS THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

FOR MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY 
OVER THE AREA WITH A QUASI-STATIONARY BOUNDARY OVER THE LOWER OHIO 
AND NORTHERN TENNESSEE VALLEY. MODELS DO SHOW AN UPPER TROUGH WEST 
OF THE AREA. WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS...EXCEPT FOR LIKELY POPS 
FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS DUE TO OROGRAPHIC FORCING. ISOLATED STRONG 
TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE EACH DAY WITH THE MAIN CONCERN 
BEING DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS...LOCALL HEAVY RAINFALL AND MARGINAL

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS
A WEAK COLD FRONT ALONG THE NORTHERN TN BORDER...WITH AN OUTFLOW
BOUNDARY FROM LAST NIGHT'S CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY EXTENDING FARTHER
SOUTH ACROSS NORTHERN AL AND NORTHERN GA. SATELLITE AND RADAR
IMAGERY REVEAL SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER MIDDLE AND EAST TN...
WITH A LARGE MCS OVER THE MID SOUTH MOVING EAST-SOUTHEAST TOWARDS
SOUTHERN MIDDLE TN AND NORTHERN AL. THE NORTHERN EXTENT OF THIS MCS
MAY AFFECT SOUTHEAST TN AND EXTREME SOUTHWEST NC BEFORE SUNSET...SO
WILL KEEP LIKELY POPS IN THESE AREAS UNTIL SUNSET. THE FRONTAL
BOUNDARY IN THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA IS EXPECTED
TO DRIFT FURTHER SOUTH TONIGHT...AND REMAIN QUASI-STATIONARY OVER
THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY. THUS...WILL KEEP SOME CHANCE POPS FOR
FRIDAY...WITH THE HIGHEST POPS OVER SOUTHEAST TN AND EXTREME
SOUTHWEST NC WHERE THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS OF INSTABILITY SHOULD BE
DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TONIGHT...BUT THEN
REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES FOR FRIDAY. WILL PLAN TO COMPROMISE
BETWEEN THE TWO ON FRIDAY...SINCE CLOUDS FROM CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY
SHOULD HELP TO KEEP TEMPS A LITTLE COOLER THAN PREVIOUS DAYS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...NOTHING SIGNIFICANT 
GOING ON DURING THE LONG TERM. OVERALL....IT SEEMS LIKE THERE WILL BE 
AT LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS EACH DAY WITH BETTER 
CHANCES BEGINNING ON SUNDAY AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
FORECAST PERIOD.

NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST DISCUSSION. A 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN SOMEWHAT STATIONARY ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND TENNESSEE VALLEY THROUGH AT LEAST 
SUNDAY. BEING ABLE TO DISCERN EXACTLY WHERE THE BOUNDARY WILL 
MIGRATE TO IS THE DIFFICULT PART. GENERALLY ALONG THIS BOUNDARY 
SHOULD THE BETTER CHANCES FOR SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT 
EXIST. 

SATURDAY...MODELS ARE HINTING AT WEAK AND BRIEF RIDGING OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AS HEIGHTS GETS PINCHED AND FORCED NORTHWARD 
DUE TO BEING IN BETWEEN THE APPROACHING SHORTWAVE TROUGH TO OUR WEST 
AND TROUGH TO OUR NORTHEAST. IF THIS RIDGING DEVELOPS AS MODELS SHOW 
THIS SHOULD HELP TO SUPPRESS CONVECTION...ALTHOUGH SOME SPOTTY 
DIURNAL CONVECTION STILL MAY OCCUR. ALSO...POP CHANCES WILL DEPEND 
ON THE LOCATION OF THE THE OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY. SATURDAY MAY END UP 
BEING THE NICEST DAY DURING THE WHOLE LONG TERM PERIOD.
 
THE NAM AND GFS BOTH SHOW A SHORTWAVE COMING THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING 
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. THIS FEATURE WILL ENHANCE PRECIP CHANCES 
THROUGH THIS TIME FRAME. POPS MAY NEED TO BE RAISED TO LIKELY SOON 
BUT WILL KEEP CHANCE FOR NOW. MORE SHOWERS AND STORMS ARE EXPECTED 
MONDAY OUT AHEAD OF THE NEXT APPROACHING TROUGH AND UPPER LEVEL LOW.
 
ON TUESDAY BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF SHOW A MORE ROBUST TROUGH AND 
UPPER LEVEL LOW JUST TO OUR WEST. PREVIOUS RUNS WERE SHOWING THIS 
UPPER LEVEL LOW BECOMING CUT OFF FROM THE MAIN FLOW AND HANGING OUT 
OVER OUR AREA FOR A FEW DAYS WITH NO WHERE TO GO. IF THIS IS THE 
CASE...TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY COULD BE A WET PERIOD AS THIS AREA 
OF LOW PRESSURE SITS AND SPINS ACROSS THE APPALACHIA'S. LATEST RUNS 
SUGGEST THAT IT WON'T BECOME CUT OFF BUT SLOWLY MEANDER EASTWARD AND 
BE OFF TO OUR EAST BY LATE THURSDAY. STILL MUCH UNCERTAINTY WITH 
THIS FEATURE REGARDING THE EVOLUTION AND PLACEMENT OF THE LOW. WILL 
POPS CHANCE FOR NOW UNTIL MODELS CAN FURTHER AGREE. 

GENERALLY STAYED BELOW GUIDANCE ON MAX TEMPS AS THERE WILL BE QUITE 
A BIT OF CLOUD COVER THROUGH THE LONG TERM AND FOR THIS REASON 
TRENDED A BIT WARMER ON OVERNIGHT LOWS.

TN AND SW NC...WITH MAINLY A FEW SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS
CLIPPING SW VA. 

THINKING FOR LATER TODAY IS THAT OUTFLOW BOUNDARY OR PERHAPS WEAK
FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL LIE ROUGHLY E-W ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC. THUS
CARRIED A SMALL SWATH OF HIGH CHANCE TO LOW LIKELY POPS FOR THOSE
AREAS...TAPERING BACK TO 30 TO 40 PERCENT CHANCES ACROSS SW VA AND
NE TN. REMOVED THE SEVERE WORDING WITH THE EARLIER UPDATE TO DROP
THE TORNADO WATCH. DON'T SEE A THREAT OF STRONG OR SEVERE STORMS
AFTER 12Z TODAY.

PREVIOUS GRIDS LOOKED GOOD FOR TONIGHT...BUT I DID LOWER POPS AND
DECREASE SKY COVER A BIT QUICKER OVER NRN AREAS. A BLEND OF MOS
LOOKED BETTER FOR BOTH TODAY'S HIGHS AND TONIGHT'S LOWS.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AN UNSETTLED PATTERN
STILL ADVERTISED FOR THE LONG TERM WITH IMPROVEMENTS TO PREVIOUS
GRIDS MINIMAL AT BEST. MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY INCREASES OVER THE

JUST YET FOR THOSE PERIDOS...SO STAYED WITH HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR

SEEMED PRUDENT TO CONTINUE CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY
NIGHT...AS WELL AS SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ON TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.
THE MUCH WARMER GFSX MOS MAX TEMPS LOOKED SUSPECT UNTIL TUESDAY

POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD DAMAGING WINDS...AS WELL AS LARGE HAIL...
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL...AND AN ISOLATED TORNADO. RIGHT NOW...IT
APPEARS THAT THIS POTENTIAL MCS SHOULD BEGIN TO AFFECT THE CUMBERLAND
PLATEAU AROUND 00Z (8 PM EDT)...AND THEN THE REST OF THE FORECAST
AREA AFTER SUNSET.

MODELS THEN INDICATE THAT THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL SLOWLY DRIFT 
SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY...WITH ANOTHER MCS 
POSSIBLY FORMING AROUND THE OZARKS REGION THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND 
THEN MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. WHILE THE 
MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL MOVE AS FAR SOUTH AS 
THE SOUTHERN TN BORDER...THINK THAT IT WILL LIKELY BECOME QUASI- 
STATIONARY SOMEWHERE AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THE FORECAST AREA SINCE 
THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW APPEARS TO BECOME PARALLEL TO THE BOUNDARY. 
THUS...WILL KEEP A MENTION OF SCATTERED CONVECTION FOR MOST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT 
WILL TREND TOWARDS THE SLIGHTLY WARMER NAM NUMBERS SINCE THE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN FARTHER NORTH THAN THE MODELS WOULD 
SUGGEST.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL 
REMAIN STATIONARY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND TENNESSEE 
VALLEY THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD. THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD BE ABLE TO 
PRODUCE THE NECESSARY AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY ACROSS THE REGION. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY 
THAT THE CONVECTION COULD BE A LITTLE MORE ORGANIZED AROUND THE 
SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY TIME FRAME AS THE MODELS SHOW A SLIGHTLY MORE 
AMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL TROUGH BUILDING ACROSS THE REGION. THEREFORE 
PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION MAY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED A LITTLE HIGHER 
EARLY IN THE NEW WEEK. TRIMMED A COUPLE DEGREES OFF SUGGESTED HIGH 
TEMPERATURES DURING THE LONG TERM PERIOD.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT JUST NORTH OF THE
OHIO RIVER...WITH A VERY WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST
AREA. SATELLITE AND RADAR IMAGERY REVEAL A LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION
OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY OCCURRING ALONG THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY.
MODELS INDICATE THAT A MODERATELY TO POSSIBLY VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS
DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY AHEAD OF THIS
FRONTAL BOUNDARY. AS A RESULT...THIS CONVECTION OVER THE OHIO RIVER
VALLEY SHOULD STRENGTHEN AS IT MOVES SOUTHEASTWARD TOWARDS THE FORECAST
AREA. WITH A FAIRLY STRONG (AROUND 40 TO 50 KT) MID LEVEL WIND FLOW...
THIS CONVECTION SHOULD ORGANIZE INTO AN MCS WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR
WIDESPREAD DAMAGING WINDS...AND WITH LARGE HAIL AND AN ISOLATED
TORNADO ALSO POSSIBLE. WILL PLAN TO KEEP A MENTION OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON AHEAD OF THIS
POTENTIAL MCS...BUT THE MAIN STORY SHOULD BE THE MCS EXPECTED TONIGHT.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH ROTATING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WILL DRAG A 
WEAK COLD FRONT INTO THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS LATE THIS
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. THIS WILL BRING THE REGION ITS BEST
OPERTUNITY FOR WIDESPREAD MEANINGFUL PRECIPIATION IN QUITE SOME
TIME...AS WELL AS THE THREAT FOR STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS.
THE LATEST RUN OF THE NAM...ALONG WITH THE GFS IS SHOWING SOME
CONVECTION FIRING ALONG THE KENTUCKY/TENNESSEE BORDER INTO
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING
HOURS...WITH A BULK OF THE ACTIIVTY MOVING IN LATE EVENING AND
OVERNIGHT WITH THE MAIN MCS/STORM COMPLEX FEATURE THAT WILL DEEVLOP
OVER THE OHIO VALLEY EARILER IN THE DAY. 

HAVE INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY DURING THIS TIME PERIOD ALONG
NORTHERN/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS FEEL MORE
CONFIDENT ABOUT THIS ACTIVITY MOVING IN LATER ON TONIGHT GIVEN THE
BETTER MODEL CONTINUITY. HOWEVER...SHOULD THIS ACTIIVTY BE SLOWER
IN ITS PROGRESSION AND BEGIN TO FIZZLE OUT...THE SOUTHERN PART OF
THE AREA MAY MISS OUT ON PRECIPIATION AGAIN ALL TOGETHER. THUS FOR
NOW...HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT CAUTIOUS WITH POPS AND HAVE KEPT THE
NORTHERN ZONES BELOW CATEGORICAL. STILL THINK THE POTENTIAL FOR
SOME SUPERCELL STRUCTURES WILL EXIST...ESPECAILLY IF SOME DISCRETE
ACTIVITY CAN DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE MAIN LINE EARILER ON IN THE
EVENING. MODEL SOUDINGS AT KTRI/KTYS SUPPORT THIS AND EXHIBIT
CURVED HODOGRAPHS AND A STRONG SHEAR PROFILE...WHICH WOULD SUPPORT
ROTATING UPDRAFTS. HOWEVER...STILL THINK THAT THE PRIMARY STORM
MODE WILL BE LINEAR IN NATURE AS THIS ACTIVITY CONGEALS ALONG THE
OHIO VALLEY EARLIER IN THE EVENING AND MOVES INTO NORTHERN
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA LATER ON IN THE NIGHT. AS
MENTIONED...THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME ROTATING UPDRAFTS IN SOME OF THE
SUPERCELL/BOOK-END STRUCTURES WILL WARRANT AN ISOLATED TORNADO
THREAT...BUT THE PRIMARY IMPACT WILL BE DAMAGING STRAIGHT-LINE
WINDS AND HAIL. AS MENTIONED...THE MOST FAVORED AREAS WILL ROUGHLY
BE THE NORTEHRN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH LOCATIONS ALONG
AND SOUTH OF I-40 HAVING A LOWER SEVERE WEATHER THREAT.
HOWEVER...SHOULD THIS ACTIVITY MOVE IN FASTER THAN EXPECTED...A
DAMAGING WIND THREAT WILL EXIST WELL INTO THE SOUTHERN VALLEY
COUNTIES.
 
.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
BANKING ON CONVECTION 
MOVING INTO OUR FORECAST AREA EARLY THURSDAY ASSOCIATED WITH MCS 
ACTIVITY...SO 12Z TO 18Z THURSDAY LOOKS LIKE BEST BET FOR SOME 
BENEFICIAL RAINS. HOWEVER...MODELS DO DIFFER ON TIMING AND POTENTIAL 
STRENGTH OF THIS CONVECTION. THIS MCS COULD WEAKEN...LEAVING OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES FOR LATER DEVELOPMENT...WHICH WOULD CLEARLY SHIFT THE 
TIMING AND LOCATION OF MORE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

THE THUNDERSTORM COMPLEX SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY 
THURSDAY EVENING...BUT RAIN CHANCES CERTAINLY REMAIN IN THE FORECAST 
JUST ABOUT EVERYDAY. THE UPPER RIDGE TO OUR WEST IS SHOWN TO HAVE 
SEVERAL RIPPLES OF NEW CONVECTION TRACKING OUR WAY. GOOD MODEL 
CONSENSUS FOR INCREASED COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BY 
SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT HESITATED TO GO LIKELY JUST YET.

A SLIGHTLY MORE AMPLIFIED SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS BEING ADVERTISED BY 
BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS...MOVING ACROSS THE MID MS VALLEY 
REGION EARLY MONDAY. ADDED LOW CHANCE POPS ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA 
BASED ON THIS FOR MONDAY...BUT KEPT MONDAY NIGHT GRIDS DRY FOR NOW. 

OTHERWISE...SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ALSO ADDED FOR TUESDAY IN LINE WITH 
GFSX MOS TRENDS...PLUS OUR DRY GRIDS WERE AN OUTLIER FROM ADJACENT 
NWS GRIDS. 

FOR TEMPS...UNDERCUT THURSDAY M0S MAXES GIVEN THE EXPECTED ORGANIZED 
CONVECTION. GFSX MOS CONTINUES TO ADVERTISE HIGHS REACHING INTO THE 
UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S DURING THE LONG TERM...WHICH IS QUESTIONABLE 
GIVEN THE CLOUDINESS AND PERSISTENT RAIN CHANCES THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
MOS MINS WERE REASONABLE...CLOSE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS...AND GENEARLLY 
FOLLOWED.

MORNING RAINFALL COVERAGE HAS NOT BEEN AS HIGH AS PREVIOUSLY
THOUGHT. THE ENHANCED CLOUDINESS AND LACK OF FORCING HAS CAUSED THE

MOVING SOUTHEAST OUT OF SOUTHERN MIDDLE TN WILL MOVE INTO MARION

UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND WEAK COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO WEAKEN NOW OVER
MIDDLE TN NE INTO ERN KY. SHORT RANGE MODELS DIFFER CONSIDERABLY ON
TIMING AND COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LATER TODAY...BUT
EXPECT THIS INITIAL CONVECTION WILL MOVE INTO NRN PLATEAU AND SW VA
THIS MORNING...WEAKENING BEFORE DEVELOPING AGAIN INTO THE AFTERNOON
HOURS AND WORKING SE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF OUR FORECAST AREA. 

FORECAST GRIDS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THIS MOST LIKELY SCENARIO...
ALLOWING FOR RAIN CHANCES TO DIMINISH FROM THE NORTH DURING THE
DAY. STAYED BELOW THE LIKELY POPS FROM NAM MOS FOR NOW DUE TO MODEL
DIFFERENCES.  

EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD BE CONFINED TO SRN
AREAS...THEN SHOWERS FROM A WEAKENING MCS MAY REACH SW VA AND NE TN
BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z WEDNESDAY. MOS GUIDANCE SUGGESTS AREAS OF FOG
DEVELOPING TONIGHT...BUT HELD OFF ON ADDING THIS TO WEATHER GRIDS
DUE TO UNCERTAINTY AND POSSIBLE LINGERING CLOUDS. 

FOR TEMPS...MAX TEMPS TODAY MORE CHALLENGING THAN TONIGHT'S MINS
AND WILL BE AFFECTED BY TIMING OF CONVECTION. STAYED CLOSE TO A MOS
BLEND AND ADJACENT NWS GRIDS.


.LONG TERM.../WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH ROTATING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WILL DRAG A 
WEAK COLD FRONT INTO THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
INTO THURSDAY. AHEAD OF THIS FRONT...A COMPLEX OF STORMS WILL 
DEVELOP ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND EVENTUALLY TRACK INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY LATER IN THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS. THERE IS STILL SOME 
UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF THIS EVENT THIS 
FAR TO THE SOUTH. THE NAM-12 IS MUCH MORE PESSIMISTIC REGARDING 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES AND SHOWS A BULK OF THE ACTIVITY WELL TO THE 
NORTH ALONG THE OHIO RIVER. THE GFS MEANWHILE MAINTAINS THE FRONT 
AND ASSOCIATED MCS/STORM COMPLEX DROPPING SOUTH INTO THE REGION 
DURING THE LATE EVENING AND PUSHING INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND EVEN 
PARTS OF THE SOUTHERN VALLEY LATE IN THE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING.

AS A RESULT...POPS WERE TRICKY...BUT DID LEAN SLIGHTLY TOWARD THE 
GFS SOLUTION AND HAVE BUMPED POPS ALONG THE TENNESSEE/KENTUCKY 
BORDER AND IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA TO LIKELY AS HAVE A MUCH HIGHER 
CONFIDENCE THAT THOSE AREAS WILL EXPERIENCE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY THURSDAY MORNING. THE LATEST SOUNDING 
DATA AT KTRI/KTYS INDICATES THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME SUPERCELLS GIVEN 
THE CURVED HODOGRAPHS AND STRONG SHEAR...WHICH WOULD SUPPORT 
ROTATING UPDRAFTS. HOWEVER...THINK THAT THE PRIMARY STORM MODE WILL 
BE LINEAR IN NATURE AS THIS ACTIVITY CONGEALS ALONG THE OHIO VALLEY 
EARLIER IN THE EVENING AND CLIPS NORTHERN TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA LATER ON IN THE NIGHT. AS MENTIONED...THE POTENTIAL FOR 
SOME ROTATING UPDRAFTS AND SOME DISCRETE ACTIVITY WILL WARRANT AN 
ISOLATED TORNADO THREAT...BUT THE PRIMARY IMPACT WILL BE DAMAGING  
STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS AND HAIL. AS MENTIONED...THE MOST FAVORED AREAS 
WILL BE THE NORTHERN AND NORTHEASTERN ZONES...WITH LOCATIONS ALONG

THEREAFTER...AN UPPER-RIDGE WILL BUILD BACK INTO THE REGION ON 
FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND...RESULTING IN CONTINUED WARM AND HUMID 
WEATHER...WITH ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION EXPECTED EACH DAY. 
ANOTHER WEAK FRONT SUNDAY NIGHT MAY RESULT IN A MORE ORGANIZED

JUST TO OUR WEST. GENERALLY...WE HAVE DEWPOINTS IN THE 50S TO NEAR 
60 WHILE MIDDLE TN IS IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S. THIS DRIER AIR
SHOULD PREVENT SHOWERS ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA FOR THE REST OF THE
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN PLACE FOR A
SHOWER AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE PLATEAU AND
SWVA.

LATER TONIGHT A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BEGIN TO APPROACH OUR 
AREA OUT OF THE NORTHWEST. SLOWLY STARTED INCREASING POPS AFTER
MIDNIGHT ON TUESDAY. POPS CONTINUE TO INCREASE THROUGH THE NIGHT
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE BEST CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
WILL BE BETWEEN 15 AND 18 UTC ON TUESDAY. THERE IS A BIT OF
COVERAGE DIFFERENCE IN PRECIP BETWEEN THE NAM AND GFS. THE NAM
WANTS TO HAVE A CLEAN LINE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS EXITING BY 18 TO
21Z WHILE THE GFS KEEPS SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS AROUND ALL
DAY. WILL TREND CLOSER TO THE GFS AS THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WON'T
HAVE MUCH PUSH BEHIND IT THEREFORE BEING SLOWER TO EXIT. ROUGHLY
800 TO 12OO J/KG CAPE WILL BE PRESENT BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON SO
THERE COULD BE A FEW STRONG STORMS AROUND WITH LOCALLY GUSTY WINDS
AND PEA SIZED HAIL. HOWEVER...MID AND UPPER LEVEL WINDS WILL BE
QUITE WEAK SO NOT EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF SEVERE.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS IN REASONABLE 
AGREEMENT OVERALL FOR THE LONG TERM PERIOD...ALTHOUGH EARLY IN THE 
PERIOD THE NAM IS AN OUTLIER IN HOW STRONG IT HAS THE LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM MOVING BY TO OUR NORTH...WHICH HAS IMPLICATIONS ABOUT HOW 
QUICK/HOW FAR SOUTH THE FRONT SURGES.  WILL GENERALLY LEAN TOWARD A 
GFS/ECMWF SOLUTION THERE.  FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS ABOUT AVERAGE FOR 
THIS TIME OF YEAR.  FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE TO OUR NORTH TUESDAY 
NIGHT/WEDNESDAY...AND SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY MAY HELP TO 
TRIGGER CONVECTION ESPECIALLY NORTH CLOSER TO THE FRONT.  WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT AND THURSDAY EXPECTED TO BE MORE ACTIVE WITH CONVECTION AS 
COLD FRONT PUSHES IN. THE FRONT WILL LIKELY STALL NEAR OUR SOUTHERN 
BORDER...WITH SOME DRIER AIR FILTERING IN MAINLY NORTH. WILL GO DRY 
NORTH/SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SOUTH FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.  MOISTURE MAY 
RETURN BY SUNDAY AND MONDAY WITH ANOTHER FRONT APPROACHING...ALONG 
WITH BETTER CHANCES FOR CONVECTION.  GFS MOS TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE 
FOR THE MOST PART SO WILL GENERALLY STAY CLOSE.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RAIN FREE ACROSS THE REGION THIS 
MORNING WITH LOW CLOUD DECK ADVECTING NORTHWARD FROM NE AL AND NRN 
GA. MOST OF NE TN AND SW VA UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES...ALTHO TEMP 
AND DEW POINT TEMP SPREADS LARGE ENOUGH TO INHIBIT ANY FOG SO FAR.

SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES LOOK QUITE LOW FOR TODAY...BUT KEPT 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES AND LEE/WISE COUNTIES OF 
SW VA. MODELS A BIT SLOWER IN SPREADING ANY CONVECTION SE INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...BUT I CAN'T RULE OUT SOME ISOLATED 
CONVECTION OVERNIGHT...SO KEPT CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS AND 
NWS NEIGHBORS FOR NOW.

SOUNDINGS AND TIME HEIGHT SECTIONS SHOW INCREASING MID AND HIGH 
CLOUDS THIS AFTERNOON...SO KEPT MAX TEMPS CLOSE TO A BLEND OF MOS. 
THIS SHOULD MEAN HIGHS QUITE CLOSE TO SUNDAY MAXES. WENT CLOSE TO 
THE SLIGHTLY MILDER GFS MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN
SHIFTING SURFACE HIGH EAST TUESDAY WITH WEAK FRONT MOVING INTO THE
OHIO VALLEY. INCREASED MOISTURE MOVES UP FROM THE SOUTH AND DOWN
FROM THE NW. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING SE WILL TRIGGER SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY IN THE AFTERNOON. NAM MODEL MOVES SHORTWAVE
THROUGH RAPIDLY DRYING OUT ATMOSPHERE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY.
ECMWF ALSO FAST WITH SHORTWAVE BUT LEAVES SOME RESIDUAL MOISTURE
AND SHORTWAVE ENERGY TUESDAY NIGHT. GFS A LITTLE SLOWER WITH RAIN
CHANCES CONTINUING OVERNIGHT. WILL HAVE HIGHEST POPS TUESDAY BUT
LEAVE SOME RESIDUAL RAIN CHANCES TUESDAY EVENING. UPPER RIDGE TO
THE WEST BUILDS EAST WEDNESDAY. NAM MODEL KEEPS IT DRY WHILE
GFS/ECMWF STILL KEEPS CHANCE OF RAIN OVER REGION. THINK LINGERING
MOISTURE AND HEATING WILL ALLOW CONVECTION TO REFORM WEDNESDAY BUT
NOT BE AS WIDESPREAD. HEIGHTS RISE WITH TEMPERATURES SEVERAL
DEGREES WARMER WEDNESDAY.

THE COLD FRONT IN THE OHIO VALLEY WILL THEN MOVE SLOWLY SOUTH
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT OR THURSDAY AND REMAIN IN
THE VICINITY THROUGH FRIDAY. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL ALLOW
SHOWERS AND STORMS TO DEVELOP WITH THE HEATING OF THE DAY AND
CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING. THERE MAY BE A DRIER DAY SATURDAY BUT
ANOTHER SURFACE LOW THAT FORMS IN THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ALONG THE OLD
FRONT MOVES EAST ALONG THE FRONT AND REDEVELOPS CONVECTION ALONG
THE FRONT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY INCREASING RAIN CHANCES.
TEMPERATURES STAY NEAR TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL WITH HIGHS IN THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...LAYER HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
GRADUALLY SHIFT SE OF THE AREA THROUGH THE PERIOD. LITTLE CHANGE IN 
ABOVE NORMAL LAYER MOISTURE AND TEMPERATURES. DAY TIME HEATING 
REMAINS THE BEST TRIGGER FOR CONVECTION FAVORING WESTERN AREAS WHERE 
THERE IS WEAK LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...LATE MONDAY NIGHT A 
SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED FRONT WILL TRANSLATE ACROSS WESTERN KY AND 
MIDDLE TN. THIS WILL CAUSE AN INCREASE IN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
GENERALLY ACROSS THE PLATEAU COUNTIES AND MAYBE PORTIONS OF 
SOUTHWEST VA. BY TUESDAY THIS SYSTEM WILL TRACK ACROSS E TN AND INTO 
SW NC BRINGING THE HIGHEST CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION THIS WEEK. LOOK 
FOR A BRIEF DRYING PERIOD BEFORE THE WARM AND HUMID ATMOSPHERE 
PRODUCES ADDITIONAL LOW END SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES THROUGH 
AT LEAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT. BY THURSDAY THE RIDGE WEAKENS OVER THE 
OHIO VALLEY AND ANOTHER FRONT WILL SKIRT THE FORECAST AREA ALONG 
WITH RESPECTABLE INSTABILITY. SO WE ANTICIPATE ANOTHER INCREASED 
SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. CURRENT 
MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT FOR A MOSTLY DRY SATURDAY BUT SUNDAY COULD 
PROVE TO BRING CHANCES OF SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WHEN A 
WARM FRONT MOVES OUT OF GEORGIA AHEAD OF A DEEP TROUGH MOVING OUT OF 
THE PLAINS STATES.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND WEAK SE 
FLOW FROM SFC-850 MBS WAS KEEPING AN AREA OF CONVECTION GOING 
OVERNIGHT....MAINLY OVER NRN GA INTO SE TN. MODELS ARE CONSISTENT IN 
SPREADING THIS CONVECTION NW TODAY...WHICH FAVORS HIGHEST POPS FOR 
SE TN AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES. DEW POINT TEMPS ONLY IN 
THE 50S OVER SW VA AND NE TN...SO OPTED TO KEEP THOSE AREAS DRY FOR 
TODAY AND TONIGHT. CLOUDS IN THE WEAK SE LOW LEVEL FLOW WERE KEEPING 
TEMPS VERY MILD THIS MORNING...SO FAVORED GOING WITH OR JUST ABOVE 
THE WARMEST MOS MAX TEMPS. 

A SLIGHT CHANCE OF EVENING CONVECTION OVER SRN AND WRN AREAS...THEN 
PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY WITH PATCHY AREAS OF FOG...ESPECIALLY WHERE 
RAIN OCCURS TODAY. NOT SURE WHY LATEST MOS MINS WERE SO COOL FOR 
TONIGHT...SO I STAYED CLOSE TO PREVIOUS MIN TEMPS. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...DRIER AIR MASS WITH
SURFACE HIGH CENTERED ALONG EAST COAST WILL KEEP FORECAST AREA
DRIER AS DEEP MOISTURE STAYS TO THE WEST THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY
MONDAY. HOWEVER BOTH GFS AND NAM SHOW CONSIDERABLE MID AND HIGH
CLOUD COVER MOVING OVER THE EASTERN TN VALLEY WHICH MAY HOLD

TUESDAY AS COLD FRONT MOVES INTO OHIO VALLEY AND MAJOR SHORTWAVE
MOVES WITH FRONT ACROSS OHIO VALLEY. KEPT HIGH POPS NORTH AND 50
PERCENT CHANCE SOUTH DURING THE DAY. RAIN CHANCES DECREASE WITH
SUNSET TUESDAY NIGHT. THEN UPPER RIDGING OVER THE SW STATES NOSES
EASTWARD WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURES RISE A FEW
DEGREES AND LOWERED POPS TO 20 TO 30 PERCENT. THE RIDGE THEN
WEAKENS AGAIN WITH FRONT DROPPING INTO OHIO VALLEY. SHOWERS AND

THE OHIO VALLEY. BY WEDNESDAY IT APPEARS THAT THE NOSE OF THE RIDGE 
CENTERED NEAR THE TEXAS BIG BEND REGION WILL BUILD NORTHEASTWARD. 
THIS SHOULD LIMIT RAINFALL ACTIVITY FOR ALL BUT PERHAPS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA. AS THE RIDGE WEAKENS ITS HOLD LOOK FOR SCATTERED ACTIVITY 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. 
TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN AT OR ABOVE SEASONAL NORMALS THROUGH THE 
PERIOD.

THIS MORNING...MAINLY WHERE THE BETTER RAINS OCCURRED YESTERDAY. 

PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS LOOKED ON TRACK WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR NRN 
AREAS TO AROUND 50 PERCENT FOR SE TN AND SW NC...ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
LINGERING FRONTAL BOUNDARY. WEAK SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW FOR 
TONIGHT...SO KEEPING SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SRN AREAS AND MOSTLY CLEAR 
NRN AREAS. CLOUDS CREEP BACK INTO SE TN AND SW NC...SO NUDGED MIN 
TEMPS UP A COUPLE OF DEGREES IN THOSE AREAS. MAX TEMPS QUITE CLOSE

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING DOWN
THE EAST COAST WILL KEEP SLIGHTLY COOLER LESS HUMID AIR MASS ACROSS
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY. ALONG OR NEAR THE SOUTHERN
BORDER WHERE WEAK FRONT IS EXPECTED TO BE TODAY THE FLOW WILL STAY

CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS SOUTHEAST. STILL EXPECT NORTHEAST
SECTIONS TO BE DRY AND ONLY ISOLATED CONVECTION NEAR KNOXVILLE AND
OAK RIDGE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SMOKIES. HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS
SLIGHTLY EAST SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY AND GULF MOISTURE INCREASES
MONDAY INTO TUESDAY AS A LOW PRESSURE AREA MOVES INTO THE GREAT
LAKES AND COLD FRONT MOVES TOWARD THE MS VALLEY. RAIN CHANCES
INCREASE MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. THIS COLD FRONT THEN PASSES MAINLY TO
THE NORTH OF THE REGION AS HIGH PRESSURE HANGS ON OVER THE
SOUTHEAST STATES. WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT UPPER RIDGE TO THE
WEST SHIFTS EAST ACROSS THE TN VALLEY. THIS WILL SUPPRESS
CONVECTION SOMEWHAT. THEN THURSDAY A COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE OHIO
VALLEY AND TRIES TO MOVE SOUTH THROUGH THE TN VALLEY BY FRIDAY.
THE GFS MOVES THE FRONT THROUGH THURSDAY AND THE ECMWF IS SOMEWHAT
SLOWER. BASIC FORECAST CHANGES LITTLE FOR THE MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY
PERIOD WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS EACH DAY WITH THE BEST
CHANCE NORTH ON TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES NEAR AVERAGE WITH SLIGHTLY

WHEN THE RIDGE BREAKS DOWN OVER THE SE AND A SHORTWAVE TRANSLATES 
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION. THIS SHOULD HELP SET UP A NORTHWEST 
FLOW PATTERN BRINGING THUNDERSTORMS FROM CENTRAL KY INTO E TN DURING 
THE DAY ON TUESDAY. BY WEDNESDAY THE WEAK RIDGE BUILDS EAST AND 
CONFIDENCE IS LOW AGAIN WHEN IT COMES TO THE CONVECTION COVERAGE. 
MODELS ARE VERY AGGRESSIVE WITH PRECIPITATION. 

NO DOUBT THE TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON THE RISE EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE 
HOTTEST DAYS SHOULD BE TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY OF NEXT WEEK WITH 
TEMPERATURES APPROACHING 90 DEGREES FOR SEVERAL LOCATIONS.

WEAKEN OVER THE AREA AS AN UPPER LOW SETTLES OVER THE LA/AR REGION.  
A BROAD SOMEWHAT ILL DEFINED FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS SLOWLY SLIDING

THURSDAY NIGHT.  AHEAD OF THE BOUNDARY...DEW POINTS WILL STAY IN THE

HEATING AND WEAK OROGRAPHIC LIFT WILL AID SCATTERED THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOMENT THIS AFTERNOON AND LINGER INTO THE EVENING.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN 
DECENT OVERALL AGREEMENT WITH FAIR RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY...AND 
FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS ABOUT AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.  THE 
WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY SAGGING SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA FRIDAY WILL 
STALL OUT NEAR THE SOUTHERN TENNESSEE BORDER BEFORE GRADUALLY 
DISSIPATING. SOMEWHAT DRIER BUT NOT MUCH COOLER AIR WILL FILTER INTO 
AT LEAST NORTHERN AND CENTRAL AREAS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT INTO

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY
OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH A WARM AND HUMID AIR MASS OVER
THE FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION OVER
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC...WITH NO
ACTIVITY CURRENTLY OVER THE GREAT TN VALLEY. WITH THE SETTING OF THE
SUN...THINK THAT MOST CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY HAS ENDED FOR THE NIGHT.
HOWEVER...WILL KEEP A MENTION OF ISOLATED CONVECTION EVERYWHERE
OVERNIGHT...SINCE A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS PROGGED TO LINGER
OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT
WILL UPDATE THIS EVENING TO REMOVE ANY EVENING PRECIP WORDING AND TO
TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.AVIATION...ATMOSPHERE OVER THE GREAT VALLEY HAS HAD A SUPPRESSED
LOOK TO IT THROUGH THE LATE AFTERNOON HOURS AND IT APPEARS THAT
OROGRAPHICS ON THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES WILL BE THE MAIN AREA OF
DEVELOPMENT FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM THROUGH MUCH OF THE
REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT. THEREFORE...LITTLE CHANCE FOR A SHOWER AT A
TERMINAL TONIGHT. THE SURFACE THROUGH LOW LEVEL AIRMASS IS DRIER
TONIGHT BUT SOME LIGHT FOG CAN STILL FORM TOWARD 08Z AT CHA AND
TYS. VISIBILITY MAY DROP FROM MVFR TO AS LOW AS IFR AT TRI FOR A
BRIEF PERIOD AROUND SUNRISE AT TRI. A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE FOR
CONVECTION IN THE WORKS ON THURSDAY AS THE COOL FRONT SLIPS A
LITTLE FURTHER SOUTH ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. BEST SHOT AT
A THUNDERSTORM AFFECTING A TERMINAL WOULD BE AT TRI BUT ADDED A
VICINITY THUNDER AT TYS AND CHA AS WELL.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA INTO FRIDAY. A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL 
BACKDOOR INTO THE AREA BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON. WEAKENING UPPER LOW 
REMAINS SOUTHWEST OF THE AREA. SURFACE DEW POINTS IN THE 60S AND 
ABOVE NORMAL LAYER MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE OVER THE AREA UNTIL DRIER 
AIR BUILDS IN FROM THE NORTHEAST ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES 
WILL CONTINUE ABOVE NORMAL. STRAY THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE ANY 
TIME BUT DAY TIME HEATING AND OROGRAPHIC LIFT WILL BE THE BEST 
TRIGGERS FOR DEVELOPING THUNDERSTORMS. SLOW MOVING STORMS COULD 
PRODUCE BRIEF LOCALIZED FLOODING. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THIS PERIOD...IN THE UPPER LEVELS WE WILL BE UNDER A WEAK RIDGE THAT 
IS SANDWICHED BETWEEN THE WEAK GULF OF MEXICO LOW AND A VERY STRONG 
LOW IN EASTERN CANADA.  AT THE SURFACE...A BACK-DOOR COLD FRONT WILL 
BE MOVING EITHER THROUGH THE AREA ALREADY OR WILL BE MOVING THROUGH 
FRIDAY EVENING...DEPENDING ON THE MODEL.  FOR SATURDAY...MOST MODELS 
AND ENSEMBLE MEMBERS HAVE THE FRONT S AND W OF OUR AREA AND KEEP US 
DRY...BUT BY SUNDAY THE RETURN FLOW HAS BEGUN TO OUR WEST AND PRECIP 
CHANCES MAY BE SOMEWHAT CLOSE. HOWEVER...INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...THE 
AREA REMAINS UNDER THE SAME BASIC SCENARIO...UNDER A WEAK UPPER 
RIDGE...ALTHOUGH CHANGES ARE OCCURRING ELSEWHERE...AND THIS COULD 
CONTINUE INTO THE END OF THIS PERIOD ON WEDNESDAY.  

WITH THE RIDGE WINNING-OUT FOR THE MOST PART...AM LEANING ON THE 
HIGH SIDE OF MAX TEMPS...AND FIGURING ON MORE EVAPORATION THAN 
PRECIPITATION...SO WILL KEEP DEW POINTS ON THE DRY SIDE NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LITTLE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER 
PATTERN THROUGH THE SHORT TERM.  WEAKENING HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
REGION THAT IS SLOWLY SHIFTING SOUTH AND EAST AS AN UPPER LOW OVER 
THE TX/AR REGION CONTINUES TO SLOWLY MOVE SOUTHEAST. THE RESULT WILL 
BE WEAK INSTABILITY OVER THE MRX CWA WITH DEW POINTS STAYING IN THE 
60S.  THIS WILL CREATE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED INSTABILITY 
SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS WITH CHANCES INCREASING DURING THE AFTERNOON 
WITH DIURNAL INFLUENCE.  THIS ALL TRANSLATES TO A WARM DAY WITH 20 
POPS IN THE MORNING....INCREASE TO AROUND 40 POPS IN THE AFTERNOON 
AND DECREASING ONCE AGAIN TO AROUND 20 TO 30 LATE TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS SHOWING DECENT 
CONSISTENCY AND AGREEMENT OVERALL...AND FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS ABOUT 
AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL SAG SOUTH INTO 
THE AREA THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...AND SHOULD BE NEAR OUR 
SOUTHERN BORDER BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. THE FRONT IS EXPECTED 
TO STALL OUT JUST TO OUR SOUTH AND SLOWLY DISSIPATE.  WILL CARRY 
LIKELY POPS ALL BUT SOUTH THURSDAY AND CHANCE POPS ALL ZONES 
THURSDAY NIGHT AS THE FRONT SAGS INTO THE AREA.  SOME LIMITED DRYING 
EXPECTED TO FILTER IN BY SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...SO WILL GO 
PRECIP FREE EXCEPT SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH SAT AND DRY ALL ZONES SAT 
NIGHT.  MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO RETURN BY SUNDAY...SO PRECIP CHANCES 
START TO INCREASE AGAIN FOR THE LATTER PART OF THE WEEKEND INTO

WEATHER OFFICE NORTH. SOUTH OF THE OFFICE ACTIVITY CONCENTRATED 
ALONG THE TN/GA BORDER AND IN SW NC. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES AT 
THE SURFACE WITH UPPER RIDGING ALOFT OVER THE SE CORNER OF THE

EAST TODAY TOWARDS THE LOWER MS VALLEY. ANOTHER MORE CONCENTRATED 
AREA OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WAS DEVELOPING IN THE OHIO VALLEY OUT 
AHEAD OF A FRONT MOVING SOUTH THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES AND UPPER 
MIDWEST. NOT MUCH CHANGE IN CURRENT PATTERN THROUGH WEDNESDAY. 
SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL SLOWLY DECREASE THROUGH EARLY EVENING. BUT 
ISOLATED ACTIVITY POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT. THERE MAY BE A LITTLE MORE 
MOISTURE IN THE WEST AS THE UPPER LOW SLIDES FARTHER EAST AND ALSO 
POSSIBLY OVER SW VA AS MOISTURE POOLS AHEAD OF FRONT AS IT APPROACHES
THE OHIO VALLEY AS SHOWN BY NAM MODEL. THE GFS WANTS TO BRING MORE
SHOWERS DOWN INTO SW VA WEDNESDAY FROM ACTIVITY IN OHIO VALLEY. NAM
MODEL PUTS POPS AT 50 TO 60 PERCENT OVER THE AREA AND GFS ONLY 20
PERCENT. WILL COMPROMISE AND SLOWLY INCREASE POPS FROM 20 TO 40
PERCENT DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY. LOWS TONIGHT LOOK SIMILAR TO THIS

BOTH MODELS LOOKS BEST...UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S NORTHEAST AND MID
80S CENTRAL AND SOUTHWEST.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED

INDICATE THAT THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL EVENTUALLY DRIFT SOUTH AND 
WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION 
AT LEAST ISOLATED CONVECTION AFTER SATURDAY SINCE A MARGINALLY

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RATHER STAGNANT WEATHER PATTERN 
WILL CONTINUE FOR THE SHORT TERM WITH CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE 
LINGERING OVER THE AREA. ENOUGH INSTABILITY WILL BE PRESENT FOR SOME 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ESPECIALLY THIS AFTERNOON INTO 
EVENING...ALTHOUGH NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF ORGANIZED FORCING IS 
EXPECTED SO WILL CARRY LOW CHANCE POPS ALL ZONES. WILL MENTION 
PATCHY FOG FOR TONIGHT. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE SO ONLY 
SOME MINOR TWEAKS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...THROUGH THE EARLY EXTENDED 
PERIOD WILL BE IN A RATHER UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN WITH A CUTOFF 
LOW DROPPING SOUTH TOWARDS THE GULF AND STALLING OVER LA.  DEW 
POINTS IN THE 60S AND A WEAK TO OCCASIONALLY MODERATE UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS IN PLACE WILL CREATE SCATTERED MOSTLY DIURNAL CONVECTION 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.  A BROAD...WEAKENING FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL 
SLIDE THROUGH ON FRIDAY WHICH SHOULD PROVIDE OUR BEST CHANCE AT 
ORGANIZED CONVECTION THROUGH THE PERIOD.  AIR MASS BECOMES MORE 
STABLE BEHIND THE FRONT.  HOWEVER...THE BOUNDARY WILL STALL JUST TO 
OUR SOUTH DURING THE WEEKEND AND CONVECTION SHOULD BECOME MORE 
ISOLATED WITH BEST CHANCES OF PRECIP OVER SOUTHERN LOCATIONS.  THE 
BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE BACK INTO THE REGION EARLY IN THE 
UPCOMING WEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...A MOSTLY SUNNY TO PARTLY CLOUDY 
MEMORIAL DAY WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FIRING OVER 
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PLATEAU COUNTIES AHEAD OF WEAK SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY MOVING SLOWLY EAST ACROSS MIDDLE AND EAST TN. MUCH LESS 
COVERAGE ELSEWHERE AT THIS HOUR BUT A FEW STORMS OVER SW VA AND IN 
THE SMOKIES. DO EXPECT A LITTLE MORE COVERAGE FROM MID TO LATE 
AFTERNOON THROUGH EARLY EVENING AS ACTIVITY DEVELOPS IN THE VALLEYS 
EITHER FROM HEATING OR OFF OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM PLATEAU ACTIVITY. 
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER TO MID 80S EXCEPT WHERE SHOWERS AND 
STORMS ARE OCCURRING.

THE CONVECTION SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE SLOWLY EAST OR NORTHEAST. 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS COULD BE LOCALLY HEAVY IN STORMS...ABOUT ONE TO TWO 
INCHES BUT OUTSIDE OF THUNDERSTORMS AROUND ONE QUARTER INCH OR LESS. 
WARM AND HUMID TONIGHT WITH A FEW DEGREES WARMER FROM KNOXVILLE 
NORTH AND ABOUT THE SAME IN THE SOUTH. WEATHER PATTERN DOES NOT SHOW 
MUCH CHANGE TUESDAY. SURFACE HIGH OVER SOUTHEAST STATES WITH UPPER 
LEVEL RIDGING CLOSE BY TODAY. AN UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
THAT MOVES EAST TOWARDS THE MS VALLEY TUESDAY. MODELS SHOW A LITTLE 
MORE MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY OVER THE EASTERN TN VALLEY TUESDAY SO 
KEPT HIGHER POPS OF 40 TO 50 PERCENT REGION WIDE FOR MID AFTERNOON
TO EARLY EVENING. HIGH TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO TODAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A STAGNANT PATTERN LINGERING INTO 
EARLY NEXT WEEK. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY...AND BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY FOR 
SEVERAL DAYS AROUND THE FORECAST AREA. WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE 
AIR MASS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP EACH DAY OVER THE FORECAST AREA... 
MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING...SCATTERED CONVECTION WILL 
CONTINUE TO DEVELOP EACH DAY. MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WILL EVENTUALLY DRIFT SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA BY THE 
WEEKEND...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION AL LEAST ISOLATED CONVECTION 
SINCE A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL LINGER OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA BEHIND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...IT LOOKS LIKE THIS PERIOD WILL 
BE A BIT MORE ACTIVE IN TERMS OF THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION 
THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. THE CONFIGURATION OF A TROUGH OVER 
THE MID SECTION OF THE NATION AND A RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WILL 
KEEP THE PREVAILING FLOW ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
SOUTHERLY AND THUS RATHER MOIST. THE HUMID ATMOSPHERE WILL ALSO 
BECOME UNSTABLE WITH SUFFICIENT SUMMER LIKE HEATING AND LIFT COULD 
BECOME ENHANCED ON TUESDAY AS MODELS GENERALLY AGREE THAT A WEAK 
SHORT WAVE WILL RIDE NORTHEAST OUT OF THE DEEP SOUTH INTO MIDDLE 
TENNESSEE. THEREFORE...TRIED TO TREND CHANCE POPS JUST A LITTLE 
HIGHER OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH EMPHASIS ON THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. MAINTAINED MEDIUM CHANCE POPS ON WEDNESDAY BUT 
BY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY TWEAKED POPS UP A BIT FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WITH LONG TERM MODELS HOLDING ONTO A SCENARIO WHICH 
INCLUDES THE AMPLIFYING NORTHEASTERN U.S. UPPER TROUGH AND 
ASSOCIATED COOL FRONTAL PUSH SOUTH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
AS THE SLIGHTLY COOLER AND MAINLY DRIER AIRMASS PUSHES SOUTH ACROSS 
THE MRX FORECAST AREA PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION WILL BE MUCH 
LOWER IN THE MORE STABLE AIR NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY. BY SUNDAY...MOST 
OF THE GREAT VALLEY WILL BE STABLE ENOUGH FOR NO MENTION OF 
CONVECTION WITH JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE ON THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES.

.DISCUSSION...
A QUICK UPDATE TO ADDRESS ONGOING CONVECTION OVER MIDDLE TN WHICH
HAS BEEN DRIFTING SLOWLY EAST. THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS APPEAR TO
HAVE FORMED ALONG THE 925 MB FRONTAL BOUNDARY SITUATED ROUGHLY FROM
NASHVILLE TO NC/TN/GA BORDER. MENTIONED CHANCE/SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
FOR THIS MORNING ACROSS CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AREAS TO ACCOUNT FOR
DEVELOPING/ADVECTING RAINFALL. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW LOW-MID
LEVEL DRY AIR FROM ABOUT 850-500MB AT CHA THROUGH THE DAY. TYS
SHOWS THE MID-LEVEL DRY AIR AROUND 650MB AROUND 18Z.

EXTENSIVE HIGH CLOUD COVER MAY INHIBIT MAX DAYTIME TEMPERATURE TO

340 AM EDT SUN MAY 25 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
NEAR THE SOUTHERN TENNESSEE BORDER WILL NUDGE SLOWLY NORTH AS A WARM 
FRONT DURING THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. MORE SIGNIFICANT INSTABILITY 
INDICATED FOR TODAY THAN YESTERDAY MAINLY SOUTHERN ZONES...AND 
EXPECT SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP IN THE VICINITY OF 
THE FRONT TODAY AND CONTINUE INTO AT LEAST THE FIRST PART OF 
TONIGHT.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA 
BOTH PERIODS. WILL MAKE MAINLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO MAV 
TEMPS...MAINLY DOWN ON HIGHS AND UP ON LOWS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION 
WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE WORK 
WEEK AS A SOUTHERLY COMPONENT TO THE FLOW KEEPS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS SUFFICIENTLY MOIST AND UNSTABLE FOR CONVECTION. LITTLE 
TO FOCUS DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EARLY IN THE 
PERIOD OTHER THAN SOME OROGRAPHIC LIFT. ALTHOUGH THE MODELS BRING 
OCCASIONAL WEAK IMPULSES ACROSS THE REGION IN A NORTHWESTERLY 
STEERING FLOW FORMED BY THE PRESENCE OF AN UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTH 
CENTRAL U.S. AND AN AMPLIFYING TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEASTERN STATES. 
THE INCREASING PROBABILITIES SLIP INTO THE WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY 
TIMEFRAME AS A SYNOPTIC FRONTAL BOUNDARY PRESSES SOUTHWEST TOWARD 
THE FORECAST AREA DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING EASTERN TROUGH. 
CONVERGENCE ALONG THE FRONT WOULD HELP TO FOCUS THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE 
WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY AND THEN FARTHER SOUTH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION LATER THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT COINCIDENT WITH 
THE SLOWLY MOVING FRONTAL BOUNDARY. CONCERNING TEMPERATURES NOTICED 
A TREND IN WHICH GUIDANCE (MAINLY THE MAV) HAS BEEN A LITTLE TOO 
WARM. WITH INCREASING HUMIDITY DURING THE LONG TERM PERIOD ALONG 
WITH SCATTERED CONVECTION...WOULD EXPECT MAXES TO BE SUPPRESSED TO 
SOME DEGREE SO UNDERCUT MAXES THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD WHILE STAYING 
CLOSER TO SUGGESTED MINS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY SITUATED 
ROUGHLY FROM SOUTHWEST NC TO NASHVILLE MAY HELP FOCUS A FEW ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY SOME THUNDER BEFORE SUNSET. AFTER SUNSET 
THICKER HIGH CLOUDS WILL FLOW OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA WHILE NORTHERN AREAS WILL EXPERIENCE CLEAR SKIES. THE FRONT 
WILL SLOWLY LIFT NORTHWARD ON SUNDAY AND PROVIDE THE FOCUS FOR 
ADDITIONAL ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP IN THE 
AFTERNOON...ALBEIT LOW CHANCES. THE BETTER INSTABILITY RESIDES ALONG 
AND SOUTH OF A LINE FROM WARTBURG TO KNOXVILLE TO NEWPORT. 

OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL BE CLOSE TO THIS MORNING/S READINGS BUT 
SLIGHTLY COOLER WHERE ITS CLEAR. SUNDAYS MAX TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE 
AT LEAST A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER THAN TODAY/S. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO 
THE SOUTHWEST SOUTH OF THE FRONT BUT OVERALL WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO 
REMAIN BELOW 10 MPH FOR MOST AREAS. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...OVERALL...SUMMER
TIME PATTERN REMAINS THROUGH THE LONG TERM WITH WARM AND HUMID
CONDITIONS IN PLACE AS WELL AS SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL
SLOWLY INCREASING THROUGH TIME. A CUT OFF UPPER LEVEL LOW AND UPPER
LEVEL RIDGE WILL BE THE PRIMARY INFLUENCES OF OUR WEATHER DURING
THIS TIME PERIOD.

A CUT OFF UPPER LEVEL LOW IS IN PLACE OVER THE FOUR CORNERS STATES 
ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND WILL SLOWLY MEANDER EAST TOWARD OUR REGION 
THROUGH THE REST OF THE LONG TERM.  SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
STORMS ON MONDAY AREA WIDE WITH THE TYPICALLY SUMMER TIME CHANCE 
POPS ACROSS OUR FAVORED HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS...WHICH INCLUDE PARTS 
OF THE PLATEAU AND SMOKIES. BY TUESDAY THE CUT OFF LOW LOOKS TO BE 
LOCATED OVER TX/OK. GOING BACK TO SUNDAY...A STRONG SOUTHERLY 850MB 
FLOW WILL HAVE STREAMED GULF MOISTURE UP TO THE APEX OF THE RIDGE 
CENTERED TO OUR WEST. THEN...NORTHWEST FLOW ON TUESDAY BEGINS TO 
CARRY THAT MOISTURE DOWN INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS EXTRA 
MOISTURE WILL INCREASE CHANCES OF AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS NE TN AND INTO SWVA. ON WEDNESDAY...A 
DEVELOPING RIDGE SURGES OUT OF THE PACIFIC SOUTHWEST AND UP INTO THE 
NORTHERN PLAINS. MODELS SUGGEST THAT THIS NEWLY DEVELOPING RIDGE 
FORCES THE CUT OFF LOW DOWN TOWARD THE GULF COAST STATES WHERE IT 
EVENTUALLY PETERS OUT DUE TO THE AFOREMENTIONED STRENGTHENING RIDGE 
ACROSS THE PLAINS. FOR OUR AREA...WE STILL REMAIN IN A NORTHWEST 
FLOW AND INCREASED MOISTURE CONTENT WILL ALLOW FOR CHANCE SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS. 

NORTHWEST FLOW BEGINS TO GIVE WAY ON THURSDAY...BUT STRONG RIDGING 
OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. WILL FORCE AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH ACROSS THE 
NORTHEASTERN STATES DOWN INTO THE COASTAL CAROLINAS BEGINNING 
THURSDAY AND THROUGH FRIDAY. AS WITH THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...THIS 
COULD ALLOW A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT INTO OUR AREA WHICH WOULD SERVE AS 
A FOCUSING MECHANISM FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. AT THIS 
TIME...IT APPEARS THAT THIS COLD FRONT MAY MOVE THROUGH THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. CHANCE POPS IN PLACE DURING THIS TIME. BY 
SATURDAY WE ARE UNDER THE RIDGE AXIS THAT WAS ONCE OVER THE CENTRAL 
PLAINS. BEING UNDER THE CENTER OF THE RIDGE SHOULD LIMIT ANY 
CONVECTION TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN. TEMPERATURES WILL GENERALLY BY IN 
THE LOW TO UPPER 80S DURING THE LONG TERM WITH A BRIEF COOL DOWN 
INTO THE UPPER 70S AND LOW 80S ON FRIDAY WITH THE BACKDOOR FRONT.

JUST A QUICK UPDATE TO TWEAK MAX TEMPERATURES AND EXTEND RAIN
CHANCES FOR SOUTHERN AREAS INTO THE EARLY EVENING. 

THE 925MB FRONTAL BOUNDARY WAS SITUATED FROM THE TN RIVER/KENTUCKY
LAKE IN MIDDLE TN TO NEAR CHATTANOOGA. SOME LIGHT RADAR ECHOES WERE
NOTED OVER MIDDLE TN ALONG THIS BOUNDARY. BY LATER THIS AFTERNOON
FEEL THAT SOME SCATTERED SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WILL BE
POSSIBLE FOR THE SOUTHERN TN VALLEY. ANY SHOWERS/STORMS THAT
DEVELOP WILL WEAKEN BY SUNSET AND DISSIPATE QUICKLY THEREAFTER.
SOME OF THESE MAY MOVE INTO SW NC BEFORE ITS ALL SAID AND DONE.
COVERAGE LOOKS SCATTERED AT BEST AND MAY BE MORE ISOLATED IN
NATURE...THEREFORE CONTINUED WITH SLIGHT CHANCE MENTION.

WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AREAS...LAMP GUIDANCE
SUGGESTS THAT DAYTIME TEMPERATURES FOR NORTHERN AREAS MAY BE
SLIGHT COOLER. ADJUSTED MAX TEMPS ONLY SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD AND
UPDATED WIND FORECAST FOR THE AFTERNOON.

DURING THE SHORT TERM. WILL CONTINUE TO SEE MORE CLOUDS SOUTH THAN 
NORTH...AND WHILE IT SHOULD BE WEAK ENOUGH INSTABILITY LIKELY TO BE 
PRESENT THAT ISOLATED SHOWERS OR THUNDERSTORMS CANNOT BE RULED OUT 
ACROSS THE SOUTH CLOSER TO THE FRONT.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
FOR THIS AFTERNOON. JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS...WHICH LOOK 
REASONABLE FOR THE MOST PART.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...DEFINITELY WILL FEEL LIKE 
SUMMER HAS FINALLY ARRIVED FOR THE DURATION AS HIGH TEMPERATURES 
THROUGH THE PERIOD SHOULD BE IN THE 80S. ALONG WITH THE WARMTH WILL 
BE A FAIR AMOUNT OF HUMIDITY. IN THIS SCENARIO THE ATMOSPHERE WILL 
BUBBLE UP INITIALLY INTO A COUPLE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN FEATURES ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST 
NORTH CAROLINA AND ALONG THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS ON SUNDAY AND MEMORIAL 
DAY WITH JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A SHOWER OR STORM ELSEWHERE. 
HOWEVER...THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAY GRADUALLY 
INCREASE ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE ON 
TUESDAY AS WEAK UPPER LEVEL IMPULSES RIDE OUT OF THE MIDWEST AND 
OVER THE TOP OF A PERSISTENT RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. 
GENERALLY INCREASED POPS TO A MEDIUM CHANCE CATEGORY FOR CONVECTION 
FORECAST AREA WIDE WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AS MODEL PROGS INDICATE 
AN UPPER TROUGH WILL AMPLIFY ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. WHICH

THE COLD FRONT IS POSITIONED E-W ALONG THE NORTHERN TN

TROUGH IS LOCATED FROM NEAR NASHVILLE TO CROSSVILLE TO NEAR ANDREWS 
NC...WHICH FORMS THE BACK EDGE OF TEH CU FIELD. ALONG AND SOUTH OF

2000 J/KG...BUT FORCING BOTH ALOFT AND AT THE SURFACE IS WEAK. SOME 
STRONG TO BORDERLINE SEVERE STORMS MAY BE POSSIBLE...BUT COVERAGE 
SHOULD BE SCATTERED AT BEST. ANY ACTIVITY SHOULD END BY MIDNIGHT

RIDGING WILL BE PRESENT THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEKEND. WEAK
INSTABILITIES WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE COULD PROVIDE ISOLATED
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SUNDAY AFTERNOON. A COUPLE OF SHORTWAVES
MOVE THROUGH THE AREA THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK WEEK.
OVERALL INSTABILITY AND SHEAR LOOK VERY WEAK TO SUPPORT ANY SEVERE
STORMS DEVELOPING MONDAY AND TUESDAY. A LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS
AROUND THE GREAT LAKES AND A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THAT LOW
WILL SWING DOWN OVER THE AREA FOR WEDNESDAY. INSTABILITIES A LITTLE
STRONGER WITH MORE ORGANIZED WIND PROFILE...COULD SEE STRONG STORMS
WITH A LOW CHANCE FOR ANYTHING SEVERE. RAIN CHANCES WILL CONTINUE
THROUGH THURSDAY AS A LOW PRESSURE BEGINS TO STRENGTHEN OVER THE
LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. INSTABILITIES AND MOISTURE LOOK TO
BE SUFFICIENT FOR STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS...BUT WILL HAVE TO KEEP

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...
SO FAR THE CAP HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE IN SUPPRESSING DEEP CONVECTION 
ACROSS THE REGION. SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED IN SRN KY...ALTHOUGH NOT
YET TO THE EXTENT THAT THE HRRR AND RUC HAVE BEEN DEPICTING. ANY
STORMS THAT DEVELOP WILL MOVE SE AND ENCOUNTER PLENTY OF CAPE...SO
THE SEVERE THREAT OF LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS
REMAINS...ALTHOUGH COVERAGE OF TSTMS MAY NOT BE MORE THAN
SCATTERED. WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS INTO THE EVENING IN THE PLATEAU
AND CENTRAL VALLEY.

THE RIDGE NEAR THE GULF COAST TODAY WILL SHIFT SOUTHWARD 
TOMORROW...AND THE AXIS OF MAX THETA-E AT 850 MB SHIFTS SOUTH AS 
WELL. MOST TSTM ACTIVITY TOMORROW WILL BE IN THE SOUTHERN 
VALLEY...HOWEVER WITH THE CONTINUED LACK OF UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT AND 
LIMITED MOISTURE...POPS WILL REMAIN IN THE CHANCE RANGE. THE CAP 
LOOKS WEAKER IN FORECAST SOUNDINGS TOMRROW COMPARED TO TODAY. MLCAPE 
WILL AGAIN BE PLENTIFUL...IN THE 3000-3500 J/KG RANGE...SO ANY 
STORMS THAT CAN DEVELOP WILL HAVE A LARGE HAIL/DAMAGING WIND 
POTENTIAL.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
BY FRIDAY NIGHT THE FRONT IS PROGGED TO SHIFT SOUTHWARD INTO
GEORGIA...SOUTH CAROLINA AND ALABAMA WHICH WILL ALLOW MORE STABLE
AIR TO FILTER INTO AREAS NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY. THUS RAIN CHANCES
DIMINISH FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. THE FRONT WILL BEGIN MOVING
SLOWLY BACK TO THE NORTH ON SUNDAY AND THE SOUTHERN TN AND
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA COULD SEE THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP. THE FRONT
WILL CONTINUE MOVING NORTH OVERNIGHT SUNDAY INTO MONDAY AND BRING
CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA EACH
AFTERNOON THROUGH THURSDAY.

TEMPERATURES ON SATURDAY WILL WILL GENERALLY RANGE FROM THE MID AND 
UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S. SUNDAY MORNING WILL BE RATHER COOL WITH 
TEMPERATURES IN THE 40S AND 50S. THIS WILL BE THE COOLEST PERIOD FOR 
THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK WHEN OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL 
RANGE FROM THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S AND HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL PUSH 
NEAR 90 DEGREES BY WEDNESDAY GENERALLY SOUTH OF I-40. MAX

1034 AM EDT THU MAY 22 2014

.DISCUSSION...
THE 12Z OHX SOUNDING SHOWS A STRONG CAP...AND RUC FORECAST
SOUNDINGS SHOW THIS CAP REMAINING IN PLACE THROUGH THE AFTERNOON.
IT IS STRONGEST IN SOUTHERN AREAS AND WEAKEST NORTH. THE QUESTION
IS WHETHER THERE WILL BE ENOUGH FORCING TO OVERCOME THE CAP. THE
RUC AND NAM SHOW NO UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT COMING...SO ANY CONVECTION
THAT DEVELOPS WILL NEED LOW LEVEL FORCING AND BOUNDARIES TO
DEVELOP. WE DO HAVE BOUNDARIES IN THE AREA FROM THE OVERNIGHT
SHOWERS...AND CONVECTION THAT IS EXPECTED TO INITIATE IN CNTRL KY
WILL MOVE SE..PROVIDING ADDITIONAL BOUNDARIES FOR CONVECTIVE
INITIATION. RUC AND HRRR HAVE MOST ACTIVITY IN THE PLATEAU AND
CENTRAL VALLEY.

ANY STORMS THAT FORM WILL HAVE ABUNDANT ENERGY AVAILABLE FOR
GROWTH. MLCAPE VALUES WILL APPROACH 2500 J/KG IN THE PLATEAU. THUS
LARGE HAIL APPEARS TO BE THE MAIN THREAT...WITH DAMAGING WINDS A
THREAT AS WELL AS FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW AN INVERTED-V PROFILE.
WHILE DEEP SHEAR VALUES WILL SUPPORT SOME SUPERCELLS...WEAK LOW
LEVEL SHEAR AND HIGH LCLS DO NOT FAVOR TORNADOES.

FOR THE UPDATE...POPS/WX/CLOUDS/QPF WILL BE ADJUSTED TO BETTER
MATCH FAVORED PRECIP AREAS...AND TO ADD A MENTION OF THE LARGE
HAIL/DAMAGING WIND THREAT. TEMPERATURES APPEAR ON TRACK.

MONITOR THIS ACTIVITY THE REST OF THE MORNING FOR POSSIBLE UPDATE
FOR MORNING POPS.

AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY REMAINS BETWEEN KNOXVILLE AND MORRISTOWN. THIS
BOUNDARY AS WELL AS BOUNDARY FROM KENTUCKY CONVECTION WILL LIKELY
BE MAIN FOCUS FOR AFTERNOON RE-DEVELOPMENT. AIRMASS MOST OF THE
AREA...ESPECIALLY TENNESSEE...WILL BECOME QUITE UNSTABLE WITH
MLCAPES OF 2500-3000 J/KG. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW FAIRLY LARGE
HAIL CAPES WITH FAVORABLE WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS FOR LARGE HAIL...
UP TO GOLFBALL SIZE. ALSO...FAVORABLE THERMODYNAMICS AND SOME WINDS
ALOFT FOR DAMAGING WINDS AS WELL...FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT AND FRIDAY
WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF ISOLATED STRONG CONVECTION AGAIN FOR THE

DISSIPATES BY SUNDAY. SOME MOISTURE RETURN FOR SUNDAY TO INCLUDE
SLIGHT POPS FOR THE SOUTHERN AREAS DURING THE AFTERNOON/EVENING.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE GFS MOS...EXCEPT FOR THE NORTHERN HALF OF

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)... SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP NORTH OF OUR AREA IN THE NEXT FEW 
HOURS...SUPPORTED BY UPPER DIVERGENCE AND A 500 MB VORT MAX. 
COVERAGE SHOULD BE MAINLY SCATTERED DUE TO LIMITED MOISTURE ACROSS 
THE REGION. THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE MOVING SE...AND IS PROGGED BY THE 
LOCAL WRF AND RUC TO AFFECT SW VA BETWEEN 02Z AND MIDNIGHT...THEN NE 
TN AFTER MIDNIGHT. MUCAPE IN THE 1500-2000 J/KG RANGE AND 0-6 KM 
SHEAR AROUND 35-40 KTS WILL MEAN A CHANCE OF SOME STORMS REACHING 
SEVERE LEVELS. ACTIVITY SHOULD DIMINISH AFTER 06Z. BEHIND THE 
EXITING VORT MAX. 

ANOTHER DISTURBANCE IN THE NW FLOW ALOFT WILL MOVE THROUGH TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON. THE CAP TOMORROW AFTERNOON IS WEAKER IN SOUTHERN 
AREAS...AND LINGERING BOUNDARIES FROM OVERNIGHT CONVECTION MAY AID 
DEVELOPMENT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. MLCAPE VALUES WILL BE VERY HIGH 
CENTRAL AND SOUTH...UP TO 3500 J/KG ACCORDING TO THE NAM...WITH GOOD 
0-6 KM SHEAR. AGAIN...WITH LIMITED MOISTURE...COVERAGE MAY NOT BE 
MORE THAN SCATTERED AND POPS WILL STAY IN THE CHANCE RANGE...BUT 
WHAT STORMS DO FORM COULD BE STRONG TO SEVERE WITH LARGE HAIL THE 
MAIN THREAT.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...WEAKENING FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WILL SLOWLY DROP SOUTH ACROSS THE REGION THURSDAY NIGHT AND 
FRIDAY FOR CONTINUED SCATTERED TO ISOLATED CONVECTION.  AIR MASS 
WILL BE UNSTABLE AND A 850 JET MOVING THROUGH WILL ALLOW FOR THE 
CHANCE OF AN OCCASIONAL STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM TO BE 
POSSIBLE.  UPPER RIDGE BUILDS TO OUR WEST DURING THE WEEKEND PUTTING 
THE MRX CWA IN A DRY NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT FOR DRY CONDITIONS 
SATURDAY.  LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BEGINS TO MOVE BACK INTO SOUTHERN ARES 
LATE SUNDAY AND COULD SEE A FEW ISOLATED STORMS DEVELOP LATE IN THE

ALLOWING A FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO APPROACH THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
PRODUCING SCATTERED-BROKEN THUNDERSTORMS.

BESIDES THE STORMS...TIGHTENING PRESSURE GRADIENT AND PLENTY OF 
MIXING WILL PRODUCE GUSTY SOUTHWEST WINDS TODAY SUSTAINED 
BETWEEN 13-17KTS WITH GUSTS TO 25KTS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...THE LOCAL ATMOSPHERE WILL BE 
GRADUALLY MOISTENING AND DESTABILIZING THROUGH THE PERIOD. IN 
ADDITION...ANOTHER SHORT WAVE WILL DROP SOUTHEAST OVER THE TOP OF 
THE SOUTH CENTRAL U.S. UPPER RIDGE AND BUILD ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON WEDNESDAY. WITH THIS IN MIND TWEAKED POPS 
UP A BIT ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR 
CONVECTION WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP 
OVER THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY AND SHIFT SOUTHEAST DURING THE DAY. MUCH 
OF THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA SHOULD REMAIN DRY ON 
WEDNESDAY. A HEALTHY SOUTHWEST FLOW AND ADEQUATE INSOLATION SHOULD 
HELP BOOST HIGH TEMPERATURES SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL FOR LATE 
MAY WITH MAXES EXPECTED TO REACH THE LOWER AND MIDDLE 80S. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE TO 
ONGOING FORECAST. SHORT-WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WEDNESDAY 
AND THURSDAY WILL PULL A COLD FRONT INTO TENNESSEE FOR THURSDAY. AIR 
MASS ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL BECOME FAIRLY UNSTABLE WITH 
CAPES INCREASING TO 2000-2500 J/KG. MODEL DEPICTED QPF AND MOS POPS 
NUMBERS FOR PATTERN BUT MAY BE REFLECTING DRY MID LEVELS. POTENTIAL 
OF MARGINAL SEVERE HAIL AND ISOLATED DAMAGING WINDS 
POSSIBLE...MAINLY FOR THURSDAY. HIGHLIGHTED THIS POTENTIAL IN THE

.DISCUSSION...THE FORECAST IS BASICALLY ON TRACK LATE THIS MORNING 
WITH HIGH PRESSURE STILL HANGING ON OVER THE AREA. THE AIR IS MORE 
UNSTABLE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND OCCASIONAL WEAK UPPER LEVEL 
IMPULSES RIDE OVER THE TOP OF A PERSISTENT UPPER LEVEL RIDGE IN 
PLACE ACROSS THE CENTER OF THE NATION. MODEL FORECASTS INDICATE THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A COUPLE SHOWERS AND A THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPING OVER 
THE OHIO VALLEY AND SLIPPING SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. THE ATMOSPHERE IS A BIT CAPPED ACROSS THE MRX FORECAST 
AREA WITH A LAYER OF WARM AIR AROUND 700 MB SO DON'T BELIEVE THERE 
WILL BE MUCH OF A CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION TODAY. TRIMMED POPS BACK 
ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE FAVORING HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA IF A SHOWER DEVELOPS. HIGHS SHOULD REACH THE LOWER AND

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN
AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE CAROLINA COAST...WITH A
WARMER AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA (COMPARED TO LAST NIGHT).
A WARM FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHWARD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
TODAY...AS SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS INCREASE OVER THE REGION. THIS WARM
FRONT MAY TRIGGER SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION OVER NORTHEAST TN AND
SOUTHWEST VA THIS AFTERNOON...BUT OVERALL...LOCAL AIR MASS SHOULD BE

GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT
WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS THE SLIGHTLY WARMER NAM NUMBERS WITH A
SOUTHWESTERLY WIND FLOW EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...SHORT-WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE 
GREAT LAKES WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WILL PULL A COLD FRONT INTO 
TENNESSEE FOR THURSDAY. AIR MASS ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT FOR
LATE WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY WILL BECOME FAIRLY UNSTABLE WITH
CAPES INCREASING TO 2000-2500 J/KG. AN UPPER JET MOVING ACROSS THE
OHIO VALLEY INTO THE MID-ATLANTIC WILL PLACE THE LOWER OHIO
VALLEY/PARTS OF TENNESSEE INTO FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION FOR
THURSDAY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FORCING. SOUNDINGS SHOW FAIRLY DECENT
HAIL CAPE ALONG WITH SOME MID-LEVEL DRY AIR...SO POTENTIAL OF
MARGINAL SEVERE HAIL AND ISOLATED DAMAGING WINDS POSSIBLE...MAINLY
FOR THURSDAY. WILL HIGHLIGHT THIS POTENTIAL IN THE HWO.

DEPENDING ON WHICH MODEL...FRONT WILL MOVE SLOWLY SOUTH ACROSS THE

FOR THE SOUTHERN AREAS FRIDAY. BOUNDARIES REMAIN QUASI-STATIONARY 
NEAR OR JUST SOUTH OF THE AREA FOR THE WEEKEND...BEFORE DISSIPATING.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...PROTECTIVE RIDGE STILL HOLDS 
INFLUENCE OVER MOST OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THROUGH THE 
PERIOD. HOWEVER...AN UPPER LEVEL WAVE CURRENTLY OVER THE MIDWEST 
WILL PRESS EAST AND THE COMBINATION OF THIS FEATURE AND LIFT AHEAD 
OF A WARM FRONT MAY ALLOW FOR A SMALL CHANCE OF A SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORM OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE 
ON TUESDAY. THE OTHER ASPECT OF THE FORECAST WILL BE THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SOME FOG FORMATION OVERNIGHT. DIFFICULT TO TELL WHERE THE FOG 
WILL BE MOST PERVASIVE BUT THE BEST GUESS IS AGAIN ACROSS THE GREAT 
VALLEY FROM CENTRAL EAST THROUGH SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE WHERE MODEL 
MOISTURE IS PROGGED TO BE HIGHEST IN THE 0-1 KM LAYER. STAYED IN THE 
MIDDLE OF GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES DURING THE SHORT TERM.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
WEAKENS OVER THE AREA EARLY IN THE PERIOD AS HIGH PRESSURE CENTER 
SHIFTS INTO FL. THE AIRMASS WILL SLOWLY MOISTEN AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH ON WEDNESDAY. THICKNESS VALUES ARE PACKED 
NEAR FRONT OVER OH VALLEY BUT BECOME DIVERGENT OVER E TN VALLEY BY 
WED NIGHT. ONGOING CONVECTION...POSSIBLE MCS...WILL MOVE INTO 
NORTHERN AREAS WED NIGHT AND CONTINUE ACROSS MRX CWA ON THU WHILE 
POSSIBLY WEAKENING. SPEED MAX OVER CNTRL APPALACHIANS KEEPS 
PRECIPITATION CHANCE GOING NORTH OF FRONT THU NIGHT. SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE NORTH THROUGH THE WEEKEND. RELATIVELY 
DRY AIRMASS SETTLES OVER THE APPALACHIANS. TEMPERATURES ABOVE NORMAL 
IN ADVANCE OF FRONT AND CONTINUED SLIGHTLY WARM BEHIND THE FRONT.

AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE UPPER OHIO RIVER VALLEY...
WITH A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE DEEP SOUTH.
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES OVER THE TN RIVER
VALLEY...WHICH HAS ALLOWED SOME DENSE FOG TO DEVELOP OVER SOUTHEAST
TN AND EXTREME SOUTHWEST NC WHERE A DECENT RAINFALL WAS OBSERVED
YESTERDAY. THIS FOG SHOULD BURN OFF SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE...WITH
ONLY A FEW HIGH CLOUDS MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. A WEAK UPPER-
LEVEL SHORT WAVE IS PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
TONIGHT...BUT WITH LIMITED MOISTURE AVAILABLE...IT SHOULD PRODUCE
MAINLY AN INCREASE IN HIGH CLOUDS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT
WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THIS PERIOD BEGINS WITH THE 
UPPER RIDGE IS INFLUENCING THE REGION WITH TEMPERATURES RISING.  
HOWEVER...THE RIDGE STAYS CENTERED TO OUR SW...AND KEEPS OUR AREA IN 
A NW FLOW.  OF COURSE IN OUR SW COUNTIES THE RIDGE WILL HAVE MORE OF 
AN EFFECT BY PROXIMITY...BUT IN OUR NE COUNTIES...ROUGHLY 200 MILES 
AWAY...THE NW FLOW IS MORE DOMINANT.  SO POPS START UP IN SW VA 
TUESDAY...WHERE AS THE SW CORNER HOLDS OFF POPS FOR A FULL 2 DAYS. 

SO FOR TUESDAY...DEVELOPMENT WILL LIKELY BE IN THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN...BUT RESTRICTED TO THE NERN AREAS.  WILL KEEP POPS FAIRLY 
LOW OVER THAT AREA BECAUSE THE NW FLOW WILL QUICKLY TAKE THE 
SHOWERS/STORMS OUT OF THE AREA...THAT DEVELOP IN THE HIGHEST TERRAIN 
IN THE APPALACHIAN CHAIN.  HAVE LOWER POPS IN THE SMALLER MOUNTAINS 
TO THE WEST ALONG THE KY LINE AND HIGH KNOB ETC...BUT ANYTHING THAT 
DEVELOPS THERE WILL QUICKLY ADVECT OVER THE VALLEY TO THE ESE...SO 
WILL NEED POPS IN THE VALLEY LOCATIONS AS WELL.

FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...THE PRECIP CHANCES WILL PENETRATE MORE 
AND MORE INTO THE AREA AS THE ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM SAGS SWD.  
THEN BY FRIDAY IT LOOKS LIKE THE FRONT WILL BE ABOUT TO EXIT THE 
AREA TO THE SOUTH...SO ONLY HAVE ABOUT THE SOUTHERN 1/3 OF THE AREA 
WITH POPS.
 
STILL LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A RISK OF SEVERE STORMS WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
THURSDAY AS INSTABILITY AND SHEAR COMBINE NEAR THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
AS IT SAGS SOUTH.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...RADAR AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS 
INDICATE THE LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS HAVE MOVED JUST SOUTH OF OUR SE TN 
AND SW NC COUNTIES. SOME AMOUNT OF CLOUDINESS LINGERS OVER SRN 1/3RD 
BUT I EXPECT THESE CLOUDS TO THIN OUT DURING THE EVENING.

PROBLEM FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE PATCHY AREAS OF DENSE FOG...MAINLY 
ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC...WHERE RADAR PRODUCTS SHOW A SWATH OF 1/2 TO 
1 INCH RAINFALL OCCURRED OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS. THESE AREAS COULD 
GET DOWN TO 1/4 MILE VISBY OR LESS LATE TONIGHT. FURTHER NORTH... 
RAIN WAS GENERALLY ABSENT AND THE BOUNDARY LAYER LOOKS TO BE TOO DRY 
FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN PATCHY FOG. 

SOME CHATTING AMONGST NRN AND ERN NEIGHBORS ON POSSIBLE PATCHY FROST 
TONIGHT...AND I DID NUDGE MIN TEMP GRID DOWN TO INCLUDE A FEW SPOTS 
OF UPPER 30S FOR MINS. HOWEVER...WILL JUST MENTION THE POSSIBILITY
OF PATCHY FROST IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK FOR NOW.

A NICE DAY FOR THE REGION MONDAY...WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AND TEMPS 
STARTING A RECOVERY TOWARDS SEASONAL NORMALS BY MID WEEK.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...RIDGING OVER THE
MID-SOUTH TO GULF COAST...AND AN UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EAST
COAST...WILL RESULT IN NW FLOW OVER THE CWA FOR MUCH OF THE
EXTENDED PERIOD. THIS MEANS THAT [SLIGHT] PRECIP CHANCES IN AND
NEAR SW VA WILL BEGIN MONDAY NIGHT. THESE CHANCES WILL SPREAD
SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE REST OF THE CWA THROUGH FRIDAY. CONDITIONS MAY
BE IN PLACE WED/THURS TO SUPPORT SOME SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS.

THEN THE AMPLITUDE OF THE EASTERN TROF STRENGTHENS ENOUGH TO 
SCOUR OUT THE MOISTURE STREAM...THUS LOOKING AT DRY WEATHER BY 
NEXT WEEKEND. 

DAYTIME TEMPS WILL BE FAIRLY WARM [MID 80S IN THE VALLEY] FOR 
TUES/WED...BEFORE THE NW/N FLOW ALOFT DRAWS DOWN COOLER TEMPS 
LATE WEEK INTO NEXT WEEKEND. FAIR SKIES AND HIGHS NEAR 80 IN 
THE VALLEY NEXT WEEKEND.

PLENTY OF SUNSHINE FOR SW VA AND THE NRN 1/3 TO 1/2 OF E TN THIS

QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE DEEP SOUTH. AREA RADARS
REVEAL A LINE OF SHOWERS OCCURRING ALONG THE SOUTHERN TN BORDER IN
ASSOCIATION WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE MOVING EASTWARD ACROSS
THE TN RIVER VALLEY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT SHOWERS WILL
MAINLY AFFECT SOUTHEAST TN THIS MORNING...WITH A GRADUAL DECREASE IN
SHOWERS AND CLOUDS THIS AFTERNOON AS THE SHORT WAVE EXITS THE REGION.
WITH SKIES CLEARING TONIGHT AND DEWPOINTS GRADUALLY RISING...WILL
PLAN TO MENTION PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING AFTER MIDNIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...
GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY...BUT
REVEAL LARGE DIFFERENCES TONIGHT MAINLY DUE TO THEIR DIFFERENCES IN
DEWPOINTS. WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARDS THE WARMER NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS
FOR TONIGHT...SINCE DEWPOINTS ARE ALREADY FAIRLY HIGH OVER THE
FORECAST AREA.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...THIS PERIOD BEGINS WITH THE 
UPPER RIDGE BEGINNING TO TAKE CONTROL...AS THE ACTIVE TROUGH 
CONTINUES TO EXIT TO OUR EAST. HOWEVER...THE RIDGE NEVER COMPLETELY
CENTERS OVER THE AREA...SO WE ARE PARTLY LEFT IN A NORTHWEST FLOW
SCHEME DURING THE WEEK.

BY WEDNESDAY THERE MIGHT BE ENOUGH MOISTURE TO GET A FEW STORMS...BUT
THE MAIN THREAT LOOKS TO BE NORTH OF HERE NEAR A WEAK FRONTAL
BOUNDARY...AS AN MCS DEVELOPS OVER THE PLAINS/MIDWEST. BY THURSDAY
THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD BE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO THE AREA AS
THE PREVIOUS MCS HELPS TO NUDGE THE BOUNDARY SOUTHWARD. THERE IS
ENOUGH SHEAR AND INSTABILITY TO GET ANOTHER MCS GOING AS WELL AS IT
LOOKS LIKE THERE COULD BE A SEVERE THREAT...IN OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES
AS THE RIDGE KEEPS OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES DRY. FRIDAY...THE BOUNDARY
SLIDES FARTHER SOUTH AND MAY-WELL BE IN OUR CWA. SEVERE PARAMETERS
WANE A BIT...BUT STILL POSSIBLE...THEN BY SATURDAY...THE FRONT MAY
BE SOUTH OF HERE AS IT CONTINUES TO SLIDE SOUTHWARD...SO TRIMMED
THE POPS BACK ACROSS OUR NORTHERN AREAS ON SATURDAY. SO HAVE POPS
IN AT LEAST SOME PART OF THE CWA WED-SAT.

FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE LOOKED GOOD OVERALL. TRIMMED BACK MAX TEMP 1-3

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...AN ACTIVE FIRST HALF OF THE 
SHORT TERM FINALLY GIVES WAY TO IMPROVING CONDITIONS LATE SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON INTO SUNDAY NIGHT AFTER A COOL AND DAMP SPELL OVER THE 
PAST FEW DAYS. AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORTWAVE WILL CONTINUE MOVING ACROSS 
THE EXTREME SOUTHERN AREAS THE REST OF THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY 
EVENING GENERATING SHOWERS ALONG THE WAY. THIS FEATURE SHOULD EXIT 
OFF TO OUR EAST BY AROUND 00Z. THE NEXT WAVE THEN BEGINS TO MOVE IN 
BY AROUND THE 06Z HOUR. MODELS HANDLING THIS NEXT FEATURE FAIRLY 
WELL BUT STILL SOME DIFFERENCES ON HOW LONG OF A BREAK IN THE 
PRECIPITATION BETWEEN THE AFTERNOON WAVE AND THE 06Z WAVE. THE NAM 
DOESN'T SHOW MUCH OF A BREAK WHILE THE GFS...RAP...AND HRR DO. WILL 
TREND TOWARD THE SOLUTION OF A BREAK IN THE PRECIP.

THE SECOND WAVE MOVES IN TONIGHT AND CONTINUES INTO SUNDAY AND WILL 
BE VERY SIMILAR TO THIS AFTERNOONS IN THAT IT WILL MAINLY AFFECT THE 
SOUTHERN VALLEY AND SWNC. WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
FOR THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY AS WELL AS NETN FOR SUNDAY BUT 
SHOWERS SHOULD GENERALLY STAY SOUTH OF I-40...WITH AGAIN THE BEST 
CHANCES ACROSS THE EXTREME SOUTHERN AREAS. BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON 
SOUNDINGS DO SHOW MINOR AMOUNTS OF INSTABILITY FROM KNOXVILLE 
SOUTH...SO WILL THEREFORE INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS 
DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS SOUTH OF KNXOVILLE. CONDITIONS BEGIN TO 
SLOWLY IMPROVE LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON AS THIS PROLONGED TROUGH 
FINALLY BEGINS TO LIFT OUT OF OUR AREA FOR GOOD. PRECIP LOOKS TO END 
AROUND 00Z MONDAY ACROSS SWNC WITH CLEARING SKIES LATE SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON INTO SUNDAY NIGHT. 

MONDAY MORNING WILL BE ANOTHER CHILLY MORNING DUE TO THE CLEAR SKIES 
ON SUNDAY NIGHT. LOWS WILL GENERALLY BE IN THE LOW TO MID 40S WITH A 
FEW UPPER 30S ACROSS NETN AND SWVA. A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE STARTS 
TO BUILD INTO OUR AREA SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. MONDAY LOOKS SUNNY 
WITH HIGHS BACK IN THE MID AND UPPER 70S WHICH IS NORMAL FOR THIS 
TIME OF YEAR.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY LITTLE TO NO CHANCE FOR RAIN AS AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL 
HAVE FULLY REPLACED THE EASTERN STATES TROUGH. THE RIDGE WILL 
RETROGRADE SOUTHWEST OVER THE GULF COASTAL REGION DURING THE 
REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM AS AN UPPER LOW BUILDS SLOWLY SOUTHEAST 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST CANADA AND THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. IN THIS PATTERN A 
WAVE TRAIN OF MESO SCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS WILL TRACK SOUTHEAST 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THREATENING MAINLY SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WHERE A LITTLE HIGHER CHANCE POPS 
WERE APPLIED WITH SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITIES FARTHER SOUTH ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA. TEMPERATURES WILL SPRING BACK ABOVE NORMAL

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT TWO UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVES WILL
SWING ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY TODAY AND AGAIN ON SUNDAY...BRINGING
A GOOD CHANCE OF RAIN...ESPECIALLY OVER SOUTHEAST TN. MODEL SOUNDINGS
REVEAL A MORE STABLE AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR TODAY AND
SUNDAY...SO WILL MENTION ONLY SHOWERS AS THE PREDOMINATE PRECIP TYPE.

COVER THROUGH SUNDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE

DIFFERENCES ARISE BY SUNDAY...WHEN A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO SEEMS
BEST.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THIS PERIOD BEGINS WITH 
THE UPPER TROUGH EXITING THE AREA AND AN UPPER RIDGE MOVING INTO THE 
REGION.  WITH THE RIDGE'S HIGH PRESSURE CENTER ANCHORED OVER THE 
LOWER MISS VALLEY...THERE WILL LIKELY BE SOMEWHAT OF A GRADIENT OF 
THE RIDGE'S INFLUENCE (OR SUBSIDENCE) OVER OUR AREA...WITH MORE 
INFLUENCE SW AND LEAST INFLUENCE OVER OUR NERN AREAS.  ADDED INTO 
THIS EQUATION IS WHETHER A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL SETTLE INTO THE 
REGION.  LOOKS LIKE GOOD SETUP FOR MCS SCENARIO WITH WNW-ESE 
ORIENTATION OF FRONTAL BOUNDARY.  WITH A COUPLE OF DAYS OF 
OPPORTUNITY FOR MCS DEVELOPMENT TO OUR NORTH...AND ASSOCIATED COLD 
POOL PROPAGATION OF FRONTAL BOUNDARY...THINK IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT 
THE FRONT WILL INDEED SETTLE INTO THE AREA--AT LEAST INTO THE 
NORTHEAST--POSSIBLY BY THURSDAY AND LIKELY BY FRIDAY. HOWEVER...WIND
PROFILE CERTAINLY NOT TEXTBOOK FOR MCS MAINTENANCE IN OUR AREA WITH
LEE TROUGH INDUCING LOW LEVEL WINDS WITH SIGNIFICANT WESTERLY
COMPONENT. SO LOOKS LIKE MCS WOULD DEVELOP IN THE PLAINS...WHERE
SETUP IS BETTER...THEN MCS WOULD BE WEAKENING AS IT MOVES TOWARD
THE APPALACHIANS. SO ALTHOUGH AIRMASS WILL BE UNSTABLE...THIS SETUP
WILL LIKELY LIMIT SEVERE THREAT AND HEAVY RAIN THREAT. STILL MAY BE
SOME SEVERE THREAT...BUT NOT NEARLY AS MUCH AS IF THE LOW LEVEL
WIND HAD A STRONG SOUTH COMPONENT. WENT A LITTLE ABOVE GUIDANCE ON
POPS IN THE NORTHEAST DURING THIS TIME PERIOD.

FOR TEMPS...KEPT CLOSE TO GUIDANCE THE FIRST FEW DAYS...THEN FOR MAX

SHOWERS HAVE ENDED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH SUNSET AND CLOUDS
HAVE DECREASED CONSIDERABLY DURING THE EVENING AS HEATING AS ENDED
FOR THE DAY. TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN MUCH COLDER IN THE NORTHEAST
AREAS WHERE SHOWERS WERE MORE NUMEROUS. GUSTY WINDS TO 30 MPH AND
SMALL HAIL AND A FEW LIGHTNING STRIKES ACCOMPANIED THESE SHOWERS.

THE NEXT SHORTWAVE WAS MOVING SOUTHEAST FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS
TOWARDS THE LOWER MS AND WESTERN TN VALLEY THIS EVENING WITH
CONSIDERABLE CLOUD COVER WEST OF THE MS RIVER AT THIS TIME. AM A
LITTLE CONCERNED THAT TEMPERATURES MAY DROP LOW ENOUGH IN THE
EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND SHELTERED VALLEYS LATER TONIGHT BEFORE
THICKER CLOUDS MOVE IN AROUND SUNRISE SATURDAY. ADDED PATCHY FROST
TO THE NORTHEAST AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS WHERE TEMPERATURES COULD
DROP BELOW 40. ELSEWHERE WINDS AND OR INCREASING CLOUDS SHOULD KEEP
LOWS IN THE LOWER TO MID 40S. TEMPERATURES SHOULD STEADY OUT IN THE
SOUTHERN VALLEY AND PLATEAU AFTER MIDNIGHT AS CLOUDS INCREASE.
DROPPED POPS FOR REST OF THE NIGHT EXCEPT SOUTHERN PLATEAU LATE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...DEEP NEGATIVELY TILTED 
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH OUR AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. SHOWERS SHOULD BE CONFINED TO NETN AND 
SWVA BY LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING AS THE TROUGH STARTS TO 
LIFT OFF TO OUR NORTHEAST. A FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS AND SMALL 
HAIL WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE DUE TO STEEP LAPSE RATES BECAUSE OF VERY 
COLD AIR ALOFT FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. DROPPED POPS TONIGHT DUE TO 
TROUGH LIFTING OUT OF OUR AREA BUT RAIN RETURNS FOR SATURDAY. NEAR 
RECORD BREAKING TEMPS TOMORROW MORNING WITH CURRENT FORECAST TEMPS 
AND RECORD LOWS AT CHA 45/42...TYS 42/39...TRI 39/34. ALTHOUGH IT
APPEARS THAT NO RECORDS WILL BE TIED OR BROKEN...IT WILL STILL BE
VERY CHILLY FOR MID MAY TOMORROW MORNING.

ANOTHER WAVE OF ENERGY MOVES THROUGH THE TROUGH BASE TOMORROW 
AND WILL APPROACH OUR WESTERN AREAS BY TOMORROW MORNING AND WILL
BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS THROUGH THE DAY. LAPSE RATES AREN'T
NEARLY AS STEEP AS THEY WERE TODAY AND SOUNDINGS ALSO INDICATE A
MID LEVEL STABLE LAYER. THEREFORE...WILL NOT INCLUDE THUNDER WITH
TOMORROWS SHOWERS. TOMORROWS HIGH TEMPS WILL BE SIMILAR TO TODAYS
WITH TEMPS IN THE LOW TO MID 60S.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEAK SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY MOVING THROUGH THE EASTERN UPPER TROUGH EXPECTED TO BRING 
SOME SHOWERS SATURDAY NIGHT ESPECIALLY SOUTH. INSTABILITY WEAK SO NO 
THUNDER MENTION FOR NOW.  MAY BE A LINGERING SHOWER MAINLY SOUTH 
SUNDAY MORNING...THEN DECREASING CLOUDS.  UPPER RIDGE TO BUILD OVER 
THE AREA MONDAY AND TUESDAY...AND EXPECT DRY WEATHER WITH A WARMING 
TREND.  MODELS DISAGREE A BIT ON LATTER PERIOD ABOUT HOW FAR SOUTH 
ANY ACTIVITY ROUNDING THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE RIDGE WILL MAKE 
IT. GFS KEEPING IT TO OUR NORTH UNTIL THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...WHILE 
ECMWF WANTS TO PUSH IT FURTHER SOUTH BY WEDNESDAY.  FOR NOW WILL 
LEAN TOWARD CURRENT FORECAST IDEA AND DRIER GFS...BUT WILL STILL 
CARRY LOW POPS AS EARLY AS WEDNESDAY FOR NORTHERN ZONES. FORECAST 
CONFIDENCE AVERAGE FOR EARLY PERIODS BUT DIPS A BIT BELOW AVERAGE 
FOR THE LATTER PERIODS.

THROUGH OUR AREA TODAY. WITH THIS TROUGH...A SECONDARY COLD FRONT 
WILL MOVE THROUGH PROVIDING ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR SHOWERS. 
SOUNDINGS STILL SHOWING VERY MINOR AMOUNTS OF INSTABILITY DUE TO THE 
STEEP LAPSE RATES BECAUSE OF THE COLDER AIR ALOFT. WILL LEAVE 
WEATHER GRIDS AS THEY ARE...WITHOUT MENTION OF THUNDER...BUT A 
RUMBLE OF THUNDER ISN'T COMPLETELY OUT OF THE QUESTION. WINDS WILL 
PICK UP THIS AFTERNOON BECAUSE OF THE TIGHTENING PRESSURE GRADIENT 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. ADDED LIKELY POPS TO THE TN 
VALLEY AND SWNC THROUGH 18Z. AFTER 18Z LIKELY POPS ADDED TO NETN AND 
SWVA WHILE DROPPING LIKELY IN THE VALLEY AND SWNC. ALSO MADE 
ADJUSTMENTS TO SKY COVER TO INCREASE CLOUDS. WILL TWEAK HOURLY TEMPS

VALLEY ASSOCIATED WITH AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE MID WEST. 
THIS SECONDARY COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS
SHOWS A STRONG COLD FRONT OVER THE CAROLINAS...WITH ANOTHER
SECONDARY COLD FRONT OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY ASSOCIATED WITH AN
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE MID WEST. THIS SECONDARY COLD FRONT
WILL MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY TODAY...AS A HIGHLY
AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH SLOWLY ROTATES OVER THE EASTERN HALF
OF THE NATION. THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL HELP TO TRIGGER SCATTERED
SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY. MODEL
SOUNDINGS SHOW A LITTLE BIT OF INSTABILITY OVER THE FORECAST AREA
TODAY...WITH A MID-LEVEL STABLE LAYER DEVELOPING BY TONIGHT AND
STRENGTHENING INTO SATURDAY. THUS...WILL MENTION SHOWERS AS THE
PREDOMINATE PRECIP TYPE THROUGH SATURDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND
NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...
AND LOOK REASONABLE. DIFFERENCES ARISE BY SATURDAY...WHEN A
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO SEEMS BEST.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...THIS PERIOD BEGINS
WITH A LARGE UPPER TROUGH DOMINATING THE EASTERN U.S. AND THE
TROUGH AXIS ALMOST OVER OUR AREA. MODELS SHOW A COUPLE MORE SHORT
WAVES ARE DUE TO RACE THROUGH THE AREA...THEN BY ABOUT TUESDAY THE
TROUGH HAS MOVED EAST AND A RIDGE IS BUILDING INTO THE AREA THAT
WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THIS PERIOD.

MEX MOS HAS SOME POPS TOWARD THE END OF THE PERIOD...BUT THINK THIS 
MAY BE CLIMATE INFLUENCE...AS MODELS SHOW RIDGE HOLDING STRONG 
DURING MOST OF THIS PERIOD...HOWEVER THERE IS ALSO AGREEMENT THAT 
THE RIDGE RECEDES SOME IN THE LAST 24 HOURS...SO WILL HAVE SOME LOW 
POPS IN THE NORTHEASTERN SECTIONS WHERE THE RIDGE WILL HAVE THE 
LEAST INFLUENCE. THERE WILL BE SOME INSTABILITY AS WELL...SO FOR 
THIS PRECIP WILL INCLUDE THUNDER.  ALTHOUGH MODELS SHOW SHEAR CLOSE 
TO AREA...AND EURO SHOWS IT OVER MUCH OF THE AREA...THIS SEEMS 
OVERDONE WHEN CONSIDERING CLOSE PROXIMITY OF UPPER HIGH...SO WILL 
NOT INCLUDE SEVERE IN HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK...THINK BETTER 
CHANCE OF SHEAR/ORGANIZED STORMS FARTHER TO NORTH.

AIR MASS MIGHT BE COLD ENOUGH ON SUNDAY MORNING TO MIX WITH SNOW IN 
THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS OF THE SMOKIES.  WILL NOT MENTION SNOW MIX IN 
THOSE MOUNTAIN ZONES YET...WILL SEE IF MODELS KEEP THE AIR MASS THIS 
COLD...STILL A COUPLE OF DAYS AWAY.

WENT A LITTLE ABOVE GUIDANCE ON MAX TEMPS ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...
AS WELL AS SOUTHERN HALF OF AREA ON THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...IT APPEARS THAT WE WILL 
HAVE A BREAK IN THE PRECIP FOR MOST OF TONIGHT AS THE COLD FRONT IS 
NOW JUST OFF TO OUR EAST...EXCEPT FOR A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS ACROSS 
EXTREME NETN AND INTO SWVA UNTIL MIDNIGHT OR SO. PRECIP CHANCES 
RETURN FRIDAY MORNING AS THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS APPROACHES OUR 
REGION. WITH THE BASE OF THIS TROUGH...ANOTHER LOBE OF ENERGY 
ROTATES THROUGH ENHANCING LIFT AND BRINGING THE BEST CHANCES OF RAIN 
FROM KNOXVILLE NORTH WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES ACROSS SWVA. FROM 
KNOXVILLE SOUTH THERE WILL BE LESS LIKELY CHANCES OF RAIN BUT STILL 
WILL INCLUDE SLIGHT CHANCE DOWN INTO THE SOUTHERN VALLEY. INCLUDED 
MENTION OF ISOLATED THUNDER FROM KNOXVILLE NORTH AS THERE WILL BE A 
SLIGHT AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY...NOTHING NOTE WORTHY THOUGH WITH JUST 
A COUPLE HUNDRED JOULES OF CAPE PRESENT. ALSO...WITH THE TROUGH BASE 
ROTATING THROUGH EXPECT WINDS TO BE BREEZY TOMORROW DUE TO A TIGHTER 
PRESSURE GRADIENT.

RINSE WASH REPEAT...THERE WILL BE ANOTHER BREAK IN PRECIP FOR FRIDAY 
NIGHT BEFORE YET ANOTHER WAVE OF ENERGY MOVES IN SATURDAY MORNING 
BRINING ANOTHER ROUND OF PRECIP. THIS TIME...THE MAJORITY OF OUR CWA 
SHOULD SEE PRECIP AS THE WAVE MOVES IN THROUGH FROM NORTHWEST AND 
THROUGH THE TROUGH BASE. THE BIGGEST STORY IN THE SHORT TERM WILL BE 
COLD NIGHT TIME TEMPS FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 
LOW TO MID 40S TONIGHT AND NEAR RECORD BREAKING TEMPS ON SATURDAY 
MORNING. CURRENT FORECAST TEMPS/RECORD LOW FOR SAT MORNING...CHA 
45/42...TYS 43/39...TRI 39/34. OVERALL...A COOL...CLOUDY...AND DAMP 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY ARE IN STORE.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...BLOCKED FLOW PATTERN 
WILL KEEP COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES AROUND FOR THE FIRST 
COUPLE DAYS OF THE WEEK AS THE EASTERN U.S. UPPER TROUGH WILL TAKE 
ITS TIME MOVING OFF THE COAST. IN ADDITION...A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL 
BUILD SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. THE MODELS CONTINUE TO 
INDICATE THE DEEPER MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL BE POSITIONED OVER 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA WHERE LOW CHANCE 
POPS WERE PLACED. LEFT A SLIGHT CHANCE OVER THE REST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA DURING THIS PERIOD. THE DRY PERIOD WAS MAINTAINED FROM SUNDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY FOR THE ENTIRE AREA AS TEMPERATURES GRADUALLY 
CLIMB AS AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS SLOWLY EAST INTO THE EASTERN 
U.S. WENT AHEAD AND KEPT SOME LOW TO MEDIUM CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA FROM TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
THURSDAY NIGHT AS SEVERAL WEAK IMPULSES RIDE OVER THE TOP OF THE 
APPROACHING RIDGE AND WARMER AIR ADVANCES OVER THE RETREATING COOLER 
WEEKEND AIR MASS. IN THIS SCENARIO RAIN CHANCES ARE GENERALLY NIL 
SOUTH OF THE I-40 CORRIDOR.

.AVIATION...RAIN CONTINUES OVER EAST TENNESSEE TONIGHT WITH A COLD
FRONT JUST TO THE WEST OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AT THIS TIME.
LOWER CEILINGS EARLIER HAVE TEMPORARILY RISEN BUT SHOULD DROP TO
MVFR BETWEEN 6 AND 9Z AT CHA...AROUND 9-10Z AT TYS AND AFTER 12Z AT
TRI. THE AIR MASS HAS BECOME MORE STABLE BUT ISOLATED STORMS ARE
STILL POSSIBLE IN EXTREME NORTHEAST TN FOR A FEW MORE HOURS AHEAD
OF THE MAIN AREA OF PRECIPITATION. FRONTAL PASSAGE THURSDAY
MORNING SHOULD BRING AN END TO THE RAIN AND A SHIFT OF WINDS TO
WEST FIRST AT CHA AROUND 12Z AND ABOUT 18Z AT TYS...WITH THE SHIFT
SEVERAL HOURS LATER AT TRI...POSSIBLY NOT UNTIL AROUND 00Z FRIDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT RADAR TRENDS APPEAR TO BE AHEAD OF THE CURRENT POP/WX
GRIDS AS THE AREA OF RAIN THAT HAS MOVED NORTH OUT OF GA HAS
BLOSSOMED...SO AN UPDATE WILL BE ISSUED TO MAKE SOME SMALL
ADJUSTMENTS. NO SEVERE THREAT IS EXPECTED...BUT SOME GUSTY WINDS
BELOW SEVERE LEVELS MAY BE POSSIBLE. WILL ALSO UPDATE QPF AMOUNTS
TO REFLECT THE LATEST QPF GUIDANCE FROM WPC...WHICH PRODUCES
AMOUNTS OF 2-2.5 INCHES IN SW NC OVERNIGHT. THIS APPEARS REASONABLE
BASED ON CURRENT TRENDS.

336 PM EDT WED MAY 14 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...THE COLD FRONT CURRENTLY OVER
WEST TENNESSEE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARDS THE APPALACHIANS
THROUGH THE NIGHT. THIS EVENING...ATMOSPHERE HAS MOISTENED UP
CONSIDERABLY FROM THE SOUNDINGS THIS MORNING. THE INSTABILITY
VALUES ARE UNDER 1000 J/KG AND THE CIN VALUES REALLY INCREASE
AROUND SUNSET. THE WINDS STILL REMAIN STRONG THROUGHOUT THE MID AND
UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...SO COULD STILL SEE SOME STRONG
WINDS IN THE CONVECTION THROUGH THE EARLY EVENING. TEMPERATURES ARE
A BIT WARMER THAN PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS WERE ANTICIPATING DUE TO THE
CLOUD COVER SLOWER TO MOVE IN ACROSS THE AREA. COULD STILL SEE A
COUPLE OF STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS ACROSS THE AREA EARLY EVENING.

FOR TONIGHT...MIDLEVEL WARM AIR ADVECTS INTO THE AREA...LIMITING 
INSTABILITY VALUES EVEN FURTHER FOR THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. SOUNDING 
FULLY SATURATED WITH PW VALUES ABOVE 1.50 INCREASES THE FLOODING 
THREAT THROUGH THE NIGHT AND EARLY MORNING. HAVE ISSUED A FLASH 
FLOOD WATCH THROUGH 2 PM THURSDAY DUE TO THE HIGH RAINFALL AMOUNTS 
EXPECTED. DOWNSLOPE FLOW WILL BE PRESENT OVER NE TN AND SW VA...SO 
FOR NOW DO NOT EXPECT THESE AREAS TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH RAINFALL AS 
QUICKLY. WILL LET LATER SHIFTS UPDATE THIS AREA AS NEEDED. THE LOW 
LEVEL JET WILL INCREASE OVERNIGHT DUE TO UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE 
PRESENT OVER THE AREA...THIS WILL IN TURN INCREASE WINDS OVER THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

FOR TOMORROW...THE FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST 
TN THROUGH THE LATE MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON. RAIN WILL QUICKLY 
DIMINISH BY 4PM IN THIS AREA...AND WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. 
HIGH TEMPERATURES BEHIND THIS FRONT ARE EXPECTED TO LOWER TO SEVERAL 
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)... WITH THE
DEPARTURE OF OF THE RAIN EVENT...THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH NEXT
WEDNESAY WILL BE MUCH DRIER IN COMPARISON...WITH COOL TEMPERATURES
PERSISTING THROUGH THE WEEKEND. SATURDAY MORNING WILL SEE A FEW
PLACES REACH THE UPPER 30S. THANKS TO THE SLOW AND PERSISTENT
LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES...WE WILL BE DODGING WEAK
AND QUICK PRECIP EVENTS CAUSED BY DISTURBANCES IN THE NW FLOW.
RIDGING WILL RETURN EARLY IN THE NEW WORK WEEK...WITH TEMPS BACK TO
NORMAL.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...AFTER SCATTERED SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS DISSIPATED AROUND MIDNIGHT SKIES CLEARED
TEMPORARILY. CLOUDS HAVE SINCE MOVED BACK IN ACROSS MOST OF THE
FORECAST AREA WITH PATCHY FOG...LOCALLY DENSE WHERE RAIN OCCURRED
TUESDAY. AREA RADARS ACROSS MIDDLE TN SHOW SCATTERED SHOWERS AND
STORMS FIRING OVER NORTHERN AL AND SOUTHERN MIDDLE TN AND MOVING
SLOWLY NORTH. THIS CONVECTION LIES IN THE VICINITY OF A COLD FRONT
THAT LIES ACROSS MIDDLE TN EARLY THIS MORNING. SHORT RANGE MODELS
DEVELOP LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER NORTH MS THAT SLOWS FRONT DOWN AS
THE LOW MOVES ALONG IT TODAY AND THEN MOVES THE SURFACE LOW INTO
THE GREAT LAKES EARLY THURSDAY. THE FRONT IS FORECAST TO MOVE EAST
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT AND THURSDAY.

A SATURATED AND UNSTABLE AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WILL ALLOW 
NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND STORMS TO FORM FROM WEST TO EAST LATE THIS 
MORNING OR BY MID AFTERNOON. A STRONG SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER WEST TX 
WILL MOVE INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON. THE BOUNDARY OVER 
MIDDLE TN WILL BE THE FOCUS FOR THE STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS TO 
DEVELOP AS A LINE TO THE WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS LINE IS 
EXPECTED TO MOVE EAST INTO WESTERN SECTIONS BY LATE AFTERNOON OR 
EVENING WITH A RISK OF DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL. RAINFALL 
AMOUNTS COULD BE HEAVY BY THIS EVENING WITH THIS LINE AND THEN JUST 
AHEAD OF THE FRONT OVERNIGHT INTO THURSDAY. KEPT LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL WORDING FOR OVERNIGHT AND THURSDAY MORNING. AS FRONT
MOVES EAST THURSDAY SHOWERS WILL TAPER OFF LATE IN THE DAY. HIGH
TEMPERATURES WILL AGAIN REACH THE LOWER TO MID 80S TODAY...NOT
QUITE AS WARM AS TUESDAY. THURSDAY HIGHS SHOULD BE ABOUT 15 DEGREES
COOLER BEHIND THE FRONT.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER TROUGH AXIS 
MOVES THROUGH SLOWLY THURSDAY NIGHT AND EARLY FRIDAY. POPS TAPER OFF 
THURSDAY NIGHT BUT CONTINUE SLIGHTLY INTO FRIDAY WITH NW FLOW. 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SETTLES OVER THE AREA FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE 
PERIOD. IMPULSES IN NW FLOW WILL PULL MOISTURE BACK INTO THE AREA 
WITH A LOW CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION OVER THE WEEKEND. TIMING OF 
THESE FEATURES UNCERTAIN. TRENDED TOWARD AN OVERALL DRIER FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...
CONVECTION REMAINS RATHER UNORGANIZED THIS AFTERNOON AND MOVING
NORTH AT JUST OVER 10 MPH. PLENTY OF INSTABILITY BUT VERY WEAK
WINDS ALOFT. OPTED TO LOWER POPS IN EXTREME NE TN AND SW VA TO
SOLID CHANCE WITH SCATTERED WORDING FOR REST OF THE AFTERNOON AND
EARLY EVENING HOURS.

SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVING THROUGH THE UPPER TROUGH TO OUR WEST WILL 
INCREASE WINDS ALOFT FOR WEDNESDAY...AND ALSO NUDGE THE COLD FRONT 
CLOSER TO OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES. THIS SHOULD LEAD TO INCREASING 
SHOWERS AND A BIT STRONGER TSRA FOR TOMORROW. PREVIOUS FORECAST 
GRIDS LOOKED GOOD AND WERE GENERALLY FOLLOWED...KEEPING LIKELY POPS 
FOR WRN AREAS BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. 

MIN TEMPS SHOULD BE QUITE SIMILAR TO TUESDAY MORNING LOWS...WHILE 
MAX TEMPS SHOULD COOL AT LEAST A FEW DEGREES ACROSS MOST AREAS GIVEN 
THE HIGHER RAIN CHANCES ON WEDNESDAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
POPS WILL BE INCREASING TO CATEGORICAL WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE DEEP
TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS SLOWLY MOVES EAST. A SOUTHERLY FLOW FROM THE
TROPICS WILL PROVIDE DEEP MOISTURE TRANSPORT THROUGH THURSDAY.
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL BE ON THE ORDER OF 1.5 INCHES...WELL
ABOVE CLIMO NORMALS. THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF THE SYSTEM KEEPS UPPER
DIVERGENCE IN THE JET ENTRANCE REGION AND FRONTOGENETIC FORCING
OVER THE AREA FOR A GOOD 12-18 HOUR PERIOD. WILL INCLUDE A MENTION
OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. TWO INCH AMOUNTS MAY BE POSSIBLE IN SOME
SPOTS...MOST LIKELY IN SW NC. THE NEED FOR A FLOOD WATCH WILL BE
MONITORED. FRONTAL PASSAGE IS AGREED UPON BETWEEN THE NAM AND
GFS...EXITING THURSDAY AFTERNOON.

WITH THE DEEP TROUGH MOVING OVERHEAD FRIDAY...AND A CUT OFF LOW  
LINGERING OVER THE EASTERN CONUS THROUGH SUNDAY...TEMPERATURES WILL 
BE WELL BELOW NORMAL FOR THE WEEKEND. DISTURBANCES PASSING BY IN THE 
NW FLOW ALOFT MAY ALSO BRING SOME LIGHT SHOWERS BOTH SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY...AND WILL HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EACH DAY AND NIGHT. 
CONFIDENCE IN THE MODELS ABLILTY TO PREDICT THESE DETAILED FEATURES 
IS LOW. IT DOES APPEAR THAT RIDGING WILL BUILD IN 
MONDAY/TUESDAY...BRINGING DRY WEATHER AND WARMER TEMPERATURES.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A BERMUDA HIGH OVER THE WESTERN
ATLANTIC...WITH A COLD FRONT OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY AND OZARKS
REGION. THIS BERMUDA HIGH WAS HELPING TO CREATE AN UNSEASONABLY WARM
AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...WITH SOME
ISOLATED CONVECTION STILL LINGERING NEAR THE MOUNTAINS. THIS
CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS WITH THE
LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING...SO WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST LATER
THIS EVENING TO REMOVE ANY EVENING PRECIP WORDING. WITH THE HIGH
DEWPOINTS IN PLACE...WILL ALSO PLAN TO MENTION PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING
AFTER MIDNIGHT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)... 
AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE REMAINS THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE ACROSS
THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON AS TEMPERATURES HAVE SOARED INTO THE 80S
AREAWIDE ONCE AGAIN...AND WILL TOP OFF IN THE 85 TO 90 DEGREE RANGE
OVER A GOOD PORTION OF THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY THIS LATE
THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING. HOWEVER...ABUNDANT MOISTURE UNDERNEATH THIS
RIDGE HAS ALLOWED FOR SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP. THIS ACTIVITY HAS MAINLY BEEN CONFINED TO
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THE MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA...EAST TENNESSEE AND WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA. HOWEVER...A
ROGUE THUNDERSTORM IN THE VALLEY IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION THOUGH
SUNSET. MODELS ARE ALSO SHOWING SOME ADDITIONAL CONVECTION FIRING
ACROSS SOUTHERN KENTUCKY AND MAKING ITS WAY ALONG THE NORTHERN
PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA BY THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. GIVEN
SOME INSTABILITY ACROSS THE REGION. SOME STORMS COULD BECOME
LOCALLY STRONG...AND PERHAPS APPROACH SEVERE LIMITS. HOWEVER...THE
LACK OF SHEAR WILL SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT THE SEVERE THREAT AND
ORGANIZATION WITHIN THESE CLUSTERS OF STORMS.

THIS ACTIVITY WILL WANE BY THE EARLY EVENING WITH THE SETTING SUN AND 
ALLOW FOR A QUIET NIGHT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. MOISTURE BOUNDARY 
LAYER CONDITIONS AND CALM WINDS LATE TONIGHT WILL ALLOW FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF SOME PATCHY FOG NEAR BODIES OF WATER AND IN SHELTERED 
VALLEYS...SO HAVE INCLUDED A MENTION OF THIS IN THE ZONES AS WELL. 
TUESDAY SHOULD BE A CARBON COPY OF TODAY...BUT WITH A LITTLE MORE 
CLOUD COVER AND CONVECTION THANKS TO AN APPROACHING UPPER-LEVEL 
STORM SYSTEM AND A WEAKENING CAP. THIS WILL LEAD TO MORE WIDESPREAD 
SCATTERED STORMS /SOME STRONG TO LOCALLY SEVERE BY THE AFTERNOON/ 
...SO HAVE CHANCE POPS AREAWIDE. GIVEN THE CLOUD COVER...HIGHS WILL 
BE A DEGREE OR TWO COOLER BUT STILL REACH THE MID 80S IN MOST SPOTS 
AGAIN. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
SYNOPTIC FORCING WILL BE INCREASING TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS A 
DEEP UPPER TROUGH DIGS OVER THE PLAINS AND THE ATLANTIC RIDGE LOSES 
ITS GRIP. MOISTURE WILL BE PLENTIFUL WITH TRAJECTORIES COMING FROM 
THE GULF FOR SEVERAL DAYS. SOME AFTERNOON HEATING WEDNESDAY COULD 
PROVIDE ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR AN ISOLATED SEVERE THREAT. HOWEVER... 
THE BEST LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE JET AND QG FORCING WILL ARRIVE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY AS CYCLOGENESIS OCCURS OVER WEST 
TN/WESTERN KY AND THE SYSTEM SLOWLY TRACKS EAST. MODERATE TO LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAIN MAY BE POSSIBLE AT TIMES DUE TO FAVORABLE POSITION OF THE 
UPPER JET AND DEEP MOISTURE. COLD FRONT PASSAGE THURSDAY NIGHT WILL 
BRING AN END TO POPS. 

THE GENERAL FORECAST TREND FOR FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY WILL BE A 
LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN CONUS. THIS WILL PROVIDE BELOW 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES EACH DAY AND NIGHT. SMALLER EMBEDDED 
DISTURBANCES MAY BRING SLIGHT CHANCES OF SHOWERS OVER THE 
WEEKEND...BUT GFS AND ECMWF DO NOT AGREE ON THE DETAILS OT TIMING OF 
THESE FEATURES. WILL NOT MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AS CONFIDENCE IS 
LOW. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP OVER THE WEEKEND FOR NOW.

AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN THE DOMINANT
WEATHER FEATURE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...AND HAS PROMOTED
MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS MORNING
/EXCEPTION OF A FEW BANDS OF HIGH CLOUDS MOVING OVER THE NORTHERN
PLATEAU AND CENTRAL VALLEY/. THE ABUNDANT SUNSHINE AND WARM
TEMPERATURES ALOFT/HIGH THICKNESS VALUES WILL ALLOW FOR A QUICK
WARM-UP INTO THE LOW 80S BY MIDDAY AND A EVENTUALLY INTO THE MID TO
UPPER 80S ACROSS MUCH OF THE VALLEY AGAIN BY THE AFTERNOON /WITH A
FEW SPOTS APPROACHING 90 DEGREES/. WITH MOISTURE UNDERNEATH THIS
RIDGE HOWEVER...THE SOME DIURNALLY DRIVEN CONVECTION IS EXPECTED
/PRIMARILY ALONG THE EAST TENNESSEE/WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA
MOUNTAINS/ THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MODELS ARE ALSO SHOWING SOME
ADDITIONAL CONVECTION FIRING ACROSS SOUTHERN KENTUCKY AND MAKING
ITS WAY ALONG THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA BY THE
AFTERNOON.

GIVEN THIS...HAVE LOW-END MENTIONABLE POPS IN THESE AREAS AND
CHANCE POPS ALONG THE MOUNTAINS /AS THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD BE
ISOLATED TO SCATTERED IN NATURE/. HOWEVER...KEPT MENTIONABLE POPS
OUT OF THE VALLEY FOR NOW AS THINK MODELS ARE OVER DOING IT
SOMEWHAT WITH THE CAP STILL IN PLACE. THIS THINKING IS SUPPORTED
WELL BY THE HRRR WHICH SHOWS CONVECTION PRIMARILY ALONG THE
MOUNTAINS AND LATE MOVING INTO SW VIRGINIA. THERE WILL BE ENOUGH
INSTABILITY LATER TO SUPPORT SOME STRONG STORMS CAPABLE OF GUSTY
WINDS AND SMALL HAIL ALONG THE MOUNTAINS...WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR
A ROGUE SEVERE STORM OR TWO. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE LACK OF
ORGANIZATION...AM NOT ANTICIPATING ANYTHING MORE THAN A VERY
ISOLATED SEVERE THREAT FOR THOSE AFOREMENTIONED AREAS ATTM.

IS RELATIVELY DRY BUT NEAR SEASONAL NORMAL. GOOD H85-H70 LAPSE RATE 
DEVELOPS TODAY HOWEVER WARM LAYER NEAR H50 PERSISTS. QUESTION 
REMAINS WILL CONVECTION BE ABLE TO BREAK THE CAP. BEST CHANCES ARE

.LONG TERM( TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...AS A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST AND OUT OF THE AREA A WEAK IMPULSE MOVING

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE DEVELOPING OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON DUE TO ISENTROPIC LIFT. THIS CONVECTION WILL
CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE FLOW AROUND THE HIGH PRESSURE...CURRENTLY
OVER THE COASTAL STATES. AS THE HIGH PRESSURE SLOWLY SHIFTS
EASTWARD...THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL SLOWLY MOVE TOWARDS
THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU...SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE...AND SOUTHWEST NORTH
CAROLINA. THERE IS ENOUGH INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE AND TEMP
ADVECTION TO SUPPORT ANYTHING MOVING INTO THE AREA IN THE LATE
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON COVERAGE AND
TIMING. THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE DIURNAL IN
NATURE...AND QUICKLY FALL APART AROUND SUNSET.

FOR TONIGHT...ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS STILL PRESENT FOR PATCHY 
FOG DEVELOPMENT AGAIN AREAWIDE. TOMORROW...MODELS IN PRETTY GOOD
AGREEMENT FOR ANOTHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY IN
THE AFTERNOON. THERE IS A DECENT AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY
TOMORROW...BUT THE WIND PROFILE IS NOT IMPRESSIVE FOR STRONG
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. AGAIN...THIS WILL BE MORE DIURNAL IN
NATURE AND WILL QUICKLY DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET. TEMPERATURES WILL
BE SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.


.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/... 

AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL 
SLOWLY SLIDE TO THE EAST ON TUESDAY...BUT MAINTAIN ENOUGH OF AN 
INFLUENCE OVER THE REGION TO ALLOW FOR A MOSTLY DRY FORECAST FOR 
MOST OF THE DAY. HOWEVER...ENOUGH MOISTURE WILL EXIST UNDERNEATH 
THIS RIDGE WILL EXIST AND COMBINE WITH A WEAKENING TO ALLOW FOR SOME 
DIURNALLY DRIVEN CONVECTION AREAWIDE...ESPECIALLY ALONG THE PLATEAU 
AND MOUNTAINS. THIS ACTIVITY WILL MOSTLY BE SCATTERED IN 
NATURE...BUT GIVEN SOME INSTABILITY AND SHEAR...SOME STORMS COULD 
BECOME LOCALLY STRONG...AND POSSIBLY SEVERE /THOUGH AM NOT TERRIBLY 
CONFIDENT ABOUT THOSE PROSPECTS ATTM/.  

A DEEP UPPER-TROUGH WILL THEN MOVE INTO THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY AND 
DRAG A COLD FRONT WITH IT WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
MODELS DIFFER ON THE TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM...WITH THE GFS INDICATING 
SOME DEEPER CONVECTION MOVING INTO THE REGION EARLIER ON WEDNESDAY 
/WHILE THE NAM IS TRENDING A LITTLE LATER/. AT ANY RATE...THE 
POTENTIAL FOR MORE WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION TO THE AREA THROUGH 
THURSDAY MORNING. ATTM...IT APPEARS THE HIGHEST CHANCES WILL OCCUR 
ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY MORNING /SO HAVE INCREASED 
POPS TO LIKELY DURING THIS PERIOD/. THEN ON THURSDAY...HAVE TAPERED  
THEM OFF FROM WEST TO EAST DURING THE DAY. MUCH COOLER AIR WILL 
FILTER INTO THE REGION BEHIND THE FRONT AS A BROAD TROUGH SETS UP 
OVER THE EASTERN CONUS. THIS WILL KNOCK TEMPERATURES BACK INTO THE 
UPPER 60S AND LOWER 70S FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE 
LOOKS AS IF IT WILL TRACK TOWARD THE REGION FRIDAY NIGHT...BRINGING 
AN ADDITIONAL ROUND OF SHOWERS TO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR SATURDAY 
/BEFORE CLEARING OCCURS BY SUNDAY/.

306 AM EDT SUN MAY 11 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE RIDGE CONTINUES OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. UPPER RIDGING BUILDS INTO THE AREA THROUGH 
THE PERIOD. BOUNDARY LAYER MOIST FROM RECENT RAINFALL. GOOD COOLING 
EARLY TONIGHT HAS LED TO OVERNIGHT FOG DEVELOPMENT. WINDS WILL 
REMAIN LIGHT SO FOG WILL BURN OFF SLOWLY THIS MORNING. LOW LEVEL 
CONVERGENCE ALONG SOUTHERN MOUNTAINS COUPLED WITH DAY TIME HEATING 
COULD LEAD TO ISOLATED OROGRAPHIC CONVECTION ACROSS SOUTHERN 
MOUNTAINS. TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW 80S WILL BE COMMON AS THICKNESS 
HEIGHTS RISE TODAY. WARMER TEMPERATURES CONTINUE TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL 
NUDGE INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION FOR MONDAY.  WITH SOME 
WEAK INSTABILITY REMAINING OVER THE AREA AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IN 
PLACE...COULD SEE MAINLY DIURNAL TYPE CONVECTION DEVELOPING AND 
GENERAL OVER NORMALLY FAVORED LOCATIONS...HIGHER TERRAIN.  MAIN 
SYSTEM OF CONCERN THROUGH THE EXTEND CONTINUES TO BE A RELATIVELY 
STRONG COLD FRONT PROGGED INTO THE AREA MID WEEK.  MODELS CONTINUE 
TO SLOW THIS SYSTEM'S EASTWARD MOVEMENT.  MAY SEE SOME SCATTERED 
CONVECTION DEVELOP AND MOVE IN ON TUESDAY AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM.  
HOWEVER...THE MAIN BAND NOW APPEARS TO HOLD OFF UNTIL LATE TUESDAY 
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY.  LINGERING PRECIP SHOULD END FROM WEST TO EAST 
ON THURSDAY AS MUCH COOLER AIR MOVES IN.  A WEAK DISTURBANCE SLIDES 
THROUGH ON FRIDAY FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS NORTH.  THEN...DRY 
ON SATURDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY
OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH A HUMID AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST
AREA WITH DEWPOINTS MOSTLY IN THE 60S. AREA RADARS STILL REVEAL SOME
LINGERING SHOWERS OVER NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA THIS EVENING...
BUT THIS CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SHOULD DIMINISH BEFORE MIDNIGHT AS AN
UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE EXITS THE REGION AND THE LOCAL AIR MASS
STABILIZES WITH THE SETTING OF THE SUN. WITH RAINFALL OBSERVED AREA
WIDE EARLIER TODAY...THINK THAT AREAS OF FOG WILL DEVELOP AFTER
MIDNIGHT AS CLOUDS DIMINISH.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT
WILL UPDATE LATER THIS EVENING TO REMOVE ANY PRECIP WORDING AND TO
MENTION AREAS OF FOG DEVELOPING AFTER MIDNIGHT.

.DISCUSSION...WEAK SHORT WAVE CONTINUES TO PRESS EAST TOWARD THE
APPALACHIANS THIS EVENING. THERE IS STILL A FEW LIGHTNING STRIKES
LOCATED WITHIN THE LINE OF SHOWERS ADVANCING ACROSS THE GREAT
VALLEY BUT THESE WILL NOT BE LONG LIVED AS THE ATMOSPHERE GRADUALLY
STABILIZES. WOULD EXPECT MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS AT THE TERMINALS BUT
VSBY MAY DROP INTO THE MVFR CATEGORY FOR A PERIOD AROUND SUNRISE.
THE BEST CHANCE OF MVFR OR EVEN IFR VSBY REDUCTION IN FOG WILL BE
AT TRI. THE FOG SHOULD BE GONE BY 13-14Z ALLOWING A RETURN TO VFR
WEATHER.

229 PM EDT SAT MAY 10 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...A SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE
THROUGH THE AREA...AS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP
OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. MOVEMENT OF THESE
STORMS IS TO THE NORTHEAST...SO AREAS NORTH OF I-40 WILL SEE THE
STRONGEST SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THERE IS ENOUGH INSTABILITY
AND SHEAR IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT ANY STORMS THAT DO BEGIN TO
DEVELOP...COULD BE STRONG. NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE AMOUNT OF
LIFT...SO WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE STORMS TO SEE IF ANY
APPROACH SEVERE CRITERIA. WITH THE PW VALUES AND WINDS AT THE LOW
AND MIDLEVELS...THE MAIN THREATS WITH THESE SHOWERS AND ANY
THUNDERSTORM ARE GOING TO BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND GUSTY
WINDS.

UPPER AND MID LEVEL DRY AIR IS EXPECTED TO BE ADVECTED INTO THE
AREA AROUND SUNSET. THIS WILL BEGIN TO LIMIT ANY ADDITIONAL STORM
DEVELOPMENT...AND ALLOW THE STORMS OVER THE AREA TO BEGIN TO WEAKEN
AND MOVE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. BEHIND THIS CONVECTION...FOG IS
POSSIBLE AROUND SUNRISE IN AREAS THROUGH THE CWA DUE TO THE AMOUNT
OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINING. SUNDAY...SKIES WILL BEGIN TO
CLEAR IN THE AFTERNOON. MODELS WANT TO BRING IN A CHANCE FOR PRECIP
IN THE MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON HOURS. CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON ANY
COVERAGE...SO INCLUDED JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR NOW. TEMPERATURES
WILL STILL BE JUST A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH SUNDAY.


.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/... AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE 
OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL NOSE INTO THE REGION 
FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THIS WILL PROMOTE A MOSTLY DRY FORECAST 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE MOISTURE 
UNDERNEATH THIS RIDGE...THE POTENTIAL FOR DIURNALLY DRIVEN SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE BOTH DAYS...ESPECIALLY ALONG THE 
PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS. THIS ACTIVITY WILL MOSTLY BE ISOLATED TO 
SCATTERED IN NATURE...WITH THE BETTER COVERAGE OCCURRING ON TUESDAY. 
SOME OF THIS ACTIVITY COULD BECOME LOCALLY STRONG...BUT OVERALL 
CONFIDENCE IN ANY WIDESPREAD SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL IS LOW ATTM 
GIVEN THE LACK OF DYNAMICS. 

A DEEP UPPER-TROUGH WILL THEN MOVE INTO THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY AND 
DRAG A COLD FRONT WITH IT WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
THIS WILL BRING THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION TO 
THE AREA THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING. MODELS HAVE TRENDED SLOWER WITH 
THIS SYSTEM...SO HAVE KEPT A BULK OF THE HIGHEST POPS OUT OF THE 
AREA UNTIL AFTER 00Z THURSDAY...BEFORE TAPERING THEM OFF FROM WEST 
TO EAST DURING THE DAY ON THURSDAY. THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME MORE 
WIDESPREAD ORGANIZED THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG 
THE FRONT...BUT ANY SEVERE POTENTIAL WILL DEPEND ON TIMING OF THE 
FRONT AND THE AVAILABLE INSTABILITY. MUCH COOLER AIR WILL FILTER 
INTO THE REGION BEHIND THE FRONT AS A BROAD TROUGH SETS UP OVER THE 
EASTERN CONUS. THIS WILL KNOCK TEMPERATURES BACK INTO THE UPPER 60S 
AND LOWER 70S FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK...WITH ADDITIONAL RAIN 
CHANCES POSSIBLE FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND.

A SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND
EVENING. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO
DEVELOP BEHIND THE WIDESPREAD RAIN THAT IS CURRENTLY AFFECTING KTRI

AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. CONFIDENCE ON TIMING OF ANY THUNDER
REACHING THE TAF SITES IS LOW...SO LEFT VCTS IN TAF FOR NOW.
REMAINING MOISTURE BEHIND THIS SYSTEM WILL ALLOW FOG TO DEVELOP AT

.DISCUSSION...
A SHORTWAVE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE REGION THROUGH THE
DAY AS ISENTROPIC LIFT FROM THE GULF WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE
WIDESPREAD RAIN OVER OUR AREA THROUGH THE LATE MORNING. FOR EARLY
AFTERNOON...NOT A LOT OF STRONG FORCING FOR THE STORMS IN MIDDLE TN
TO DEVELOP AND MOVE THROUGH EAST TN...BUT DO HAVE DECENT 0-6 KM
SHEAR...WITH ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY IN
AREAS NORTH OF I-40. GUSTY WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WOULD
BE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE STORMS. DRY AIR THEN MOVES INTO THE UPPER
AND MID LEVELS...WITH THE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
DECREASING THROUGH THE EVENING. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR NORMAL
TODAY WITH THE CLOUD COVER.

.SHORT TERM...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING NORTHWEST INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WEAKENS SLIGHTLY TODAY. WEAK UPPER SHORT WAVE 
WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS THE AREA TODAY. LIFT SUPPLIED EARLY IN THE 
PERIOD WILL ENHANCE CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMWENT TO THE WEST TODAY. LOW 
LEVEL CONVERGENCE MAY HELP CONVECTION AS IT MOVES EAST INTO THE AREA 
TODAY. KEPT CLOSE TO HIGH END MOS POP GUIDANCE WHILE EXPECTED 
CONVECTION TO BE MORE HIT AND MISS IN NATURE THROUGH TODAY. NOTHEAST 
TN AND SW VA STAND A BETTER CHANCE OF SEEING RECURRING STORMS. HIGH 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE CLOSE TO NORMAL WITH CLOUD COVER. MID LEVELS 
DRY OUT WITH THE PASSING OF THE UPPER SHORT WAVE THIS EVENING. LOW 
CLOUDS WILL WRAP AROUND SURFACE RIDGE AND RETURN TO THE AREA LATER 
TONIGHT.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEAK RIDGING OVER THE AREA 
EARLY IN THE EXTENDED.  HOWEVER...GOOD LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND A 
WEAKLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS IN PLACE COULD ALLOW FOR ISOLATED DIURNAL 
CONVECTION TO DEVELOP OVER THE REGION SUNDAY AND MONDAY.  FAVORED 
AREAS WOULD BE OVER HIGHER TERRAIN.  MAIN CONCERN THROUGH THE PERIOD 
WILL BE A FAIRLY STRONG COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION MID WEEK.  IN ADVANCE OF THIS SYSTEM...SCATTERED 
SHOWER AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WILL POSSIBLY MOVE IN ON TUESDAY.  
HOWEVER...MODEL TRENDING A BIT SLOWER WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE SO 
TIMING OF MAIN LINE OF CONVECTION REMAINS IN QUESTION.  HAVE 
INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY CATEGORY ON WEDNESDAY DUE TO THE SLOWER

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER SPEED MAX OVER OK ON 
BASE OF UPPER TROUGH WILL WEAKEN AND MOVE NE TO THE W OH VALLEY THIS 
EVENING. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO SHIFT SE OF THE 
AREA. MOISTURE INCREASES TODAY AS PWAT VALUES NEARLY DOUBLE TO 
AROUND 1.50 BY THIS EVENING. INSTABILITY AND LIFT ARE RELATIVE LOW 
BUT SUFFICIENT FOR THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPMENT. UPPER DIVERGENCE 
APPEARS TO BE THE BEST FEATURE TO AID IN DEVELOPMENT AND REGENERATION 
OF CONVECTION THAT WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST TODAY. HIGH 
POPS EXPECTED THROUGH THE PERIOD BUT CONVECTION WILL LIKELY BE 
SCATTERED AND PERIODIC IN NATURE. AFTER A LULL OVERNIGHT AN INCREASE 
IN ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY AS WEAK 
SHORT WAVE MOVES EAST THROUGH THE TN VALLEY. CONVECTION WILL 
DECREASE IN COVERAGE BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON AS TROUGH AXIS MOVES 
THROUGH AND LAYER MOISTURE DROPS OFF. AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
SLIGHTLY COOLER DUE TO CLOUD COVER. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...WILL BE IN A RATHER 
UNSETTLE WEATHER PATTERN FOR MUCH OF THE EXTENDED.  BEHIND THE 
EXITING COLD FRONT...WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE DECENT LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE IN PLACE AND THE AIR MASS WILL REMAIN SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE.  
THIS COMBINED WITH A COUPLE OF WEAK IMPULSE MOVING THROUGH WILL 
ALLOW FOR THE SLIGHT CHANCE OF CONVECTION ACROSS THE AREA SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY.  ANOTHER...STRONGER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE IN LATE TUESDAY 
INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  CONFIDENCE LOW ON TIMING BUT BEST CHANCE FOR 
CONVECTION APPEARS TO BE WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  THE FRONT SHOULD EXIT THE 
AREA FOR A DRY DAY ON THURSDAY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...UPPER RIDGE OVER THE REGION 
WILL SHIFT EAST. MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA 
WELL IN ADVANCE OF AN APPROACHING UPPER TROUGH TONIGHT AND FRIDAY.  
WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS TONIGHT...AND SOME SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS LIKELY TO DEVELOP AND MOVE IN FRIDAY MAINLY IN THE 
AFTERNOON.  INSTABILITY LOOKS TO RELATIVELY WEAK...AND RISK FOR 
SEVERE STORMS AT THIS POINT LOOKS ON THE LOW SIDE. WILL NOT STRAY 
FAR FROM MAV TEMPS WHICH LOOK REASONABLE OVERALL.   
 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...AN ACTIVE PATTERN
IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD AS A COUPLE OF STORM SYSTEMS WILL MOVE
THROUGH THE REGION...BRINGING SOME GOOD OPPORTUNITIES FOR
PRECIPITATION. THE FIRST UPPER-TROUGH WILL SKIRT THROUGH THE GREAT
LAKES FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY...AND DRAG A WEAK COLD FRONT
THROUGH THE AREA. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP ALONG/WEST
OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND MOVE EAST INTO MIDDLE TENNESSEE
/WEAKENING AS THEY DO/. THE BEST CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION ACROSS
EAST TENNESSEE APPEAR TO BE FROM 06-16Z SATURDAY...BEFORE TAPERING
OFF BY THE AFTERNOON AS THE FRONT SHIFTS EAST. SOME THUNDERSTORMS
WILL BE POSSIBLE ...BUT GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS IN INSTABILITY DO NOT
THINK THERE IS MUCH IN THE WAY OF A SEVERE WEATHER THREAT ATTM.
SOME RIDGING WILL THEN BUILD BACK IN FOR SUNDAY AND
MONDAY...RESULTING IN A WARM-UP BACK INTO THE 80S FOR EARLY NEXT
WEEK. SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE
DURING THE DAY GIVEN THE MOISTURE-LADEN ATMOSPHERE /MAINLY ALONG
THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE PLATEAU/MOUNTAINS/. ANOTHER STRONGER
STORM SYSTEM WILL THEN MOVE INTO THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT AND
WEDNESDAY...BRINGING A STRONGER COLD FRONT AND THE POTENTIAL FOR
SOME MORE WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING. THE
COOLER AIR ASSOCIATED WITH THIS STORM SYSTEM WILL ALSO DROP HIGHS
BACK INTO THE 60S AND 70S TO CLOSE OUT THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...ONE MORE DAY UNDER THE INFLUENCE 
OF AN AMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL RIDGE KEEPS SKIES FILLED WITH MORE 
SUNSHINE THAN CLOUD ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE A FEW MORE CIRRUS AROUND 
TODAY. THE RIDGE SLIPS A LITTLE FURTHER EAST TO THE EASTERN SEABOARD 
OVERNIGHT. THERE WILL BE A FEW MORE CLOUDS ADVANCING AHEAD OF THE 
CENTRAL U.S. TROUGH TONIGHT BUT LITTLE CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION. 
STAYED A DEGREE OR TWO UNDER THE GUIDANCE MAXES TODAY FOLLOWING THE 
TREND OF THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS WHICH HAS RESULTED IN GUIDANCE BEING 
ABOUT A DEGREE OR TWO WARM. FOLLOWED MINS CLOSELY TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL BEGIN TO ENTER THE AREA FROM THE WEST FRIDAY AFTERNOON AS AN 
UPPER TROUGH AND SURFACE FRONT APPROACH. THE BEST FORCING WITH THE 
UPPER JET APPEARS TO COME INTO OUR AREA AFTER 00Z SAT. THE LACK OF 
INSTABILITY AFTER DARK SHOULD HELP LIMIT ANY SEVERE 
THREAT...ALTHOUGH WITH A LLJ OF AROUND 50 KTS...IT CANNOT BE 
ENTIRELY RULED OUT. THE BEST MID/UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS WITH THIS 
SYSTEM LIFTS NE FRIDAY NIGHT...SO THERE SHOULD BE A GENERAL 
WEAKENING TREND TO THE CONVECTION AS IT MOVES THROUGH. 

BEHIND THE TROUGH PASSAGE...THE FLOW BECOMES NEARLY ZONAL...AND THE 
SURFACE FRONT STALLS E-W TO OUR NORTH. FOR SATURDAY THROUGH 
MONDAY...THE ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL REMAIN THE DOMINANT FEATURE. THE 
LACK OF DEEP MOISTURE AND FORCING ALOFT WILL LIMIT CONVECTION TO 
ISOLATED/SCATTERED COVERAGE AT BEST...FAVORING TERRAIN AREAS...AND 
MAINLY DIURNALLY DRIVEN. POPS WILL BE LOWERED THESE DAYS...AND 
REMOVED ENTIRELY FROM OVERNIGHT PERIODS. 

THERE IS FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GFS AND ECMWF OF A DEEP 
TROUGH DROPPING INTO THE PLAINS ON TUESDAY...AND THE ATLANTIC RIDGE 
GIVING WAY. THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR GREATER MOISTURE TO ADVECT INTO 
THE AREA...AND WILL RAISE POPS INTO THE HIGH CHANCE RANGE 
TUESDAY/TUESDAY NIGHT.

MOISTURE INCREASE WITH SOUTHWEST TO SOUTHERLY WIND FROM THE GULF 
AHEAD OF SHORTWAVE RAISES DEW POINTS INTO THE MID TO UPPER 50S... 
POSSIBLY NEAR 60 BY LATE FRIDAY. GFS SHOWS SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE

INTO NE AND EASTERN SECTIONS. MOUNTAINS MAY SEE SHOWERS IN THE 
AFTERNOON IF AIR MASS BECOMES UNSTABLE ENOUGH. WET PATTERN CONTINUES 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING...DECREASING SOME IN THE
AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS MOIST FLOW CONTINUES OUT AHEAD OF FRONT.
TEMPERATURES WARM BUT COOLER FRIDAY WITH MORE CLOUDS. NIGHTTIME
TEMPERATURES CONTINUE MILD UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S. WEAKENING FRONT
MAKES IT THROUGH REGION SATURDAY NIGHT OR EARLY SUNDAY. RIDGING
ALOFT WILL KEEP PATTERN DRIER FROM SUNDAY ON BUT SOUTHWEST FLOW
ALOFT WILL KEEP ENOUGH MOISTURE STREAMING IN FROM THE GULF FOR
AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWERS AND STORMS SUNDAY AND MONDAY INTO
TUESDAY. ANOTHER FRONT THAT IS MORE DEVELOPED AND MAY PRODUCE SOME
SEVERE STORMS WILL MOVE INTO THE MS VALLEY TUESDAY AND MOVE ACROSS

232 PM EDT TUE MAY 6 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH THE SHORT TERM.  
THIS WILL MAKE FOR A QUIET WEATHER FORECAST WITH CONTINUED WARM AND 
DRY CONDITIONS.  HIGHS ON WEDNESDAY WILL ONCE AGAIN CLIMB WELL INTO 
THE 80S ACROSS THE TN VALLEY.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...HIGH FORECAST 
CONFIDENCE FOR THE EARLY PART OF THE PERIOD AS MODELS AGREE UPPER 
RIDGE AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE IN CONTROL WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
AND THURSDAY. RIDGE WILL SLIP EAST THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...AND 
MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA. WILL CARRY SLIGHT 
CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS ON FRIDAY FOR POSSIBILITY OF SOME SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. BEYOND FRIDAY...FORECAST CONFIDENCE TAKES A TUMBLE AS 
MODEL TO MODEL AGREEMENT AND RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY BECOMES POOR.  
APPEARS SOME SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL AFFECT THE REGION AND A COLD 
FRONT WILL SAG INTO THE AREA DURING THE WEEKEND...BUT DETAILS/TIMING 
STILL SOMEWHAT MURKY.  WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY HIGHEST POPS FOR 
SATURDAY FOR NOW.  00Z ECMWF WANTS TO BUILD A RIDGE BACK OVER US FOR 
MONDAY WHILE GFS HAS ANOTHER COLD FRONT PUSHING INTO THE REGION. FOR 
NOW GIVEN UNCERTAINTY WILL JUST KEEP SOME LOW POPS FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS BOTH MONDAY AND TUESDAY.  GFS MOS TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE SO MAINLY MINOR TWEAKS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)... THE FORECAST WILL 
REMAIN DRY WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH THIS PERIOD AS 
HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE SLOWLY DRIFTS EAST ACROSS THE SE 
CONUS...AND THE MID/UPPER RIDGE OVER THE REGION AMPLIFIES. 
TODAY...AND CONVECTION SHOULD STAY WELL NORTH ALONG A BOUNDARY 
ACROSS WV...AND FORECAST SOUNDINGS ARE STRONGLY CAPPED. GIVEN THE 
DRY SOIL CONDITIONS...WILL LEAN TEMPERATURES TOWARD THE WARM SIDE OF 
GUIDANCE FOR HIGH TEMPS EACH DAY. THIS WILL YIELD HIGHS IN THE MID 
TO UPPER 80S IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS. CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE 
FROM THE WEST THURSDAY NIGHT AS THE RIDGE ALOFT SHIFTS TO THE EAST 
COAST AND THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS APPROACHES.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...THE PROTECTIVE UPPER RIDGE 
SLIPS FARTHER EAST OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST ON FRIDAY WHILE THE LONG 
WAVE TROUGH APPROACHES THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. TRIED TO KEEP POPS IN 
THE CHANCE CATEGORY FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON FRIDAY AS MOST 
OF THE ACTION SHOULD BE FARTHER WEST OVER WESTERN TENNESSEE. FRIDAY 
NIGHT INTO SATURDAY PROBABILITY CRANKS UP AS DEEPER MOISTURE AND 
LIFT BUILD INTO THE REGION. 1000-500 MB MEAN MOISTURE AXIS AND BEST 
INSTABILITY BUILDS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON 
SATURDAY AND THEREFORE HIGHEST POPS WERE MAINTAINED DURING THIS 
TWELVE HOUR PERIOD. KEPT A DECENT 40 PERCENT CHANCE FOR CONVECTION 
GOING SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY AS A WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY DROPS 
SLOWLY THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY WOULD 
EXPECT A DECREASE IN THE PROBABILITY OF CONVECTION AS RELATIVELY 
DRIER AIR BUILDS INTO THE REGION WITH NO MAJOR FOCUS APPARENT FOR 
DEVELOPMENT. STAYED AWAY FROM THE GFS CONCEPT WHICH TRIES TO BRING A 
HEALTHY LOOKING SHORT WAVE TROUGH WITH ASSOCIATED WIDESPREAD 
CONVECTION IN THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...PREFERRING THE MORE BENIGN 
APPEARANCE OF THE ECMWF.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES 
TO STRENGTHEN ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH THE SHORT TERM...KEEPING A 
BOUNDARY TO OUR NORTH.  THIS WILL KEEP PRECIP TO OUR NORTH AT WELL 
BUT MAY SEE A FEW HIGH CLOUDS DRIFT THROUGH.  SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL 
ALLOW WARM TEMPERATURES TO CONTINUE THOUGH THE SHORT TERM WITH HIGHS 
ONCE AGAIN REACHING INTO THE 80S ACROSS VALLEY LOCATIONS ON TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER RIDGE AND LITTLE 
TO NO INFLUX OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE UNTIL LATE THURSDAY...SO EARLY 
PART OF LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO FEATURE MUCH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS 
AND DRY WEATHER. 

MODELS ALSO GENERALLY SLOWING DOWN ANY ONSET OF CONVECTION UNTIL 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON...MAINLY ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. THUS...I 
LOWERED POPS FOR FRIDAY MORNING TO A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS WITH 
CHANCE POPS ALL AREAS FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON. WETTEST PERIOD LOOKS TO 
BE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY...BUT THIS TIMING AND SEVERE WEATHER 
PARAMETERS DON'T SUGGEST STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS AT THIS TIME. I DID 
NUDGE POPS UP TO A SOLID LIKELY CHANCE BY SATURDAY AND WENT CLOSER 
TO THE COOLER ECMX MOS MAX TEMPS FOR SATURDAY.

OTHERWISE...GULF MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY INCREASE SUNDAY AND MONDAY 
SO CHANCES FOR AT LEAST DIURNAL CONVECTION...IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS 
GRIDS AND WORTH 20 TO 30 PERCENT CHANCES FOR NEW DAY 7 (MONDAY). 

GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE 00Z AND SIMILAR 12Z GFSX MOS TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
THE BOUNDARY STATIONED TO THE NORTH OF OUR AREA WILL BE PUSHED 
FARTHER NORTH TODAY AS THE RIDGE OVER THE GULF WILL BUILD NORTHWARD. 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A STRONG CAPPING INVERSION REMAINING IN 
PLACE AREA-WIDE. THIS WILL ELIMINATE ANY CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE THEIR UPWARD 
TREND TODAY AS TEH RIDGE BUILDS OVERHEAD...REACHING THE UPPER 80S 
SOUTH TO LOWER 80S NORTH. 

SW WINDS WILL AGAIN BE IN THE 10-20 MPH RANGE WITH SOME GUSTS 
POSSIBLE IN THE AFTERNOON...WITH MIN AFTERNOON RH IN THE 25-30 
RANGE. THIS COULD PRESENT SOME FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS...AND WILL 
COORDINATE WITH STATE FORESTRY FOR THE NEED OF ANY STATEMENTS. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
SURFACE RIDGING INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO LIMITING MOISTURE RETURN
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS... AND UPPER RIDGING PRODUCING MID-
LEVEL WARMING CAPPING MOIST CONVECTION...WILL KEEP FORECAST AREA
DRY AND VERY WARM TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY.

BY FRIDAY...AN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES 
FLATTENING UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA ALLOWING MID-LEVELS TO COOL. 
ALSO...SURFACE RIDGE INTO THE GULF WILL MOVE EAST OF THE GULF 
ALLOWING FOR MOISTURE RETURN INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. A WEAK 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL APPROACH THE AREA...BUT WILL LIKELY REMAIN 
NORTH OF THE REGION. 

MODELS DO SHOW UPPER DIVERENCE OVER THE AREA DUE TO A SERIES OF JET 
STREAKS MOVING THROUGH TENNESSEE AND OHIO VALLEYS. THESE FEATURES 
ALONG WITH INCREASING MOISTURE/INSTABILIY WILL ALLOW FOR INCREASING 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR FRIDAY. FOR SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY...MOISTURE/INSTABILITY IS SHOWN TO INCREASE A GOOD DEAL WITH 
HIGHER POPS OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

GENEALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

A QUIET NIGHT IS PREVAILING ONCE AGAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN

TO NOSE INTO THE AREA. THIS HAS RESULTED IN MOSTLY CLEAR AND WARM
CONDITIONS THIS EVENING...WITH TEMPERATURES STILL IN THE MID 70S

ACROSS NORTHERN KENTUCKY/CENTRAL WEST VIRGINIA IS PRODUCING SOME

OF MOISTURE AND UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT...NO CONVECTION HAS ATTEMPTED
TO DEVELOP THIS EVENING. LATEST RADAR AND SATELLITE TRENDS SUPPORT
THIS THINKING...WITH NO VERTICAL CU DEVELOPMENT. AND...WITH
CONVECTIVE INHIBITION QUICKLY DEVELOPING THIS EVENING WITH THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER 
NORTHERN KY AND SOUTHERN WV...WITH A WEAK LEE TROUGH ALONG THE 
EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. A NORTHWEST FLOW 
UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN WILL REMAIN NEARLY PARALLEL TO THIS FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...SO NOT MUCH MOVEMENT IS EXPECTED 
WITH THIS BOUNDARY. MODELS HAVE BEEN INCONSISTENT WITH WHETHER THE 
AIR MASS WILL BE MOIST ENOUGH TO GENERATE CONVECTION AROUND THIS 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY (AND ALSO WHERE EXACTLY THIS BOUNDARY WILL SETTLE)...
BUT WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR CONVECTION OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND
NORTHEAST TN THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT SINCE THE AXIS OF INSTABILITY IS
PROGGED TO LINGER AROUND THESE AREAS. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL STEEP
LAPSE RATES OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN THROUGH TUESDAY
NIGHT...WHICH WOULD SUGGEST THAT A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS
WOULD BE POSSIBLE IF ANY CONVECTION ULTIMATELY DEVELOPS. DAMAGING
WINDS APPEAR POSSIBLE WITH ANY STORMS DUE TO AN INVERTED V SOUNDING
PROFILE IN THE LOWER LEVELS...WITH LARGE HAIL ALSO POSSIBLE DUE TO
FAIRLY LOW FREEZING LEVELS AROUND 9000 TO 9500 FT MSL. SINCE IT HAS
BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT NORTHWEST FLOW SEVERE EVENTS TEND TO BE
SURPRISES (ESPECIALLY DURING THE WARM SEASON)...I BELIEVE IT IS
PRUDENT TO MENTION IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK THE POSSIBILITY
OF ISOLATED STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS EACH AFTERNOON AND EVENING THROUGH
TUESDAY NIGHT OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS
AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...
BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER RIDGE STRENGTHENING OVER
THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. ISOLATED DIURNAL CONVECTION
POSSIBLE OVER HIGHER TERRAIN ON WEDNESDAY...OTHERWISE DRY CONDITIONS
ACROSS THE AREA FOR THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. THE RIDGE SHIFTS EAST
OF THE REGION ON FRIDAY ALLOWING A COLD FRONT TO APPROACH FROM THE
WEST. MODEL RUNS SHOW SOME DISCREPANCY DURING THE REST OF THE
EXTENDED AND CONFIDENCE IN TIMING IS LOW. BUT OVERALL PATTERN SHOWS
CLOUDS WILL INCREASE FRIDAY MORNING WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP TO OUR WEST AND MOVE INTO THE MRX
CWA FRIDAY AFTERNOON OR INTO THE NIGHT. AN ADDITIONAL LINE OF
CONVECTION IS EXPECTED LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY SATURDAY AS THE
FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA. ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL LINGER OVER THE
AREA INTO SUNDAY AS THE SYSTEM MOVES OUT AND ANOTHER APPROACHES FROM
THE WEST.

NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT REMAINS NEARLY PARALLEL TO THE BOUNDARY. MODELS
INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION DEVELOPING
THIS AFTERNOON OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN...WITH MODEL
SOUNDINGS REVEALING STEEP LAPSE RATES OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND
NORTHEAST TN. WHILE THE DRY BOUNDARY LAYER OVER THESE AREAS SHOULD
LIMIT THE AREAL COVERAGE OF CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON...ANY STORMS
THAT DEVELOP APPEAR TO HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF BECOMING STRONG TO
SEVERE WITH DAMAGING WINDS (DUE TO INVERTED V SOUNDING PROFILE IN
THE LOWER LEVELS) AND LARGE HAIL (DUE TO LOW FREEZING LEVEL AROUND
9300 FT).

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS MORNING TO TWEAK THE
PRECIP WORDING AND TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.
IN ADDITION...AFTER COORDINATING WITH AREA FORESTERS...WILL PLAN TO
ISSUE A FIRE DANGER STATEMENT TO ADDRESS THE ELEVATED FIRE DANGER
FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING DUE TO BREEZY WINDS AND LOW
RELATIVE HUMIDITIES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A WEAK BOUNDARY WILL BE ORIENTED E-W ACROSS KY AND SOUTHERN WEST
VA TODAY. THIS MAY PROVIDE A FOCUS FOR SOME CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT
THIS AFTERNOON. NAM AND GFS FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A STRONG CAP
OVER SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL SECTIONS REMAINING IN PLACE THROUGH THE
DAY...BUT NORTH...THE CAP ERODES AFTER 18Z. THERE IS LITTLE IN THE
WAY OF MID/UPPER LEVEL LIFT AND MOISTURE IS LIMITED...BUT THE
SURFACE BOUNDARY MAY HELP GET THINGS GOING. WILL HAVE A SLIGHT
CHANCE POP IN SW VA AND NE TN TODAY. ANYTHING THAT CAN DEVELOP WILL
BE DIURNALLY DRIVEN...AND SHOULD DISSIAPTE BEFORE MIDNIGHT.
TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL CONTINUE ON THE WARMING TREND...REACHING
LOWER 80S IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS. GUSTY WINDS TO 20-25 MPH MAY BE
POSSIBLE IN NORTHERN SECTIONS IN THE AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
OVERALL...QUIET PATTERN WILL CONTINUE UNTIL FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.
RIDGING ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES LIMITING MOISTURE RETURN AND
UPPER RIDGING ALOFT WILL PRODUCE A QUIET PATTERN THROUGH THURSDAY.
FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW FAIRLY WARM TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 800-700MB
KEEPING THE AREA FAIRLY CAPPED. ONLY CONCERN FOR CONVECTION WILL BE
WITH A WEAK QUASI-FRONTAL BOUNDARY THAT MOVES CLOSE ENOUGH TO
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE TO KEEP LOW CHANCE POPS
EARLY NEXT WEEK.

EXTENDED PERIOD BECOMES A LITTLE MORE ACTIVE FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY 
AS AN UPPER JET OVER THE OHIO VALLEY PLACES THE FORECAST AREA UNDER 
DIVERGENCE ALOFT. A WEAKENDING FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL ALSO MOVE 
TOWARD THE AREA. MODELS SHOW ONLY LIMITED INSTABILITY...SO SEVERE 
WEATHER CHANCES LOOK MINIMAL AT THIS TIME. 

GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MEX MOS THROUGHT THE FORECAST PERIOD AS 
SUMMER-LIKE CONDITIONS ANTICIPATED.

VERY MINOR CHANGES MADE TO THE FORECAST THIS EVENING AS EVERYTHING

EVENING...AN UPPER-RIDGE AXIS WILL BEGIN TO BUILD INTO THE FORECAST
AREA TONIGHT. A WEAK FRONT ALONG THE OHIO RIVER MAY DIP INTO
SOUTHERN KENTUCKY LATE TONIGHT...BUT SHOULD HAVE VERY LITTLE IN
THE WAY OF CLOUD COVER WITH IT. AS A RESULT OF THE DRY
CONDITIONS...A MOSTLY CLEAR SKY WILL PREVAIL TONIGHT ACROSS THE

TONIGHT IN THE UPPER 40S TO THE LOWER 50S IN MOST LOCATIONS ACROSS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK LEE TROUGH ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT TOWARDS THE 
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...AND THEN BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY SOMEWHERE 
NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY AS NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT BECOMES 
NEARLY PARALLEL TO THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY. MODELS HAVE BEEN 
INCONSISTENT WITH THE EXACT PLACEMENT OF THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY... 
WITH THE NAM AND ECMWF MODELS INDICATING THAT THE BOUNDARY WILL 
REMAIN FARTHER NORTH OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. HOWEVER...THE GFS 
MODEL CONTINUES TO INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME ISOLATED 
CONVECTION OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN...SO THINK THAT A 
MENTION OF AT LEAST SLIGHT CHANCES FOR CONVECTION IS NEEDED OVER 
THESE AREAS FOR BOTH SUNDAY AND MONDAY. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL STEEP 
LAPSE RATES DEVELOPING DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS AROUND THIS 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY...ESPECIALLY ON MONDAY AFTERNOON WHEN A MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND 
NORTHEAST TN. THUS...IT APPEARS THAT A FEW ISOLATED STORMS MAY 
BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL. SINCE IT 
HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT NORTHWEST FLOW SEVERE EVENTS TEND TO BE 
SURPRISES (ESPECIALLY DURING THE WARM SEASON)...I BELIEVE IT IS 
PRUDENT TO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED STRONG TO SEVERE 
STORMS FOR BOTH SUNDAY AND MONDAY AFTERNOONS OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND 
NORTHEAST TN IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS 
AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH MONDAY 
NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL
CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN AND MOVE UP FROM THE GULF THROUGH THE WORK
WEEK. AT THE SAME TIME...A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO
DEVELOP AND BY THE END OF THE WORK WEEK...BRING A COLD FRONT THE
AREA. A COUPLE OF SHORTWAVES WILL MOVE AROUND THIS HIGH PRESSURE.
HAVE INCLUDED SLIGHT POPS FOR NORTHEASTERN TN AND SOUTHWEST VA AT
THIS TIME TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND WEDNESDAY. FORCING IS VERY WEAK
THESE DAYS...BUT WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE MODELS AS UPDATES
ARRIVE. BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON...THE COLD FRONT WILL BE APPROACHING
MIDDLE TN. ISOLATED SHOWERS AHEAD OF THE FRONT ARE POSSIBLE FRIDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH THE MAIN AREA OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE DAY ON SATURDAY. TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE
WORK WEEK WILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO WILL EXTEND
NE INTO THE TN VALLEY REGION TODAY AND TONIGHT. A DRY NW FLOW WILL
PERSIST THROUGH THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS. THE FEW CLOUDS THAT ARE
AROUND EARLY THIS MORNING IN NORTHERN AREAS CONTINUE TO
DISSIPATE...AND MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES ARE EXPECTED THROUGH THE DAY.
W-SW WINDS WILL BE 10-15 MPH WITH SOME GUSTS AROUND 20 POSSIBLE IN

TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE ON A WARMING TREND...WITH HIGHS IN THE
UPPER 60S TO MID 70S IN MOST LOCATIONS. LOWS TONIGHT UNDER CLEAR
SKIES WILL FALL INTO THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
OVERALL...A CONTINUED QUIET EXTENDED PERIOD. FOR SUNDAY THROUGH
TUESDAY...WEST TO NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WITH SURFACE RIDGING INTO
THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL KEEP AIRMASS FAIRLY DRY FOR MAY. A SERIES
OF WEAK SHORT-WAVES WILL MOVE ACROSS THE LOWER GREAT LAKES/OHIO
VALLEY WITH A QUASI-STATIONARY BOUNDARY MOVING INTO SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA/FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. THIS BOUNDARY WILL FOCUS BOUNDARY
LAYER MOISTURE TO PRODUCE A LOW CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

FOR WEDNESDAY...UPPER RIDGING WILL STRENGTHEN IN ADVANCE OF A STRONG 
SHORT-WAVE TROUGH OVER THE ROCKY'S AND PLAIN STATES. BOUNDARY WILL 
HAVE MOVED NORTH...BUT ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO WARRANT A CONTINUED LOW 
CHANCE OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN. BY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...MID-LEVEL 
WARMING FROM UPPER RIDGING AND CONTINUED SURFACE RIDGE INTO THE 
EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...WILL PRODUCE VERY WARM AND DRY CONDITIONS.

NEXT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS RETURN FOR NEXT WEEKEND.

WEST NORTHWEST AND TEMPERATURES WILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.
SEVERAL DIFFERENT SHORTWAVES WILL MOVE AROUND THAT LOW PRESSURE...
BRINGING RAIN TO THE REGIONS NORTH OF OUR CWA. THE MODELS BRING THE
SOUTHERN EXTENT OF THIS RAIN INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. RIGHT NOW THE
CONFIDENCE IS VERY LOW THAT THE LIFTING WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR
THE SHOWERS TO MAKE IT INTO THE AREA. OTHERWISE...PLEASANT CONDITIONS

SOME LINGERING LIGHT SHOWERS ALONG THE MOUNTAINS OF EAST TENNESSEE AND
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA SHOULD CLEAR THE AREA AND DISSIPATE BY DAYBREAK...
RESULTING IN A DRY FORECAST FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY. SOME
LOW STRATUS WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FROM
MIDDLE TENNESSEE EARLY THIS MORNING...PROMOTING MOSTLY CLOUDY
CONDITIONS IN MOST LOCATIONS THROUGH LATE MORNING. HOWEVER...THESE
CLOUDS WILL BREAK UP SOMEWHAT BY MIDDAY AND RESULT IN PARTLY SUNNY
CONDITIONS BY THE AFTERNOON...AND MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS BY THE
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS. WITH AN UPPER-TROUGH STILL DOMINATING
THE WEATHER ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK
WEEK...BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL KICK OFF THE MONTH OF MAY AS
HIGHS PEAK IN THE 60S AND LOWS BOTTOM OUT IN THE 40S.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
LONG WAVE TROUGH AXIS DOES NOT MOVE EAST OF THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS UNTIL LATE SATURDAY. HOWEVER...MODELS CONTINUE IN GOOD
AGREEMENT ON ANY PRECIPITATION STAYING TO OUR NORTH OVER THE GREAT
LAKES REGION...AND TO OUR SOUTH ACROSS THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO
NE TO THE CAROLINAS. THUS...NOT MANY TWEAKS NEEDED TO FORECAST
GRIDS INTO THE WEEKEND.

THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE REGION FROM LATE SUNDAY INTO EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...REACHING MAXIMUM AMPLIFICATION BY WEDNESDAY. SOUTHWEST 
LOW LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPS BY TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY...WITH LOTS OF 
SUNSHINE TO SEND MAX TEMPS WELL INTO THE 80S. MIN TEMPS IN THE 50S

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS
SHOWS A COLD FRONT STRETCHING GENERALLY ACROSS THE GREAT TN VALLEY...
WITH SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS OCCURRING ALONG IT OVER THE CUMBERLAND
PLATEAU AND ADJACENT VALLEY AREAS. TEMPS HAVE QUICKLY WARMED INTO THE
UPPER 70S OVER NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA...WHERE THE AIR MASS HAS
BECOME MARGINALLY UNSTABLE. AS A RESULT...EXPECT SOME TSTORMS TO
DEVELOP LATER THIS AFTERNOON AS THE COLD FRONT SLOWLY MOVES THROUGH
THESE AREAS. AFTER THIS COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA
TONIGHT...COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL THEN SETTLE INTO THE TN RIVER
VALLEY FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...RESULTING IN TRANQUIL CONDITIONS.
AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO SWING ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY
ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...BUT THE MODELS AGREE THAT MOISTURE
WILL BE LIMITED WITH NO PRECIP EXPECTED. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT
WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODEL FORECASTS NOT TOO 
DISSIMILAR WITH THE WEEKEND THROUGH MID WEEK WEATHER. BASICALLY AN 
UPPER TROUGH DROPS SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUADRANT OF THE 
NATION ABOUT SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY. THE ASSOCIATED MODELING WITH 
THIS FEATURE INDICATES A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BUILD SOUTH INTO 
THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PARTS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. 
MOISTURE AND LIFT NOT IMPRESSIVE WITH THIS SCENARIO. PROBABILITY 
QUITE LOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE IN THE VICINITY OF THE WEAK BOUNDARY SO DID 
NOT INCLUDE IN THE EARLY PORTION OF THE EXTENDED PREFERRING TO STAY 
WITH A DRY FORECAST. FOLLOWING THE DEPARTURE OF THIS UPPER TROUGH IS 
AN AMPLIFYING RIDGE WHICH SHOULD ALLOW FOR A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE 
ALONG WITH NEAR TO ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES INTO MID WEEK.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
310 PM EDT TUE APR 29 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS MIDDLE 
TENNESSEE CONTINUES TO CRAWL SLOWLY EAST.  STILL APPEARS THE NEXT 
ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE INTO OUR AREA THIS 
EVENING.  BEST INSTABILITY/LOW LEVEL WIND SHEAR AND JET DYNAMICS 
SHOULD BE COME TOGETHER DURING THE EVENING HOURS...AND ANOTHER ROUND 
OF STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IS EXPECTED. VERTICAL PROFILES 
INDICATE DAMAGING WIND AND HAIL AS THE PRIMARY THREATS...ALTHOUGH 
THERE IS STILL AN ISOLATED TORNADO THREAT.  SOME HEAVY RAIN STILL 
EXPECTED AND THERE MAY BE AT LEAST LOCALIZED FLOODING...ALTHOUGH THE 
THREAT OF WIDESPREAD EXCESSIVE RAINFALL APPEARS TO HAVE LESSENED A 
BIT.  WILL CONTINUE THE FLOOD WATCH...BUT WILL NOT EXTEND INTO 
WEDNESDAY AT THIS POINT.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...THE ATMOSPHERIC 
PATTERN WILL BE RATHER SLOW TO CHANGE FOR THE FIRST SEVERAL DAYS OF 
THE EXTENDED FORECAST. THE OFFENDING MIDWESTERN UPPER LOW WILL MOVE 
SO SLOWLY AWAY TO THE NORTHEAST THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. MEDIUM TO HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS 
WILL CONTINUE FOR MUCH OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THEN THERE 
WILL BE A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS MAINLY NORTH OF INTERSTATE 40 
DURING THE DAY THURSDAY AS A WEAK SHORT WAVE SWINGS NORTHEAST AROUND 
THE UPPER LEVEL LOW. EVEN AS THE THIS LOW DEPARTS ACROSS THE EASTERN 
GREAT LAKES...ENOUGH SHORT WAVELENGTH ENERGY WILL BE BUILDING INTO 
THE EASTERN U.S. FOR THE FORMATION OF A SEMI-PERMANENT LONG WAVE 
TROUGH. THIS COULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA BUT PROBABILITY TOO LOW FOR MUCH MORE THAN A SLIGHT 
CHANCE MAINLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE ALL 
THE WAY THROUGH SUNDAY. BY MONDAY AND TUESDAY HIGHER PRESSURES MAY 
HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS ENOUGH OF THE EASTERN U.S. FOR IMPROVED 
WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. THE COOLER WEATHER 
IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN WILL GRADUALLY BE REPLACED BY WARMER  
CONDITIONS SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.

SHIFTING SLOWLY EAST. THERE WILL BE A BREAK IN THE PRECIPITATION
FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF TODAY. HOW MUCH DESTABILIZATION WILL
OCCUR STILL SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN...BUT APPEARS SOME SUN WILL BREAK

TO INCREASE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LATER THIS

EXPECTED...APPEARS IT WILL BE FAVORABLE ONCE AGAIN FOR SEVERE
THUNDERSTORMS...WITH DAMAGING WINDS...HAIL...AND ISOLATED TORNADOES
POSSIBLE. HEAVY RAIN THREAT MORE ISOLATED TODAY GIVEN LOWER

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
551 AM EDT TUE APR 29 2014

.DISCUSSION...
BASED ON CURRENT OBS/TRENDS...HAVE CANCELLED THE TORNADO WATCH FOR
EAST TENNESSEE EARLY THIS MORNING...AS STORMS HAVE FIZZLED AS THE
ATMOSPHERE HAS STABLIZED FROM THE PREVIOUS CONVECTION EARLIER IN
THE NIGHT. HOWEVER...A RISK FOR STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WILL
EXIST LATER THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING AND TONIGHT AS A COLD FRONT
TRACKS TOWARD THE REGION FROM THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.

UNCERTAINTY REMAINS ON HOW MUCH THE ATMOSPHERE WILL DESTABILIZE
LATER ON. THIS WILL LIKELY BE DEPENDENT ON HOW LONG THE CLOUD
COVER AND LINGERING PRECIPITATION FROM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT PERSISTS
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. HOWEVER...MODELS INDICATE A BREAK IN THE CLOUDS
AND SOME CLEARING /ESPECIALLY  ALONG THE PLATEAU AND THE SOUTHERN
AND CENTRAL VALLEYS BY MIDDAY AND INTO THE AFTERNOON WHICH WOULD
ALLOW FOR SOME HEATING TO TAKE PLACE. AS A RESULT...SOME
DESTABLIZATION WOULD OCCUR /AND COMBINED WITH THE STRONG WIND
SHEAR/...LEAD TO ORGANIZED  STRONG/SEVERE CONVECTION ALONG THE
FRONT. THE STORM MODE WOULD BE VERY SIMILAR TO TODAY...WITH BAND OF
SUPERCELLS...AND PREHAPS SOME MORE LINEAR BOWING SEGMENTS PROMOTING
A LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WIND THREAT. HOWEVER...THE MOIST BOUNDARY
LAYER/HIGH DEWPOINTS/LOW LCL HEIGHTS...STRONG 0-1 KM SHEAR...HIGHER
HELICITY VALUES AND EXISTING RESIDUAL OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WILL ALSO
HELP TO INCREASE A TORNADO POTENTIAL WITHIN THE STRONGEST ACTIVITY
/ESPECIALLY ALONG THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND SW NORTH CAROLINA/. IN
ADDITION TO THE SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL... LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL
AND THUS A THREAT OF FLODD/FLASH FLOODING WILL PERSIST THROUGHOUT
THE DAY AND NIGHT...AND POTENTIALLY INTO THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY.

245 AM EDT TUE APR 29 2014

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
A SEVERE WEATHER OUTBREAK CONTINUES EARLY THIS MORNING ACROSS THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION...WITH THE
POTENTIAL FOR TORNADOES...LARGE HAIL...DAMAGING HAIL AND LOCALLY
HEAVY RAINFALL. AS OF 2:30 AM EDT...SCATTERED STRONG STORMS
CONTINUE TO TRACK ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE...WITH ADDITIONAL TORNADIC
STORMS STILL IN PROGRESS ACROSS NORTHEAST ALABAMA. CURRENT OBS AT
KCHA INDICATE A STILL MOIST AND UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT FAVORABLE FOR
SUSTAINMENT OF THESE STORMS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL VALLEY AS
THEY TRACK NORTHEAST. AS A RESULT...HAVE EXPANDED THE TORNADO WATCH
SOUTH TO THE GA BORDER TO INCLUDE THE CHATTANOOGA METRO AREA. THIS
WATCH IS IN EFFECT ALONG THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE SMOKY MTNS AND
THEIR SURROUNDING FOOTHILLS THRU 11Z. MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD
WANE BEFORE THEN...BUT SOME LOCALLY SEVERE /POSSIBLY TORNANIC/
STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE UNTIL DAYBREAK GIVEN THE AFOREMENTIONED
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS.

AFTER A BRIEF LULL DURING THE MORNING HOURS...ANOTHER ROUND OF
STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS MUCH OF THE
FORECAST AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. HOWEVER...THE
PRIMARY THREAT WITH THIS NEXT ROUND OF ACTIVITY WILL BE LOCALLY
HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING GIVEN THE STORM TOTAL FORECAST OF
BETWEEN 2 TO 4 INCHES ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. GIVEN THIS
/ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT SOME OF THE HEAVIEST PRECIPITATION
OCCURRED ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA/...OPTED EXPAND THE FLOOD WATCH TO THE ENTIRE AREA THROUGH
12Z WEDNESDAY...THOUGH IT MAY NEED TO BE EXPANDED LATER ON THE DAY
SHIFT DEPENDING ON THE LATEST MODEL TRENDS. THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE
HEAVIEST FROM THE AFTERNOON THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD
TONIGHT...BEFORE TAPERING OFF FROM WEST TO EAST ON WEDNESDAY. 

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
A FEW SHOWERS WILL LINGER INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND TO A LESSER
EXTENT THURSDAY AS THE UPPER LOW CONTINUES TO DROP INTO THE REGION.
THE TROUGH AXIS SLIDES IN ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY WHICH WILL KEEP A
SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVER NORTHERN LOCATIONS. AN UPPER RIDGE
BUILDS IN EARLY NEXT WEEK FOR A RETURN TO DRY CONDITIONS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...RADAR SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF 
STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE PLATEAU WITH AN OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARY OVER SOUTHERN MIDDLE TENNESSEE. THIS BOUNDARY WILL LIKELY 
BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE SEVERE WEATHER OUTBREAK FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW FAVORABLE BOUYANCY 
AND SHEAR OVER THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN VALLEY LATE TODAY FOR SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS. HODOGRAPH SHOWS FAVORABLE SHEAR FOR TORNADIC 
DEVELOPMENT. ALREADY HAVE SIGNIFICANT TORNADO PARAMETER VALUES OF 2 
TO 3 OVER NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND NORTHERN ALABAMA.

WILL NEED WATCH FOR SUPERCELL DEVELOPMENT OVER THESE AREAS THIS 
AFTERNOON...THEN MOVE EAST NORTHEAST INTO THE PLATEAU/SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. EVENTUALLY...THESE STORMS 
WILL COME TOGETHER AS A SQUALL LINE WITH DAMAGING WINDS A CONCERN 
FOR A GOOD PART OF THE AREA THIS EVENING/OVERNIGHT.

A SQUALL LINE WILL DEVELOP THIS EVENING THEN MOVE ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
FORECAST AREA WITH THE MAIN CONCERN BEING DAMAGING WITH ISOLATED 
TORNADO.

A BREAK IN THE CONVECTION IS EXPECTED FROM MID-MORNING THROUGH MID-
AFTERNOON...BUT ANOTHER JET WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING TUESDAY. ANOTHER ROUND OF 
THUNDERSTORMS...SOME LIKELY SEVERE. AGAIN MAIN THREAT DAMAGING 
WINDS...ISOLATED TORNADO AND HAIL.

HIGH PWS WILL PRODUCE A POTENTIAL OF HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLASH 
FLOODING AS WELL. HAVE ISSUED A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
DUE TO THE STRONG BOUNDARY LAYER JET DEVELOPING THIS 
EVENING/OVERNIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...THE SLOW MOVING
UPPER LOW TO OUR NORTHWEST WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE REGION FOR
THE BEGINNING OF THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. THE ROUND OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS THAT BEGINS LATER TUESDAY AFTERNOON WILL CONTINUE
INTO TUESDAY NIGHT...WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME SEVERE STORMS
CONTINUING PAST SUNSET. HEAVY RAINFALL ALSO A THREAT TUESDAY
NIGHT...AND THE FLOOD WATCH CONTINUES FOR ALL BUT NORTHEAST ZONES.
SHOWERS AND PERHAPS SOME THUNDER LIKELY TO LINGER INTO WEDNESDAY
ESPECIALLY EASTERN ZONES...WITH SOME DRYING WORKING IN WEDNESDAY
NIGHT AND ESPECIALLY THURSDAY. WITH A BROAD AND LOW AMPLITUDE UPPER
TROUGH OVER THE EAST WE MAY SEE SHORT WAVE ENERGY BRING SOME
SHOWERS SOMETIME IN THE LATTER PART OF THE PERIOD...BUT MODELS
HAVING CONSISTENCY/AGREEMENT PROBLEMS CONCERNING TIMING. FOR NOW
WILL CARRY LOW POPS FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...BUT CONFIDENCE LOW AT
THIS POINT CONCERNING PRECIP POTENTIAL.

.AVIATION...THREAT OF TSRA AT TAF SITES FOR TODAY APPEARS TO BE 
INCREASING AS STRONG CONVECTION CONTINUES TO DEVELOP ACROSS MIDDLE 
TN. ALSO SEEING SOME LINGERING ACTIVITY NEAR WARM FRONT OVER NE TN 
AS WELL AS A LINE OF NEW CONVECTION ALONG EASTERN PARTS OF PLATEAU.

OTHERWISE...STRONG TO SEVERE TSRA ALMOST A SURE BET AFTER 29/00Z SO 
FELT IT WAS PRUDENT TO CARRY TSRA IN CHA AND TYS TAFS ALREADY.

...PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...QUITE A CHANGE FROM THE DRY 
APRIL PATTERN GETS UNDERWAY TODAY...WITH A PROLONGED WET PERIOD A 
FULL DAY BEYOND THE SHORT TERM. WARM FRONT DRAPED ACROSS NE TN IS A 
FOCUS FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS EARLY THIS 
MORNING. FURTHER WEST CLOSER TO THE LARGE UPPER LOW IN THE CENTRAL 
PLAINS...MORE ROBUST CONVECTION CONTINUES TO DEVELOP OVER WRN KY AND 
MIDDLE TN THIS MORNING. MOIST AND UNSTABLE OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
TODAY...WITH MOS POPS AND NEIGHBORING NWS POP GRIDS GENERALLY HIGHER 
THAN OUR POP GRIDS...SO NUDGED POPS UP TO 60 TO 70 PERCENT FOR TODAY.

LITTLE CHANGES FOR TONIGHT...AS A ROUND OF STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS 
STILL LOOKS LIKELY WITH THE HEAVIEST RAINS EXPECTED FROM 00Z TO
12Z TUESDAY. MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO POP AND WEATHER GRIDS FOR TUESDAY
AFTERNOON WITH BOTH GFS AND NAM SHOWING A DRY SLOT WORKING IN...SO
LOWERED POPS TO REFLECT THIS IN THE 18Z TO 00Z GRIDS.
HOWEVER...THIS DRYING IS VERY BRIEF AS NEW CONVECTION IS SHOWN TO
QUICKLY FIRE ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND MOVE EAST INTO THE
FORECAST AREA LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. HOWEVER...QPF
DOES LOOK TO DROP OFF A GOOD BIT.

MAX TEMPS TRICKY GIVEN VERY WARM 07Z VALUES TODAY...THEN THE DRY 
SLOT COULD LET TEMPS REBOUND INTO THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON. A BLEND OF SIMILAR MOS MINS WAS CLOSELY FOLLOWED.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...AS NEW CONVECTION
DEVELOPS OR MOVES EAST FROM AREAS TO THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST AHEAD
OF COLD FRONT STRONG WINDS ALOFT AND SHEAR WILL BE ENOUGH FOR
POSSIBLE TORNADOES AND DAMAGING WINDS AS THE STORMS DEVELOP INTO
LINES THROUGH THE EVENING...SEE SPC DAY2 OUTLOOK. THE COLD FRONT
WILL MOST LIKELY BE APPROACHING THE PLATEAU AT 00Z AND A POSSIBLE
SECONDARY LOW ALONG THE FRONT IN NORTHERN AL WHICH COULD SLOW ITS
PROGRESS. HEAVY RAINFALL THREAT WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE NIGHT
ACROSS SOUTHERN AND EASTERN SECTIONS. LOWS STAY MILD IN THE UPPER
50S TO LOWER 60S. WEDNESDAY SLOW MOVING PARENT LOW OVER WESTERN
GREAT LAKES AND UPPER LOW MOVE LITTLE NEXT 24 HOURS. HOWEVER COLD
FRONT WILL FINALLY MOVE EAST INTO NORTH CAROLINA DURING THE DAY
WEDNESDAY. KEPT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS IN WEDNESDAY WITH SOME
POSSIBLE HEAVY RAIN IN THE MORNING WITH A FEW STRONG STORMS. THEN
THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY SHORTWAVE IMPULSES MOVING AROUND UPPER
LOW WILL BRING MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES TO NORTHERN SECTIONS AND A
CHANCE OF SHOWERS WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SOUTH. UPPER LOW FINALLY MOVES
FARTHER EAST LATE SATURDAY WITH RIDGING FROM THE WEST MOVING IN
SUNDAY FOR MOSTLY SUNNY AND SLIGHTLY WARMER. TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY
WILL BE TEMPERED BY CLOUDS AND SHOWERS BUT CLEARING SKIES FROM THE
WEST SHOULD ALLOW HIGHS TO REACH THE MID 70S LATE IN THE DAY.

BE LACKING FOR MOST OF THE DAY. DOWNSLOPING WINDS WILL ALSO 
CONTRIBUTE TO LOWER PRECIPITATION CHANCES ACROSS NE AREAS. SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS ON TAP FOR MONDAY. THIS ACTIVITY WILL LIKELY ADVANCE 
INTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU IN THE LATE AFTERNOON HOURS. 
 
.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...THE VIGOROUS UPPER LOW 
OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS WILL WREAK HAVOC OVER TENNESSEE...PARTS OF 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA STARTING MONDAY 
NIGHT. FIRST BRINGING CHANCES OF SEVERE WEATHER IN THE FORM OF 
DAMAGING WINDS AND ISOLATED TORNADOES POSSIBLE. LOOK FOR THE INITIAL 
THREAT TO BEGIN CLOSE TO 6PM EDT AND PERSIST INTO THE OVERNIGHT 
HOURS GENERALLY FOR THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN TN VALLEY AND PLATEAU 
AREAS. THIS IS WHERE THE MODELS INDICATE A STRONG SOUTHERLY LOW 
LEVEL JET AND CONVERGENCE...ALONG WITH STRONG UPPER LEVEL WINDS. 
THIS SHOULD INCREASE THE LIFT OVER THE FORECAST AREA AND ALLOW FOR A 
STRONG LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP IN THE EARLY EVENING HOURS 
MONDAY. ADDITIONALLY VERY HEAVY RAINFALL IS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT. 
THERE WILL LIKELY BE A LULL IN ACTIVITY BEFORE ADDITIONAL SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS REDEVELOP ON TUESDAY. THIS RAINFALL WILL ONLY 
EXACERBATE ANY FLOODING PROBLEMS THAT OCCURRED EARLIER FROM THE 
HEAVY RAINS. THUS A FLOOD WATCH HAS BEEN ISSUED MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING.

THE PESKY UPPER LOW WILL SLOWLY MEANDER INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION 
LATE WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL PROLONG THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THE 
COLD FRONT ALLOWING FOR MORE SHOWERS TO DUMP ADDITIONAL RAINFALL 
TUESDAY NIGHT. THE MAJORITY OF THE HEAVY RAIN WILL COME TO AN END 
WEDNESDAY FOR THE AREAS THAT RECEIVED THE HEAVIEST RAIN EARLIER. THE 
MOUNTAINS AND NORTHERN AREAS OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL SEE LINGERING 
RAIN CHANCES INTO NEXT WEEKEND. 

LOOK FOR NEAR SEASONAL TEMPERATURES ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. WITH 
THE UPPER LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION AND NORTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT...LOOK FOR BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES TO PERSIST INTO NEXT 
WEEKEND.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
439 AM EDT SUN APR 27 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEATHER PATTERN CHANGES
TODAY AS HIGH PRESSURE GIVES WAY TO INCREASING MOISTURE AND
INSTABILITY...AHEAD OF THE LARGE AND SLOW MOVING AREA OF LOW
PRESSURE OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. HOWEVER...MOS POPS (CERTAINLY
NAM) SEEM A BIT HIGH FOR TODAY. NUDGED POPS UP FOR ALL BUT FAR NE
TN AND SW VA CLOSE TO A BLEND OF THE NAM AND GFS MOS POPS. THIS
CONVECTION SHOULD BE MOSTLY DIURNAL AND TAPER OFF AFTER THE EARLY
EVENING HOURS. RAIN CHANCES SHOULD THEN INCREASE FOR AT LEAST
PLATEAU AND SE TN AREAS LATE TONIGHT...AS A SHORTWAVE MOVES ACROSS
THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.

LOWERED MAX TEMPS SLIGHTLY CLOSER TO THE GFS MOS FOR TODAY GIVEN THE 
INCREASING CLOUDS AND MOISTURE. QUITE MILD TONIGHT...BUT JUST MINOR 
TWEAKS FROM PREVIOUS MIN TEMP GRID. 

THIS INITIAL BATCH OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WON'T PRODUCE ANY 
SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL AMOUNTS...AND NOT LIKELY TO REACH STRONG TO 
SEVERE LEVELS EITHER.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE
FORECAST AREA WILL LIE IN THE WARM SECTOR BETWEEN A COLD FRONT
MOVING INTO MO AND AR AND A QUASI STATIONARY BOUNDARY OR WARM
FRONT OVER THE NE SECTION OF THE FORECAST AREA EARLY MONDAY.
OVERNIGHT SHOWERS AND STORMS MOVING INTO MIDDLE TN LATE TONIGHT AND
EARLY MONDAY WILL LIKELY BE DECREASING IN INTENSITY AS THEY MOVE
INTO MORE STABLE AIR OVER EAST TN. SO SHOWERS OR STORMS MAY BE
AFFECTING WESTERN SECTIONS EARLY MONDAY. THEN THERE MAY BE A LULL
UNTIL CLOUDS BREAK UP SOME AND DAYTIME HEATING CAUSES REDEVELOPMENT
FROM OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES AND SHORTWAVE ENERGY ROTATING AROUND
INTENSE LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. 

MORE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY SHOULD DEVELOP DURING THE
DAY TO THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST OF THE FORECAST AREA AS DEEP
MOISTURE FLOWS IN WITH THE STRONG SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FLOW AND
DAYTIME HEATING. STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP
OR MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST MONDAY
EVENING OR EARLY TUESDAY. HEAVY RAINFALL IS ALSO A THREAT
OVERNIGHT. INCREASED RAINFALL AMOUNTS MONDAY NIGHT TO OVER 2 INCHES
IN THE SOUTHWEST AND KEPT SEVERE WORDING AND HEAVY RAINFALL. MAY
NEED TO ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH DURING THE DAY TODAY FOR MONDAY NIGHT
INTO TUESDAYS RAINFALL.

ON TUESDAY THE SURFACE LOW OVER THE PLAINS AND MID MS VALLEY MOVES
EAST NORTHEAST INTO THE GREAT LAKES BY WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER ROUND OF
SHOWERS AND STORMS SHOULD OCCUR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. RAINFALL
AMOUNTS SHOULD BE LESS AND SEVERE THREAT IS EXPECTED TO BE FOCUSED
A LITTLE FARTHER SOUTH. THERE STILL COULD BE SOME SEVERE STORMS
TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH THE FRONT STILL TO THE WEST. 
WEDNESDAY THE COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH EARLY IN THE
MORNING SO THE RISK FOR MORE STORMS WILL BE LOWER. WINDS WILL
SHIFT TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST. WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
NIGHT THE LOW PRESSURE AREA REMAINS OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND UPPER
LOW AND TROUGH SHIFTS INTO THE EASTERN STATES. IMPULSES MOVING
AROUND THE UPPER LOW GIVE MORE CHANCES OF SHOWERS MAINLY ACROSS
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE AREA AND COOLER TEMPERATURES. FRIDAY
THROUGH SATURDAY UPPER TROUGH BECOMES MORE PRONOUNCED WITH NW FLOW
ALOFT AND SOMEWHAT DRIER BUT STILL A CHANCE OF SHOWERS NORTH AND
NORTHEAST. TEMPERATURES MONDAY AND TUESDAY AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL
STAY MOSTLY IN THE 70S TO LOWER 80S AND LOWS MONDAY NIGHT AND
TUESDAY NIGHT UPPER 50S TO MID 60S. WEDNESDAY TEMPERATURES WILL BE
COOLER AND THEN ONLY 60S FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. LOW TEMPERATURES DROP
TO THE 40S TO LOWER 50S THE LAST THREE MORNINGS.

317 PM EDT SAT APR 26 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
SLIDES SOUTHEAST OF THE AREA TONIGHT. A WARM FRONT WILL MOVE NORTH 
THROUGH THE AREA ON SUNDAY. UPPER RIDGE AXIS MOVES EAST OVER AREA 
TOMORROW. RISING UPPER HEIGHTS COUPLED WITH THE ADVANCING WARM FRONT 
WILL RESULT IN WIDESPREAD TEMPERATURES IN THE 80S. INCREASED 
SOUTHWEST FLOW IN THE LAYER WILL INCREASE PWAT VALUES TO NEAR 1.25 
ALONG SOUTHERN AND WESTERN PORTIONS OF MRX CWA. A VERY WEAK UPPER 
SHORT WAVE IS PROGGED TO MOVE NE INTO THE AREA BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON.  
SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS MAY DEVELOP ALONG OR ADVANCE INTO THE 
PLATEAU AND OR SOUTHERN MOUNTAINS AND VALLEY BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...NO MAJOR CHANGES TO 
FORECASTS FROM THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS CONCERNING THE MAJOR STORM 
SYSTEM THAT WILL BE AFFECTING THE REGION...STARTING LATE SUNDAY 
NIGHT...RAMPING-UP LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY...THEN 
CONTINUING UNSETTLED THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD.  

WE CONTINUE TO BE EAST OF WHERE THE STRONGEST CONDITIONS COME 
TOGETHER OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS...BUT STILL WILL BE AFFECTED.  MAIN 
DIFFERENCE TODAY IS THAT DURING THE HEART OF THE EFFECTS...THE 
CHARACTER OF THE STORMS IS LOOKING A LITTLE LESS WET AND A LITTLE 
MORE SEVERE.  WE WILL BE ON THE TAIL-END OF THE SEVERE STORMS...THAT 
DEVELOP WEST OF THE MISS RIVER ON MONDAY AFTERNOON...AND MOVE INTO 
OUR AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT MONDAY NIGHT.  OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS 
IT HAD LOOKED MORE LIKE A FLOODING THREAT VERSUS A SEVERE 
THREAT...BUT MODELS ARE SHOWING MORE INSTABILITY NOW LATE MONDAY 
NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING...SUGGESTING A LITTLE MORE BALANCE...WITH 
SOME FLOODING POSSIBLE...BUT MORE OF A SEVERE STORM THREAT.

FOR TUESDAY MODELS NOT IN GREAT AGREEMENT DURING THE DAY...COULD BE 
LINGERING MODERATE RAINS OR RAINS COULD RACE EAST...BUT THERE WAS 
AGREEMENT THAT BY SUNSET MOST OF THE LEFT-OVER STORMS WILL BE EAST 
OF THE AREA.  THEN FOR TUESDAY NIGHT...IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH 
DEVELOPS IN WEST TN ALONG THE BOUNDARY...THAT COULD MOVE IN LATER IN 
THE NIGHT.  WILL PLAN ON STORMS COMING INTO THE AREA...INTO THE 
WESTERN AREAS BY LATE EVENING...AND INTO THE EAST AFTER MIDNIGHT.  

FOR WEDNESDAY...THE COLD FRONT STARTS TO SLIDE THROUGH THE 
AREA...LOOKING AT COOLER AIR ENTERING...BUT THE UPPER LOW MOVES 
LITTLE AND SEVERAL LITTLE WAVES OF LIFT AND ENERGY COME RACING 
THROUGH THE AREA...WILL KEEP SOME POPS IN FOR MUCH OF THE AREA 
THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST.

FOR TEMPS...CUT DOWN ON DIURNAL RANGE FOR MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY DUE 
TO LOW CLOUDS AS WELL AS WIND AT NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...VERY NICE WEATHER WILL CONTINUE 
COURTESY OF AN UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE. MOISTURE 
FROM FRIDAY RAINS HAS ALLOWED PATCHY AREAS OF FOG TO DEVELOP... 
MAINLY ALONG AND NORTH OF I-40 AND I-81 WHERE MORE WIDESPREAD RAINS 
OCCURRED. THIS FOG MAY DEVELOP AGAIN TONIGHT...BUT WILL WAIT BEFORE 
ADDING FOG JUST YET...SINCE A VERY WARM AND SUNNY DAY MAY DRY OUT 
THE BOUNDARY LAYER. 

OTHERWISE...SIMILAR MOS MAXES CLOSELY FOLLOWED WITH HIGH TEMPS 
TOPPING OUT ABOUT 5 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. FOR MINS TONIGHT...I 
FAVORED THE COOLER MOS WHERE WINDS STAY NEAR CALM...AND MILDER MOS 
WHERE A LIGHT SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST LOW LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPS LATE. 
CLOUDS NOT MUCH OF A FACTOR AS SKIES SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY CLEAR AT 
LEAST INTO SUNDAY MORNING.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING OVER
THE FORECAST AREA AND RISING HEIGHTS WILL MAKE FOR A VERY WARM DAY.
FOLLOWED CLOSE TO WARMER MAV NUMBERS. GFS SHOWS INCREASE IN HIGH
LEVEL MOISTURE AND SOME LOW LEVEL INCREASE AS WELL. SHORTWAVE
APPROACHES THE AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON AND MAY TRIGGER SOME
EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS AIR MASS BECOMES MODERATELY
UNSTABLE WITH STRONG HEATING. WELL DEVELOPED SYSTEM IN THE PLAINS
SUNDAY MOVES SLOWLY EAST REACHING THE MID MS VALLEY TUESDAY AND
WEAKENS SOMEWHAT. UPPER LOW ASSOCIATED WITH IT MOVES LITTLE OVER
THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. STILL LOOKS LIKE
BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL BE TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY. 
SEVERE THREAT AGAIN LOOKS TO BE LATE TUESDAY WITH BEST CHANCES
WESTERN SECTIONS. HEAVY RAINFALL AGAIN A THREAT WESTERN AREAS WITH
ONE TO THREE INCHES FROM TUESDAY MORNING TO WEDNESDAY MORNING AND
ONE INCH OR LESS EAST.

MILD TEMPERATURES AGAIN SUNDAY NIGHT WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW AND
INCREASING DEW POINTS. MONDAY AGAIN WARM WITH HIGHS 70S MOUNTAINS
AND UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S VALLEYS. HIGH TEMPERATURES COOLER
TUESDAY WITH CLOUDS AND WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION. HIGHEST QPF
TOTALS OR RAINFALL AMOUNTS TUESDAY NIGHT WITH THREAT FOR SEVERE

IS KIND OF IN FLUX WITH THE CUT-OFF LOW OVER THE PLAINS AND GREAT 
LAKES IN THIS PERIOD...AS THESE FEATURES TEND TO WOBBLE BOTH IN THE 
MODELS AND IN REAL-TIME. THE OVERALL PROGRESSION HAS SLOWED SINCE 
YESTERDAY'S MODELS...SO RATHER THAN THE HEART OF THE PRECIP BEING 
MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT IT IS NOW LOOKING MORE LIKE IT 
WILL BE TUESDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...THEN TAPERING ON 
WEDNESDAY...STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER TIMING TWEAKS. 

SEVERE PARAMETERS LOOKING BETTER OVERALL FOR TUESDAY...BUT MAIN 
FOCUS IS STILL LOOKING LIKE IT IS WELL WEST OF OUR AREA ON 
TUESDAY...SO WITH THIS TIMING IT WOULD LIKELY BE DARK BEFORE A LINE 
OF STORMS WOULD MOVE INTO THE AREA.  BUT MODELS SEEM LIKE THEY WANT 
TO GET A PRETTY LARGE AREA OF PRECIP AHEAD OF THE MAIN SEVERE 
WEATHER AREA...SO LIKE YESTERDAY...STILL WONDERING THIS FAR EAST HOW 
MUCH INSTABILITY THERE WILL BE.  WILL BE WORTH WATCHING TO SEE IF 
LARGE AREA OF PRECIP DOES GET GENERATED AHEAD OF FRONT.  WITH 
PRESENT TIMING...WESTERN AREAS STAND A BETTER CHANCE OF SEVERE 
STORMS.

FOR HEAVY PRECIP...GFS PRECIPITABLE WATER FORECAST NOW EVEN HIGHER 
THAN YESTERDAY'S RUN...WITH 1.5 INCH PLUME MOVING INTO WESTERN CWA 
ABOUT 12Z TUESDAY AND LINGERING INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING...ALSO DEEP 
SATURATED WARM LAYER...AND LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE TRANSPORT MAXIMIZE 
OVER THE REGION DURING THIS SAME PERIOD. AT ANY RATE...TIMING MAY BE 
INCONSISTENT BETWEEN MODEL RUNS...BUT THE SCENARIO OF UP TO 12-18 
HOUR PERIOD OF HEAVY RAINS MAKING ITS WAY ACROSS THE AREA IS LOOKING 
PRETTY CONSISTENT IN THE MODELS.  ALTHOUGH THIS IS BEYOND OUR QPF 
TIME PERIOD...THINKING THAT 2-3 INCHES FOR PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST 
TN...THEN MORE LIKE 1-2 INCHES IN THE UPPER PARTS OF THE VALLEY. 
 
WILL MENTION PERIODS OF HEAVY RAIN FOR TUESDAY TO GET THE WORD 
OUT...ALTHOUGH TIMING MAY NEED TO GET TWEAKED OVER THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS. FLY IN OINTMENT TO SQUELCH THIS POSSIBILITY WOULD BE A COMPLEX 
OF STORMS DEVELOPING SOUTH OF THE REGION THAT STEALS THE 
MOISTURE...THIS HAPPENED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.  WITH ALL THIS IN 
MIND...WILL GO ON THE COOL SIDE OF GUIDANCE FOR THE TUESDAY MAX 
TEMP...AND WILL CONTINUE COOLER THAN GUIDANCE ON WEDNESDAY AS WELL.  
WILL RAISE DEWPOINTS DURING THIS TIME AND WILL MAKE VERY MILD MIN 
TEMP FOR MONDAY NIGHT / TUESDAY MORNING.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS SPREADING INTO MOSTLY WESTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS MORNING. FORECAST SOUNDINGS OFFER AT LEAST SLIGHT 
INSTABILITY FOR TODAY...SO CONTINUED TO HIGHLIGHT TSRA IN THE 
FORECAST GRIDS. GRIDS FOR BOTH TODAY AND TONIGHT LOOKED ON TRACK 
WITH JUST MINOR TWEAKS.

NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF COOLING THIS AFTERNOON AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE 
SO I CLOSELY FOLLOWED THE GFS MAXES. A FEW TO SEVERAL DEGREES 
DIFFERENCE IN MOS FOR TONIGHT'S MINS...WITH GFS MOS MUCH COOLER. 
SURFACE RIDGE ACROSS THE TN VALLEY AND SRN APPALACHIANS BY 12Z 
SATURDAY...BUT I OPTED FOR A MOS BLEND AS BEST CHOICE GIVEN 850 MB 
TEMPS.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...DRY AND WARM WEATHER
FOR THE WEEKEND AS RIDGING ALOFT BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES
AND DEEP TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE WESTERN STATES. WARMING DAYTIME
TEMPERATURES WITH HIGHS MID 70S TO LOWER 80S SATURDAY AND MOSTLY
LOWER TO MID 80S SUNDAY. DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS OVER THE
WESTERN PLAINS. STRONG SOUTHERLY FLOW OUT AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL
BEGIN TO INCREASE MOISTURE AND DEW POINTS OVER THE FORECAST AREA
SUNDAY. A CUT OFF LOW OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE
EAST NORTHEAST ACROSS THE MS VALLEY AND INTO THE GREAT LAKES MONDAY
AND TUESDAY. A FEW SHOWERS COULD FORM AS EARLY AS LATE SUNDAY NIGHT
AND MONDAY WITH A FEW THUNDERSTORMS...BUT THE WEATHER SYSTEM WILL
STAY WEST OF THE AREA UNTIL LATE MONDAY NIGHT OR TUESDAY.
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BECOME MORE LIKELY TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY WITH
POSSIBLE HEAVY RAIN OR SEVERE STORMS TUESDAY. 

TEMPERATURES STAY WARM MONDAY AND TUESDAY BUT WILL COOL WEDNESDAY
AS FRONT MAKES ITS WAY EAST. SHOWERS LINGER WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND
THURSDAY IN THE COLDER AIR BEHIND THE SYSTEM. DUE TO ITS SLOW
MOVEMENT THE THREAT OF PRECIPITATION WILL BE POSSIBLE EVERY PERIOD
FROM MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...STRENGTHENING SHORT WAVE WILL 
MOVE EAST ACROSS TN VALLEY TONIGHT. DEEPENING SURFACE LOW MOVES NE 
INTO THE W OH RIVER VALLEY BY FRIDAY MORNING. AIRMASS WILL MOISTEN 
UP OVERNIGHT WITH INCREASED SOUTHWESTERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW. 
INSTABILITY MEAGER BUT GOOD LIFT IN ADVANCE OF THE APPROACHING SHORT 
WAVE WILL RESULT IN CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT IN ADVANCE OF APPROACHING 
COLD FRONT. BEST CHANCE FOR STRONG CONVECTION AND ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE BETWEEN 25/09-25-15Z ACROSS MRX CWA. UPPER 
TROUGH AXIS...COLD FRONT...WIND SHIFT...WILL MOVE THROUGH SHORTLY 
AFTER 25/18Z. CONVECTION WILL TAPER OFF IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS. WARM 
TONIGHT WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES ON FRIDAY WITH WEAK COLD OR 
NEUTRAL AIR ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT LATE. 

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...THIS PERIOD WILL START 
OUT DRY AND QUIET...BUT WILL TURN MESSY FOR ITS SECOND HALF.  AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THIS PERIOD ON FRIDAY NIGHT...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS 
BUILDING INTO THE AREA BEHIND A WEAK COLD FRONT.  SATURDAY LOOKS 
BEAUTIFUL...WITH SUNDAY BEGINING THE RETURN FLOW FROM THE GULF 
BRINGING WARMER AIR AND AND THE UPPER RIDGE OVERHEAD SHOULD MAKE FOR 
A WARM DAY. 

THE AFOREMENTIONED MESSINESS DEALS WITH THE CUT-OFF LOW THAT IS 
PROGGED TO HANG IN THE UPPER MISS VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES FOR SEVERAL 
DAYS...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED TROUGH HANGING IN OUR AREA.  WITH A CUT-
OFF LOW...TIMING OF SYSTEMS MOVING THROUGH COULD BE AN ADVENTURE.

ON MONDAY THE FIRST WAVE WILL BE MOVING IN...BUT THE SYSTEM WILL BE 
GETTING STRUNG OUT AS THE ANCHORING SURFACE LOW STAYS IN THE PLAINS 
AND ANY STORMS MOVING INTO OUR AREA FROM WEST/MIDDLE TN GET FARTHER 
AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE DYNAMICS.  TUESDAY IS STARTING TO LOOK 
MORE AND MORE INTERESTING NOW...AS THE SYSTEM KICKS EAST...THE 
DYNAMICS WILL BE HEADING THIS WAY AS WELL...BUT MODELS LOOKING LIKE 
THEY WANT A LOT OF PRECIP WELL AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND THE 
DYNAMICS...SO IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO GET GOOD HEATING DURING THE 
DAY...ALSO LOOKS LIKE TIMING MIGHT BE BETTER FOR WEST/MIDDLE TN 
DURING MAX HEATING AGAIN ON TUESDAY...AND THEN THE STORMS WOULD MOVE 
IN HERE TUESDAY EVENING OR NIGHT.  AT ANY RATE...FOR NOW OUR SEVERE 
THREATS LOOK PRETTY LIMITED THIS FAR EAST.  FOR PRECIP AMOUNTS...AIR 
MASS GETS HIGH MOISTURE WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER WITH VALUES >= 1.2 
INCHES FROM 06Z TUE THROUGH 06Z WED.  LOOKING LIKE WE MAY NEED TO 
KEEP AN EYE ON QPF MORE THAN SEVERE PARAMETERS AT THIS POINT.  WPC 
QPF FORECAST HAS HEAVIEST AXIS JUST SOUTH OF OUR CWA...WITH A "HOLE" 
IN THE 7 DAY QPF OVER MUCH OF MIDDLE AND EAST TN...BUT ENSEMBLES 
PROBABLILITIES HINT THAT THE AXIS COULD MOVE MORE DIRECTLY OVER OUR 
AREA.  EVEN THE AXIS AS IS COULD POSE SOME PROBLEMS IN OUR MORE-
PRONE HYDRO STREAMS AT SOUTH CHICAMAUGA CREEK NEAR KCHA AND THE 
RIVER STRETCHES NEAR NEWPORT.
 
THERE IS LOW CONFIDENCE ON TIMING DUE TO CUT-OFF LOW'S FICKLE 
MOVEMENT...WE WILL NEED TO KEEP WATCHING FOR CHANGES IN TIMING AND 
ALIGNMENT OF PARAMETERS AS TO WHETHER THIS SCENARIO HOLDS.

BY WEDNESDAY...LOOKS LIKE GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THE COLD FRONT WILL BE 
PAST US AND COOLER AIR WILL BY MOVING IN...BUT THE UPPER LOW IS 
FORECAST TO HANG IN THE GREAT LAKES AND SEND MOISTURE AND LIFT OVER 
US IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW.  LOOKS LIKE WE MIGHT HAVE A DRY SLOT MOVE 
INTO THE AREA BY AROUND THURSDAY...BUT TIMING A DRY SLOT THIS FAR 
OUT IN THIS SCENARIO IS RISKY...SO WILL NEED TO KEEP SOME LOW POPS 
IN.

FOR TEMPERATURES...WITH THE ABOVE SCENARIO IN HAND...WILL GO LOWER 
WITH THE TUESDAY MAX TEMP ACROSS THE AREA...ESPECIALLY SOUTH WHERE 
THERE SHOULD BE NO SUN ALL DAY.

ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA. GOOD COOLING CONDITIONS SETTING UP FOR EARLY 
TONIGHT. SOME ISOLATED PATCHES OF FROST ARE POSSIBLE BUT COVERAGE 
AND DURATION APPEAR TOO BRIEF TO MEET ADVISORY CRITERIA. SOME HIGH 
CLOUDS RIDING BETWEEN UPPER RIDGE TO THE WEST AND TROUGH TO THE NE 
WILL STREAM ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY. 
THIS WILL ALSO HINDER FROST DEVELOPMENT. TEMPERATURES WARM TO ABOVE 
NORMAL THURSDAY AFTERNOON.   
 
.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/... A QUICK MOVING 
SHORTWAVE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY WILL BRING SOME SHOWERS AND 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS TO THE REGION FROM 06-15Z ON FRIDAY...BEFORE 
RAPIDLY CLEARING THE REGION FROM WEST TO EAST BY THE EARLY 
AFTERNOON. RIDGING WILL QUICKLY BUILD IN FOR LATE FRIDAY INTO THE 
WEEKEND AND RESULT IN A NICE WARM-UP...ALONG WITH AMPLE SUNSHINE AS 
HIGHS RETURN TO THE UPPER 70S AND LOWER 80S. A FEW SPOTS COULD EVEN 
REACH THE MID 80S BY SUNDAY. 

A DEEPENING UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL SHIFT FROM THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. THIS WILL BRING THE POTENTIAL FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...WITH SOME SEVERE WEATHER POSSIBLE MONDAY 
EVENING AND NIGHT. THE LATEST RUN OF THE GFS HAS COME NICELY IN LINE 
WITH THE ECMWF WITH THE TIMING AND TRACK OF THE UPPER LOW. GIVEN THE 
MOISTURE AND SOME INSTABILITY IN PLACE DURING THE AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING /COMBINED WITH SOME FAVORABLE SHEAR/...SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL CERTAINLY BE POSSIBLE. THE LATEST GUIDANCE SUGGESTS A SQUALL 
LINE /WITH SUPERCELLS AHEAD OF IT/ MAY DEVELOP WELL TO THE WEST 
ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY DURING THE DAY. AS THESE STORMS MOVE 
EAST INTO MIDDLE TENNESSEE THEY MAY CONGEAL INTO MORE OF A LINE OF 
STORMS...POTENTIALLY MOVING INTO THE PLATEAU AND FORECAST AREA LATE 
MONDAY EVENING AND NIGHT. DAMAGING THUNDERSTORMS WINDS APPEARS TO BE 
THE PRIMARY THREAT...BUT A LOT WILL HINGE ON THE EXACT TIMING OF THE 
STORMS AND HOW MUCH INSTABILITY IS AVAILABLE. PRECIPITATION CHANCES 
WILL PERSIST INTO TUESDAY AND THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK AS THE UPPER 
LOW GRADUALLY PUSHES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. THIS WILL ALSO RESULT IN 
MUCH COOLER TEMPERATURES TO KICK OFF MAY...WITH HIGHS INTO THE UPPER 
50S TO MID 60S.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES WAS CONTINUING TO MOVE EAST THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EXTENDING OUT OF IT A WEAK COLD FRONT THAT HAD MOVED 
INTO THE EASTERN OH VALLEY AND WAS DIFFUSE ACROSS CENTRAL TN AND 
THEN EXTENDED SOUTHWEST INTO CENTRAL LA. AIR MASS WAS BECOMING 
SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE OVER THE FORECAST AREA BUT ACTIVITY WAS BECOMING 
WIDELY SCATTERED. MORE CONCENTRATED SHOWERS WERE FORMING NEAR
CHATTANOOGA AND TO THE WEST. RAINFALL AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN MOSTLY ONE
TENTH OF AN INCH OR LESS SO FAR TODAY AND ONLY ABOUT ONE TENTH AS
AN AVERAGE IS EXPECTED THROUGH 00Z OR SHORTLY AFTER SUNSET TONIGHT.
TEMPERATURES WERE VARIED IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S WHERE
SHOWERS WERE OCCURRING TO MID 60S TO LOWER 70S ELSEWHERE. STILL
COULD SEE A THUNDERSTORM OR TWO ESPECIALLY SOUTHERN SECTIONS
THROUGH EARLY EVENING. OTHERWISE SKIES CLEARING THIS EVENING THEN
SUNNY AND COOL AGAIN WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES TONIGHT COULD DIP
BELOW 40 FOR A FEW HOURS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA
AND EASTERN TN BUT NO SIGNIFICANT FROST EXPECTED. WITH SOME COLD
AIR ADVECTION WEDNESDAY IT WILL BE BREEZY AND RELATIVE HUMIDITY
VALUES MAY DROP TO 20 TO 25 PERCENT BY LATE AFTERNOON. WILL
HEADLINE LOW RH AND GUSTY WINDS IN THE FIRE WEATHER FORECAST AND
MAY NEED A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT ISSUED EARLY WEDNESDAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN 
FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A PROGRESSIVE PATTERN THROUGH 
EARLY NEXT WEEK. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING...BRINGING 
SCATTERED CONVECTION INTO THE FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF IT. THIS COLD
FRONT SHOULD THEN STALL OUT OVER THE DEEP SOUTH ON SATURDAY...AS
THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES ZONAL AND PARALLEL TO THE FRONTAL
BOUNDARY. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS THEN PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT
NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT ON SUNDAY... AND MAY LINGER SOMEWHERE
AROUND THE TN RIVER VALLEY THROUGH MONDAY WITH A PROLONGED PERIOD
OF CONVECTION POSSIBLE OVER THE FORECAST AREA. A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN U.S. IS THEN PROGGED TO FURTHER AMPLIFY
OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON MONDAY...AND WILL SLOWLY DRIFT EASTWARD
EARLY NEXT WEEK...DEVELOPING A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE
LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY. GFS AND ECMWF MODELS DIFFER SOMEWHAT ON THE
EXACT TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM...BUT BOTH MODELS AGREE THAT IT WILL
BRING STRONG DYNAMICS AND MODERATE INSTABILITY OVER THE FORECAST
AREA EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF AN OUTBREAK OF SEVERE
STORMS. THUS...WILL BEGIN TO MENTION THIS POSSIBILITY IN THE
HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...ANOTHER MOSTLY SUNNY DAY 
ACROSS THE EASTERN TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH 
TEMPERATURES IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S. DEW POINTS HAD FALLEN INTO THE 
30S TO MID 40S. RH VALUES WERE AS LOW AS AROUND 20 TO 25 PERCENT IN 
SW VA SO FAR ABOUT 5 PERCENT HIGHER THAN SUNDAY. WINDS WERE MOSTLY 
ABOUT 5 TO 10 MPH OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST OR SOUTH WITH A FEW HIGHER 
GUSTS. CLOUDS TO THE WEST WERE THICKENING UP AND EXPECT THESE TO 
MOVE OVER WESTERN SECTIONS THIS EVENING. PRECIPITATION WAS AS CLOSE 
AS THE LOWER OH VALLEY IN EXTREME WESTERN KY. 

UPPER LEVEL TROUGH TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST MOVES SLOWLY EAST 
OVERNIGHT AND INTO THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY WITH SHOWERS AND A 
POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORM. WEAK FRONT TO APPROACH IN THE MORNING AND BE 
THROUGH ENTIRE AREA BY 00Z WEDNESDAY. RAINFALL AMOUNTS ONLY AROUND 
ONE QUARTER TO ONE HALF MAINLY DAYTIME HOURS TUESDAY. MODELS HAVE 
INCREASED RH VALUES BRINGING HIGHER DEW POINTS IN QUICKER THAN WHAT 
HAS HAPPENED EACH DAY SO WILL KEEP CURRENT DEW POINTS LOW THROUGH 
ABOUT 00Z TONIGHT. LOWERED DEW POINTS TUESDAY AS WELL. BUMPED LOWS 
UP A FEW DEGREES WEST TONIGHT WITH INCREASED CLOUDS. HIGHS TUESDAY 
NEAR GUIDANCE OF UPPER 60S TO MID 70S AS THERE WILL BE LITTLE COLD 
AIR ADVECTION WITH FRONT UNTIL TUESDAY NIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A PROGRESSIVE PATTERN THROUGH EARLY 
NEXT WEEK. AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...BRINGING TRANQUIL CONDITIONS 
AND A WARMING TREND. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE 
ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY LATE THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY MORNING... 
BRINGING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND TSTORMS. THIS COLD FRONT SHOULD 
THEN STALL OUT OVER THE DEEP SOUTH ON SATURDAY...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL 
FLOW BECOMES ZONAL AND PARALLEL TO THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THIS 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD THEN MOVE NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT ON 
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...AS A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE 
WESTERN U.S. FURTHER AMPLIFIES OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS DEEP 
UPPER TROUGH IS THEN PROGGED TO BRING A STRONG AND SLOW-MOVING LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY. THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS DIFFER SOMEWHAT ON THE EXACT 
TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM...BUT RIGHT NOW...BOTH MODELS GENERALLY AGREE 
THAT IT WILL BRING STRONG DYNAMICS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH THE 
POSSIBILITY OF ORGANIZED SEVERE STORMS FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS FOR

.DISCUSSION...HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES OVER THE EASTERN STATES
TODAY WITH WEAK FRONT FROM THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE SOUTHERN
PLAINS. TEMPERATURES WARMING A LITTLE FASTER THEN FORECAST BUT
INCREASED CLOUDINESS THIS AFTERNOON MAY SLOW WARMING SOME.
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE 60S AREA WIDE AND SHOULD REACH THE MID 70S
TO NEAR 80 BY MID AFTERNOON. DEW POINTS ARE IN THE LOWER 30S NE TO
LOWER 40S SOUTH AND WEST. CURRENT RELATIVE HUMIDITIES ARE MOSTLY
FROM 40 TO 50 PERCENT EXCEPT BELOW 40 PERCENT IN PARTS OF SW VA.
VALUES OVER VA ARE ABOUT 5 PERCENT HIGHER THEN THEY WERE YESTERDAY
AT THIS TIME. LOW AFTERNOON RELATIVE HUMIDITIES WILL CONTINUE IN
THE NE SECTIONS DOWN TO AROUND 20 PERCENT BUT MODELS TRY TO
INCREASE MOISTURE LATER IN THE DAY. NASHVILLES SOUNDING IS NOT AS
DRY AS YESTERDAY BUT STILL SOME DRY AIR BETWEEN 600 AND 800 MB. NO
CHANGES TO CURRENT FORECAST ALTHOUGH UPDATED HOURLY TEMPERATURE AND
DEW POINT GRIDS TO MATCH CURRENT CONDITIONS.

400 AM EDT MON APR 21 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA TODAY 
WILL BREAK DOWN AS AN UPPER TROUGH MOVES IN TONIGHT. A COLD FRONT 
WILL BE APPROACHING LATE IN THE PERIOD. WILL SEE VARYING AMOUNTS OF 
MAINLY HIGH CLOUDS TODAY...BUT STILL QUITE A BIT OF SUNSHINE WITH A 
WARM AFTERNOON.  CLOUDS WILL INCREASE TONIGHT AND SOME SHOWERS WILL 
BE AROUND...ESPECIALLY NORTH AND WEST. WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE TO 
CHANCE POPS. INSTABILITY LOOKS QUITE WEAK...SO NO THUNDER INCLUDED 
AT THIS TIME. WILL MAKE ONLY A FEW MINOR TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS FOR THE 
SHORT TERM.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A COUPLE OF RELATIVELY 
INSIGNIFICANT SHORT WAVE FEATURES WITH WEAK FRONTAL SYSTEMS WILL 
AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE WEEK WHILE ANOTHER SYSTEM 
APPROACHES LATE IN THE UPCOMING WEEKEND. THE FIRST UPPER TROUGH 
MOVES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON TUESDAY BRINGING SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND EVEN SOME THUNDER. ALTHOUGH THE THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD BE 
MORE GARDEN VARIETY IN NATURE WITH ONLY WEAK INSTABILITY AND LIMITED 
SHEAR INDICATED IN THE MODELS. THE WEDNESDAY THROUGH DAYTIME PERIOD 
THURSDAY STILL LOOKS DRY WITH AN AMPLIFIED UPPER RIDGE BUILDING IN 
ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. ANOTHER WEAK UPPER TROUGH PRESSES EAST 
ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION THURSDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY. A WEAK COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY EDGES SOUTHEAST FROM THE OHIO 
VALLEY LATE THURSDAY NIGHT AND ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE 
DAY FRIDAY. THOUGHT IT BEST WITH THIS SYSTEM TO MAINTAIN HIGH CHANCE 
POPS FOR SHOWERS AND A POSSIBILITY OF THUNDER AS THE FRONT SLIDES 
SOUTHEAST DURING THE DAY FRIDAY WHILE KEEPING A LOWER CHANCE POP FOR 
FRIDAY NIGHT DUE TO EXPECTED SLOW FRONTAL MOVEMENT THROUGH THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE FINAL SYSTEM OF THE LONG TERM APPROACHES 
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON SUNDAY AND THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE 
FOR A PERIOD OF SHOWERS AS MOIST AIR IS LIFTED ALONG A WARM FRONT 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM'S MID LATITUDE CYCLONE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE AREA TODAY WILL SLOWLY SHIFT 
SOUTHEAST TONIGHT...WHILE THE MID/UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL MOVE EAST OF 
THE APPALACHIANS TOMORROW. EXPECT TO SEE HIGH CLOUDS INCREASING 
THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE 
WEST. THE NAM AND SREF PRODUCE A LITTLE AFTERNOON QPF IN THE 
NORTHERN PLATEAU...BUT IT SEEMS MORE LIKELY THAT ANY PRECIP CHANCES 
SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL AFTER 00Z AS FORECAST SOUNDINGS LOOK QUITE 
STABLE. TEMPS TOMORROW SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN TODAY WITH A 
LIGHT SW WIND...MAINLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)... MODELS CONTINUE TO 
INDICATE WEAK UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE 
FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT AND THEN PASSING THROUGH DURING THE DAY 
TUESDAY. THEN STRONG UPPER RIDGE MOVES FROM THE PLAINS STATES 
TUESDAY NIGHT TO SETTLE OVER THE SOUTHEAST AND GULF COAST WEDNESDAY 
AND THURSDAY. THE STRONGEST PART OF THIS SYSTEM TO PASS THROUGH 
GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY. LIFT AND INSTABILITY NOT THAT GREAT SO 
DON'T EXPECT MANY THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY. RAINFALL AMOUNTS WITHOUT 
MUCH ORGANIZED CONVECTION WILL NOT BE THAT HIGH EITHER...ONLY ABOUT 
ONE QUARTER TO ONE HALF INCH. 

UPPER RIDGING BRINGS WARM TEMPERATURES AND MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES BACK 
TO THE EAST TENNESSEE VALLEY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. A WELL 
DEVELOPED LOW PRESSURE AREA ALONG THE CANADIAN AND US BORDER AND 
COLD FRONT THAT EXTENDS TO THE SOUTH THROUGH THE PLAINS STATES MOVES 
EAST TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES THURSDAY NIGHT. WARM AIR ADVECTION TO 
INCREASE CLOUDS AND DEVELOP SHOWERS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
THURSDAY NIGHT WITH POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS. FRIDAY GOOD CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH. FRONT MAY HANG 
UP OR STALL JUST TO THE SOUTH OF TN FRIDAY NIGHT SO LEFT SMALL 
CHANCES OF A FEW STORMS AND SHOWERS OVERNIGHT. SATURDAY FORECAST 
AREA BETWEEN SYSTEMS SO GENERALLY FAIR SKIES. SUNDAY A FAST MOVING 
SYSTEM AGAIN TO AFFECT THE REGION WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS BY LATE 
IN THE DAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD IN TODAY AS 
UPPER LOW TO OUR SOUTHEAST MOVES AWAY. SHOULD BE PRECIP FREE FOR THE 
SHORT TERM PERIOD. EXPECT PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TODAY DESPITE SOME HIGH 
CLOUDS...AND A MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY NIGHT TONIGHT.  GFS MOS 
TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODEL FORECASTS RELATIVELY 
CLOSE IN DEPICTION OF EXPECTED WEATHER DURING THE LONG TERM PERIOD. 
A COUPLE OF SYSTEMS WILL AFFECT THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION WITH 
THE FIRST MOVING INTO THE AREA LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. 
STAYED WITH INCREASING CHANCE FOR SHOWERS...MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT 
MONDAY NIGHT WITH THE BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN DURING THE DAY TUESDAY 
JUST AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT. MODELS INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF WEAK 
INSTABILITY WITH THIS SYSTEM SO KEPT THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST. 
THE FRONT STILL APPEARS TO MOVE OUT OF THE REGION BY TUESDAY EVENING 
WITH DRY ADVECTION AND SUBSIDENCE BUILDING IN WITH AN AMPLIFIED 
UPPER RIDGE ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. THE NEXT UPPER TROUGH AND 
ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE EASTERN U.S. LATER THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. MAINTAINED A GOOD CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WITH THIS FEATURE DURING THE DAY FRIDAY. THERE IS SOME 
UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING HOW QUICKLY THE FRONT ADVANCES SOUTHEAST 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AS THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMES ALIGNED 
PARALLEL TO THE FRONT LATER IN THE DAY FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. 
THEREFORE HELD ONTO LOW CHANCE POPS THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT 
SHOULD BE SOUTH OF THE REGION BY SATURDAY ALLOWING FOR A PLEASANT 
END TO THE WEEK COMPLETE WITH SUNSHINE AND MILD TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
ACCORDING TO PROJECTIONS BY OUR LOCAL WRF MODEL AND THE HRRR...LIGHT 
PRECIP OVER OUR SE COUNTIES WILL GRADUALLY TAPER OFF THROUGH 00Z. 
WILL KEEP A CHANCE POP SOUTHEAST IN UNTIL MIDNIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR 
THE POTENTIAL FOR A SLOWER EXIT. THE CLOSED UPPER LOW TRACKS EAST 
TONIGHT...AND CLOUDS SHOULD BE ON THE DECREASE AS WELL. MOST SPOTS 
WILL SEE LOW IN THE 40S...AND SKIES SHOULD BE CLEAR BY SUNRISE. 
SUNDAY WILL BE MILD AND SUNNY WITH A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVERHEAD.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
MODELS SLOWING EARLY WEEK SYSTEM NOW STILL MORE. RIDGING ALOFT OUT
AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM WILL KEEP HIGH PRESSURE WITH WARM AIR MASS IN
PLACE THROUGH MOST OF MONDAY. REMOVED POPS MONDAY. TEMPERATURES 40S
TO LOWER 50S SUNDAY NIGHT WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. MONDAY HIGH
LEVEL CLOUDINESS INCREASES BUT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE DOES NOT RETURN
UNTIL MONDAY NIGHT. LEAD SHORTWAVE MONDAY NIGHT PRODUCES A FEW
SHOWERS BUT MUCH OF THE PRECIPITATION HOLDS OFF UNTIL TUESDAY. WEAK
FRONT PASSES THROUGH THEN BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON. DRYING MOVES IN
QUICKLY TUESDAY NIGHT. THEN HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE DOWN FROM THE
UPPER MIDWEST AND MS VALLEY AND RESIDE OVER THE TN VALLEY THROUGH
THURSDAY FOR A COUPLE MOSTLY SUNNY WARM DAYS AND COOL NIGHTS. UPPER
LEVEL RIDGING SHIFTS EAST THURSDAY NIGHT AS NEXT FRONTAL SYSTEM
MOVES INTO MS AND TN VALLEYS. MAIN SURFACE LOW STAYS NORTH ALONG
CANADIAN BORDER FRIDAY. MODELS BRING FAST MOVING FRONT THROUGH
FRIDAY. KEPT POPS FRIDAY NIGHT AS WOUND UP UPPER LOW TRACKS
SOUTHEAST THROUGH OH VALLEY. WRAP AROUND SHOWERS AND STORMS COULD
AFFECT AREA OVERNIGHT. NE AREAS COULD GET A FEW MORE SHOWERS
SATURDAY MORNING. INSTABILITY NOT THAT GREAT MONDAY NIGHT AND
TUESDAY BUT KEPT MENTION OF THUNDER IN. THUNDERSTORMS A BETTER BET
WITH FRONT FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AN UPPER LOW CENTERED OVER THE 
FLORIDA PANHANDLE WILL SLOWLY TRANSLATE INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC 
LATER TONIGHT. UNTIL THEN UNSETTLED WEATHER WILL PERSIST GENERALLY 
ALONG THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS TODAY AND AT LEAST FOR THE FIRST 
HALF OF THE NIGHT. THE BEST RAIN CHANCES WILL OCCUR OVER SOUTHWEST 
NORTH CAROLINA AND THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE MOUNTAINS IN E TN. SOME 
OF THIS LIGHT PRECIP MAY EXTEND A LITTLE FARTHER WEST. WHATEVER DOES 
FALL WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS WILL AMOUNT TO A FEW 
HUNDREDTHS OR LESS. CLOUD COVER WILL BE THICKEST OVER EASTERN 
PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA WHILE OPAQUE CIRRUS WILL BE OVER THE 
WESTERN HALF. THIS IS WHERE DAYTIME TEMPERATURES WILL BE THE 
WARMEST...GENERALLY AROUND 70 DEGREES. OVERNIGHT LOWS FOR EASTER

COVER IS SLIGHTLY THICKER.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODEL FORECASTS NOT TOO 
DISSIMILAR THROUGH MOST OF THE PERIOD EXCEPT AT THE END WHERE THE 
ECMWF IS QUICKER TO MOVE A FRONTAL SYSTEM ACROSS THE REGION. STAYED 
CLOSER TO THE SLOWER GFS CONCERNING THIS FEATURE. STILL EXPECTING A 
PLEASANT SUNDAY WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE IN THE WAKE OF THE 
DEPARTING UPPER LOW. EDGED POPS BACK IN TIME ON MONDAY APPLYING JUST 
A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM ON THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU DURING THE AFTERNOON FOR THE POSSIBILITY THE PASSAGE OF A 
WEAK UPPER WAVE THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY. INCREASING PROBABILITY OF 
PRECIPITATION STILL IN THE WORKS FOR MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY AS 
MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIR ADVANCES AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT DUE IN THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING. 
USED A LIKELY POP FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE BIG FRONTAL 
PUSH WITH DECREASING POPS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. IT LOOKS LIKE THERE 
WILL BE A NICE RIDGE PATTERN FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH A 
MODEST WARMING TREND WHICH WILL RESULT IN HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE 
UPPER 70S BY THURSDAY. ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL 
SYSTEM BUILD INTO THE REGION FRIDAY AFTERNOON INTO FRIDAY NIGHT 
(STAYED CLOSER TO THE SLOWER GFS CONCEPT HERE) WITH MODELS 
INDICATING SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION 
WITH THE FRONT. WENT WITH MEDIUM CHANCE POP FOR THE DAYTIME PERIOD 
FRIDAY WHILE ADJUSTING TO HIGH CHANCE FOR FRIDAY NIGHT WHEN FRONT 
SWEEPS ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS.

CATEGORICAL POPS IN CLAY COUNTY NC TO NO POPS IN THE COUNTIES 
BORDERING THE PLATEAU. MODELS ARE IN BETTER AGREEMENT TODAY WITH THE 
WESTWARD EXTENT OF PRECIP...WITH VERY LITTLE IN THE VALLEY. WILL 
HAVE JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE BLEEDING INTO CHA-TYS-TRI TONIGHT AND 
SATURDAY. THE CLOSED LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW TO MOVE

SPREAD OF MOISTURE EAST FROM THIS SYSTEM MONDAY WITH SHOWERS
STARTING AS SOON AS MONDAY MORNING. CANADIAN/UKMET AND ECMWF SLOW
SYSTEM DOWN WITH APPROACH MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. KEPT SLIGHT
CHANCE SHOWERS MONDAY AFTERNOON BUT BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE WITH FRONT TUESDAY.

SURFACE HIGH AND RIDGE ALOFT BUILD BACK IN TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
THURSDAY. NEW SYSTEM MOVING INTO THE PACIFIC NW TUESDAY CROSSES THE

WEDNESDAY NIGHT EARLY THURSDAY WITH A POSSIBLE WARM FRONT. MAIN 
FRONT TO MOVE ACROSS THE PLAINS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. THE 
BULK OF THE WEATHER STAYS ACROSS THE NORTHERN STATES UNTIL THURSDAY 
NIGHT. DEEPENING SURFACE LOW OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS THEN INDUCES 
FRONTAL DEVELOPMENT INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND MS VALLEY THURSDAY

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER TROUGH TO OUR WEST WILL DIG 
SOUTHEAST AND CUT OFF...WITH SURFACE LOW OVER THE GULF TRACKING 
ACROSS FLORIDA.  BEST FORCING AND MOISTURE SHOULD STAY TO OUR SOUTH 
AND EAST...ALTHOUGH SOME MODEL DIFFERENCES WITH HANDLING OF THIS 
STILL EXIST WITH THE GFS STILL WANTING TO THROW MORE PRECIP WEST OF 
THE MOUNTAINS.  WILL LEAN MORE TOWARD AN ECMWF/NAM/SREF BLEND AND 
CARRY SIGNIFICANT POPS ALONG THE MOUNTAINS BUT MINIMAL POPS TO THE 
WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS FOR LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT.  PRECIP AMOUNTS 
NOT EXPECTED TO BE VERY HIGH...AND NO THUNDER EXPECTED GIVEN LACK OF 
INSTABILITY.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE OVERALL SO WILL STAY CLOSE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODEL SOLUTIONS NOT TOO FAR 
APART ON EXPECTED WEATHER THROUGH MOST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. ON 
SATURDAY THE NORTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO UPPER LOW DRIFTS EVER SO 
SLOWLY EAST ACROSS NORTHERN FLORIDA INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC BY 12Z 
SUNDAY. MAINTAINED A TIGHT POP GRADIENT FOR SHOWERS OVER THE CREST 
OF THE APPALACHIANS BUT SLOWED THE DEPARTURE OF THE SHOWER ACTION BY 
A FEW HOURS. WOULD EXPECT RISING MOTION ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE 
MOUNTAINS WITH SINKING MOTION WEST. THEREFORE...VERY LITTLE IF ANY 
CHANCE OF RAIN OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH THIS FEATURE. 
RIDGING FILLS IN BEHIND THE DEPARTING LOW FOR SUNDAY AND THEN WEAK 
SHORT WAVE ENERGY BUILDS NORTHEAST THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY PERHAPS 
GENERATING A SHOWER OR TWO ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS. NOT A GREAT DEAL 
OF CONFIDENCE IN THIS SYSTEM GENERATING RAIN SO KEPT POPS RATHER 
LOW. THE BETTER CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY 
WHEN A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION. RAISED POPS TO HIGH 
CHANCE WITH A POSSIBILITY OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DUE TO 
PROGGED INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THE FRONT. MORE RIDGING BUILDS IN 
BEHIND THIS SYSTEM WITH MOSTLY DRY ADVECTION SO WAS ABLE TO KEEP 
PRECIPITATION OUT OF THE FORECAST THROUGH THE END OF THE LONG TERM

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
AS A TROUGH CROSSES THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...CYCLOGENESIS WILL COMMENCE 
TONIGHT JUST OFF THE MS DELTA. CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT NEAR THE FL 
PANHANDLE WILL LIKELY CUT OFF THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FEED TONIGHT 
AND FRIDAY MORNING...KEEPING OUR AREA DRY. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODELS IN THEIR QPF DEPICTIONS OVER OUR AREA 
FRIDAY/FRIDAY NIGHT. THE GFS GENERATES MASSIVE FRONTOGENESIS ALONG 
THE MTNS...AND TRACKS THE LOW FARTHER NORTH INTO GA. THE 
NAM...SREF...AND ECMWF DO NOT SHOW THE STRONG FRONTOGENESIS AND KEEP 
THE LOW OVER FL...AND THE QPF WELL TO OUR EAST. A DOWNSLOPE WIND 
COMPONENT COULD ALSO PLAY A ROLE IN KEEPING THE VALLEY DRY. WILL 
LEAN TOWARD THE DRIER MODEL SOLUTION IN THE VALLEY AND PLATEAU...BUT 
WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS IN SW NC AND THE MOUNTAINS TO MAINTAIN SOME 
POP/QPF CONTINUITY WITH NEIGHBORING OFFICES. TEMPERATURES FRIDAY 
WILL BE TRICKY DEPENDING ON CLOUD COVER...GENERALLY STAYED NEAR A 
BLEND OF NAM/GFS MOS FOR HIGHS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD LOW PRESSURE MOVES ACROSS FLORIDA
PANHANDLE INTO ATLANTIC SATURDAY. FORECAST AREA MOSTLY WEST OF RAIN
AREA THAT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHEAST. A FEW SHOWERS EARLY
SATURDAY SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA WITH CLOUDS ALONG THE EASTERN
BORDER. THEN HIGHER PRESSURE TO BUILD IN SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY
FOR MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND WARMER TEMPERATURES. GFS MODEL MUCH
FARTHER NORTH WITH MOISTURE SHIELD SO PREFER NAM/ECMWF WHICH KEEPS
THE DEEP MOISTURE ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS SATURDAY AND
SATURDAY NIGHT. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT THEN
INCREASING CLOUDS MONDAY. LATE MONDAY INTO TUESDAY A WEAK SYSTEM TO
AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA. SHOWERS TO DEVELOP MONDAY AND MONDAY
NIGHT AND A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY AFTERNOON WITH
SOME INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. TEMPERATURES MAY BE
HINDERED SOME BY CLOUD COVER SATURDAY BUT STILL NEAR NORMAL AND
THEN WILL WARM SLIGHTLY SUNDAY WITH MORE SUNSHINE. FOR MONDAY
THROUGH WEDNESDAY TEMPERATURES STAY AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL AS
WEAK FRONT TUESDAY WILL HAVE LITTLE COOLING AFFECT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FOR THE NEAR-TERM...TEMPERATURES
ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA HAVE BEEN HIGHER THAN FORECAST DUE TO
EASTERLY WINDS. THIS MAY LIMIT FREEZE/FROST EXTENT EARLY THIS
MORNING...BUT SOME AREAS WILL REACH CRITERIA...SO WILL MAINTAIN
HEADLINES AS IS.

A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS TODAY. AIRMASS REMAINS QUITE DRY WITH VERY LOW
RELATIVE AFTERNOON HUMIDITIES ANTICIPATED. UPPER FLOW IS
SOUTHWESTERLY WHICH WILL ADVECT AREAS OF CIRRUS AND CIRRO-STRATUS
CLOUDS THROUGH TONIGHT.

TEMPERATURES WILL DROP INTO THE MIDDLE AND UPPER 30S AGAIN TONIGHT
ACROSS THE NORTHEAST AREAS...BUT INCREASING HIGH AND SOME MID-LEVEL
CLOUDS WILL LIMIT FROST DEVELOPMENT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND 
REVEAL TWO WEAK COLD FRONTS AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE 
FRIDAY/FRIDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY NIGHT/TUESDAY TIME PERIODS. MOISTURE 
IS EXPECTED TO BE LIMITED WITH THE FIRST COLD FRONT ON FRIDAY/FRIDAY 
NIGHT...MAINLY DUE TO A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE FL 
PANHANDLE AND SOUTHERN GA WHICH WILL LIKELY CUT OFF THE NORTHWARD 
FLOW OF MOISTURE INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO. 
LATEST MODEL RUNS NOW INDICATE THAT THE SECOND COLD FRONT FOR EARLY 
NEXT WEEK WILL BE SLOWER...AND SHOULD NOT MOVE INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA UNTIL TUESDAY. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS 
SECOND COLD FRONT WILL HAVE MORE MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH IT OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA...WITH SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY ALSO DEVELOPING 
AHEAD OF IT. THUS...WILL MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF TSTORMS ON

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
NO CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO THE CURRENT FROST/FREEZE ADVISORY/WARNING 
PRODUCTS THIS AFTERNOON. IT STILL LOOKS LIKE TEMPERATURES WILL FALL 
BELOW FREEZING IN NE TN/SW VA...MOUNTAINS...AND SW NC AREAS FOR A 
FEW HOURS. THE REST OF THE TN VALLEY AND PLATEAU WILL BE CLOSE TO 
FREEZING FOR A BRIEF PERIOD...AND WILL REMAIN IN A FROST ADVISORY.

HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER OH/PA TODAY WILL BE SHIFTING EAST 
TONIGHT AND OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST BY TOMORROW. A RIDGE AXIS WILL 
EXTEND SW ACROSS THE CAROLINAS...WHICH WILL GIVE A MORE SOUTHERLY 
WIND COMPONENT IN THE TN VALLEY. THIS SHOULD MEAN WARMER 
TEMPERATURES FOR THE AREA...REACHING THE LOWER TO MID 60S. LEANED ON 
THE COOL SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE BASED ON THE LACK OF WARMING WE HAVE 
SEEN SO FAR TODAY. THERE MAY BE SOME HIGH CLOUDS BUILDING IN THROUGH 
THE DAY AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING TROUGH/JET...BUT IT SHOULD HAVE 
LITTLE IMPACT.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
THERE ARE TWO SYSTEMS OF CONCERN DURING THE EXTENDED. THIS FIRST
SYSTEM WILL BRING A WEAKENING COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA ON FRIDAY.

313 AM EDT WED APR 16 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MAIN CONCERNS WILL BE VERY LOW
AFTERNOON RELATIVE HUMDITIES AND FREEZE AND FROST CONDITIONS FOR
TONIGHT.

A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS WITH A VERY DRY AIRMASS IN PLACE. AFTERNOON RELATIVE
HUMIDITIES WILL DROP INTO THE TEENS MOST LOCATIONS FOR TODAY AND
THURSDAY.

PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TODAY WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM
QUICKLY...ESPECIALLY SINCE THE AIRMASS IS QUITE DRY. LIKEWISE...
DRY AIR-MASS AND LIGHT/CALM WINDS...EXCEPT ACROSS THE RIDGE
TOPS...WHERE SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL RETURN. MOST VALLEYS AND
SHELTERED AREAS WILL SEE GOOD RADITIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS TONIGHT
ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO FALL BELOW FREEZING ACROSS THE NORTHEAST
AREAS...FAR EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. AREAS
OF FROST IS EXPECTED AREA-WIDE. HAVE ISSUED FREEZE WARNING/FROST
ADVISORIES FOR TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A QUIET PATTERN THROUGH EARLY NEXT 
WEEK WITH TWO WEAK COLD FRONT AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA. THE FIRST 
COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY 
NIGHT...WITH THE SECOND COLD FRONT AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA ON 
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. THE FIRST COLD FRONT IS NOT EXPECTED TO 
HAVE MUCH MOISTURE WITH IT OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY...MAINLY DUE TO 
A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHEAST WHICH THE MODELS 
INDICATE WILL CUT OFF THE NORTHWARD FLOW OF MOISTURE FROM THE GULF 
OF MEXICO. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS INDICATE THAT THE SECOND 
COLD FRONT ON MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT WILL HAVE MORE MOISTURE ASSOCIATED 
WITH IT OVER THE FORECAST AREA...AND WILL ALSO HAVE SOME MARGINAL 
INSTABILITY DEVELOPING AHEAD OF IT. THUS...WILL MENTION THE 
POSSIBILITY OF TSTORMS WITH THIS SECOND COLD FRONT. AS FOR TEMPS... 
WILL GENERALLY TREND COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE 
ENSEMBLE MEANS.

1100 AM EDT TUE APR 15 2014

.DISCUSSION...CHILLY AIR STREAMING INTO THE REGION LATE THIS 
MORNING. THE COLD AIR...STRONG NORTHERLY FLOW AND LIGHT RAIN IS 
MAKING IT FEEL RATHER RAW OUT THERE TODAY. THE BACK EDGE OF THE RAIN 
SHIELD IS MIXING WITH AND CHANGING TO SNOW MAINLY IMPACTING HIGHER 
TERRAIN. WENT AHEAD AND JUST MIXED IN A BIT OF SNOW WITH THE RAIN 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE NORTH HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA AS NEGATIVE SEVEN 
TO NEGATIVE EIGHT DEGREE AIR SPILLS INTO THE REGION AT 85H. STILL 
COULD SEE ACCUMULATION AROUND ONE INCH ABOVE 3500 FEET. DON'T EXPECT 
MUCH IN THE WAY OF ACCUMULATION BELOW THIS ELEVATION ALTHOUGH THERE 
COULD BE A DUSTING ON THE GRASS OVER THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS THE AFTERNOON PROGRESSES. ADJUSTED THE 
HOURLY TEMPERATURE CURVE BACK SEVERAL DEGREES FOR THE AFTERNOON WITH 
STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION CONTINUING BEHIND THE FRONT. TAPERED 
PRECIP OFF FROM WEST TO EAST THROUGH 00Z WEDNESDAY ACCORDING TO 
MODEL SOLUTION.

422 AM EDT TUE APR 15 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT)...MAIN RAINS HAVE STAYED WELL 
SOUTH...SO WILL FOCUS MAINLY ON THE POST-FRONTAL TEMPERATURES AND 
WIND.

UPGRADING TO FREEZE WARNING FOR TONIGHT FOR ENTIRE AREA. CHATTANOOGA 
AIRPORT MAY ONLY GET TO 30-32 DEGREES WITH WIND BLOWING ACROSS CITY 
HEAT ISLAND...BUT OTHER PARTS OF THE SUBURBS WILL LIKELY GO DOWN 
INTO THE UPPER 20S...SO THINK WARNING FOR EVEN SOUTHERN AREAS LOOKS 
GOOD.

AS THE COLD AIR POURS INTO THE REGION...WIND CHILL VALUES THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING WILL BE IN THE 30S IN THE VALLEY AND IN THE 
20S IN THE MOUNTAINS.  TIMING NOT VERY GOOD FOR SNOW...NOT MUCH 
MOISTURE LEFT AROUND BY THE TIME THE COLDER AIR HITS.  WILL HAVE 
SOME FLURRIES MENTIONED IN THE MOUNTAINS THIS EVENING...BUT NO 
ACCUMULATION INCLUDED.

WILL GO WITH A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE PLATEAU AND EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS...AS WELL AS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY WHERE THE PRESSURE 
GRADIENT WILL BE TIGHTER.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
PRODUCE ANOTHER GOOD NIGHT OF RADIATIONAL COOLING WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS SHELTERED VALLEYS. MIN TEMPERATURES WILL 
DROP INTO THE UPPER 20S AND LOWER 30S ACROSS MUCH OF SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE...FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND 
CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES OF NORTH CAROLINA. WILL ISSUE A FREEZE 
WATCH FOR THESE AREAS FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY MORNING.

A LESS AMPLIFIED UPPER FLOW PATTERN CAN BE EXPECTED FOR MOST OF THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD WITH A SERIES OF FAIRLY FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVE 
EJECTING ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY 
FOR THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. SURFACE RIDGING INTO THE 
GULF OF MEXICO THIS WEEK WILL LIMIT NORTHWARD MOISTURE RETURN. THE 
LIMITED BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS STAYING GENERALLY NORTH 
OF THE AREA WILL KEEP CHANCES OF RAIN IN LOW CHANCE VARIETY WITH 
BEST CHANCES NORTH AND MOUNTAINS

NEXT AREA OF INTEREST WILL BE DEVELOPING CYCLOGENESIS OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS AS ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE EJECT EASTWARD. THE GFS AND 
ECMWF DISAGREE ON EVOLUTION OF THIS WAVE WITH THE ECMWF A LITTLE 
STRONGER. WILL INCLUDE CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
MONDAY...BUT OVERALL MODELS ONLY DEPICT A FAIRLY WEAK WAVE FOR NOW.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
310 PM EDT MON APR 14 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...COLD FRONT IS MAKING 
PROGRESS THROUGH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON AND WILL MOVE 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATER THIS EVENING. MODEL INSTABILITY NOT 
TERRIBLY IMPRESSIVE AHEAD OF THE BOUNDARY SO USED CHANCE TYPE 
WORDING FOR CONVECTION IN THE CATEGORICAL POP ENVIRONMENT. THE MASS 
OF SHOWERS WILL ADVANCE SLOWLY ACROSS THE REGION WITH THE HIGHLY 
AMPLIFIED TRAILING UPPER TROUGH. BASICALLY HAVE THE RAIN ENDING 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA BY MID DAY BUT 
CONTINUING A LITTLE WHILE LONGER ACROSS THE EASTERN SECTION. MUCH 
COLDER AIR SPILLS IN BEHIND THE FRONT. MAX TEMPS WILL PROBABLY BE 
DURING THE MORNING AS STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION CONTINUES THROUGH 
THE DAY. THE TEMPERATURE PROFILE WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR A PERIOD OF 
SNOW SHOWERS AT ELEVATIONS ABOVE 4000 FT TUESDAY AFTERNOON. BY 
EVENING...THE SNOW SHOWERS WILL TAPER OFF ACROSS THE HIGHEST PEAKS 
IN THE SMOKIES. DON'T EXPECT MUCH MORE THAN AN INCH IN THESE AREAS. 
ATTENTION THEN TURNS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A HARD FREEZE TUESDAY 
NIGHT AS SKIES CLEAR AND WIND SPEED DROPS. MAINTAINED THE FREEZE 
WATCH TO HIGHLIGHT THIS POSSIBILITY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL HAVE 
MOVED IN BY WEDNESDAY BEHIND THE DEPARTED LONG WAVE TROUGH. 
WEDNESDAY'S HIGHS SHOULD BE ROUGHLY 10 TO 12 DEGREES WARMER THAN 
TUESDAY'S WITH TEMPS RANGING FROM THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S...WHICH 
WILL STILL BE AROUND 8 DEGREES BELOW AVERAGE. BELOW AVERAGE HIGHS ON 
WEDNESDAY...COMBINED WITH CALM AND CLEAR CONDITIONS ON WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...WILL LEAD TO POSSIBLE FROST ACROSS SOME OF THE NORTHERN 
AREAS. THE MAIN AREAS OF CONCERN WILL LOOK TO BE FROM KNOXVILLE 
NORTH BUT MORE SO ACROSS NETN AND ESPECIALLY FOR SWVA. HIGH PRESSURE 
CONTINUES FOR THURSDAY AND WILL NOW BE TO OUR EAST...RESULTING IN A 
A RETURN TO A MORE SOUTHERLY FLOW. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR TEMPS TO BE 
EVEN WARMER ON THURSDAY WITH HIGHS RANGING FROM THE LOW 60S TO UPPER 
60S. BY THURSDAY NIGHT WE SHOULD BE CLEAR OF ANY FROST DANGER AS 
TEMPS WILL BE IN THE UPPER 40S TOWARD CHATT...LOW TO MID 40S FOR 
KNOX...AND MID TO UPPER 30S ACROSS THE TRI-CITIES. 

HIGH PRESSURE STARTS TO MOVE OFF TO OUR EAST ON FRIDAY AS OUR NEXT 
WEATHER SYSTEM APPROACHES. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM COMES OUT OF THE 
ROCKIES AND INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS BUT QUICKLY RACES OFF TO THE 
NORTHEAST AND INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION BY FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS MAY 
PROVIDE US WITH SOME SHOWERS THROUGH THE DAY ON FRIDAY AND INTO 
SATURDAY MORNING BUT THE CENTER OF THE LOW IS SO FAR NORTH THAT IT 
SHOULDN'T CAUSE US TOO MANY PROBLEMS OTHER THAN SOME LIGHT RAIN AND 
INCREASED CLOUD COVER. CLOUDS WILL PROBABLY HANG AROUND FOR MOST OF 
THE DAY SATURDAY BUT STARTING TO CLEAR BY LATE AFTERNOON AND INTO 
THE EVENING HOURS.

THE GFS AND ECMWF GREATLY DIFFER ON SUNDAY...GFS SHOWS A WET SUNDAY 
WHILE THE ECMWF IS DRY WITH A WEDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER US. WILL

.DISCUSSION...LEAD SHORTWAVE MAKING PROGRESS INTO THE WESTERN HALF 
OF THE VIEWING AREA THIS MORNING. RADAR REFLECTIVITY NOT REAL 
IMPRESSIVE AND SURFACE OBS REVEAL THAT THE RAIN IS QUITE LIGHT. LIFT 
WITH THIS INITIAL FEATURE IS RATHER WEAK. THE HEALTHY SOUTHERLY 85H 
FLOW ACROSS THE TERRAIN COULD REDUCE THE PRECIPITATION ACROSS 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE TO JUST A FEW DROPS OF RAIN AS THE WAVE WORKS 
EAST. THE NAM LOOKS LIKE IT HAS A PRETTY DECENT GRASP OF THE 
SITUATION WITH THE WEAK AFTERNOON SHORTWAVE FOLLOWED BY A BETTER 
CHANCE OF RAIN IN SHOWERS WITH SOME THUNDER AHEAD OF THE STRONG COLD 
FRONT. HOWEVER...THIS PRECIP DOESN'T ENTER THE WESTERN HORIZON UNTIL 
CLOSE TO 00Z TUESDAY. CURRENT POPS IN THE GRIDS ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY 
GOOD WITH THE DECREASING TREND NORTHEASTERN SECTIONS OF THE VIEWING 
AREA WITH THE MAIN EVENT AROUND 00Z TUESDAY AND LATER. NOT REAL 
CONFIDENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE'S ABILITY TO PRODUCE CONVECTION ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE SO WILL REMOVE THIS 
WORDING HERE. TEMPERATURE FORECAST WILL BE DIFFICULT WITH 
TEMPERATURES QUITE MILD THIS MORNING BUT THE MID DECK WILL KEEP 
SUNSHINE AT BAY FOR A FEW HOURS THIS MORNING WEST BEFORE SOME BREAKS 
APPEAR WHILE THE EASTERN HALF WILL KEEP A MID DECK FOR A LITTLE

344 AM EDT MON APR 14 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL
CONTINUE INTO THE AREA THIS MORNING. THIS AREA OF RAIN WILL SLOWLY
DIMINISH IN COVERAGE THIS AFTERNOON WITH ONLY SCATTERED CONVECTION
EXPECTED DURING THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON.

MAIN DYNAMICS WITH UPPER JET AND ASSOCIATED FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION OVERNIGHT AND EASTERN AREAS WEDNESDAY
MORNING. WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND AGAIN SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ARE
ANTICIPATED. SOME STRONG THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED WITH THE MAIN
CONCERN BEING STRONG/GUSTY WINDS AND HEAVY RAINS. 

STRONG COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA BETWEEN 06-12Z TONIGHT
WITH COLD AIR ADVECTION FOR WEDNESDAY. VERTICAL PROFILE WILL
SUPPORT THE RAIN CHANGING TO SNOW OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THE
HIGHEST PEAKS COULD SEE MINOR SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. HIGHS WEDNESDAY
WILL BE IN THE MORNING...THEN DROP DURING THE DAY.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/... 
IN THE WAKE OF A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE REGION ON TUESDAY... 
STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL TAKE PLACE AS BRISK NORTHERLY WINDS 
PUSH COOLER AND DRY AIR INTO THE FORECAST AREA. THIS WILL RESULT IN 
A HARD AND POTENTIALLY KILLING FREEZE ACROSS A VAST MAJORITY OF THE 
FORECAST AREA /PARTICULARLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE READINGS IN THE 23 TO 28 
DEGREE RANGE MAY BE COMMON/. ADDITIONALLY...NEARLY ALL OF OF THE 
SOUTHERN VALLEY WILL DROP TO AROUND 30 DEGREES...WITH SOME SHELTERED 
VALLEYS THERE DIPPING INTO THE UPPER 20S. GIVEN THE HIGH IMPACT AN 
EVENT LIKE THIS WILL HAVE TO CROPS AND PLANTS...THOSE WITH 
AGRICURTUAL INTERESTS SHOULD ESPECIALLY TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT ALL 
TENDER VEGETATION.

AFTER A COOL DAY ON WEDNESDAY WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 
60S...AN ADDTIONAL LIGHT FREEZE AND FROST SEEMS PROBABLE FOR 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT FOR MUCH OF THE AREA AGAIN /AND POSSIBLY EVEN 
THURSDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE NORTHEAST ZONES/. HOWEVER...A GRADUAL 
WARMING TREND IS EXPECTED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK WEEK AS 
WINDS VEER TO THE SOUTHWEST AND HIGHS RETURN TO THE UPPER 60S AND 
LOWER 70S BY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. ANOTHER WEAK FRONT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH THE AREA ON FRIDAY AS WELL...BRINGING A DECENT CHANCE FOR 
SCATTERED SHOWERS FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT. HOWEVER...RIDGING WILL 
QUICKLY RETURN FOR SATURDAY...ALONG WITH CLEARER CONDITIONS AND 
SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPERATURES.

330 PM EDT SUN APR 13 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...OVERVIEW...A WET SHORT 
TERM PERIOD WILL ENSUE AS OUR NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM APPROACHES. A 
SHORTWAVE ROTATING THROUGH THE LONGWAVE TROUGH WILL FIRST IMPACT US 
ON MONDAY MORNING WITH THE LONGWAVE TROUGH TO FOLLOW MONDAY NIGHT 
INTO TUESDAY. BOTH OF THESE FEATURES WILL BRING WIDESPREAD RAIN 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH A BETTER CHANCE OF STRONGER STORMS  
WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE LONGWAVE TROUGH DUE TO HIGHER INSTABILITY 
VALUES. 

THE LATEST GFS HAS SLOWED A LITTLE BIT ON THE ARRIVAL TIME OF THE 
FIRST SHORTWAVE WITH THE NAM STILL HAVING AN EVEN LATER ARRIVAL 
TIME. SO CURRENT THINKING IS THAT SHOWERS WON'T GET INTO THE PLATEAU 
COUNTIES UNTIL WELL AFTER MIDNIGHT...PERHAPS AS LATE AS 08/09Z AND 
THEN CONTINUE TO SPREAD EASTWARD INTO THE VALLEY. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY IN RESPONSE TO THIS 
FIRST SHORTWAVE BUT IT APPEARS THAT AN EVEN BETTER CHANCE FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL COME DURING THE EVENING HOURS AND OVERNIGHT 
MONDAY AS INSTABILITY INCREASES OUT AHEAD OF THE LONG WAVE TROUGH 
AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. HIGHER INSTABILITY VALUES WILL BE IN 
PLACE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AS OPPOSED TO NETN AND INTO SWVA. 
STILL...ENOUGH CAPE SHOULD SHOULD BE PRESENT TO SUPPORT A FEW STRONG 
TO POSSIBLY SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS JUST OUT AHEAD OF THE LONG WAVE 
TROUGH. MEAN WINDS APPEAR TO BE MOSTLY PARALLEL TO THE FRONT SO THIS 
WOULD SUGGEST A LINEAR EVENT. IT IS LIKELY THAT WE WILL SEE A LINE 
OF SHOWERS AND STORMS DEVELOP IN THE LATE AFTERNOON TO OUR WEST AND 
MOVE THROUGH OUR AREA DURING THE EVENING AND INTO THE OVERNIGHT 
HOURS. SHEAR...HELICITY...AND LCL VALUES LOOK GOOD ENOUGH THAT AN 
ISOLATED TORNADO CAN'T BE RULED OUT BUT THE MAIN THREAT HOWEVER 
APPEARS TO BE GUSTY STRAIGHT LINE WINDS. THE HAIL THREAT DOESN'T 
LOOK TOO GREAT BUT SMALL HAIL LOOKS POSSIBLE...UP TO HALF AN INCH. 
THE BEST CHANCE AT SEEING STRONGER STORMS LOOKS TO BE BETWEEN 00 AND 
06 UTC. 

THE SEVERE THREAT WILL TAPER OFF ONCE THE LINE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS 
MOVE THROUGH. THE COLD FRONT DOESN'T MOVE THOUGH UNTIL TUESDAY 
MORNING BUT SHOWERY ACTIVITY WILL LIKELY CONTINUE UNTIL THE FRONT IS 
OFF TO OUR EAST...WHICH SHOULD BE SOMETIME TUESDAY AFTERNOON. LOOK 
FOR CONDITIONS TO SLOWLY IMPROVE BY LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON WITH 
CLEARING SKIES EXPECTED ACROSS OUR WESTERN COUNTIES AND GRADUALLY 
WORKING THEIR WAY EASTWARD. TUESDAY WILL BE MUCH COOLER AS A BRIEF 
BLAST OF COLDER AIR MOVES INTO OUR AREA BEHIND THE FRONT. TEMPS WILL 
BE IN THE 50S ON TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER TROUGH MOVES AWAY 
TUESDAY NIGHT WITH A COUPLE SHOWERS STILL POSSIBLE ACROSS A PART OF 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE DURING THE 
EVENING. SHOULD BE A CHILLY NIGHT WITH WELL BELOW NORMAL MIN TEMPS 
EXPECTED. FREEZING TEMPERATURES ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS MOST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA UNDER CLEARING SKIES. A DRY REGIME UNDER THE INFLUENCE 
OF RIDGING IS STILL IN STORE FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. ECM/GFS 
HAVE COME INTO A LITTLE BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE UPPER TROUGH 
EXPECTED ON FRIDAY ALTHOUGH THE GFS IS A LITTLE QUICKER TO BRING A 
SURFACE BOUNDARY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. WENT CLOSER TO THIS 
CONCEPT WITH POPS INCREASING TO MEDIUM CHANCE BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
WITH A SLOW DEPARTURE OF THE SYSTEM HANGING ONTO SLIGHT AND LOW 
CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS THROUGH THE DAYTIME PERIOD SATURDAY. DRIER 
WESTERLY FLOW BUILDS IN FOR SUNDAY TO COMPLETE THE WEEKEND WITH 
IMPROVED WEATHER.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE
OVER THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES WITH MID-LEVEL INVERSION
KEEPING CONVECTION CHANCES LIMITED/NIL TODAY. TIGHTENING PRESSURE
GRADIENT OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AHEAD OF UPPER TROUGH OVER THE 
PLAIN STATES WILL PRODUCE BREEZY SOUTHWEST WINDS BETWEEN 10 AND 20
MPH WITH GUSTS AROUND 25 MPH FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

FOR TONIGHT...UPPER FORCING FROM INCOMING UPPER TROUGH WILL PULL
SCATTERED SHOWERS INTO THE PLATEAU TOWARD MONDAY MORNING.
OTHERWISE...INCREASING CLOUDS ANTICIPATED...ESPECIALLY AFTER
MIDNIGHT WITH MILD OVERNIGHT LOWS.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL
MOVE IN FROM THE WEST LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...BRINGING A
HIGH POTENTIAL FOR PRECIPITATION EARLY NEXT WEEK. TRENDS CONTINUE
TO SUPPORT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVING INTO THE REGION WELL
AFTER SUNRISE ON MONDAY...FROM THE LATE MORNING THOUGH THE MID TO
LATE AFTERNOON. THEN...AN ADDITIONAL ROUND OF STRONG TO LOCALLY
SEVERE STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE DURING THE EVENING HOURS INTO THE
NIGHT AS ANOTHER LONGWAVE TROUGH DRAGS A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE
AREA. MODELS ARE HINTING AT A QLCS FEATURE TRACKING FROM MIDDLE
TENNESSEE AND NORTHERN ALABAMA INTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND
EVENTUALLY INTO THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY BETWEEN 00-06Z
TUESDAY. THE PRIMARY QUESTION REMAINS HOW MUCH AVAILABLE
INSTABILITY THERE WILL BE. ATTM...IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE VERY
APPRECIABLE GIVEN THE TIMING OF THIS ACTIVITY AND A SOMEWHAT WORKED
OVER ATMOSPHERE FROM EARLIER CONVECTION. HOWEVER...A 40-50 KT LOW-
LEVEL JET ROTATING OVER THE REGION WILL SUPPORT GOOD BULK SHEAR
VALUES AND LINEAR STORM ORGANIZATION. AS A RESULT SOME GUSTY
STRAIGHT LINES WINDS AND PERHAPS AN ISOLATED TORNADO COULD BE
POSSIBLE WITH THE STRONGEST ACTIVITY.

BY LATE MONDAY NIGHT...THE SEVERE THREAT WILL DIMINISH AS THE LINE 
TRACKS EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS. HOWEVER...SOME POST-FRONTAL SHOWERS 
WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE THROUGH MIDDAY BEFORE THINGS TAPER OFF AND 
THE SKY RAPIDLY BEGINS TO CLEAR. THE COOL AND DRY AIR MASS THAT WILL 
FOLLOW WILL KNOCK HIGHS WELL BELOW SEASONABLE NORMALS FOR 
TUESDAY...AS TEMPERATURES WILL PEAK IN THE 50S IN MOST LOCATIONS. 
ADDITIONALLY...A CLEAR...COOL AND CALM NIGHT WILL RESULT IN A 
FREEZE/FROST FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT AS LOWS 
BOTTOM OUT IN THE MID 20S TO LOWER 30S. AN ADDITIONAL FROST MAY BE 
POSSIBLE ACROSS FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS 
WELL WEDNESDAY NIGHT. HIGHS WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE BACK INTO 
THE 60S AND LOWER 70S BY THURSDAY AS UPPER-RIDGING BUILDS BACK IN

325 PM EDT SAT APR 12 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE 
TO SLOWLY BUILD OVERNIGHT OUT AHEAD OF AN ADVANCING LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM AND LONG WAVE TROUGH. EXPECT CLEAR AND CALM CONDITIONS 
OVERNIGHT WITH TEMPS 5 TO 8 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF 
YEAR.

HEIGHTS CONTINUE TO BUILD ON SUNDAY AS THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AND 
LONG WAVE TROUGH GET CLOSER TO OUR AREA. THIS SHOULDN'T IMPACT 
SUNDAY'S WEATHER THOUGH AS CONDITIONS WILL BE SIMILAR TO TODAY'S 
WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND TEMPERATURES ROUGHLY 10 DEGREES ABOVE 
NORMAL. INCREASING HEIGHTS AND SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL LIKELY LEAD TO 
SOME IF NOT MANY AREAS SEEING THE WARMEST TEMPERATURES OF THE YEAR.
 
CLOUDS BEGIN TO INCREASE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AS THE 
AFOREMENTIONED LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES IN FROM THE WEST. THE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH MONDAY/MONDAY AFTERNOON WITH THE LONG 
WAVE TROUGH JUST BEHIND IT BUT NOT ROLLING THROUGH UNTIL DURING THE 
LONG TERM PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. MONDAY'S SYSTEM DOESN'T APPEAR TO 
BE HIGHLY ORGANIZED AND INSTABILITY VALUES STILL DON'T LOOK 
IMPRESSIVE ACROSS OUR AREA. AT THIS TIME...BETTER CHANCES FOR 
STRONGER STORMS WILL LIKELY BE BACK TO OUR WEST AND SOUTHWEST WHERE 
INSTABILITY VALUES ARE HIGHER. HOWEVER...THERE WILL STILL BE ENOUGH 
SHEAR ACROSS OUR AREA THAT IF WE CAN GET A LITTLE INSTABILITY WE 
COULD POSSIBLY SEE SOME STRONGER STORMS. WILL HAVE TO CLOSELY 
MONITOR FUTURE MODEL RUNS TO SEE HOW THEY HANDLE INSTABILITY VALUES. 
ALSO...SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES IN ARRIVAL TIME STILL EXISTS BETWEEN 
MODELS. THE LATEST NAM IS SLOWER WHILE THE GFS IS QUICKER. WILL 
TREND TOWARD THE QUICKER GFS FOR NOW.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODEL SOLUTIONS SIMILAR 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD HOWEVER...DIVERGENCE OF OPINION NOTED 
TOWARD THE END OF THE LONG TERM...FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. STAYED 
CLOSER TO THE GFS FOR THE LATER PERIODS. THE MAIN EVENT WILL BE THE 
THE RATHER STRONG FRONTAL SYSTEM DRIVEN BY A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER 
TROUGH. CATEGORICAL POPS CONTINUE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING HOURS TUESDAY UNTIL THE SURFACE COLD FRONT 
MOVES EAST OF THE TERRAIN. MUCH COLDER AIR FOLLOWS THE BOUNDARY 
KEEPING TEMPERATURES A GOOD TEN TO FIFTEEN DEGREES BELOW NORMAL ON 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY FOLLOWED BY A GRADUAL WARMING TREND WHICH 
ALLOWS FOR A RETURN TO SEASONAL TEMPERATURES BY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. 
AGAIN...MODELS DISSIMILAR DURING THIS PERIOD BUT THE GFS SHOWS 
ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY. DUE TO 
UNCERTAINTY DURING THIS PERIOD JUST ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS LATE FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY FOR THIS POSSIBILITY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AREA OF CONVECTION HAS FINALLY
DISSIPATED. TEMPERATURE/DEWPOINT SPREAD QUITE CLOSE OVER THE
PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE DUE TO THE RECENT RAINS. WILL
INCLUDE PATCHY FOG THERE THIS MORNING.

A STATIONARY FRONT WAS LOCATED ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE EARLY THIS MORNING. THIS BOUNDARY WILL PULL NORTHEAST
TODAY AND TONIGHT. MODELS SHOW INCREASING 800MB WARMING WITH AN
INVERSION SETTING UP ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA
FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND INTO THE REST OF THE AREA OVERNIGHT. CAN NOT
RULE OUT A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
THIS AFTERNOON...BUT CONFIDENCE TO IS TOO LOW TO INCLUDE.

OTHERWISE...BESIDES SOME HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS...A SUNNY DAY IS IN
STORE WITH WARM AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES. FOLLOWED GFS MOS CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE CAROLINA WILL BE
THE PREDOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE OVER THE REGION FOR
SUNDAY...PROMOTING WARM/MOIST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AND DRY...SUNNY
CONDITIONS. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR ANOTHER WARM DAY /PERHAPS THE
WARMEST OF THE YEAR SO FAR FOR MANY AREAS/...AS HIGHS WILL PEAK IN
THE LOWER 80S IN MANY LOCATIONS. HOWEVER...A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
WILL MOVE IN FROM THE WEST LATE SUNDAY NIGHT...BRINGING A HIGH
POTENTIAL FOR PRECIPITATION EARLY NEXT WEEK. AT THIS TIME...IT
APPEARS THAT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION
WELL AFTER SUNRISE ON MONDAY...FROM THE LATE MORNING THOUGH THE MID
TO LATE AFTERNOON. DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF THIS ACTIVITY AND
AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY THAT IS AVAILABLE...SOME OF THESE STORMS
COULD BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE DURING THE DAY GIVEN THE STRONG WIND
SHEAR IN PLACE.

A LONGWAVE TROUGH WILL THEN SLIDE INTO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 
MONDAY EVENING...AND HELP TO GENERATE LIFT AND THUS AN ADDITIONAL 
ROUND OF SHOWERS MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING...BEFORE THE 
PRECIPITATION RAPIDLY TAPERS OFF FROM WEST TO EAST TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON. A MUCH COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE AREA IN 
IT'S WAKE...RESULTING IN A FREEZE/FROST FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE 
REGION TUESDAY NIGHT. AS A RESULT...HAVE ADDED THIS TO THE GRIDS 
DURING THAT PERIOD. HIGHS WILL BE ABNORMALLY COOL FOR MOST OF THE 
WEEK...PEAKING IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY...BEFORE A WARMING TREND OCCURS AS A HIGH BUILDS IN LATE 
IN THE WEEK.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...SYSTEM TO OUR NORTH THAT WAS

FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEKEND AS THE UPPER RIDGE SWELLS SLIGHTLY 
NORTHWARD.  SHOULD BE BREEZY OVER THE WEEKEND...SO FIRE WEATHER 
STILL A SLIGHT CONCERN...ALTHOUGH THE HUMIDITY VALUES WILL BE HIGHER 
AS GULF MOISTURE CONTINUES TO FLOW INTO THE AREA.  STAYED PRETTY 
CLOSE TO GUIDANCE ON TEMPS...USED A MIX OF NAM/GFS MOS FOR DEWPOINTS 
WITH A FEW TWEAKS LOWER AT A FEW LOCATIONS/TIMES.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS RELATIVELY CLOSE 
IN DEPICTION OF EXPECTED WEATHER EARLY BUT THE ECMWF APPEARS MUCH 
TOO AMPLIFIED AND THUS SLOWER AT MID WEEK SO WENT CLOSER TO THE GFS 
SOLUTION HERE. MODELS STILL INDICATE AN INITIAL SHORT WAVE MOVES 
FROM THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY DURING THE 
DAY MONDAY. A SHARP AND SLOW MOVING FRONTAL BOUNDARY BUILDS INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA AT THIS TIME. SLOWED THE ARRIVAL OF PRECIP JUST A BIT 
DURING THE DAY MONDAY FAVORING MUCH HIGHER POPS CLOSER TO THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. MODELS REALLY NOT SHOWING A GREAT DEAL OF 
INSTABILITY WITH THIS EVENT SO APPLIED JUST A CHANCE FOR CONVECTION 
IN CONJUNCTION WITH LIKELY PROBABILITY OF SHOWERS MONDAY INTO MONDAY 
NIGHT. THE COLD FRONT PRESSES EAST ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS TOWARD 
MIDNIGHT BUT MODELS STILL SHOW THE MAIN 500 MB UPPER TROUGH TRAILING 
WELL TO THE WEST. DEEP MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE SHOULD 
KEEP A HIGH LIKELIHOOD FOR SHOWERS GOING THROUGH THE DAY TUESDAY 
WITH THE PRECIPITATION TAPERING OFF LATER IN THE AFTERNOON. ENTIRE 
FORECAST AREA SHOULD BE PRECIP FREE BY MIDNIGHT. DRY...ALBEIT 
COOL...WESTERLY FLOW BEHIND THIS SYSTEM ENSURES A DRY WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY. MODELS NOT ON THE SAME PAGE FOR FRIDAY WITH THE GFS 
BRINGING ANOTHER SHORT WAVE INTO THE PICTURE LATER IN THE DAY 
FRIDAY. DUE TO UNCERTAINTY STAYED CLOSER TO THE LESS ENERGETIC ECMWF

OF LOW AFTERNOON RELATIVE HUMIDITIES/BREEZY SOUTHWEST WINDS...AND
CHANCE OF AFTERNOON/EVENING SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM FOR
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHERN TENNESSEE.

DEWPOINTS HAVE INCREASED SOME THE PAST 12 HOURS...BUT EXPECT
ANOTHER DAY OF GOOD MIXING ALLOWING AFTERNOON RELATIVE HUMIDITIES
TO DROP INTO THE UPPER 20S TO MIDDLE 30S. ALSO...BOUNDARY LAYER
MIXING AND TIGHTENING PRESSURE GRADIENTS WILL PRODUCE SUSTAINED
SOUTHWEST WINDS OF 10 TO 20 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 25 MPH. BOTH LOW
HUMIDITIES AND BREEZY CONDITIONS WILL INCREASE FIRE DANGER
CONDITIONS AGAIN TODAY.

A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL APPROACH THE NORTHERN
AREAS THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING BEFORE BECOMING QUASI-STATIONARY
OVERNIGHT. NAM/GFS SHOW ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
NORTHERN TENNESSEE LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING.

OTHERWISE...ZONAL FLOW PATTERN WILL BRING IN A GOOD DEAL OF
HIGH/MID LEVEL CLOUDS AND WARM AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
AN UPPER-RIDGE AXIS WILL BE THE PREDOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE OVER THE

SUBSTANTIALLY AS IT MOVES INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. OTHER THAN SOME 
EARLY MORNING CLOUD COVER AND PERHAPS AN ISOLATED SPRINKLE...DO NOT 
ANTICIPATE ANY IMPACTS FROM THIS WEAK SYSTEM. A MUCH STRONGER STORM 
SYSTEM WILL IMPACT THE REGION EARLY NEXT WEEK...BRINGING A HIGH 
POTENTIAL FOR PRECIPIATION /AND PERHAPS SOME LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL/. THIS ACTIVITY WILL APPROACH THE AREA FROM THE WEST LATE 
SUNDAY NIGHT AND OVERSPREAD THE REGION ON MONDAY IN THE FORM OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF INSTABLITY 
THAT IS AVIALABLE...SOME OF THESE STORMS COULD BECOME STRONG TO

CONDITIONS CONTINUE THIS AFTERNOON...BUT THIS EVENING HUMIDITY 
VALUES SHOULD RECOVER PRETTY WELL AS GULF MOISTURE SPREADS ACROSS 
THE AREA.  THEN ON FRIDAY HUMIDITY VALUES SHOULD NOT FALL NEARLY AS 
MUCH.  WEAK SYSTEM SAGGING INTO THE NORTHERN PARTS OF THE AREA WILL 
INCREASE THE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS OVER THE NORTH FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
AND FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT PRETTY MINIMAL PRECIP AMOUNTS EXPECTED WITH 
IT. WENT CLOSE TO GUIDANCE ON TEMPS OVERALL.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...THE UPPER LEVEL 
PATTERN WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY AMPLIFIED DURING THE BEGINNING OF 
THE WEEK WITH RIDGING OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION WITH A 
TROUGH OUT WEST. THE FORECAST AREA WILL ENJOY THE WARMEST DAY OF THE 
LONG TERM PERIOD ON SUNDAY AS WINDS INCREASE OUT OF THE SOUTH AHEAD 
OF A STRENGTHENING FRONTAL SYSTEM...COMPLIMENTS OF THE AMPLIFIED 
WESTERN TROUGH. ALONG WITH THE MILD AIR WILL COME INCREASING 
MOISTURE OFF THE GULF OF MEXICO. STRENGTHENING WIND FIELDS ALONG 
WITH AN INCREASE IN INSTABILITY DURING THE DAY MONDAY SHOULD LEAD TO 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM 
COLD FRONT. THE FRONT SHIFTS INTO THE CAROLINAS BY MONDAY EVENING 
BUT TRAILING SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND ASSOCIATED DEEP MOISTURE APPEAR 
TO KEEP THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS GOING MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WHEN 
THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS FINALLY MOVES ONTO THE EASTERN SEABOARD. DRIER

TOMORROW...BUT MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW A STRONG SUBSIDENCE INVERSION 
SETTLING OVER THE AREA THAT MAY LIMIT DEVELOPMENT...BUT LOOKING AS

RADIATIONAL COOLING.  PUTTING IN PATCHY FROST OVER IN THE NERN AND 
SERN SECTIONS...WHERE TEMPS SHOULD COOL TO LESS THAN 40 DEGREES AND 
WINDS SHOULD DIE-OFF ALL NIGHT.  WINDS ON THE PLATEAU AND NWRN 
SECTIONS WILL LIKELY START TO PICKUP PRIOR TO DAYBREAK...THEREBY 
LIMITING RADIATIONAL COOLING.

WENT VERY CLOSE TO GFS MOS TEMPS FOR TONIGHT AND THURSDAY...BUT NOT 
QUITE AS COLD AS MOS IN TRI AREA.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FOR THURSDAY NIGHT 
AND FRIDAY...UPPER FLOW WILL BE ZONAL WITH A COLD FRONT TRYING TO 
PULL SOUTH INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. GIVEN FRONT BECOMING PARALLEL
WITH UPPER FLOW...BOUNDARY WILL BECOME STATIONARY JUST OVER
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA LATE FRIDAY...THEN PULL BACK NORTH FOR SATURDAY.
WILL MAINTAIN LOW CHANCE POPS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHERN TENNESSEE.

MAIN ACTION DURING THE EXTENDED WILL BE A NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN 
STREAM SHORT-WAVES MOVING INTO THE ROCKIES FOR THIS WEEKEND...THEN 
PULLING EAST INTO THE PLAIN STATES FOR SUNDAY. DEPENDING ON AMOUNT 
OF PHASING BETWEEN THE NORTHERN/SOUTHERN STREAM WAVES...FAIRLY 
STRONG CYCLO-GENESIS POSSIBLE OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS THEN LIFTING 
NORTHEAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. 

FAIRLY GOOD UPPER DYNAMICS/FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING DEPICTED FOR LATE 
MONDAY/MONDAY EVENING. AT THIS TIME...MODELS SHOW LIMITED 
INSTABILITY...BUT WILL NEED TO WATCH FOR THE POTENTIAL OF 
STRONG/SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY/...
AN UPPER-TROUGH SWINGING THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS

ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY DEVELOP OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE
THIS AFTERNOON AND SPREAD EASTWARD INTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY
EARLY EVENING AND EVENTUALLY THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEYS AFTER
SUNSET. GIVEN SOME MODEST INSTABILITY...AN ISOLATED RUMBLE OF
THUNDER MAY BE POSSIBLE WITH THE STRONGEST ACTIVITY THROUGH 03Z OR
SO. AS THE BASE OF THE TROUGH PASSES THROUGH THE AREA OVERNIGHT...
INCREASED LIFT WILL GENERATE SOME MORE WIDESPREAD SHOWER ACTIVITY
BETWEEN 06-12Z. MOST RAINFALL TOTALS WILL REMAIN LIGHT...WITH
AMOUNTS AROUND ONE-TENTH TO TWO-TENTHS OF AN INCH BEING THE
MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF RAINFALL EXPECTED. SOME LOW CLOUDS AND LIGHT
PRECIPITATION MAY LINGER ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA WEDNESDAY MORNING...BUT DRIER AIR WILL CREATE MOSTLY
CLEAR CONDITIONS BY THE AFTERNOON. THE NORTHWEST FLOW WILL HELP TO
REINFORCE THIS COOLER AIR MASS...BUT SUNSHINE SHOULD ALLOW HIGHS TO

THURSDAY LOOKS SUNNY AND WARMER AS THE RIDGE MOVES TO OUR EAST AND A 
SOUTHERLY FLOW DEVELOPS...GIVING HIGHS IN THE 70S WITH SUNNY SKIES. 

THERE IS SOME MODEL DISAGREEMENT WITH THE APPROACH OF A COLD FRONT 
ON FRIDAY/FRIDAY NIGHT. THE GFS KEEPS THE VORT MAX/UPPER JET WELL 
NORTH...WITH MOST PRECIP OVER THE OH VALLEY AND KY. THE NAM IS 
FARTHER SOUTH WITH THESE FEATURES...AND DEVELOPS A PRE-FRONTAL 
TROUGH OVER OUR AREA FRI AFTERNOON. THE NAM PRECIP DEPICTION IS 
SUPPORTED BY THE SREF AND ECMWF...SO WILL LEAN IN THAT DIRECTION AND 
HAVE HIGH CHANCE POPS NORTH LATE FRI AFTERNOON/EVENING. THE COLD 
FRONT STALLS SOMEWHERE NEARBY ON SATURDAY. THE ECMWF AND GFS 
CONTINUE TO DIFFER WITH THE FRONTAL POSITION...BUT WITH LITTLE UPPER 
LEVEL SUPPORT FOR LIFT AND LITTLE MOISTURE...WE SHOULD STAY DRY IN 
EITHER SCENARIO. A WARMING TREND IS EXPECTED THROUGH THE WEEKEND 
WITH HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST...WITH HIGHS 
REACHING THE MID AND UPPER 70S BY SUNDAY.

THERE IS GENERAL MODEL AGREEMENT ON A DEEPENING TROUGH OVER THE 
PLAINS ON MONDAY...WHICH SPREADS PRECIP INTO OUR AREA MONDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY. HOWEVER...THE 12Z GFS CUTS OFF A CLOSED LOW OVER ARKANSAS 
THAT IS SLOW TO MOVE EAST THROUGH TUESDAY. THIS IS THE FIRST RUN OF 
THE GFS THAT HAS SHOWN THIS PATTERN. THE ECMWF AND GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN 
HAVE AN OPEN WAVE TROUGH THAT EXITS BY TUESDAY. WILL HAVE HIGH 
CHANCE POPS IN FOR MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT WITH DECREASING PRECIP 
CHANCES TUESDAY AND COOLER TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...THE MAIN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH
CONTINUES TO TRACK INTO THE OHIO VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON...AND WITH
IT A STRONG 40-50 KT LOW-LEVEL JET IS MOVING ACROSS MIDDLE
TENNESSEE INTO EASTERN KENTUCKY BY THIS EVENING. THE SKY HAS
REMAINED MOSTLY CLOUDY ACROSS THE REGION FOR MOST OF THE...THOUGH
SOME BREAKS HAVE OCCURRED JUST TO THE WEST ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE
ALONG AND JUST AHEAD OF A SLOW ADVANCING COLD FRONT. THOUGH LIMITED
HEATING HAS OCCURRED...HIGHS HAVE RISEN INTO THE LOWER 60S IN MANY
LOCATIONS TODAY...WITH DEWPOINTS PRESENTLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 50S
ALONG THE PLATEAU AND MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEYS.
THROUGH THERE IS VERY LITTLE TO NO SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY...SOME
VERY LIMITED DESTABILIZATION ALOFT HAS OCCURRED ALOFT...WITH ML
CAPE VALUES OF AROUND A FEW HUNDRED J/KG BY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON.
THIS LIMITED INSTABILITY...COMBINED WITH THE STRONG BULK SHEAR HAS
ALLOWED 0-3 KM SR HELICITY VALUES TO CLIMB TO 300-500 M2/S2 ACROSS
MIDDLE/EAST TENNESSEE AND LIFTED INDEX VALUES TO -1 TO -2.

SOME EVIDENCE OF SOME SHOWERS DEVELOPING ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE 
AND SOME SCATTERED STORMS ACROSS MIDDLE TENENSSEE SUPPORT THE MODEL 
GUIDANCE OF SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION OCCURRING MID TO 
LATE AFTERNOON. GIVEN THE AFOREMENTIONED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS 
/ALONG WITH THE LATEST RADAR TRENDS TO THE WEST/...STILL THINK SOME 
LOCALLY ORGANIZED STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE POSSIBLE... 
IN THE FORM OF LINE SEGMENTS AND LOW-TOPPED SUPERCELLS. THE MAINLY 
UNIDIRECTIONAL SHEAR IN PLACE BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON WILL SUPPORT A 
DAMAGING WIND THREAT WITH THE STRONGEST ACTIVITY. HOWEVER...SOME 
MARGINALLY SEVERE HAIL AND EVEN AN ISOLATED TORNADO CANNOT BE RULED 
OUT... ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE A WEAK PRE-EXISTING BOUNDARY MAY 
EXIST AND WHERE WINDS ARE LOCALLY BACKED NEAR THE SURFACE. 

THIS ACTIVITY WILL DIE OFF THIS EVENING AFTER SUNSET AND THE 
BOUNDARY LAYER STABILIZES. HAVE REMOVED POPS IN ALL BUT THE NORTHEAST 
ZONES AFTER MIDNIGHT. AFTER SUNRISE...THE BASE OF THE TROUGH WILL 
SWING THROUGH THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS...BRINGING ANOTHER 
OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME SHOWERS ON TUESDAY...MAINLY DURING THE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THUS...HAVE ADJUSTED POPS DOWN IN THE MORNING 
AND UP IN THE AFTERNOON TO SUPPORT THIS CONFIDENCE. HIGHS ON TUESDAY 
WILL ON THE COOL SIDE /SIMILAR TO TODAY/...AND PEAK IN THE UPPER 50S 
TO LOWER 60S. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...A BROAD UPPER TROUGH 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS 
EXPECTED. TROUGH AXIS WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA EARLY WEDNESDAY 
WITH UPPER FLOW BECOMING ZONAL FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK. A 
FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY APPROACHING THE FORECAST AREA 
FRIDAY...BUT GIVEN THE ZONAL FLOW ALOFT...FRONT WILL REMAIN NORTH OF 
THE AREA WITH ONLY LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/FAR 
NORTHERN AREA OF TENNESSEE FRIDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING.

SURFACE RIDING AND DRY AIRMASS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO DROP INTO 
THE MIDDLE 30S ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND NORTHERN PLATEAU FOR 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. MAY NEED TO ISSUE A FROST ADVISORY FOR THESE AREAS 
LATER THIS WEEK.

NEXT UPPER TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE ROCKIES INTO THE PLAIN STATES 
FOR THIS WEEKEND. MODELS SHOW A NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM WAVES 
PHASING OVER THE PLAIN STATES FOR SUNDAY. GFS AND ECMWF DISAGREE 
WITH TIMING AND LOCATION OF CYCLO-GENEIS...BUT FROM SUNDAY NIGHT

THUNDERSTORMS.

.DISCUSSION...
THE INITIAL AREA OF SHOWERS IS QUICKLY EXITING THE REGION THIS
MORNING AS THE MAIN UPPER-TROUGH SHIFTS INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. AS
IT DOES SO A STRONG 40-50 KT LOW-LEVEL JET WILL ROTATE OUT OF
MIDDLE TENNESSEE INTO EASTERN KENTUCKY...WITH A 90-100 KT 500 MB
JET PASSING OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS WILL PROVIDE THE
POTENTIAL FOR SOME STRONG GRADIENT WINDS OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN
THROUGH THE EARLY AFTERNOON /THANKS ALSO TO A PERSISTENT THIN
STABLE LAYER ALOFT/. THUS...WILL KEEP THE HIGH WIND WARNING GOING
THROUGH 20Z...MAINLY FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

ADDITIONALLY...THIS WILL ALSO HELP TO INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR
STRONG TO POSSIBLY SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATER THIS AFTERNOON ALONG
THE FRONT. THE MAIN QUESTION WILL DEAL WITH INSTABILITY...AS VERY
LITTLE SURFACE BASED CAPE SEEMS PROBABLE THIS AFTERNOON GIVEN THE
CURRENT CLOUD COVER. HOWEVER...DEPENDING IF THERE ARE ANY
SUFFICIENT BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS SOME HEATING COULD OCCUR AND THUS
WEAKEN THE CAP BY 18Z OR SO. MUCAPE VALUES ARE ALSO PROGGED TO BE A
LITTLE HIGHER...AND APPROACH 300-400 J/KG BY THE AFTERNOON...WITH
LIFTED INDEX VALUES AOA -1 TO -3. GIVEN THE STRONG BULK SHEAR
VALUES AND THIS MODEST INSTABILITY...THINK THAT SOME ORGANIZED
STRONG CONVECTION IS POSSIBLE DURING THE AFTERNOON...PARTICULARLY
IN THE FORM OF LOW-TOPPED SUPERCELLS. THE PRIMARY THREAT OF ANY
SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE DAMAGING WINDS GIVEN THE MOSTLY
UNIDIRECTIONAL SHEAR BY THE AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...SOME MARGINALLY
SEVERE HAIL AND EVEN AN ISOLATED TORNADO CANNOT BE RULED OUT...
ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE A WEAK PRE-EXISTING BOUNDARY MAY EXIST
AND WHERE WINDS ARE LOCALLY BACKED NEAR THE SURFACE.

938 PM EDT SUN APR 6 2014

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER
SOUTHWESTERN LA...WITH A WEAK INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDING
NORTHEAST OF IT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL AN
EXTENSIVE AREA OF RAIN SPREADING NORTHEASTWARD...WITH THE LEADING
EDGE OVER SOUTHEAST TN. LIGHTNING WAS ALSO BEING OBSERVED OVER
CENTRAL AL...WITH MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATING SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY
DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT. MODELS ALSO INDICATE
A STRONG SOUTH-TO-SOUTHEASTERLY 850 MB WIND FLOW DEVELOPING NORTHWEST
OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS AFTER MIDNIGHT...WITH THE NAM MODEL
REVEALING STRONGER 850 MB WINDS (70 TO 75 KT) THAN THE GFS MODEL
(50 TO 55 KT). THIS SCENARIO APPEARS CONDUCIVE TO THE FORMATION OF
HIGH WINDS DUE TO MOUNTAIN WAVES IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE MOUNTAINS
LATER TONIGHT INTO MONDAY...BUT A POTENTIAL "FLY IN THE OINTMENT"
APPEARS TO BE THE SURFACE-BASED STABLE LAYER THAT BARELY EXTENDS
OVER THE MOUNTAINS. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL AN UNSTABLE LAYER BEGINNING
AROUND 800 MB AND EXTENDING FURTHER UP THE ATMOSPHERE. IT'S NOT
REALLY KNOWN HOW THIS SOMEWHAT SHALLOW STABLE LAYER WILL AFFECT THE
INTENSITY OF THE MOUNTAIN WAVES LATER TONIGHT...BUT OVERALL...THE
HIGH WIND WARNING APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY
CHANGES TONIGHT.

OTHERWISE...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO REMOVE
ANY MENTION OF EVENING PRECIP FOR TONIGHT.

252 PM EDT SUN APR 6 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL 
APPROACH FROM THE SOUTHWEST TONIGHT AND WILL DEEPEN AS IT TRACKS BY 
TO OUR WEST AND INTO OHIO MONDAY.  ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL 
PUSH IN MONDAY AFTERNOON. STRONG SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL BRING 
PLENTY OF MOISTURE INTO THE AREA...SO SHOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT RAIN 
EVENT FOR THE ENTIRE AREA.  WILL CARRY CAT POPS ALL ZONES BOTH 
PERIODS. HIGHEST PRECIP TOTALS EXPECTED TO BE SOUTH AND 
SOUTHEAST...WHERE RAINFALL MAY EXCEED 2 INCHES IN SOME AREAS.  
FLOODING POSSIBILITY OF SOME CONCERN...ALTHOUGH GROUND IS FAIRLY DRY 
WITH 6 HOUR FFG AREAS IN THESE AREAS GENERALLY AROUND 3 INCHES OR 
HIGHER...SO FOR NOW NO FLOOD WATCH FOR NOW. SECOND CONCERN IS STRONG 
WINDS IN THE NORMALLY FAVORED MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS GIVEN 
POSSIBILITY OF MOUNTAIN WAVES.  GFS LOW LEVEL WINDS NOT AS STRONG 
BUT MORE FAVORABLE DIRECTION...NAM LOW LEVEL FLOW QUITE STRONG BUT 
DIRECTION STAYS FAVORABLE FOR A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME.  OTHER 
CONCERN IS STABLE LAYER MAY BE A BIT SHALLOW TO BE IDEAL...BUT MODEL 
SOUNDINGS HINT IT MAY BE DEEP ENOUGH AT LEAST FOR A SHORT PERIOD.  
WILL GO AHEAD AND UPGRADE THE HIGH WIND WATCH TO A WARNING AND ISSUE 
A WIND ADVISORY FOR SOUTHERN MOUNTAIN ZONES NOT IN THE WATCH.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SHOWERS WILL
CONTINUE TO GRADUALLY TAPER OFF MONDAY NIGHT FROM THE INITIAL
DEPARTING LOW...BUT SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL BE
POSSIBLE ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF EAST TENNESSEE AND IN
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THROUGH THE NIGHT. ANOTHER FAST MOVING TROUGH
WILL QUICKLY FOLLOW...MOVING INTO THE REGION TUESDAY AND TUESDAY
NIGHT. THOUGH LIFT/MOISTURE WILL NOT BE AS HIGH...SCATTERED SHOWERS
WILL BE POSSIBLE THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND EVENING ON TUESDAY...BUT
WILL TAPER OFF LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AS THE SYSTEM
SHIFTS EAST. CLOUD COVER SHOULD KEEP LOWS IN THE 40S MONDAY AND
TUESDAY NIGHT...DESPITE THE COOLER HIGHS ONLY PEAKING IN THE 50S IN
MOST PLACES DURING THE DAY. HOWEVER...THE RAPID CLEARING THAT WILL
TAKE PLACE BY WEDNESDAY EVENING WILL ALLOW FOR GOOD RADIATIONAL
COOLING THAT NIGHT...LIKELY RESULTING IN A FROST/LIGHT FREEZE
ACROSS THE NORTHERN VALLEY AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THAT NIGHT.
THEREAFTER...RIDGING FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WILL ALLOW HIGHS TO
RETURN TO THE 70S...WITH AMPLE SUNSHINE AND SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS.
ANOTHER DISTURBANCE MAY APPROACH THE AREA EARLY THIS WEEKEND...BUT
GIVEN UNCERTAINTIES IN HOW FAR SOUTH THE FRONT WILL PUSH...AND THE
WEAKER LIFT/MOISTURE...HAVE LOW MENTIONABLE POPS IN THE FORECAST
FOR NOW.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...AT THE START OF THIS 
PERIOD THE UPPER TROUGH IN THE PLAINS IS STILL DIGGING AND MAKING

DEEPER MOIST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT OVER OUR AREA.  A LARGE AREA

MONDAY...THE STEADY RAINS WILL MOVE AWAY WITH IT LEAVING US WITH 
MORE SPOTTY PRECIP CHANCES FOR PART OF THE DAY ON MONDAY.  HOWEVER, 
BY MONDAY LATE AFTERNOON OR EVENING A COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE 
REGION FROM THE WEST...BRING BETTER CHANCES FOR PRECIP AS A LINE OF 
SHOWERS/STORMS MARCHES THROUGH THE AREA. MOISTURE RECOVERY AHEAD OF 
THIS FRONT WILL ONLY BE MARGINAL WITH DEW POINTS ONLY RISING INTO 
THE 50S...SO NOT FORECASTING ANY SEVERE STORMS FOR NOW...BUT WILL 
NEED TO WATCH FOR GUSTY WINDS IN ANY SHOWERS OR STORMS DUE TO 
GENERAL STRONG WIND FIELD THAT COULD GET BROUGHT TO SURFACE. 

FOR MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...KEEPING CHANCES OF SHOWERS 
FOR MUCH OF THE AREA AS MOISTURE HANGS AROUND AND LITTLE WAVES OF 
LIFT RACE THROUGH THE AREA. LOOKS LIKE THE LAST OF THESE WAVES MOVE 
THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING/NIGHT...ALONG WITH RE-ENFORCING COLD FRONT 
AND DRIER AIR FOLLOWS.

BY WEDNESDAY...CHANCES FOR PRECIP SHOULD BE JUST ABOUT GONE THROUGH 
THE END OF THE WEEK AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...CURRENT RADAR ACTIVITY 
JUST WEST OF CUMBERLAND PLATEAU IS OCCURRING ALONG APPROACHING COLD 
FRONT. FURTHER SHOWERY ACTIVITY MAY DEVELOP ALONG THE COLD FRONT AS 
IT MOVES INTO OUR AREA. WE MAY SEE A RUMBLE OF THUNDER OR TWO WITH 
THE AFOREMENTIONED ACTIVITY BUT THE MAJORITY OF IT SHOULD REMAIN AS 
SHOWERS DUE TO THE LACKING INSTABILITY BECAUSE OF DENSE CLOUD COVER 
THAT PERSISTED ACROSS OUR AREA TODAY. 

MODELS SHOW THE FRONT DRAPED ACROSS OUR AREA BY AROUND 00Z AND 
MOVING THROUGH SHORTLY THEREAFTER. WITH THE DEPARTED FRONT...EXPECT 
SLOWLY CLEARING CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT AS WE RETURN TO A ZONAL FLOW 
ALOFT. CHA WILL START TO CLEAR FIRST WITH TRI LIKELY HANGING ON TO 
SOME CLOUD COVER THROUGH MOST OF THE NIGHT. WINDS WILL ALSO STAY UP 
THROUGH MOST OF THE NIGHT UNTIL THE FRONT CAN MOVE FURTHER TO OUR 
EAST WITH WINDS FINALLY CALMING CLOSER TO SUNRISE. OVERNIGHT LOWS 
WILL GENERALLY BE IN THE LOW TO MID 40S. HIGH TEMPS ON SATURDAY WILL 
BE ROUGHLY 5 DEGREES COLDER THAN NORMAL AREA WIDE WITH TEMPERATURES 
IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S WITH SUNSHINE RETURNING.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...ANOTHER DEEPENING
UPPER-LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL SHIFT FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON SUNDAY...BRINGING INCREASED CLOUD COVER
INTO THE REGION AND WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS
TO THE AREA OVERNIGHT. HAVE MAINTAINED THE CHANCE POPS DURING THE
LATE AFTERNOON ON SUNDAY...AND THE CATEGORICAL POPS SUNDAY
NIGHT...AS ALL MODELS ARE HINTING AT WIDESPREAD SHOWERS MOVING INTO
THE AREA FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST AFTER 00Z MONDAY.
ADDITIONALLY...HAVE MAINTAINED THE CATEGORICAL TO LIKELY POPS
MONDAY MORNING...BEFORE GRADUALLY TAPERING THEM OFF MONDAY
AFTERNOON AS DRY SLOTTING OCCURS. IN ADDITION TO THE RAIN
POTENTIAL...SOME STRONG SOUTHEASTERLY GRADIENT WINDS SUNDAY NIGHT
WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME MOUNTAIN WAVES ALONG THE
HIGHER TERRAIN AND FOOTHILLS OF EAST TENNESSEE. A HIGH WIND WATCH
MAY BE NEEDED TOMORROW ALONG THE MOUNTAIN ZONES AND FAVORED
FOOTHILL LOCATIONS SHOULD THESE MODEL TRENDS CONTINUE.
 
A BROAD TROUGH WILL THEN SWING INTO THE REGION FOR TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY...MAINTAINING THE BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND GENERATING 
SOME ISOLATED TO PERHAPS SCATTERED SHOWER ACTIVITY /ALONG WITH SOME 
DENSE CLOUD COVER/. ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND SOME WEAK RIDGING WILL 
ALLOW FOR A WARM-UP LATE IN THE WORK WEEK AS THE SKY CLEARS AND 
SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS PUSH TEMPERATURES BACK UP INTO THE 60S TO LOWER 
70S.

.DISCUSSION...SEVER THUNDERSTORM WATCH HAS BEEN CANCELLED FOR OUR AREA 
AS CURRENT RADAR SHOWS MAIN LINE OF STORMS EAST OF WATCH AREA.  
EXTREME NETN AND SWVA COULD STILL SEE SOME HIGHER WIND GUSTS WITH 
THE LINE OF STORMS CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH BUT OVERALL TREND HAS 
BEEN WEAKENING OF THE LINE OF STORMS OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. WE 
HAVE HAD A FEW TREES DOWN HERE AND THERE BUT NO WIDESPREAD OR MAJOR 
DAMAGE HAS BEEN REPORTED. WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE GUSTY THIS 
AFTERNOON AS COLD FRONT IS STILL BACK TO OUR WEST. CURRENT SURFACE 
PLOTS SHOW THE FRONT TO BE JUST WEST OF NASHVILLE. THE BIG QUESTION 
OF THE DAY IS WHETHER ANY NEW DEVELOPMENT WILL OCCUR LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING AS COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH. WILL LEAVE 
MENTION OF ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS IN ZONES FOR THIS AFTERNOON IN 
CASE WE DO HAVE NEW DEVELOPMENT. AT THIS TIME HOWEVER...CONFIDENCE 
NOT OVERLY HIGH THAT WE WILL HAVE NEW DEVELOPMENT. IF ANYTHING DOES 
DEVELOP...IT MAY BE MORE ISOLATED/SCATTERED CONVECTIVE TYPE ACTIVITY 
AS OPPOSED TO SEVERE. NEW ZONES OUT SOON TO REMOVE WATCH HEADLINE. 
WILL ALSO TWEAK HOURLY TEMPS.

339 PM EDT THU APR 3 2014

.SHORT TERM.../TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...CURRENT ACTIVITY ON RADAR
TO OUR NORTHWEST MAY SLOWLY WORK ITS WAY INTO PORTIONS OF OUR
AREA...MAINLY FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND NORTHWARD WITH BETTER
CHANCES ACROSS EXTREME NETN AND SWVA LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY
EVENING. CURRENT MESO ANALYSIS SHOWS CAP SLOWLY WEAKENING ACROSS
THESE AREAS. WILL ADD IN SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR CENTRAL VALLEY FOR
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY
EVENING HOURS AND CHANCE FOR NETN AND SWVA. THREAT SHOULD BE OVER
WITH BY AROUND 03Z. AFTER THIS...CALMER CONDITIONS WILL SETUP
OVERNIGHT BEFORE THE NEXT ROUND OF WEATHER MOVES IN.

MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT A POTENTIALLY STRONG LINE OF SHOWERS 
AND STORMS WILL APPROACH OUR AREA FROM THE WEST OVERNIGHT AND ARRIVE 
TOWARD MORNING. THIS LINE OF STORMS IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE ON THE 
PLATEAU BETWEEN 12/15Z AND INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY BETWEEN 15/18Z. 
THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THIS ACTIVITY IS A NEGATIVELY TILTED TROUGH 
THAT WILL SWING ACROSS OUR AREA. AS THE TROUGH SWING THROUGH THE LOW 
WILL LIFT FURTHER NORTH UP INTO THE GREAT LAKES...THIS SHOULD HELP 
TO WEAKEN FORCING ACROSS OUR AREA. HOWEVER...MULTIPLE PARAMETERS 
INDICATE THAT THERE STILL COULD BE SOME SEVERE STORMS WITHIN THIS 
LINE. A STRONG WIND FIELD WILL ACCOMPANY THE TROUGH WITH ROUGHLY 45 
TO 60KTS OF 0-6KM BULK SHEAR AND 0-1KM SHEAR OF 30 TO 40KTS AS WELL 
AS ENHANCED VALUES OF SRH AND EHI. THESE PARAMETERS SUGGEST 
THAT...THOUGH NOT THE MAIN THREAT ANTICIPATED...AN ISOLATED TORNADO 
OR TWO CAN NOT BE RULED OUT. LOW LCL HEIGHTS ALSO SUPPORT AN 
ISOLATED TOR RISK. CAPE WILL BE SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO SUPPORT STRONG 
TO SEVERE STORMS WITH SURFACE BASED CAPE VALUES ROUGHLY BETWEEN 500 
AND 1000 J/KG AND MU CAPE UP TO 1500 J/KG. HAIL THREAT STILL LOOKS 
MARGINAL AS THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME CAPE IN THE HAIL GROWTH ZONE AS 
WELL AS LOW WBZ HEIGHTS. OVERALL...MAIN THREAT APPEARS TO BE 
DAMAGING STRAIGHT LINE WINDS. THE THREAT FOR SEVERE STORMS APPEARS 
THAT IT WILL END BY LATE AFTERNOON AS DRIER AIR BEGINS TO BUILD IN 
ACROSS OUR AREA.

.LONG TERM.../FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...
COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL QUICKLY FILER INTO THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY 
NIGHT AS THE COLD FRONT DEPARTS THE REGION. THIS WILL RESULT IN A 
MOSTLY SUNNY...BUT COOLER DAY ON SATURDAY AS NORTHWESTERLY FLOW 
PREVAILS...WITH HIGHS TOPPING OFF IN THE 60S. ANOTHER DEEPENING 
UPPER-LOW WILL SHIFT FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY ON SUNDAY...BRINGING INCREASED CLOUD COVER FOR SUNDAY AND A 
HIGH POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. 
GIVEN GOOD MODEL CONTINUITY...HAVE INCREASED POPS TO CATEGORICAL 
OVER THE SOUTHERN ZONES SUNDAY NIGHT...AND HAVE GONE LIKELY POPS 
ELSEWHERE THROUGH MONDAY MORNING. IN ADDITION TO THE RAIN 
POTENTIAL...SOME STRONG SOUTHEASTERLY GRADIENT WINDS SUNDAY NIGHT 
WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME MOUNTAIN WAVES ALONG THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN AND FOOTHILLS OF EAST TENNESSEE. THIS WILL NEED TO BE 
MONITORED AS THE WEEKEND APPROACHES. 
 
SOME DRY SLOTTING WILL THEN BEGIN TO OCCUR BY MONDAY AFTERNOON... 
DECREASING THE RAIN POTENTIAL BY THE EVENING. MODELS ARE HINTING AT 
SOME WRAP AROUND MOISTURE GENERATING SOME LIGHT SHOWERS ACROSS 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA MONDAY NIGHT...SO HAVE 
KEPT CHANCE POPS IN UP THERE. A BROAD TROUGH WILL THEN REMAIN IN 
PLACE ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY THOUGH MOST OF THE WEEK 
AHEAD...PROMOTING BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND SOME SLIGHT CHANCES 
FOR PRECIPITATION  EACH DAY THROUGH AT LEAST THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK.

1037 AM EDT THU APR 3 2014

.DISCUSSION...EARLY MORNING CONVECTION IS ALMOST OUT OF OUR AREA.
FOLLOWING THE SAME IDEAS AS THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION IN THAT OUR 
AREA LOOKS TO BECOME CAPPED OFF THIS AFTERNOON AS 850MB 
TEMPS CONTINUE TO WARM. THIS SHOULD PROHIBIT DEVELOPMENT OF ANY 
AFTERNOON ACTIVITY ACROSS OUR AREA. MODELS DO SHOW NEW DEVELOPMENT 
THIS AFTERNOON TO OUR WEST...BUT AGAIN...I BELIEVE MOST OF THAT 
ACTIVITY SHOULD STAY TO OUR WEST AND NORTH. IF ANY AREA DOES SEE 
ACTIVITY IT SHOULD BE LIMITED TO EXTREME NETN AND INTO SWVA...WILL 
KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR THESE AREAS INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS.
VIS SAT SHOWS CLEAR SKIES BEHIND THE MORNING CONVECTION BUT CLOUDS
SHOULD BEGIN TO FILL BACK IN WITH MORE CLOUDS APPROACHING OUT OF 
THE SOUTHWEST. OTHERWISE...PREVIOUS FORECAST STILL LOOKS GOOD. 
NO MAJOR UPDATES PLANNED AT THIS TIME. WILL ISSUE NEW ZONES TO 
REMOVE MORNING WORDING. WILL ALSO TWEAK HOURLY TEMPS AND DEWPOINT.

430 AM EDT THU APR 3 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A SHORT WAVELENGTH TROUGH IS 
MOVING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH EARLY THIS MORNING. THE FEATURE IS 
UTILIZING SUFFICIENTLY MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIR IN PLACE ACROSS THE 
REGION LEADING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. SOME 
OF THE STORMS PRODUCED LARGE HAIL ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE BUT MODEL 
DEPICTION INDICATES INSTABILITY DECREASING TO A CERTAIN DEGREE 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH THE MORNING WITH THE 
ATMOSPHERE BECOMING CAPPED OFF MID DAY INTO THE AFTERNOON. WITH THIS 
IN MIND AND THE DEPARTURE OF THE UPPER TROUGH LATER THIS MORNING 
INTO THE AFTERNOON WOULD EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT DROP OFF IN 
PROBABILITY OF PRECIP. TWEAKED MAX TEMPS UP A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE 
GUIDANCE WITH INCREASING INSOLATION DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. MUCH 
OF THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD APPEARS TO BE DRY WITH DEEPER MOISTURE AND 
LIFT ARRIVING DURING THE DAY FRIDAY. HOWEVER...KEPT A TIGHT POP 
GRADIENT FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE PLATEAU EASTWARD IN 
CASE STRONG STORM SYSTEM SQUALL LINE RACES OUT AHEAD OF THE COLD 
FRONT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)... STORMS ARE EXPECTED TO BE 
APPROACHING OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD....WITH 
THE 14-19Z PERIOD BEING THE HEIGHT OF ACTIVITY IN OUR AREA. THE NE 
MOVEMENT OF THE UPPER LOW AND JET FROM THE PLAINS TOWARD THE GREAT 
LAKES WILL MEAN THAT SYNOPTIC FORCING WILL BE DIMINISHING THROUGH 
THE DAY...WHICH WILL HELP LIMIT THE THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS 
SOMEWHAT. CAPE VALUES ON FRIDAY ARE FAIRLY LOW...WITH MAX MUCAPE 
NEAR 800 J/KG SOUTH...HOWEVER DEEP LAYER SHEAR IS HIGH...AS IS 0-1 
KM HELICITY. LCL HEIGHTS ARE ALSO QUITE LOW IN OUR SOUTHERN 
COUNTIES. SO THERE WILL BE A THREAT OF SUPERCELLS WITH DAMAGING 
WINDS AND POSSIBLY TORNADOES. LOW WBZ HEIGHTS SUGGEST A MARGINAL 
HAIL THREAT AS WELL. THE THREAT SHOULD END BY LATE AFTERNOON...WITH 
POPS DROPPING OFF TO NIL AROUND MIDNIGHT AS DRIER AIR BUILDS IN 
BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. 

SATURDAY WILL BE A SUNNY BUT COOL DAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
OHIO VALLEY AND A SHORTWAVE RIDGE ALOFT. THIS PATTERN CHANGES 
QUICKLY HOWEVER...AS LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS OVER TX/OK ON 
SUNDAY...AND TRACKS NE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY THROUGH MONDAY. GFS 
AND ECMWF ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS SYSTEM. A WARM FRONT AND 
ISENTROPIC LIFT SPREADS RAIN BACK INTO OUR AREA SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 
MAX LIFT COMES SUNDAY NIGHT WITH FAVORABLE POSITIONING OF THE JET 
EXIT/ENTRANCE REGIONS OVER THE TN VALLEY ALONG WITH A NEGATIVE TILT 
TO THE 300-500 MB TROUGH...AND WILL MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE OF TSTMS 
THIS PERIOD. THE SURFACE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH ON MONDAY...BUT 
THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS PERSISTS THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE LONGWAVE 
TROUGH SLOWLY MOVES EAST. CLOUDY AND COOL CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED 
WITH THE LINGERING TROUGH FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.

AND INSTABILITY LOOK TO BE ON THE WEAK SIDE...STILL LOOKS LIKE
CHANCE POPS WARRANTED NORTH AND SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH LATE TONIGHT
INTO THURSDAY TIME FRAME WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER ALL ZONES.
EXPECT ANY PRECIP TO EXIT BY LATER THURSDAY WITH A DECREASE IN
CLOUDS. WILL STILL BE QUITE WARM. WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV
TEMPS...WHICH LOOK REASONABLE OVERALL.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...DEEPENING SURFACE
LOW TO MOVE FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS THURSDAY NIGHT TO THE GREAT
LAKES FRIDAY. MOST OF THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE ALONG
AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT ACROSS WESTERN AND MIDDLE TN THURSDAY NIGHT
WITH SOME SHOWERS AND STORMS SPREADING INTO WESTERN SECTIONS
OVERNIGHT. BETTER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY
MORNING AND INTO THE AFTERNOON. MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIR MASS AHEAD
OF FRONT WILL LEAD TO WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.
DAMAGING WINDS WILL BE THE MAIN THREAT BUT ISOLATED TORNADOES
POSSIBLE AS WELL. THE STORMS MAY BE WEAKENING AS THEY MOVE INTO THE
CWA FROM THE WEST IN THE MORNING...BUT COULD REDEVELOP AND GET
STRONG AS THEY MOVE INTO EASTERN AREAS.

SHOWERS AND STORMS MOVE EAST FRIDAY EVENING AND HIGH PRESSURE WILL
SLIDE IN FOR A SUNNY SATURDAY AND PARTLY CLOUDY SUNDAY. A SURFACE
LOW DEVELOPING OVER TX COAST SUNDAY WILL BRING UP OLD FRONTAL
BOUNDARY NORTH SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. THIS LOW DEEPENS AS IT
MOVES NORTH ACROSS LOWER MS VALLEY INTO THE GREAT LAKES. PRE
FRONTAL RAINS WILL BE LIKELY MONDAY AND THEN WRAP AROUND SHOWERS
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES COOLER
FRIDAY WITH CLOUDS AND PRECIPITATION. THEN COOLER ON THE WEEKEND

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...TODAY SHOULD BE ANOTHER DRY DAY 
ALTHOUGH SOME CIRRUS AND ALTO CU WILL BE ON THE INCREASE THROUGH THE 
DAY AS A SHORT WAVE TROUGH RIDES EAST NORTHEAST OUT OF THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. BOTH THE GFS AND NAM MOVE THIS WAVE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT HOWEVER THE GFS WAS LESS OPTIMISTIC WITH THE 
ABILITY OF THE SHORT WAVE TO PRODUCE SHOWERS ACROSS THE REGION. 
THEREFORE...STAYED WITH SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR MOST OF THE 
AREA. WENT A LITTLE HIGHER ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WHERE THERE IS 
A SMALL CHANCE FOR A BRIEF PERIOD OF THUNDER DUE TO PROXIMITY TO THE 
SLIGHTLY BETTER INSTABILITY. CONVECTIVE INHIBITION SHOULD BE A 
LITTLE TOO GREAT FARTHER EAST FOR THUNDER. STAYED RIGHT IN THE 
MIDDLE OF GUIDANCE MAXES TODAY WHILE EDGING MINS CLOSER TO THE 
MILDER NAM TEMPERATURES TONIGHT DUE TO THE EXPECTED INCREASE 
IN MID DECK CLOUDS. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL BE 
EXITING TO THE NE THURSDAY MORNING...AND WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS 
NORTH. BEHIND THIS EXITING TROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON...THERE WILL BE 
LITTLE IN THE WAY OF FORCING TO OVERCOME A STRONG CAPPING INVERSION 
THAT WILL BE IN PLACE. CIN IS STRONGEST OVER SOUTHERN AREAS...SO 
WILL REMOVE POPS FROM THAT AREA...WITH JUST LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCES 
NORTH WHERE THE CAP IS WEAKER. 

THE CAP BEGINS TO ERODE THURSDAY NIGHT...AND QG FORCING INCREASES 
FRIDAY MORNING AS THE UPPER TROUGH AND SURFACE FRONT APPROACH FROM 
THE WEST. HOWEVER FORCING IS NOT PARTICULARLY STRONG AS THE UPPER 
JET LIFTS NE ACROSS THE PLAINS AND MS VALLEY...AND INSTABILITY IS 
MARGINAL WITH MAX MUCAPE VALUES IN THE 500-800 J/KG RANGE WITH THE 
MORE UNSTABLE NAM. THERE IS SOME FAVORABLE 0-6 KM SHEAR...STEEP LOW 
LEVEL LAPSE RATES...AND LOW LCL HEIGHTS...SO THERE COULD BE A FEW 
STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLE WITH A THREAT OF ISOLATED 
TORNADOES. WINDOW OF TIMING FOR THE BEST THREAT LOOKS TO BE 15-21Z. 
GFS IS FASTER WITH THE FRONTAL EXIT FRIDAY EVENING THAN THE NAM BY 
ABOUT 3 HOURS...BUT EVEN THE NAM HAS IT THROUGH BY MIDNIGHT. WILL 
SPEED UP THE ENDING OF POPS AREAWIDE TO MIDNIGHT.

DRY AND SUNNY CONDITIONS WITH COOLER TEMPS ARE EXPECTED FOR SATURDAY 
AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE NW. THERE IS REASONABLY GOOD 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GFS AND ECMWF ON A DEEP TROUGH MOVING ACROSS 
THE PLAINS...WHICH INDUCES A LOW TO DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN MS 
VALLEY REGION. THIS LOW TRACKS NE ACROSS THE CAROLINAS THROUGH 
MONDAY. BOTH MODELS BEGIN TO SPREAD PRECIP INTO OUR AREA LATE SUNDAY 
AND SUNDAY NIGHT. WILL RAISE POPS TO LIKELY FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
MONDAY. THE DEEP UPPER TROUGH IS SLOW TO EXIT THE REGION...SO WILL 
KEEP CHANCE POPS IN THROUGH TUESDAY WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPS.

SOUTHERLY WINDS.  WARMING TREND CONTINUES THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH 
HIGHS ON WEDNESDAY REACHING INTO THE MID 70S TO AROUND 80.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...RAIN CHANCES CONTINUE 
FOR THE EARLY PARTS OF THE LONG TERM...ALTHO NOT THAT HIGH UNTIL 
LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...WHICH IS ALSO THE MAIN PERIOD FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS (A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE). TIMING OF FRONTAL PASSAGE 
LOOKS ON TRACK...SO WILL NOT MENTION ANY THUNDERSTORMS AFTER FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON WITH RAIN CHANCES FALLING SHARPLY FRIDAY EVENING.

SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE BRIEFLY BUILD OVER THE EASTERN STATES 
SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...KEEPING THIS OUR MAIN DRY PERIOD. 
LONGWAVE TROUGH STARTS TO BUILD ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SRN PLAINS BY 
SUNDAY...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM PROGGED TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE 
LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND GULF COAST REGION SUNDAY EVENING. THIS 
SYSTEM IS NOW INDICATED TO BE A MAJOR WEATHER MAKER FOR US INTO 
TUESDAY...WITH SOME AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS. THE 
MAIN CHANGE IN FORECAST GRIDS WAS TO GENERALLY INCREASE POPS FROM 
SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. NO SUPPORT FOR MORE THAN SHOWERS 
AND MUCH TOO WARM FOR ANY SNOW SHOWERS EVEN IN OUR HIGHEST TERRAIN 
FOR NOW. 

OTHERWISE...BREEZY TO WINDY CONDITIONS THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. 
TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO RUN ABOVE CLIMO FOR BOTH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY 
THEN FALL TO AROUND CLIMO FOR THE WEEKEND INTO MONDAY. SOME DEGREE 
OF CLOUDINESS AND COOLER TEMPS EXPECTED FOR TUESDAY AS THE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKS NE ACROSS THE MID-ATLANTIC AND NEW ENGLAND 
STATES AT THAT TIME. 00Z AND 12Z GFSX MOS NOT THAT FAR APART AND 
ALSO SIMILAR TO LATEST ECMX MOS...SO JUST MINOR TWEAKS WHERE NEEDED.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)... A VORT MAX WILL CROSS THE 
AREA THIS MORNING...BRINGING MAINLY MIDLEVEL CLOUDS TO THE AREA. 
MOST OF THE PRECIP SEEN ON RADAR IS NOT REACHING THE GROUND AS THE 
SURFACE TO 700 MB LAYER IS VERY DRY. ANY RAIN THAT DOES REACH THE 
GROUND WILL BE TOO ISOLATED AND LIGHT TO WARRANT ANY POPS THIS 
MORNING. WE SHOULD SEE MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES BY AFTERNOON...AND WITH A 
LOW LEVEL SW FLOW...TEMPS WILL WARM INTO THE MID AND UPPER 70S IN 
THE VALLEY. THIS PATTERN WILL PERSIST THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS A RIDGE 
SLOWLY DRIFTS EAST OFF THE GA/FL COAST. HIGHS MAY REACH 80 IN THE 
SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY ON WEDNESDAY. 

A SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS SHOWN BY THE NAM AND GFS TO MOVE THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. A PUSH OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BEHIND A 850 MB WARM 
FRONTAL FEATURE WILL PROVIDE ENOUGH MOISTURE TO BRING SOME LIGHT 
SHOWERS. A CHANCE OF SHOWERS CONTINUES THROUGH THURSDAY AS WE GET AN 
INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING...SUPPORTED BY SOME WEAK 
UPPER DIVERGENCE AND A STRENGTHENING LLJ. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW 
THE CAPPING INVERSION STRONGEST SOUTH AND EAST...AND WEAKEST NORTH 
AND WEST. WILL PATTERN POPS ACCORDINGLY...FROM SLIGHT CHANCES SE TO 
HIGH CHANCES NW...WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF TSTMS EVERYWHERE.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY AGREE 
THAT A RELATIVELY STRONG SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL BUILD NORTHEAST FROM 
THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES FROM THURSDAY EVENING 
THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING. ASSOCIATED DEEPENING SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY AND MODELS 
DEPICT SUFFICIENT SHEAR AND INSTABILITY FOR CONVECTIVE STORMS AHEAD 
OF THE FRONT. THIS EVENT IS STILL A FEW DAYS AWAY BUT THE 
POSSIBILITY EXISTS FOR A FEW STORMS TO PRODUCE DAMAGING WINDS AND AN 
ISOLATED TORNADO DURING THE DAY FRIDAY. THE FRONT SHIFTS STEADILY 
EAST FRIDAY NIGHT WITH A DECREASING CHANCE OF RAIN. THE DAYTIME 
PERIOD SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY STILL LOOKS DRY AS A SHORT WAVE RIDGE 
BUILDS ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES. ECMWF AND GFS SOLUTIONS 
DIVERGE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY SO FORECAST CONFIDENCE DIMINISHES 
TOWARD THE END OF THE LONG TERM. MODELS SHOW VARYING STRENGTHS AND 
SYSTEM TRACK WITH THE EARLY WEEK EVENT BUT GENERALLY TRY TO BRING 
ANOTHER SHORT WAVE TROUGH NORTHEAST FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ACROSS 
THE OHIO VALLEY. USED MEDIUM CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS DUE TO 
UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS SYSTEM.

.DISCUSSION...
MILD CONDITIONS ARE IN PLACE THIS EVENING ACROSS THE REGION DUE TO
THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE THAT WAS IN PLACE TODAY...WHICH ALLOWED
TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB WELL INTO THE 60S TO LOWER 70S. A SHORTWAVE
TROUGH TO THE WEST WILL CONTINUE TO APPROACH THE REGION OVERNIGHT.
AS A RESULT...DECKS OF MID TO HIGH-LEVEL CLOUDS WILL INCREASE
/ESPECIALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT/. THIS WILL PREVENT RADIATIONAL COOLING
FROM BEING AS PRONOUNCED AS WHAT WAS OBSERVED LAST NIGHT. AS A
RESULT...LOWS WILL BE 10-15 DEGREES WARMER THAN LAST NIGHT AS THE
MERCURY WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE 40S TO LOWER 50S ACROSS THE VALLEY.
MODELS ARE KICKING OFF SOME LIGHT QPF SIGNALS LATE TONIGHT AS THE
BRUNT OF THE SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE DECAYING
LIFT AND DRY BOUNDARY LAYER...HAVE HELD OFF ON ANY MENTIONABLE POPS
FOR NOW...AS THINK THIS WILL PRIMARILY BE SOME PASSING DENSER
CLOUD COVER PASSING THROUGH AROUND DAYBREAK.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
TEMPERATURES EARLY THIS MORNING ARE RUNNING A TAD COOLER THAN
FORECAST IN A FEW VALLEY LOCATIONS. PROJECTED LOW TEMPS ARE STILL
IN THE RANGE FOR POSSIBLE FROST...SO THE ADVISORY WILL BE
MAINTAINED UNCHANGED.

HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE SURFACE THROUGH 300 MB WILL BE OVER THE AREA 
TODAY...PROVIDING SUNNY SKIES AND WARMER TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 60S 
TO LOWER 70S IN MOST SPOTS. GFS MOS TEMPS SEEM A BIT ON THE WARM 
SIDE...SO WILL UNDERCUT IT BY A FEW DEGREES...CLOSER TO NAM MOS. 
TONIGHT THE RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS EAST OF THE AREA...AND A SW FLOW 
DEVELOPS THROUGH THE COLUMN. A WEAK TROUGH REFLECTED AT 700-500MB 
WILL MOVE THROUGH AFTER MIDNIGHT...WHICH SHOULD BRING SOME BROKEN 
HIGH TO MIDLEVEL CLOUDS. THIS WILL HOLD LOW TEMPS UP IN THE 40S IN 
MOST SPOTS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
A RETURN TO MORE WEST TO SOUTHWEST FLOW TUESDAY THOUGH FRIDAY WILL
ALLOW FOR SPRING-LIKE TEMPERATURES TO SPREAD INTO THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY. FOR LATE MONDAY AND TUESDAY...A NORTHERN STREAM UPPER
TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WITH ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT
PULLING INTO THE LOWER OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS...BUT UPPER
DYNAMICS WELL NORTH AND AIRMASS STILL STABLE. WILL KEEP FORECAST
DRY.

THIS BOUNDARY WILL LIFT BACK NORTH INTO THE OHIO VALLEY WITH 
SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT ANTICIPATED FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AHEAD OF A 
STRONGER SOUTHERN STREAM TROUGH EXITING THE ROCKIES INTO THE PLAINS. 
THE UPPER TROUGH AND CYCLOGENESIS WILL LIFT NORTHEAST INTO THE GREAT 
LAKES FOR FRIDAY WITH TRAILING COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY. AN OUTBREAK OF SEVERE STORMS ARE POSSIBLE OVER THE WESTERN/ 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE VALLEY FRIDAY...THEN SPREAD INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
LATE FRIDAY/FRIDAY EVENING.

WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR THIS POSSIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE 
WEEK AND WILL INCLUDE IN THE HWO. MAIN CONCERN WILL BE DAMAGING 
WINDS AND ISOLATED TORNADOES.

THIS SYSTEM PULLS EAST OF THE AREA FOR NEXT WEEKEND. WILL KEEP NEXT 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY DRY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
THE CLOSED UPPER LOW OVERHEAD AT THE MOMENT WILL BE EXITING THE AREA 
THROUGH THE MORNING. STABILIZATION AND DECREASING MOISTURE WILL 
LIKELY BRING AN END TO SNOW SHOWERS IN MOST SPOTS BY 12Z. WILL KEEP 
SOME POPS GOING FROM 12-15Z IN THE MOUNTAINS AND SW VA...BUT THERE 
SHOULD NOT BE MUCH MORE ACCUMULATION AFTER DAYBREAK. WITH SNOW STILL 
ONGOING AT THE MOMENT...WILL KEEP THE WSW RUNNING...BUT THIS MAY 
NEED TO BE UPDATED FOR CANCELLATION BEFORE 12Z.

OBS ACROSS THE AREA SHOW ONLY A FEW SPOTS WITH WINDS ABOVE 10 
MPH...AND NO GUSTS HIGHER THAN 25...WELL BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA. 
WINDS ARE ONLY EXPECTED TO WEAKEN THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING 
HOURS...SO WILL CANCEL THE WIND ADVISORY. 

THE CLOUD AND TEMPERATURE FORECAST WILL BE TRICKY TODAY...AND 
SATELLITE SHOWS EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER UPSTREAM...AND MODELS ARE 
LIKELY CLEARING CLOUDS OUT TOO QUICKLY THIS MORNING. WILL LEAN ON 
THE COOL SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE FOR HIGH TEMPS...ESPECIALLY NORTH. WE 
SHOULD SEE CLEAR SKIES EVERYWHERE BY LATE AFTERNOON...WITH CLEAR 
SKIES THROUGH THE NIGHT. LOW TEMPS TONIGHT WILL BE IN THE LOWER 30S 
IN THE NORTHERN HALF...AND LATER FORECASTS MAY NEED TO MONITOR THE 
NEED FOR A FREEZE WARNING OR FROST ADVISORY TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
A MORE WEST TO SOUTHWEST FLOW IS EXPECTED THROUGH THE EXTENDED
PERIOD. FIRST SHORT-WAVE MOVES EAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL
PLAINS THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES LATE MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY...BUT
LITTLE TO NO UPPER DYNAMICS AND LIMITED MOISTURE AND
INSTABILITY...SO KEPT FORECAST DRY.

A STRONGER UPPER TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE ROCKIES INTO THE PLAIN 
STATES FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WITH ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT 
MOVING ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. AIRMASS 
AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL BECOME MOIST AND UNSTABLE AS GULF MOISTURE 
PULLS NORTH. GFS AND ECMWF DIFFER ON TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM WITH THE 
GFS THE SLOWEST. WILL CALL FOR INCREASING CONVECTION FOR THURSDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. STRONG UPPER LEVEL JET WILL PLACE THE 
AREA UNDER FAVORED DIVERGENCE ALOFT LATE FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. 
SOUNDINGS SHOW DECENT DIRECTIONAL/SPEED SHEAR AS WELL. WILL CONTINUE 
TO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE STORMS LATE FRIDAY AND FRIDAY
NIGHT.

DUE TO WEST TO SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...A WARMING TREND WILL BE RULE

.DISCUSSION...
COLD AIR IS FILTERING INTO THE REGION QUICKLY THIS EVENING BEHIND A 
COLD FRONT...WITH A GOOD SET-UP FOR SOME LOCALLY HEAVY NORTHWEST
FLOW SNOW SHOWERS ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS...PARTICULARLY ALONG THE GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS. GIVEN
THE DEEP MOISTURE IN PLACE AND THE STRONG NORTHWEST FLOW COMPONENT
/WHICH WILL FURTHER ENHANCE THE OROGRAPHIC LIFT/...PERIODS OF
LOCALLY HEAVY SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THESE AREAS LATE
THIS EVENING AND THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. SNOWFALL AMOUNTS OF
AROUND 4 INCHES WILL BE COMMON IN THESE AREAS...WITH LOCALLY HIGHER
AMOUNTS POSSIBLE ABOVE 4000 FT OR SO. THUS...HAVE DECIDED TO
UPGRADE TO A WINTER STORM WARNING IN THESE AREAS. ADDITIONALLY...
NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW SHOWERS WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE THROUGHOUT THE
NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA. TOTALS OF 1 TO 3 INCHES WILL GENERALLY BE COMMON
THERE...AND MAINLY ABOVE 2500 FT. SOME LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS WILL
BE POSSIBLE...BUT WILL NOT BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO WARRANT AN
UPGRADE TO A WARNING.

THE AFOREMENTIONED SNOWFALL IS FORECAST TO IMPACT LOCATIONS AT OR 
AROUND 2500 FT. SOME LIGHT SNOW MAY BE POSSIBLE IN THE VALLEYS...
ESPECIALLY AT LOCATIONS DOWN TO 2000 FT OR SO. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE
WARM CONDITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR THE PAST SEVERAL
DAYS...DO NOT EXPECT MUCH IN THE WAY OF AN IMPACTS. MUCH OF THE
NORTHERN...CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY WILL REMAIN AT OR ABOVE
FREEZING OVERNIGHT AS WELL...SO NO IMPACTS ARE EXPECTED FROM ANY OF
THE FLURRIES THAT MAY MIX IN WITH THE LIGHT RAIN LATE TONIGHT AS
WELL.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER SOUTHWEST VA... 
WITH A COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWEST OF IT ACROSS THE GREAT TN 
VALLEY. THIS LOW WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHEASTWARD TONIGHT...WITH 
A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BEHIND IT BRINGING A STRONG NORTHWESTERLY 
WIND FLOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA. SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS THIS 
EVENING WILL EVENTUALLY TRANSITION TO SNOW SHOWERS TOWARDS MIDNIGHT 
AND THEREAFTER...WITH LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED IN THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS...MAINLY ABOVE 2500 FEET. IT APPEARS THAT TEMPS 
WILL REMAIN TOO WARM IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS FOR MUCH ACCUMULATIONS. 
WITH UPSLOPE FLOW ALSO ENHANCING PRECIP AMOUNTS IN THE MOUNTAINS... 
WILL ISSUE A WINTER WX ADVISORY FOR LATE TONIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING 
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA AND THE EAST TN 
MOUNTAINS. WILL ALSO ISSUE A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE EAST TN MOUNTAINS 
FOR LATE TONIGHT AND INTO SUNDAY MORNING...WHERE SUSTAINED WINDS 
WILL LIKELY BE ABOVE 25 MPH. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BEGINS TO BUILD OVER 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...WITH SOUTHERLY WINDS ON 
ITS BACK SIDE BRINGING A RAPID WARMING TREND ON MONDAY. AS FOR 
TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO WHERE 
SOME DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER 
THE AREA TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND DRY 
WEATHER. A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE AREA BY THURSDAY...WITH 
MODELS DISAGREEING ON TIMING OF ARRIVAL. ECMWF IS A LITTLE BIT MORE 
EXCITED BRINGING PRECIP AHEAD OF THE FRONT INTO THE AREA THURSDAY 
MORNING...AND CONVECTION THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING WHEN THE FRONT MOVES 
EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. 

SOUNDINGS SHOW AMPLE MID AND UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE...BUT LIMITED CAPE 
THROUGH THE DAY THURSDAY. WILL SEE ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ON 
FRIDAY TO INCREASE INSTABILITIES AND LOWER LCL HEIGHTS. DECENT WIND 
SHEAR IS PRESENT THROUGHOUT THE DAY FRIDAY. MID AND UPPER LEVEL WINDS 
WILL BE GREATER THAN 50 KTS...ESPECIALLY FRIDAY EARLY AFTERNOON. 
CONCERN WILL ALSO BE IF THESE WINDS GET PULLED DOWN TO THE SURFACE 
WITH THIS SYSTEM. FOR NOW...A FEW STORMS COULD BE STRONG TO 
SEVERE...BUT WILL NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THAT MOISTURE ARRIVAL. 
TEMPERATURES BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE COLD FRONT WILL BE A COUPLE 
OF DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL...COOLING TO NORMAL TEMPERATURES WITH THE 
COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
THE ONSET OF PRECIP WILL BE DELAYED FURTHER FROM PREVIOUS 
FORECAST...AS PRECIP ROTATING SLOWLY NE OVER MS/AL AT THE MOMENT 
WILL REACH OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES AFTER 10Z. LIFT OVER THE ENTIRE 
AREA WILL MAX OUT BETWEEN 12Z AND 18Z AS THE SURFACE TO 850 MB LOW 
TRACKS ACROSS KY AND JET ENTRANCE REGION PROVIDES UPPER DIVERGENCE. 
ONE POTENTIAL CONCERN IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONVECTION TO OUR 
SOUTH...WHICH COULD CUT OFF OUR MOISTURE FEED AND REDUCE PRECIP 
AMOUNTS. WILL LOWER QPF A BIT TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS...BUT STILL HAVE 
CATEGORICAL POPS. WEAK INSTABILITY SUGGESTS JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
TSTMS SOUTH. AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES ACROSS TONIGHT...STEEPENING LOW 
LEVEL LAPSE RATES WILL KEEP SCATTERED SHOWERS GOING OVERNIGHT IN 
NORTHERN AREAS...WITH SOME UPSLOPE FLOW ENHANCING PRECIP AMOUNTS IN 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. COLD ADVECTION DURING THIS TIME WILL CHANGE 
PRECIP TO SNOW...MAINLY AFTER 06Z. SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS AROUND 1 
INCH CAN BE EXPECTED...LOCALLY UP TO 2 POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHEST PEAKS 
OF THE SMOKIES AND AT HIGH KNOB.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
NORTHWEST FLOW AND WRAP- AROUND MOISTURE WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF
SNOW SHOWERS GOING ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE SUNDAY MORNING. UPPER TROUGH WILL
MOVE EAST OF THE AREA SUNDAY WITH PRECIPITATION ENDING AREA-WIDE BY
NOON WITH CLEARING SKY. A CHILLY NIGHT FOR SUNDAY NIGHT/MONDAY
MORNING DUE TO SURFACE RIDGING OVER THE AREA.

FOR MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...UPPER FLOW BECOMES WEST...THEN 
SOUTHWEST AS AN UPPER TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE ROCKIES INTO THE 
PLAINS. THICKNESS AND 850MB TEMPERATURES WARM WITH TEMPERATURES 
CLIMBING INTO THE 70S MOST LOCATIONS BY MID-WEEK. SURFACE RIDGING 
MOVING EAST OF THE AREA WILL ALLOW GULF MOISTURE TO PULL NORTH INTO 
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH INCREASING INSTABILITY AS WELL. 

AS THE UPPER TROUGH MOVES EAST FROM THE PLAINS TOWARD THE OHIO 
VALLEY...SURFACE LOW AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS FOR FRIDAY. INCREASING CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
FOR THURSDAY WITH THUNDERSTORMS ANTICIPATED FOR FRIDAY. DEPENDING ON 
TIMING OF FRONTAL BOUNDARY FRIDAY...STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS 
ARE POSSIBLE. WILL NEED TO WATCH FOR THE POTENTIAL OF WIDESPREAD 
SEVERE STORMS FOR THE END OF THE WEEK.

A WEAKENING COMPLEX OF THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER
THIS EVENING CONTINUES TO TRACK TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA AS AN
UPPER-TROUGH DEEPENS AND SHIFTS EASTWARD TOWARD EAST TENNESSEE
TONIGHT INTO SATURDAY. THOUGH WIND SHEAR VALUES WILL SUPPORT SOME
SHOWER/STORM ORGANIZATION...INSTABILITY VALUES REMAIN FAIRLY LOW.
AS A RESULT...THE STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL WILL BE
FAIRLY LOW. HOWEVER...THE THREAT FOR EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS WITHIN
THE ADVANCING SHOWERS WILL EXIST AFTER MIDNIGHT AS THE
AFOREMENTIONED ACTIVITY MOVES IN. GIVEN THE MOIST BOUNDARY
LAYER...THE INCREASING LIFT FROM THE APPROACHING TROUGH AND THE
CURRENT MOVEMENT OF THE SHOWERS/STORMS...HAVE MAINTAINED
CATEGORICAL POPS ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION AFTER MIDNIGHT. GIVEN
THE CLOUD COVER AND SOUTHERLY FLOW...LOWS TONIGHT WILL BE MILD AND
BOTTOM OUT IN THE 50S AREAWIDE.

ONLY A FEW LIGHT AND ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH 
A LARGE CONVECTIVE COMPLEX OVER THE NORTHERN GULF COAST REGION  
CUTTING OFF THE MOISTURE INFLOW INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY TODAY. AS A 
RESULT...EXPECT ONLY SCATTERED CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY THROUGH THE

AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY AND 
MOVES NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY SATURDAY MORNING. 
THIS LOW AND ITS ASSOCIATED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH SHOULD PRODUCE A GOOD 
COVERAGE OF CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY...WITH 
SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF 
A COLD FRONT SATURDAY MORNING. WILL MENTION SHOWERS AS THE

RAIN SHOWERS WILL BE SPREADING ACROSS THE AREA THIS MORNING IN 
ASSOCIATION WITH GOOD UPPER DIVERGENCE AND A STRONG LLJ. WILL KEEP 
THE WIND ADVISORY FOR THE MTNS IN PLACE AS OBSERVED WIND GUSTS HAVE 
BEEN NEAR 40 MPH. DRY LOW LEVEL AIR AT THE MOMENT WILL GRADUALLY 
MOISTEN THROUGH THE MORNING. BY THE AFTERNOON...SOME MIDLEVEL DRYING 
AND THE EXIT OF THE UPPER JET WILL LOWER PRECIP CHANCES. THE SURFACE

SOME STRONG FORCING ALOFT...WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF TSTMS. 
THE LOW WILL BE TO OUR NE SAT AFTERNOON...BUT THE 500 MB TROUGH WILL 
BE DELAYED UNTIL SATURDAY NIGHT. VORT ADVECTION AND COOLING MIDLEVEL 
TEMPS WILL KEEP SOME SHOWERS IN NORTHERN AREAS THROUGH SAT NIGHT. A 
TRANSITION TO SNOW WILL OCCUR IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. SOME LIGHT 
ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE WITH UPSLOPE NW FLOW BEFORE THE TROUGH 
AND MOISTURE EXITS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA SUNDAY. NORTHWEST FLOW
AROUND EXITING SURFACE LOW WILL PRODUCE SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS
ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE
SUNDAY MORNING...OTHERWISE CLEARING SKY.

FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...UPPER AND SURFACE 
RIDGING WILL PRODUCE DRY CONDITIONS WITH WARMING THICKNESS/850MB 
TEMPERATURES. UPPER FLOW WILL BECOME ZONAL FOR EARLY PART OF THE 
WEEK UNTIL BROAD UPPER TROUGH OVER THE ROCKYS MOVE EAST TOWARD THE 
PLAIN STATES BY MID-WEEK. 

A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES/JETS WILL MOVE EAST INTO THE PLAINS FOR 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH SOUTHERLY BOUNDARY LAYER JET INCREASING 
OVER THE MIDDISSIPPI AND WESTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY. THE LOW-LEVEL JET 
WILL PULL INCREASING MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY INTO THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK. 

FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
MID-WEST/UPPER OHIO VALLEY WITH ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT PULLING INTO 
THE WESTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY. WIDESPREAD THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP

OF THE FORECAST AREA ONCE AGAIN THIS MORNING THANKS TO THE COLD
AND DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE...ALONG WITH THE FAIRLY CALM WINDS AND
MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS EARLIER. AREAS OF MID TO HIGH CLOUDS WILL
OVERSPREAD THE REGION EARLY THIS MORNING AND INTO THE DAY
TODAY...WHICH WILL KEEP LOWS WARMER IN MOST LOCATIONS THAT LAST
NIGHT. WINDS WILL VEER TO THE SOUTHEAST AND QUICKLY INCREASE BY
MIDDAY...AND BECOME GUSTY AT TIMES BY THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS
A STRONG LOW-LEVEL JET PASSES TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE REGION OVER
MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND CENTRAL KENTUCKY. HOWEVER...WHILE WIDESPREAD
BREEZY CONDITIONS WILL EXIST /ESPECIALLY ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN
OF THE SMOKIES/...DO NOT THINK WIDESPREAD ADVISORY-LEVEL WINDS
WILL QUITE BE REACHED THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...SOME
LOCALLY STRONG GUSTS WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THESE MOUNTAINOUS
AREAS /WHILE THE VALLEYS SHOULD EXPERIENCE SOME BREEZY...BUT
WEAKER WIND SPEEDS/. THESE WINDS WILL ALSO HELP TO PUSH HIGHS INTO
THE LOW TO MID 60S IN MOST SPOTS BY THIS AFTERNOON...AND KEEP LOWS
TONIGHT ABOUT 15 TO 20 DEGREES WARMER THAN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT.

THE ATTENTION WILL THEN TURN TO AN UPPER-TROUGH THAT WILL PUSH
AREAS OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE
AREA LATE TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY. STRONG BULK SHEAR VALUES AND SOME
INSTABILITY MAY ALLOW FOR SOME STRONGER STORMS TO ORGANIZE AND
DEVELOP...PARTICULARLY DURING THE DAY ON FRIDAY. HOWEVER...ATTM
THE BEST INSTABILITY WILL BE DISPLACED WELL TO THE SOUTH AND WEST
SO THINK THAT THE SEVERE THREAT IS FAIRLY LOW. THE MAIN FORECAST
ADJUSTMENT FOR THIS PERIOD WAS TO INCREASE POPS TO CATEGORICAL
ALONG THE PLATEAU BETWEEN 09-12Z TONIGHT AND AREAWIDE FROM 12-18Z
FRIDAY...BEFORE GRADUALLY TAPERING THEM OFF FROM WEST TO EAST
DURING THE MID AFTERNOON TO EVENING. HIGHS FRIDAY WILL BE SLIGHTLY
COOLER GIVEN THE PRECIPITATION AND CLOUD COVER...BUT WILL STILL
PEAK IN THE LOWER 60S IN MOST SPOTS ALONG THE VALLEY.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
THREAT OF STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY
HAS GREATLY DIMINISHED WITH SPC DAY 2 OUTLOOK NOW KEEPING SLIGHT
RISK OF SEVERE STORMS CONFINED TO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
REGION. THIS MAKES SENSE AS LOW LEVEL SHEAR PROGGED TO BE ONLY
AROUND 25 KNOTS WITH THE MUCAPE ROUGHLY 400 J/KG OR LESS FOR FRIDAY
NIGHT...WITH EVEN LESS CAPE OVER NE TN AND SW VA. A BIT OF
INSTABILITY DOES LINGER INTO SATURDAY MORNING AND POSSIBLY SATURDAY
AFTERNOON...DEPENDING ON ACTUAL TIMING OF FRONTAL PASSAGE. I DID
DEPICT A BRIEF LOWERING OF POPS FOR 00Z TO 06Z SATURDAY...SHOWING A
BREAK BETWEEN EXITING CONVECTION FRIDAY AND THE APPROACH OF
ADDITIONAL CONVECTION FRIDAY NIGHT. PUSHED POPS BACK UP TO LIKELY
IN THE 06Z TO 12Z SATURDAY GRIDS...WITH PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER
GRIDS GENERALLY STILL ON TRACK FOR SATURDAY.

OTHERWISE...SEE NO REASON NOT TO KEEP SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY DRY 
AT THIS TIME. MODELS ACTUALLY IN BETTER AGREEMENT ON THIS THAN 24 
HOURS AGO. UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGE STILL THE DOMINANT FEATURES FOR 
OUR REGION INTO MONDAY. LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS OVER MID-MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY REGION ON MONDAY THEN TRACKS NE INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. 
THIS DEVELOPS S-SW LOW LEVEL FLOW FOR MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY... 
WHICH SUPPORTS WARMER MINS AND MAXES. MORE RIDGING FOR WEDNESDAY SO 
ANOTHER DRY PERIOD. THE 27/00Z GFSX MOS REFLECTS THESE WARMER TEMPS 
FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...SO I NUDGED TEMPS UP A BIT BUT STAYED CLOSE TO 
NWS NEIGHBORS GRIDS AS WELL. DAY SHIFT CAN MAKE FURTHER TWEAKS UP 
WITH TEMPS IF NEEDED.

310 PM EDT WED MAR 26 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY... 
WITH A VERY DRY AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS HIGH PRESSURE 
AREA WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY DRIFT EASTWARD OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS TONIGHT...WITH CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS CREATING 
ANOTHER UNSEASONABLY COLD NIGHT. HIGH CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO 
INCREASE FROM THE SOUTHWEST OVERNIGHT...WHICH SHOULD HELP TO KEEP 
TEMPS ABOVE FREEZING AROUND THE CHATTANOOGA AREA. OTHERWISE...TEMPS 
SHOULD FALL BELOW FREEZING EVERYWHERE ELSE...AND WILL CONTINUE THE 
FREEZE WARNING FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY AREAS WHERE THE SPRING FREEZE 
PROGRAM HAS BEEN BEGUN DUE TO BLOOMING VEGETATION. AS THE HIGH MOVES 
FURTHER EAST OFF THE CAROLINA COAST ON THURSDAY...SOUTHERLY WINDS ON 
ITS BACK SIDE WILL BRING A QUICK WARMING TREND OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. A COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE MS RIVER 
VALLEY ON THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION AHEAD OF IT 
BRINGING SHOWERS...MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY WILL DEVELOP OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...AS THE COLD FRONT STALLS 
OUT AROUND THE FORECAST AREA. AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS 
IS THEN PROGGED TO DEVELOP A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY FRIDAY NIGHT...WHICH WILL PRODUCE A GOOD COVERAGE OF 
CONVECTION THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SOME RELATIVELY MINOR 
DIFFERENCES IN MODELS THROUGH THE PERIOD WHICH FEATURES A COUPLE OF 
SYSTEMS THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO PRODUCE SOME SHOWERS. THE FIRST WILL 
BE A STRENGTHENING SHORT WAVE EMERGING FROM THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 
FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL SHIFT 
NORTHEAST FROM THE TENNESSEE VALLEY OF ALABAMA LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA BY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON SATURDAY. THE LOW 
WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AND MODEL FORECASTS 
GENERATE SOME WEAK INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THE FRONT SO MAINTAINED A 
CHANCE FOR CONVECTION DURING THIS PERIOD. MORE SHORT WAVE ENERGY 
BUILDS SOUTHEAST ACROSS MAINLY THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUFFICIENTLY DEEP MOISTURE WILL BE AVAILABLE 
FOR LIFTING SO KEPT A CHANCE OF SHOWERS GOING ACROSS THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN AREAS INCLUDING SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
AND ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. A NICE PERIOD OF RIDGING SHOULD 
KEEP DRY WEATHER IN PLACE WITH A WARMING TREND TO START OUT THE NEW 
WEEK BUT THE MODELS SWING A COLD FRONT BACK ACROSS THE REGION ON 
TUESDAY. BOTH THE ECMWF AND THE GFS CONTINUE TO SHOW LIMITED 
MOISTURE RETURN AHEAD OF THE FRONT SO WENT AHEAD AND MAINTAINED 
CONTINUITY WITH THE PREVIOUS FORECAST KEEPING DRY CONDITIONS IN 
PLACE FOR THIS FEATURE. AN AMPLIFYING UPPER RIDGE MOVES IN FOR THE 
FINAL DAY OF THE PERIOD WHICH MAY ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB 
SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. TRIED NOT TO GO TOO WARM FOR WEDNESDAY 
...DUE TO UNCERTAINTY AT THIS TIME RANGE...ADJUSTING TEMPERATURES 
JUST A FEW DEGREES AHEAD OF CLIMATOLOGY.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
AN ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM HAS PROMOTED MOSTLY CLEAR...CALM
AND DRY CONDITIONS OVER A GOOD PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA EARLY
THIS MORNING. THE ONE EXCEPTION IS FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA WHERE SOME LIGHT NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW SHOWERS ARE
CONTINUING ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN THERE. AM EXPECTING THIS
ACTIVITY TO CONTINUE TO WANE OVER THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT...BUT
SOME VERY LIGHT SHOWERS MAY PERSIST THROUGH DAYBREAK. THE COLD AIR
HAS ALSO ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO PLUMMET INTO THE 20S THIS
MORNING...SO HAVE A FREEZE WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE CENTRAL AND
SOUTHERN VALLEYS THROUGH 10 AM EDT.

THE MAIN STORY FOR TODAY WILL BE THE COOL AND DRY AIR IN PLACE
ASSOCIATED WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED ARCTIC HIGH. NORTHERLY
WINDS...ALONG WITH THIS COLDER AIR WILL KEEP HIGHS IN THE 40S
ACROSS THE AREA TODAY...WITH SOME AREAS IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA ONLY
REACHING THE UPPER 30S...ABOUT 20 TO 25 DEGREES BELOW SEASONABLE
NORMALS FOR LATE MARCH. THE INITIAL CLEAR...CALM AND DRY
CONDITIONS WILL ALLOW FOR EXCELLENT RADIATIONAL COOLING AGAIN
TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL QUICKLY FALL AFTER SUNSET AND DROP
BELOW THE FREEZING MARK AFTER MIDNIGHT ACROSS MUCH OF THE CENTRAL
AND SOUTHERN VALLEY ONCE AGAIN. THE ONE CHALLENGE WAS EVALUATING
HOW THE INCOMING CLOUD COVER LATE TONIGHT...ALONG WITH WINDS
VEERING TO SOUTHEAST WILL INFLUENCE TEMPS ALONG THE SOUTHERN
PLATEAU AND VALLEY. THINK THAT MOST OF THE VALLEY AREAS WILL STILL
REACH CRITERIA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HAMILTON...BRADLEY AND
SEQUATCHIE AND MARION DUE TO THE AFOREMENTIONED FACTORS.
THUS...HAVE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL FREEZE WARNING FOR MOST OF THESE
SAME AREAS ONCE AGAIN FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH EARLY THURSDAY
MORNING.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
UNSETTLED AND PROGRESSIVE PATTERN EARLY IN THE LONG RANGE...BUT
GOOD NEWS IS WARMER AND CLOSER TO CLIMO TEMPS THROUGH THE PERIOD.
FIRST CHANCE OF RAIN STILL LOOKS TO BE LATE THURSDAY NIGHT IN
WESTERN AREAS AND GENERALLY AREA- WIDE ON FRIDAY INTO EARLY FRIDAY
NIGHT...ASSOCIATED WITH SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND COLD FRONT. THE TRACK
OF THE SHORTWAVE AND LIMITED INSTABILITY DOES NOT SUPPORT MUCH OF A
MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS FOR NOW. SLIGHT CHANCE OF TSRA IN PREVIOUS
GRIDS FOR FAVORED AREAS LOOKED GOOD.

THE SECOND SYSTEM SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES RATHERLY QUICKLY ON 
THE HEELS OF THE EXITING SYSTEM...PER MODEL CONSENSUS. HOWEVER...I 
FELT THERE WILL BE AT A LEAST A BRIEF BREAK (6 HOURS OR SO) BEFORE 
SHOWERS ADVANCE AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM. AGAIN...NOT SEEING MUCH 
SUPPORT FOR MENTIONING THUNDERSTORMS. THUS...TWEAKED POP AND WEATHER 
GRIDS A BIT...SHOWING A DECREASE IN POPS FROM 06Z TO 12Z SATURDAY. 
GFSX AND ECMX MOS POPS CONTINUE TO RUN NEAR CATEGORICAL FOR 
SATURDAY...BUT I PREFERRED TO STAY WITH A SOLID LIKELY GIVEN THE 
POSSIBILITY OF TIMING ISSUES. 

SOME WEAK SIGNALS OF SLIGHT POPS NEEDED FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY
...BUT MODELS SHOW A LARGE DEGREE OF VARIABILITY LATE IN THE PERIOD.
KEEPING A DRY FORECAST FOR NOW FROM SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT.
SOMETHING TO WATCH AND ADJUST AS NEEDED.

FOR TEMPS...MIN TEMPS CERTAINLY RECOVER IN THE LONG TERM FROM THE 
FROSTY MINS OF RECENT. MOS GUIDANCE GENERALLY CONSISTENT FROM 25/12Z 
TO 26/00Z RUN...AND CLOSE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS. I DID CONTINUE TO 
SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT MAX TEMPS ON DAYS WITH HIGH RAIN CHANCES AND ALSO 
SUNDAY AS THE SURFACE RIDGE IS SETTLING OVER THE REGION AND HEIGHTS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...SHORT-WAVE WITH COLD AIR
ALOFT IS MOVING ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE. RADAR SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF
SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY DUE TO THE ASSOCIATED COLD AIR ALOFT...
PRODUCING A GOOD DEAL OF LOW-LEVEL INSTABILITY. AREA OBSERVATIONS
AND WEBCAMS SHOW SNOW IS ACCUMULATING ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
LIKELY OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN AS WELL. GIVEN MODELS KEEPING SNOW
SHOWERS OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THROUGH
AT LEAST 03Z...WILL CONTINUE ADVISORY THERE.

SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OVER THE REST OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WILL BE BETWEEN 1/2 AND 1 INCH AND MAINLY ON
GRASSY SURFACES.

AS WE APPROACH SUNSET...LOW-LEVEL INSTABILITY WILL LESSEN WITH SNOW 
SHOWERS DIMINISHIHG. LOW-CLOUDS WILL SLOPE DISSIPATE FROM
SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST OVERNIGHT. CLEAR SKIES ANTICIPATED AREA-WIDE
BY MID-MORNING WEDNESDAY. WILL MAINTAIN FREEZE WARNING AS A HARD
FREEZE IS EXPECTED.

WINDS WILL REMAIN GUSTY THIS AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING AS PRESSURE 
GRADIENTS TIGHTEN AND DOWNDRAFTS FROM SCATTERED SHOWERS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A DEEP SW FLOW DEVELOPS OVER THE AREA WED NIGHT AS THE RIDGE AXIS 
SHIFTS EAST. MIDLEVEL MOISTURE INCREASES THU WITH A SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
PASSAGE...BUT DRY AIR BELOW 700 MB SHOULD HOLD OFF PRECIP UNTIL THE 
LLJ ADVECTS HIGHER THETA-E AIR INTO THE AREA THU NIGHT. THE COLUMN 
WILL BE WELL SATURATED BY FRI MORNING...WITH LIFT PROVIDED BY UPPER 
DIVERGENCE IN THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET AND GOOD 850 MB 
CONVERGENCE. WILL HAVE CATEGORICAL POPS THU NIGHT/FRI. ONCE THESE 
FEATURES PASS...WE MAY SEE A LULL FRI NIGHT...THEN THE MAIN UPPER 
TROUGH MOVES THROUGH SAT. WILL RAISE POPS INTO THE LIKELY RANGE FOR 
SAT. THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH SAT AFTERNOON. SOME MOISTURE 
WRAPPING AROUND THE BACK OF THE LOW COULD KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH 
SAT NIGHT. 

A BUILDING RIDGE WILL PROVIDE DRY AND SUNNY CONDITIONS FOR SUN...BUT 
COOL TEMPS BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. TEMPS WILL WARM TO THE LOWER 70S 
IN THE VALLEY BY MON AS THE RIDGE MOVES EAST. THERE ARE BIG 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GFS AND ECMWF FOR TUE. ECMWF TRACKS A CLOSED 
LOW ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY...WHILE THE GFS SHOWS A FAST-MOVING COLD 
FRONT WITH LITTLE MOISTURE. FOR NOW...WILL KEEP TUE DRY AS 
CONFIDENCE IS LOW.

.DISCUSSION...NEXT SHORT-WAVE WITH COLD AIR ALOFT IS MOVING ACROSS
THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS. RADAR SHOWS ANOTHER AREA OF
PRECIPITATION ACROSS CENTRAL KENTUCKY AND MIDDLE TENNESSEE. THIS
AREA OF PRECIPITATION IS DEPICTED WELL BY THE GFS...WHICH SHOWS

SOME DAYTIME HEATING THIS MORNING WITH PLENTY OF BREAKS IN THE

ALOFT WITH 300MB TEMPERATURES AT OR BELOW 30 DEGREES CELCIUS...
I EXPECTED PLENTY OF SHOWERS.

VERTICAL TEMPERATURE PROFILE SUGGEST A GOOD DEAL OF SNOW SHOWERS
WITH SOME MIXING WITH RAIN...MAINLY OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS APPROACHING
WESTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH LIFT DEVELOPING...SPREADING
LIGHT PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU INTO THE VALLEY
COUNTIES JUST NOW. HOWEVER...SURFACE DEW POINT TEMPS CONTINUED TO
RUN MUCH LOWER THAN MOS GUIDANCE. THIS AIRMASS IN PLACE IS QUITE
DRY SO MUCH OF THE RADAR ECHOES ARE STILL EVAPORATING BEFORE
REACHING THE SURFACE. THIS MAKES THE LATEST HEAVIER QPF FOR TODAY
QUESTIONABLE...SO I STUCK WITH LIQUID AMOUNTS AROUND 1/10 OR LESS
FROM 12Z TO 18Z...THEN 0.05 OR LESS FROM 18Z TO 00Z. 

OTHERWISE...PREVIOUS SNOW AMOUNTS AND ADVISORY AREAS LOOKED GOOD
OVERALL. I DID ADD WISE AND SCOTT COUNTIES OF SW VA INTO THE NRN
MOST WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY AND EXTENDED THAT ONE OUT TO 21Z
TODAY. SOME WRAP AROUND MOISTURE IS INDICATED WITH MOISTURE RUNNING
UP TO 600 MBS OR SO INTO THE AFTERNOON...PLUS SOME 20 KNOTS OR SO
OF UPSLOPE LOW LEVEL FLOW. NOT MUCH CHANGE IN GENERAL ELSEWHERE.
UNDERCUT MOS MAX TEMPS BY SEVERAL DEGREES DUE TO STRONG COLD AIR
ADVECTION THIS AFTERNOON.

FOR TONIGHT...CLEAR OR DECREASING CLOUDS AND VERY COLD FOR LATE
MARCH...TEENS TO MID 20S. THUS...UPGRADED THE FREEZE WATCH AREAS TO
A FREEZE WARNING. UPDATED WSW AND NPW PRODUCTS TO FOLLOW.


.LONG TERM.../WEDNESDAY THOUGH MONDAY/...IN WAKE OF THE FRONTAL
SYSTEM THAT WILL PASS THROUGH THE REGION ON TUESDAY...A RIDGE OF
HIGH PRESSURE WILL QUICKLY BUILD INTO THE REGION AND NORTHWESTERLY
WINDS WILL REINFORCE A DOME OF COLD AIR...RESULTING IN HIGHS AND
LOWS RUNNING SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW SEASONABLE NORMS. THE HIGH ON
WEDNESDAY WILL STRUGGLE TO CLIMB OUT OF THE LOW TO MID 40S IN MOST
LOCATIONS...WITH LOWS BOTTOMING OUT IN THE 20S ONCE AGAIN IN MANY
AREAS DESPITE THE AMPLE SUNSHINE. ADDITIONALLY...THE DRY AIR WILL
ALSO LEAD TO RH VALUES PLUMMETING TO 20 TO 30 PERCENT IN THE
AFTERNOON. WINDS WILL QUICKLY SHIFT TO THE SOUTH ON THURSDAY AHEAD
OF THE NEXT FRONTAL SYSTEM HOWEVER...WHICH WILL QUICKLY PUSH HIGHS
BACK INTO THE 60S AND INCREASE GULF MOISTURE ACROSS THE AREA. THIS
WILL SET THE STAGE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVING INTO THE
REGION THURSDAY NIGHT AND ESPECIALLY FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT AS
THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA. AFTER A SLIGHTLY COOLER DAY ON
SATURDAY...A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL QUICKLY BUILD IN FOR SUNDAY
AND MONDAY...PROMOTING MOSTLY CLEAR AND DRY CONDITIONS. HIGHS WILL
CLIMB WELL INTO THE UPPER 60S AND LOWER 70S BY EARLY NEXT WEEK.

310 PM EDT MON MAR 24 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...ACTIVE SHORT-TERM. SATELLITE
SHOWS A FAIRLY STRONG SHORT-WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS
WITH DECENT PRESSURE FALLS AHEAD OF THE WAVE. STRONG UPPER JET OVER
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL HELP STRENGTHEN AN INVERTED TROUGH OVER
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TONIGHT WITH INCREASING FRONTO-GENETIC
FORCING. INITIALLY AIRMASS IS QUITE DRY...BUT WITH MOISTURE
CONVERGENCE ALONG INVERTED TROUGH...BOUNDARY LAYER WILL MOISTEN
WITH PRECIPITATION DEVELOPING OVER THE SOUTHERN AREAS AROUND
06Z...THEN SPREADING NORTHEAST. LIKELY-CAT POPS FOR THE FAR EASTERN
COUNTIES FROM CHEROKEE-CLAY NC TO RUSSELL-WASHINGTON COUNTIES VA.
LESSER CHANCES FAR WEST.

TEMPERATURE PROFILE FAVORABLE FOR SNOW ACROSS THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS...GENERALLY AT OR ABOVE 2500 FEET...EXCEPT FOR THE
NORTHEAST SECTIONS...SUCH AS THE TRI-CITIES WERE SNOW ACCUMULATIONS
ARE EXPECTED...MAINLY GRASSY AND ELEVATED SURFACES. HAVE ISSUED A
WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR THESE AREAS.

FOR TUESDAY...FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING MOVES EAST OF THE AREA BY
15Z...HOWEVER...MODELS SHOW ANOTHER WAVE MOVING SOUTHEAST INTO THE
AREA WITH 500MB TEMPERATURES DROPPING TO -30 DEGREES C. THE COLD
AIR ALOFT WILL PRODUCE SCATTERED RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS OVER THE AREA.
THESE SHOWERS WILL PRODUCE GUSTY AFTERNOON WINDS UP TO 30-35 MPH.

ALSO...WINDS WILL BECOME NORTHWESTERLY PRODUCE OROGRAPHIC LIFT INTO
THE WESTERN SLOPES OF THE FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS INTO THE
EVENING HOURS TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE 
PATTERN...AND REVEAL THE MAIN PRECIP-MAKERS FOR THE FORECAST AREA 
BEING A COLD FRONT ON FRIDAY AND AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH ON SATURDAY. 
A LARGE DOME OF ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING...BRINGING 
UNSEASONABLY COLD TEMPS SOME 15 TO 20 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. AS A 
RESULT...WILL ISSUE A FREEZE WATCH FOR THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL 
VALLEY AREAS WHERE THE SPRING FREEZE PROGRAM HAS STARTED...BUT THE 
ENTIRE FORECAST AREA CAN EXPECT A HARD FREEZE ON WEDNESDAY MORNING. 
AS THIS HIGH DRIFTS EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY...A 
WARMING TREND WILL THEN QUICKLY DEVELOP FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK. IN 
FACT...BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS INDICATE SOME WEAK INSTABILITY 
DEVELOPING ON FRIDAY AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. WHILE THIS 
COLD FRONT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY...AN 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO SWING ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
BEHIND IT ON SATURDAY. AS A RESULT...SOME LINGERING CONVECTION WILL 
STILL BE POSSIBLE ON SATURDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND COOLER THAN 
THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE 
IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...QUITE A BIT OF SIGNIFICANT
WEATHER CRAMMED INTO THE FIRST 2 PERIODS OF THE FORECAST GRIDS
THIS MORNING. RAIN IS ON THE WAY...MOVING QUICKLY ENE THROUGH
MIDDLE TN AND LIKELY REACHING OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES IN THE NEXT
1 TO 2 HOURS. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SUGGEST SNOW FOR MUCH OF SW VA
AND FAR NRN MTNS OF E TN FROM 12Z TO 16Z TODAY...BUT LIGHT QPF AND
SUCH WARM TEMPS AHEAD OF THE RAIN...DON'T SUPPORT MUCH IN THE WAY
OF ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL. I DID ADD SNOW SHOWERS TO A LARGER PART
OF SW VA AND PARTS OF JOHNSON CARTER AND UNICOI COUNTIES THIS
MORNING. MAX TEMPS MAY OCCUR JUST AROUND 12Z TODAY IN OUR NWRN
AREAS...AND MAY MAX OUT THIS MORNING BEFORE STEADY OR FALLING IN
THE AFTERNOON ELSEWHERE.

FOR TONIGHT...MIN TEMPS IN THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S LOOK ON TRACK 
FOR THE SRN AND CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES OF E TN (WHERE FROST/FREEZE 
PROGRAM HAS BEEN ACTIVATED)...AND CERTAINLY MUCH COLDER OVER ALL NRN 
AREAS. OPTED TO UPGRADE THE FREEZE WATCH TO A FREEZE WARNING...SINCE 
OUTLYING RURAL AREAS SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES COLDER THAN THE 30 TO 
32 DEGREE MINS EXPECTED AT TYS AND CHA ASOS SITES.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MONDAY HIGH PRESSURE WITH
COLD BUT DRY AIR MASS WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES COOL AGAIN MONDAY.
SKIES SHOULD STAY MOSTLY SUNNY SO WITH THE HIGHER SUN ANGLE
TEMPERATURES WILL STILL CLIMB TO THE UPPER 40S TO MID 50S. FOLLOWED
CLOSER TO COOL NAM GUIDANCE. FAST MOVING CLIPPER SYSTEM TO AFFECT
THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING. CLOUDS
INCREASE MONDAY EVENING WITH PRECIPITATION STARTING AFTER MIDNIGHT.
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN LOWER ELEVATIONS HAVE A COLD RAIN TUESDAY INTO
TUESDAY NIGHT...POSSIBLY WITH SOME LIGHT SNOW MIXED IN. HIGHER
ELEVATIONS FROM THE SMOKIES NORTH INTO VIRGINIA CHANGE RAIN TO SNOW
TUESDAY MORNING. AMOUNTS OF A COUPLE INCHES OF SNOW IN THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS WITH TRACE TO AROUND ONE HALF INCH LOWER ELEVATIONS OF
NE TN AND SW VA STILL LOOK POSSIBLE. DID NOT CHANGE SNOWFALL AMOUNT
GRIDS SIGNIFICANTLY. TUESDAY NIGHT TEMPERATURES TAKE NOSE DIVE
AGAIN FROM BELOW 20 HIGHER ELEVATIONS MOUNTAINS TO 20S ELSEWHERE.
FREEZE WATCH AGAIN LIKELY TO BE ISSUED MONDAY AND LOWS EVEN COLDER
THAN TONIGHT. WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT BELOW NORMAL
TEMPERATURES CONTINUE AS COLD AIR MASS MOVES OVERHEAD. SURFACE HIGH
BEGINS TO SHIFT EAST WITH MUCH WARMER TEMPERATURES THURSDAY. A
SURFACE LOW DEVELOPING EAST OF THE ROCKIES WILL BRING UP A WARM AND
MOIST AIR MASS FROM THE GULF INTO THE REGION FRIDAY. A DEEPENING
SURFACE LOW THEN MOVES FROM THE MS VALLEY TO THE GREAT LAKES AND
SOUTHERN CANADA FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY. ECMWF IS FAST WITH THE SYSTEM
BUT GFS SLOWS THE FRONT DOWN AS IT MOVES SOUTH HANGING IT UP OVER
THE TN VALLEY THROUGH SATURDAY. ADDED THUNDERSTORMS TO FORECAST
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY TO FOLLOW SLOWER SOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM.

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A WEAK COLD FRONT CURRENTLY
MOVING THROUGH THE AREA IS EXPECTED TO SLOW DOWN A BIT AS A LOW
PRESSURE DEVELOPS IN THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THE CLOUD SHIELD
CURRENTLY OVER MIDDLE AND EAST TENNESSEE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST
WITH GREAT SPEED LEADING TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES THIS EVENING. THE
BIG RAIN FOR THIS WEEKEND WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND
FAR SOUTHEAST TN BETWEEN 4 AND 6 AM...THEN UP THE VALLEY REACHING
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA BETWEEN 6 AND 8 AM.

OVERALL LIGHT RAINFALL AMOUNTS EXPECTED WITH LOCALLY HEAVIER AMOUNTS 
POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF I40. WITH THE UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE 
AND FORCING IN PLACE...EXPECTING THE MAIN RAIN EVENT TO LAST THROUGH 
2 PM THEN TAPERING OFF FROM WEST TO EAST. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A BIT 
COLDER THROUGH THE DAY THAN THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS AS THE COLD AIR 
FILTERS IN BEHIND THE FRONT. SOUNDINGS FOR HIGH KNOB AND HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS IN WISE AND LEE COUNTIES IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA ARE JUST 
BELOW FREEZING OR RIGHT AT THE FREEZING MARK. SO WITH 
THIS...ACTUALLY LOOKING AT A DUSTING TO HALF OF AN INCH OF SNOW IN 
THESE COUNTIES...WITH HIGH KNOB RECEIVING UP TO ONE INCH OF SNOW  
EPENDING ON THE ARRIVAL TIME OF THE COLD AIR. WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY 
MENTION IN A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT FOR NOW TO VIEW MORE MODEL 
RUNS AND VIEW THE CONSISTENCY OF THIS EARLY COLD AIR ARRIVAL. AS THE 
SYSTEM MOVES EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS IN THE LATE AFTERNOON...SKIES 
WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR WITH TEMPERATURES DROPPING. EXPECTING WINDY 
CONDITIONS WITH GUSTS UP TO 20 MPH ON SUNDAY AS THIS FRONT EXITS THE 
AREA.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS SUNDAY NIGHT.
AREA FRUIT TREES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND CENTRAL AND
SOUTHERN TENNESSEE VALLEY HAVE BLOOMED MAKING THEM SUCEPTIBLE TO
FREEZE DAMAGE...SO A FREEZE WATCH HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR EARLY MONDAY
MORNING.

NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEMS WILL COME TOGETHER FOR MONDAY
NIGHT AND TUESDAY WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN AND/OR SNOW...ESPECIALLY
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THE GFS AND ECMWF DIFFER ON THE
STRENGTH OF THE TWO SYSTEMS WITH THE GFS STRONGER WITH THE SOUTHERN
WAVE AND ECMWF WITH THE NORTHERN SYSTEM. EITHER WAY...LIGHT SNOW
ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR EASTERN
TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS. THIS SYSTEM WILL PULL EAST TUESDAY NIGHT.

UPPER FLOW WILL BECOME SOUTHWEST BY THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK
WITH A WARMING TREND. ANOTHER SYSTEM PULLS INTO THE AREA FOR LATE
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY
THUNDERSTORMS.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND THURSDAY/...LARGE SHIELD OF STRATOCUMULUS 
OVER WESTERN AND CENTRAL PARTS OF THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON. FOR 
POPS...GOING WITH SLIGHT CHANCE OVER THE NORTHERN 1/3 OF THE VALLEY 
AREA TONIGHT...WITH POSSIBILITY OF SPRINKLES ABOUT AS FAR SOUTH AS 
KNOXVILLE. COLD FRONT SHOULD BE WASHING THROUGH THE AREA AROUND 
MIDNIGHT...AND FRONT SHOULD TAKE SPRINKLES AND CLOUDS OUT OF THE 
AREAS.
 
SLIGHT FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS THURSDAY AS RH VALUES FLIRT WITH THE 
20S IN THE AFTERNOON.  FORTUNATELY WINDS WILL BE GETTING LIGHTER 
THROUGH THE DAY.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
AN ACTIVE PATTERN WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE WEEK AHEAD AS A SERIES
OF TROUGHS WILL PASS THROUGH THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS. THIS
WILL PROMOTE SOME CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION...ALONG WITH BELOW
NORMAL TEMPERATURES FROM SUNDAY THROUGH MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. AHEAD
OF THE FIRST FRONT...WHICH IS PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA
SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. AHEAD OF THE INITIAL WEAK COLD
FRONT...SOME BREEZY SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS WILL HELP TO PUSH HIGHS
WELL INTO THE UPPER 60S AND LOWER 70S ON FRIDAY...AND MID TO UPPER
60S ON SATURDAY. SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL THEN MOVE THROUGH THE
AREA SATURDAY EVENING AND NIGHT WITH THE FRONT...AND COULD LINGER
INTO SUNDAY /ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY/. HOWEVER...NO
SUBSTANTIAL PRECIPITATION  AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED FROM THIS EVENT.

THE MAIN STORY ACROSS THE REGION NEXT WEEK WILL BE THE PERSISTENT
COOL TEMPERATURES AS A BROAD TROUGH SETS UP ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES
AND OHIO VALLEY. THIS WILL MAINTAIN A SOMEWHAT BREEZY WNW TO NW
FLOW ACROSS THE AREA AND REINFORCE THIS COOLER AIR MASS.
PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL RETURN ON TUESDAY AS ANOTHER WEAK FRONT
PUSHES THROUGH THE REGION. THE COLDER AIR BEHIND THIS SYSTEM MAY
ALLOW FOR SOME SNOW TO MIX IN WITH THE RAIN...ESPECIALLY  ACROSS
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. HOWEVER...NO SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION 
AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED WITH THIS STORM SYSTEM EITHER AS THE BEST
MOISTURE/LIFT WILL BE DISPLACED TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE AREA.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY/...
CLOUD COVER CONTINUES TO HANG ON OVER A GOOD CHUNK OF THE
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEYS THIS AFTERNOON
DESPITE SOME DRIER AIR MOVING INTO THE REGION AND WINDS VEERING
TOWARD THE SOUTH. HOWEVER...A LARGE BIT OF EROSION HAS TAKEN PLACE
ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA WHERE MOSTLY
CLEAR AND SUNNY CONDITIONS ARE PREVAILING. TEMPERATURES HAVE
CLIMBED INTO THE UPPER 50S IN THESE AREAS AS OF MID-AFTERNOON...
WHILE THEY ARE REMAINING IN THE UPPER 40S AND LOWER 50S UNDER THE
DENSE CLOUD CANOPY TO THE SOUTH. FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE
AFTERNOON...THESE CLOUDS SHOULD SLOWLY CONTINUE TO ERODE TOWARD
THE SOUTH AND WEST...WITH AT LEAST SOME BREAKS OCCURRING ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND VALLEY BY THIS EVENING.

SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL REMAIN IN PLACE OVERNIGHT...WITH SOME CLOUD
COVER REMAINING IN PLACE OR RETURNING TO THE NORTHERN ZONES LATER
TONIGHT. SOME MORE SUBSTANTIONAL CLEARING WILL THEN OCCUR
THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY AS WINDS INCREASE AND VEER TO THE
SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING WEAK COLD FRONT FROM THE WEST.
THE ADDITIONAL HEATING AND THESE SOUTHERLY WINDS SHOULD ALLOW
TEMPERATURES TO WARM INTO THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S BY THE
AFTERNOON. ADDITIONALLY...SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE
AS THIS SHORTWAVE PASSES THROUGH...MAINLY ALONG THE PLATEAU AND THE
CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. GUIDANCE HAS BACKED OFF
ON POPS...SO HAVE FOLLOWED SUIT SOMEWHAT IN THE GRIDS...SCALING
THEM BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE IN THESE AREAS.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN
THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A QUIET
PATTERN OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. HIGH
PRESSURE IS PROGGED TO BUILD OVER THE SOUTHEAST FOR THE END OF THIS
WEEK...WITH A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON
SATURDAY. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS INDICATE SOME MARGINAL
INSTABILITY DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF THIS COLD
FRONT...SO WILL MENTION A CHANCE OF TSTORMS ON SATURDAY. A BROAD
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS THEN EXPECTED TO SLIGHTLY AMPLIFY OVER THE
EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION BY EARLY NEXT WEEK... WHICH IS THEN
PROGGED TO DEVELOP A WEAK SURFACE LOW ALONG THE NORTHERN GULF
COAST. MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW MAY BE PULLED NORTHWARD
INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...BUT WILL
MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NOW SINCE THE FORECAST AREA IS
EXPECTED TO BE ON THE NORTHERN EDGE OF THIS PRECIP AREA. AS FOR
TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE
NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH IS IN BETTER
AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING FORECAST THIS MORNING AS QUESTIONS EXIST AS
TO THE EXTENT OF CLEARING THAT WILL TAKE PLACE LATER TODAY. CURRENT
TRENDS SHOW DRY AIR FROM THE ADVANCING RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE HAS
SLOWLY BEGUN TO ERODE THE CLOUD SHIELD...ESPECIALLY ALONG THE
MOUNTAINS WHERE PARTLY/MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS ARE TAKING PLACE.
HOWEVER...THE NORTHEAST FLOW DOWN THE VALLEY HAS HELPED TO MAINTAIN
THE LOW STRATUS DECK ALL NIGHT AND SHOULD KEEP IT IN PLACE ACROSS
PARTS OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THROUGH AT LEAST THE EARLY TO MID
AFTERNOON. WINDS WILL GRADUALLY VEER TO THE SOUTHEAST AND
EVENTUALLY SOUTHWEST LATER IN THE DAY AND EVENING WHICH WILL HELP
TO ERODE THESE CLOUDS. THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR SOME HEATING TO TAKE
PLACE AND TEMPERATURES TO RISE INTO THE MID 50S IN MOST LOCATIONS
BY THE AFTERNOON /WITH SOME AREAS APPROACHING 60 DEGREES ACROSS
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND ALONG THE VALLEYS PARALLELING THE
MOUNTAINS.

DRIZZLE AND LOW CLOUDS CONTINUE TO LINGER ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS AND TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON IN THE WAKE OF A
COLD FRONT THAT MOVED THROUGH THE REGION ON SUNDAY. THE
NORTHEASTERLY FLOW IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION...COMBINED WITH THE
DENSE CLOUD COVER HAS HELPED TO KEEP TEMPERATURES IN 40S IN MOST
AREAS TODAY...AND WELL BELOW SEASONABLE AVERAGES. THROUGH SOME
DRIER AIR IS SLOWLY BEGINNING TO FILTER INTO TO WESTERN AND MIDDLE
TENNESSEE...MODELS ARE INDICATING THAT THIS VERY MOIST BOUNDARY
LAYER WILL PERSIST OVERNIGHT AND INTO THE MORNING ON TUESDAY. THIS
WILL RESULT IN THE LOW CLOUDS LIKELY LINGERING THROUGH THE MID TO
LATE MORNING HOURS ON TUESDAY. LOW STRATUS DECKS OF A FEW HUNDRED
FEET OR LESS AND SOME PATCHY FOG ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE
REGION BY LATE THIS EVENING AND LINGER THROUGH DAYBREAK AS WELL.
THEREAFTER...THE AFOREMENTIONED DRIER AIR AND SOME RIDGING WILL
HELP TO ERODE AWAY THIS CLOUD COVER AND WINDS BEGIN TO VEER TO THE

THE GULF MOVES INTO THE REGION FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY MORNING...WITH 
A COLD FRONT SWEEPING THROUGH AND STRONG HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO 
THE REGION BY SUNDAY.

WITH THE FRONT ON SATURDAY THERE MAY BE ENOUGH RETURN FLOW MOISTURE

LIGHT RAIN CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS THE REGION LATE THIS
MORNING...WITH LOW CLOUDS AND SOME LIGHT FOG KEEPING TEMPERATURES
IN THE MID 30S TO LOWER 40S IN MOST AREAS. HOWEVER...SOME LOCALIZED
AREAS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA ARE STILL LINGERING AT OR AROUND
THE FREEZING MARK. AS A RESULT...SOME LIGHT FREEZING DRIZZLE WILL
BE POSSIBLE /PARTICULARLY ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS OF THE
CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS/ THROUGH NOON BEFORE TEMPERATURES CREEP UP A
DEGREE OF TWO AND THE PRECIPITATION BEGINS TO WANE. THE LIGHT
NORTHEASTERLY FLOW WILL PERSIST THROUGHOUT THE DAY...AND ALONG WITH
THE DAMP BOUNDARY LAYER AND DENSE CLOUD COVER WILL KEEP
TEMPERATURES FROM CLIMBING NO HIGHER THAN ABOUT 5 TO 10 DEGREES
MORE BY THE AFTERNOON. HIGHS IN THE LOW TO MID 40S WILL BE PROBABLE
WITH LOCATIONS ALONG THE SOUTHERN VALLEY...CREEPING CLOSER TO 50

LINGER OVER THE REGION THROUGH THE SHORT TERM PERIOD.  BEST FORCING 
FOR PRECIP WILL BE EARLY TODAY...SO WILL CARRY CAT TO LIKELY POPS 
ALL BUT FAR WEST ZONES EARLY...THEN DIMINISHING TO SLIGHT OR LOW 
CHANCE POPS LATE. MAY STILL BE A FEW PATCHES OF FREEZING RAIN OVER 
PARTS OF NORTHERN PLATEAU/NORTHWEST PARTS OF SW VA EARLY...BUT STILL 
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THERE WILL BE MUCH CHANCE OF SIGNIFICANT 
ICING...SO WILL JUST CONTINUE SPS. FOR TONIGHT NOT EXPECTING MUCH 
MORE THAN SOME PATCHY DRIZZLE AND PLENTY OF CLOUDS.  WILL GENERALLY 
GO A BIT BELOW MAV TEMPS FOR TODAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE MODELS GENERALLY AGREE ON 
THE LONG TERM PERIOD WHICH STARTS OUT WITH A MAINLY DRY TUESDAY. 
KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS GOING ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS 
WHERE SOME DEEPER MOISTURE LINGERS VICINITY OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
ALONG WITH SOME WEAK LIFT. NEXT UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT GLIDE EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON WEDNESDAY. IT 
STILL APPEARS SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE WILL BE LACKING AHEAD OF THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...
THE NEXT FEW HOURS LOOK TO BE MAINLY DRY ACROSS MOST OF THE 
AREA...ASIDE FROM SOME SCATTERED SPRINKLES. EXPECT THAT PRECIP 
CHANCES/AMOUNTS WILL INCREASE AGAIN LATER TONIGHT...MOST LIKELY 
AFTER MIDNIGHT AS A TROWAL FEATURE DEVELOPS ACROSS SW VA/NE TN ON 
THE NW SIDE OF THE SURFACE LOW THAT TRACKS ACROSS NRN GA. THE MODELS 
DIFFER ON HOW MUCH COLD AIR IS ABLE TO WORK ITS WAY IN FROM THE 
NW...WITH THE NAM BEING COLDER THAN THE GFS IN SW VA. THE NAM SEEMS 
TO HAVE A TENDENCY OF LATE TO OVERDO COOLING AND FROZEN PRECIP...BUT 
WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION A CHANCE OF LIGHT IP/FZRA IN WISE 
COUNTY...AND ADD A CHANCE OF IP IN THE NORTHERN PLATEAU COUNTIES. 
THE WINDOW FOR ICING IS VERY SMALL...MAINLY 09-13Z...AND CONFIDENCE 
IS LOW THAT THERE WILL BE ANY ACCUMULATION...SO WILL FOREGO AN 
ADVISORY AT THIS TIME AND ISSUE A SPS FOR WISE. 

MODELS ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE TODAY TO BRING DRIER AIR IN FROM THE WEST 
BEHIND THE UPPER TROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...WITH MOISTURE CONFINED TO 
A SHALLOW LAYER AND NO LIFT TO SPEAK OF. THUS POPS WILL BE DROPPED 
AFTER 18Z. SOME PARTIAL CLEARING FROM THE WEST MAY OCCUR MONDAY 
NIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
AS SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE MOVES UP FROM THE SOUTHEAST COAST
EARLY TUESDAY SKIES WILL BE SLOW TO CLEAR FROM THE SOUTHWEST TO
NORTHEAST. A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS ALONG THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS
TUESDAY THEN ONLY IN SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA TUESDAY NIGHT.
SURFACE LOW AND UPPER FLOW BECOMES MORE SOUTHWESTERLY AS SURFACE
HIGH MOVES EAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN GULF AND RETURN FLOW AROUND IT
COMBINED WITH COUNTER CLOCKWISE FLOW AROUND SURFACE LOW TO THE NW
BRING DRYING SOUTHWEST WINDS INTO REGION LATE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY
NIGHT. THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES IN THE
AFTERNOON WESTERN AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS.

AS THE WEAK SHORTWAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SURFACE LOW APPROACHES
OVERNIGHT TUESDAY NIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL STAY WARMER. CLOUDS AND
RAIN WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL KEEP HIGHS DOWN SOMEWHAT WEDNESDAY BUT
ONLY SMALL AMOUNT OF RAIN AND LOW RAIN CHANCES. HIGH PRESSURE TO
RECLAIM THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY.
LOWS WILL BE IN THE 30S AND HIGHS RISING TO THE MID 50S TO MID 60S
THURSDAY AND MID 60S TO NEAR 70 FRIDAY. MODELS BRING NEXT UPPER

.DISCUSSION...
WARM ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT ARE SPREADING PRECIP ACROSS THE
AREA THIS MORNING...BUT WE ARE SEEING THE DRY SLOT JUST SOUTH OF
OUR AREA. MODELS...ESPECIALLY THE NAM...ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE THIS
MORNING IN BRINGING MIDLEVEL DRYING TO THE AREA THIS
AFTERNOON...AND THUS FAR THIS ALIGNS WITH WHAT WE ARE SEEING ON
RADAR. ALSO INTERESTING TO NOTE IS THE NE-SW ALIGNMENT OF
CONVECTION NEAR THE GULF COAST...WHICH TENDS TO CUT OFF GULF
MOISTURE AND REDUCE PRECIP AMOUNTS IN OUR AREA. THERE IS ALSO A
GOOD DOWNSLOPE FLOW IN THE VALLEY THIS MORNING AS EVIDENCED BY
WARMER TEMPS AT TRI...VJI...AND LNP. THESE FACTORS SUGGEST THAT
PRECIP WILL BE GRADUALLY TAPERING OFF THIS AFTERNOON FROM SW TO NE.
WILL ADJUST POPS AND QPF DOWN SLIGHTLY. TEMPS WILL ALSO BE ADJUSTED
TO BRING THEM CLOSER TO CURRENT OBS...WARMER IN THE NORTH DUE TO
DOWNSLOPING AND COOLER SOUTH WHERE RAIN HAS BEEN FALLING.

MORE REASONABLE BUT WILL STILL INCLUDE CHANCE OF SLEET AND A BIT OF

MOISTURE AND SO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS WERE APPLIED AT MID WEEK. SOME 
LATE WORK WEEK RIDGING AND DRY ADVECTION SHOULD ALLOW FOR A DECENT

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND 
TRACKS EAST...ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM WILL BE SPREADING 
CLOUDS INTO SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA THIS EVENING. STRONGER 
FORCING IN THE 850 MB CONVERGENCE ZONE AND UPPER DIFFLUENCE IN THE 
JET EXIT REGION WILL PROVIDE MODERATE PRECIP BEGINNING IN THE 09-12Z 
WINDOW...AND SPREAD NORTHWARD THROUGH THE MORNING. 

THE NAM AND GFS CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFERENCES WITH REGARD TO THE 
TIMING OF THE EXITING LIFT/MOISTURE SUNDAY EVENING...WITH THE GFS 
BEING FASTER. IT PUTS US FIRMLY IN THE DRY SLOT BETWEEN 21-
00Z...LEAVING ONLY DRIZZLE OR VERY LIGHT RAIN. NAM SHOWS SOME DRYING 
ALOFT OCCURRING AFTER 00Z...BUT NOT AS DRAMATICALLY AS THE GFS. WILL 
LEAN TOWARD THE GFS AND TREND POPS DOWNWARD AFTER 21Z...BUT STAY IN 
THE LIKELY RANGE WITH LOW QPF AMOUNTS THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. A TROWAL 
FEATURE APPEARS IN THE NAM AND GFS SUNDAY NIGHT...WHICH MAY INCREASE 
PRECIP AMOUNTS AGAIN IN THE 06Z-12Z WINDOW ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS. 

ALSO DURING THIS TIME...THE NAM RAPIDLY COOLS THE 1000-850 MB LAYER 
ON THE NW SIDE OF THE 850 MB LOW CENTER...SUGGESTING A PERIOD OF 
SLEET/FZRA IN SW VA AND THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AREA. THE GFS IS 
PROFILE WARMER INITIALLY...BUT STILL DROPS BELOW FREEZING IN THIS 
LAYER BRIEFLY AROUND 12Z. WILL ADD A CHANCE OF SLEET TO THE PLATEAU 
AND PARTS OF SW VA. IF THE NAM IS CORRECT...ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE...BUT WILL NOT ISSUE ANY ADVISORIES AT THIS TIME AS 
CONFIDENCE IS LOW AND STILL 36+ HOURS OUT.

MOISTURE DEPTH DECREASES RAPIDLY MONDAY MORNING...AND LIFT IS WEAK 
AT THIS TIME...WHICH SHOULD LOWER POPS TO JUST A LOW TO SLIGHT
CHANCE IN THE AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)... MOISTURE LINGERS
MONDAY NIGHT AS BACK EDGE OF SYSTEM SLOWLY MOVES UP THE EAST COAST.
AS TEMPERATURES COOL MONDAY NIGHT MIXTURE OF SLEET OR A LITTLE
LIGHT SNOW POSSIBLE NE TN AND SW VA AS SYSTEM DEPARTS. SNOW OR
POSSIBLY SLEET AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE VERY LIGHT SO DID NOT ADD ANY

BUT LOWER 30S NORTHEAST SECTIONS. TUESDAY WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS
IN FROM THE WEST AND AT THE SAME TIME SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS OVER THE
CENTRAL PLAINS. CLOUDS MAYBE SLOW TO MOVE OUT BUT HIGHS WARM TO THE
LOWER 50S TO LOWER 60S. SOUTHWEST WINDS MAY INCREASE AS SURFACE LOW
DEVELOPS TO THE NW BY TUESDAY NIGHT. NORTHERN SYSTEM MOVING THROUGH

INTO THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY WITH MUCH WARMER
TEMPERATURES...MOSTLY 60S AND A CHANCE OF SHOWERS WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING INTO 
THE REGION TODAY WILL RETREAT AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM APPROACHES 
TONIGHT.  SHOULD SEE QUITE A BIT OF SUN TODAY...BUT CLOUDS WILL 
INCREASE LATE TODAY AND TONIGHT AS MOISTURE STREAMS IN...AND RAIN 
WILL PUSH IN FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST OVERNIGHT.  WILL CARRY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS NORTH BY LATE TONIGHT...WITH CATEGORICAL POPS 
SOUTH. GFS TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...SOME DIFFERENCES NOTED IN THE 
MODELS THROUGHOUT THE LONG TERM PERIOD ALTHOUGH MAIN DIFFERENCES NOT 
SEEN UNTIL ABOUT MIDDLE PART OF NEXT WEEK WHEN THE GFS IS A GOOD SIX 
HOURS AHEAD OF THE ECMWF WITH A COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE. A LEADING 
NORTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE BUILDS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY NIGHT WITH CATEGORICAL POPS FOR THE RAIN EVENT. A 
TRAILING SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE KEEPS THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS GOING 
THROUGH THE DAY MONDAY WITH POPS FINALLY TAPERING OFF LATER MONDAY 
NIGHT. THERE COULD BE ENOUGH COLD AIR SPILLING INTO THE NORTHERN 
REACHES OF THE FORECAST AREA LATE MONDAY NIGHT FOR THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SOME LIGHT SNOW IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AS THE BACK EDGE OF THE 
DEEPER MOISTURE SHIFTS INTO THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC REGION. DRIER AIR 
BUILDS IN ON TUESDAY WITH SOME RIDGING AHEAD OF THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT 
UPPER TROUGH. BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THE CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL BE 
BACK IN THE FORECAST AS WARMER AIR IS LIFTED OVER THE RETREATING 
COOLER AIRMASS ACROSS REGION. A BETTER CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE IN 
PLACE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS ANOTHER COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. MUCH OF THE RAIN MAY END PRIOR TO DAYBREAK 
THURSDAY BUT BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTY IN FRONTAL TIMING KEPT SOME 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING INTO THURSDAY MORNING. ANOTHER PERIOD OF 
RIDGING WITH DRY ADVECTION MAY ALLOW FOR A RETURN TO SUNSHINE AND 
WARMER TEMPERATURES ON FRIDAY.

TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED ISENTROPIC LIFT ARE PRODUCING SHOWERS (MAINLY

WINDS QUITE STRONG ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)... AS A BROAD TROUGH
APPROACHES AND THE UPPER JET NOSES INTO WEST AND MIDDLE TN...WE
WILL SEE INCREASING HIGH AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS THIS EVENING. THE
LACK OF MOISTURE WILL PREVENT ANY CHANCE OF PRECIP WITH THE TROUGH
PASSAGE TONIGHT. THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE
AREA SATURDAY MORNING...AND SETTLE ACROSS THE TN/GA BORDER BY THE
AFTERNOON. THIS MAY KEEP SOME CLOUDS IN SOUTHERN AREAS TOMORROW
AFTERNOON...WHILE NORTHERN AREAS SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY. MOST
VALLEY LOCATIONS WILL REACH THE MID TO UPPER 60S.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...GRADUAL INCREASE IN 
MOISTURE SATURDAY NIGHT AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
MOVES NORTH AS A WARM FRONT. SURFACE LOW DEEPENING OVER THE LOWER MS 
VALLEY SUNDAY MORNING WILL THEN RAPIDLY SPREAD RAIN SHOWERS EAST 
TOWARD THE APPALACHIANS. RAIN SPREADS NORTHEAST DURING THE DAY. NAM 
MODEL SHOWS A DRY SLOT FORMING WITH THE LOW AS IT MOVES EAST 
NORTHEAST ACROSS TN SO RAINFALL COULD TAPER OFF FROM SOUTHWEST TO 
NORTHEAST BY LATE IN THE DAY. ECMWF AND GFS ARE SLOWER WITH THE 
SPEED OF THE SURFACE LOW AND MUCH FARTHER SOUTH WITH ITS PROGRESS 
EAST WHICH WOULD KEEP STEADY RAIN OVER MUCH OF EAST TN THROUGHOUT 
THE DAY. DIGGING UPPER TROUGH ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE SYSTEM BRINGS 
IN COLDER AIR LATE SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. THIS COULD BRING A 
LITTLE SNOW TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND NORTHEAST BUT TEMPERATURES 
MAY NOT BE QUITE COLD ENOUGH FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATION. 
PRECIPITATION MOVES OUT BY LATE MONDAY. HIGHER PRESSURE TO RETURN 
TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY. A WEAK SYSTEM TO AFFECT THE REGION WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT INTO THURSDAY AND THEN FAIR WEATHER FRIDAY. LOWS SATURDAY 
NIGHT MOSTLY IN THE 40S. SUNDAY WENT BELOW GUIDANCE WITH HIGHS MID 
40S HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO MOSTLY LOWER TO MID 50S ELSEWHERE. SUNDAY

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
REGION WILL CONTINUE TO SHIFT EAST.  AN APPROACHING AND WEAKENING 
COLD FRONT MAY MAKE IT INTO NORTHERN AREAS LATE TONIGHT. CLOUDS WILL 
INCREASE OVER THE AREA...BUT APPEARS MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED AND 
FORCING WEAK SO NO PRECIP EXPECTED DURING THE SHORT TERM PERIOD.  
WINDS WILL BE GUSTY FROM THE SOUTHWEST THIS AFTERNOON...AND MINIMUM 
RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES WILL BE GENERALLY IN THE 20S. WHILE THERE 
ARE FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS...AT THIS TIME IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT RED 
FLAG WARNING CRITERIA WILL BE MET. WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV 
TEMPS...WHICH LOOK REASONABLE OVERALL.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS NOT TOO DISSIMILAR 
THROUGH ABOUT TUESDAY EVENING BUT THEN DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED 
BETWEEN THE ECMWF AND GFS. INITIALLY A WEAKENING SHORT WAVE BUILDS 
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES ON LATER SATURDAY INTO 
SUNDAY. TRIMMED POPS BACK SIGNIFICANTLY IN TERMS OF PROBABILITY AND 
TIMING ON SATURDAY LEAVING JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A SHOWER ACROSS 
THE EXTREME SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...A 
DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH WITH A STRONG UPPER JET ROUNDING THE BASE OF 
THE TROUGH WILL AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF...A LOWER TENNESSEE VALLEY 
TRANSITING...HEALTHY SURFACE LOW LATER SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
SUNDAY. NICE MOISTURE ADVECTION OFF THE GULF WILL BE IN PLACE AHEAD 
OF THE SYSTEM TO PRODUCE A MASS OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. MORE CHILLY 
AIR BUILDS IN BEHIND THE SYSTEM SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AND THERE 
COULD BE A FEW SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS LATE SUNDAY 
NIGHT INTO MONDAY AND THEN AGAIN MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY AS AN 
ENERGETIC SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM TRAILS THE WEEKEND STORM SYSTEM. 
FINALLY...A BRIEF PERIOD OF RIDGING KEEPS THE FORECAST AREA DRY 
TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY BUT THE NEXT UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED 
FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL BE DRIVING EAST INTO THE REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
INTO THURSDAY (PREFERRED THE SLOWER ECMWF OVER THE GFS HERE). STAYED 
WITH LOW TO MEDIUM CHANCE POPS FOR THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST DUE 
TO UNCERTAINTY AT THIS TIME RANGE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER THE 
AREA TODAY WILL SHIFT TO OUR EAST OVERNIGHT. SKIES WILL BE CLEAR
TONIGHT...BUT HIGH CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE FROM THE WEST
TOMORROW AS THE JET STREAM MOVES INTO WEST TN. A SW FLOW WILL
GRADUALLY STRENGTHEN THROUGH THE DAY AS A TROUGH/FRONT MOVE
EASTWARD ACROSS THE PLAINS. THIS WILL TIGHTEN THE PRESSURE GRADIENT
ONCE MORE...AND WINDS WILL BE PICKING UP TO 10-15 MPH. WITH MIN RH
VALUES IN THE 20S...FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS WILL BE A CONCERN.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...AS WITH YESTERDAY'S 
DISCUSSION...THE MAIN STORY THROUGH THE LONG TERM WILL BE DEALING 
WITH A TRICKY WEEKEND FORECAST DUE TO A DISORGANIZED 300MB FLOW 
CAUSED BY A SPLIT FLOW PATTERN. 

FRIDAY NIGHT WE WILL REMAIN IN ZONAL FLOW WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT 
SLOWLY APPROACHING FROM THE NORTHWEST. MODELS SHOW THE FRONT SLOWLY 
DRAGGING THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...WITH ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
PRECIP ACROSS NETN AND INTO SWVA. LATER ON SATURDAY A WARM FRONT 
WILL BEGIN TO SLOWLY LIFT NORTHWARD INTO OUR AREA THAT IS ASSOCIATED 
WITH A SHORTWAVE COMING OUT OF TEXAS. THE WARM FRONT WILL PROVIDE A 
CHANCE FOR SOME LIGHT SHOWERS AREA WIDE AS THE LIFT WILL GENERALLY 
BE WEAK. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME A DEVELOPING TROUGH IS TAKING SHAPE 
ACROSS THE PLAINS ALONG WITH A NEW WAVE OF ENERGY THAT BEGAN DROPING 
OUT OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST ON FRIDAY.  AGAIN...THIS IS WHERE THE 
FORECAST BECOMES TRICKY.
 
THE ECMWF WANTS TO BETTER DEVELOP THIS SYSTEM...COMPARED TO PREVIOUS 
RUNS OF THE GFS...WHICH WOULD INCREASE AND PROLONG PRECIP ACROSS OUR 
AREA...WITH PRECIP LASTING THROUGH MONDAY MORNING. WHEREAS THE 
LATEST GFS IS NOW SHOWING SOMETHING NEW...A LOW DEVELOPING ACROSS 
THE GULF COAST STATES AND SWINGING WELL SOUTH OF OUR AREA AND ACROSS 
THE COASTAL CAROLINAS. THE LATEST NAM DOESN'T CAPTURE THE ENTIRE 
WEEKEND...BUT DOES GO THROUGH MONDAY 00Z AND APPEARS TO BE MORE IN 
LINE WITH THE ECMWF. REGARDLESS OF HOW THE WEEKEND SYSTEM 
EVOLVES...IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THE SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY 
NIGHT TIME PERIOD LOOKS TO BE WET AND WILL THEREFORE INCREASE POPS 
INTO THE LIKELY CATEGORY. THERE IS STILL THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME SNOW 
SUNDAY EVENING INTO MONDAY MORNING. STILL NOT GOING TO THROW OUT ANY 
AMOUNTS AS THEY SEEM TO CHANGE WITH EACH MODEL RUN DUE TO THE 
UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS SYSTEM. IF THERE IS GOING TO BE ANY 
ACCUMULATION...IT WILL LIKELY BE LIMITED TO EXTREME NETN AND INTO 
SWVA. MOST AREAS COULD SEE UP TO HALF AN INCH OF LIQUID PRECIP WITH 
THE WEEKEND SYSTEM AND SOME AREAS EVEN MORE.

MODELS SHOW CLEARING CONDITIONS FOR MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT AS THE 
WEEKEND SYSTEM MOVES OFF TO THE EAST. MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
SHOULD BE QUIET WEATHER AS WE WILL RETURN TO A MAINLY ZONAL FLOW. 
THE NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES SOMETIME DURING THE WED/THURSDAY TIME 
FRAME...DEPENDING ON WHICH MODEL YOU LOOK AT...AND WILL BRING US OUR 
NEXT CHANCE OF PRECIP. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL CONTINUE THE PREVIOUS 
TREND OF STAYING CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH SATURDAY 
NIGHT...BUT WILL THEN TREND CLOSER TO THE ENSEMBLE MEANS THEREAFTER 
DUE TO PATTERN UNCERTAINTY (WHICH ARE COOLER THAN THE GFS NUMBERS).

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
333 PM EDT WED MAR 12 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A COLD FRONT IS EXITING TO THE EAST...AND GUSTY WINDS HAVE DEVELOPED 
ACROSS THE AREA AS THE DEEPENING SURFACE LOW TRACKS INTO THE CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS. SEVERAL OBS SITES ARE SHOWING WINDS ABOVE ADVISORY 
CRITERIA...AND THIS IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE EVENING. THE 
CURRENT END TIME OF 03Z FOR THE ADVISORY LOOKS GOOD. 

TEMPS ARE FALLING RAPIDLY BEHIND THE FRONT AS STRONG COLD ADVECTION 
SPREADS INTO THE AREA. LIGHT SHOWERS OVER ERN KY WILL SPREAD INTO SW 
VA THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON...CHANGING OVER TO SNOW THIS 
EVENING AS MIDLEVEL TEMPS DROP. STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES WILL 
HELP MAINTAIN SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SNOW SHOWERS IN NORTHERN AREAS 
OVERNIGHT...WITH A 30-40 KT NW FLOW FROM 925-850 MB ENHANCING 
AMOUNTS IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. MOISTURE DEPTH APPEARS ADEQUATE FOR 
ACCUMULATIONS BETWEEN 00Z AND 06Z...AFTER WHICH TIME PRECIP SHOULD 
TAPER OFF. 1-3 INCH AMOUNTS APPEAR REASONABLE IN ELEVATIONS ABOVE 
2500 FT...WILL LESS THAN 1 INCH BELOW THAT LEVEL FOR SW VA AND NE 
TN. WILL MAINTAIN THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY AS IS. 

MORNING CLOUDS WILL GIVE WAY TO SUNSHINE TOMORROW AFTERNOON...BUT 
HIGH TEMPS WILL ONLY REACH INTO THE 40S IN MOST SPOTS...WITH 30S 
NORTH AND IN THE MOUNTAINS. WENT A BIT BELOW MOS TEMPS AS THIS IS AN 
ANOMALOUSLY COLD AIR MASS FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
A QUIET START TO THE LONG TERM WITH A POTENTIALLY WET WEEKEND
FOLLOWED BY A RETURN OF QUIET WEATHER THROUGH THE REST OF THE
PERIOD.

HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE BUILDING OVER OUR AREA 
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MOST OF THE DAY ON FRIDAY. CLEAR SKIES ON 
THURSDAY NIGHT WILL GIVE WAY TO INCREASING CLOUDS THROUGH THE DAY ON 
FRIDAY AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH BEGINS TO SWING ACROSS THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY. THURSDAY NIGHT WILL ONCE AGAIN BE COLD WITH LOWS IN 
THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S. FRIDAY TEMPS REBOUND BACK INTO MID/UPPER 
50S AND LOW 60S. THE LOW PRESSURE CENTER ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH IS NORTH OF THE GREAT LAKES SO WHATEVER TRAILING ENERGY 
SWEEPS ACROSS OUR AREA ON FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY MORNING WILL BE VERY 
WEAK AND SHOULD KEEP US MOSTLY DRY BUT WILL DROP TEMPS A FEW DEGREES 
AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH. BY SATURDAY MORNING MODELS ARE SHOWING A 
WEAK WAVE OVER THE TEXAS PANHANDLE AND ANOTHER STRONGER WAVE MOVING 
INTO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. THE WEAKER WAVE WILL MOVE EAST AND GIVE 
US A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SOME LIGHT PRECIP THROUGH THE DAY ON 
SATURDAY. THIS IS WHERE PATTERN BECOMES A LITTLE MESSY. 

SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...THE AFOREMENTIONED WAVE ACROSS THE 
PACIFIC NORTHWEST DROPS DOWN INTO TEXAS ALONG WITH THE DEVELOPING 
TROUGH...BUT STRONG RIDGING OFF THE BAJA PENINSULA FORCES THAT WAVE 
DOWN INTO MEXICO INSTEAD OF ON A CONTINUED EASTWARD TRACK ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN U.S. THE MODELS WANT TO SHOW THE APPROACHING TROUGH 
CATCHING UP TO THE FIRST WEAKER WAVE...NOW LOCATED AROUND THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY...AND PHASE THESE TWO FEATURES 
TOGETHER...RESULTING IN A STRENGTHENING SYSTEM. WHEN/WHERE/IF THEY 
PHASE WILL GREATLY IMPACT OUR WEATHER DURING THE SATURDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH MONDAY PERIOD. BOTH THE ECMWF AND GFS SHOW COLDER AIR 
GETTING PULLED INTO OUR AREA ON SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY ON THE BACK 
SIDE OF THE DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM...WHICH MEANS THAT IF 
THERE IS ENOUGH MOISTURE STILL AROUND WE COULD SEE SOME SNOW SUNDAY 
NIGHT INTO MONDAY. STILL WAY TOO EARLY FOR ANY TYPE OF SNOW AMOUNTS 
DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS SYSTEM. BOTH MODELS SHOW THE TROUGH 
EXITING TO OUR EAST ON MONDAY WITH CLEARING CONDITIONS THEREAFTER. 

HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS BACK IN FOR TUESDAY WITH ANOTHER SYSTEM 
POSSIBLE ON WEDNESDAY.

424 AM EDT WED MAR 12 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A VERY DYNAMIC SYSTEM IS
CONTINUING TO DEVELOP OVER THE WESTERN OHIO VALLEY WITH PRESSURE
FALLS OVER THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS. THE STRONG CYCLO-GENESIS
WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WITH A STRONG COLD FRONT
SWEEPING THROUGH THE AREA BY EARLY AFTERNOON. UPPER FORCING FROM A
STRONG 110KT+ JET OVER MISSOURI/ARKANSAS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION
THIS MORNING. WATER VAPOR LOOPS SHOWS INCREASING DIFLUENCE ALOFT
OVER THE MID-MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY MOVING INTO THE
OHIO/TENNESSEE VALLEYS. THIS LIFT ALONG WITH STRONG FRONTO-GENETIC
FORCING ALONG THE BOUNDARY WILL PRODUCE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS OVER THE
AREA THIS MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON.

MODELS SHOW ENOUGH INSTABILITY AHEAD OF FROPA WITH CAPE VALUES OF
250-500 J/KG...SO HAVE ALSO KEPT ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE
REGION AS WELL. DECENT COLD AIR ADVECTION ALOFT...SO WOULD NOT BE
SUPRISED TO SEE ISOLATED SMALL HAIL AS WELL...ESPECIALLY OVER
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE LATE THIS MORNING/EARLY
AFTERNOON.

STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION AFTER FROPA...SO HIGHS TODAY WILL BE BY
EARLY AFTERNOON...THEN DROPPING AREA-WIDE THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY.

THE TIGHT PRESSURE AND THERMAL GRADIENT WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL
PRODUCE WINDY CONDITIONS BY THIS AFTERNOON AND CONTINUE INTO THE
EVENING. FOR LATE TODAY AND TONIGHT...STRONG NORTHWEST FLOW WILL
PRODUCE OROGRAPHIC LIFT INTO THE NORTHWEST FACING SLOPES. CROSS-
SECTION SHOW PLENTY OF MOISTURE...LIFT AND FAVORABLE DENDRITIC SNOW
GROWTH FOR SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. HAVE
ISSUED A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR THE FAVORED NORTHWEST FLOW SNOWFALL
REGIONS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT THEN DIVERGE BY SUNDAY WITH THE 
HANDLING OF A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE DEEP SOUTH. 
HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO BUILD OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON 
THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...BRINGING A SHOT OF UNSEASONABLY COLD 
AIR INTO THE REGION. THIS HIGH WILL THEN QUICKLY MOVE EAST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...WITH SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS ON ITS BACK SIDE 
CREATING A RAPID WARMING TREND. A COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE 
SOUTHWARD INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON SATURDAY...WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL 
SHORT WAVE HELPING TO GENERATE SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. THIS COLD FRONT WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA...SINCE THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW IS PROGGED TO BE ZONAL THROUGH 
SATURDAY NIGHT. BOTH THE ECMWF AND GFS MODELS THEN INDICATE AN UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER THE PLAINS ON SUNDAY...BUT THE GFS 
MODEL CREATES A CUT-OFF UPPER LOW OVER TEXAS WHICH THEN SINKS 
SOUTHWARD INTO NORTHERN MEXICO. THE ECMWF MODEL REVEALS A MORE 
AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH ON SUNDAY...WHICH MOVES EASTWARD ACROSS 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY AND DEVELOPS A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER 
THE DEEP SOUTH ON SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. WILL PLAN TO FOLLOW THE 
ECMWF MODEL SOLUTION SINCE IT IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS MODEL 
RUNS (OF BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS)...AND IT ALSO APPEARS TO BE 
MORE REALISTIC WITH CLIMATOLOGY. AS A RESULT...WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF 
PRECIP IN THE FORECAST THROUGH MONDAY EVENING. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT 
WILL THEN TREND CLOSER TO THE ENSEMBLE MEANS THEREAFTER.

.DISCUSSION...
OUTSTANDING DAY TODAY WITH FULL SUNSHINE AND LIGHT SW BREEZES. THIS
COMBO HAS HELPED TEMPS INCREASE 5 TO 10 DEGREES OVER YESTERDAY/S
TEMPS...WITH AT LEAST MID 60S AREA WIDE THIS AFTERNOON PLUS SOME
70S IN SOUTHERN SECTIONS.

UNFORTUNATELY...BIG CHANGES ARE ON THE WAY WITH PRECIP...STRONG
WINDS AND MUCH COLDER AIR ALL SET TO ARRIVE WITHIN 24 HOURS. THE H5
LOW OVER THE TX/LA COAST THIS AFTERNOON WILL MOVE EAST TONIGHT.
ALTHOUGH IT WILL PASS TO OUR SOUTH...IT WILL PULL PLENTY OF
MOISTURE NORTHWARD INTO OUR REGION TONIGHT AND PROVIDE SOME WEAK
LIFT. WILL RAMP UP THE POPS TONIGHT WITH INCREASING CHANCES OF A
RELATIVELY LOW QPF EVENT. ALSO...ISOLATED ELEVATED CONVECTION
POSSIBLE.

A BIGGER ISSUE IS THE IMPACT FROM THE APPROACHING TROUGH THAT IS
PRESENTLY OVER THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS. IT SHOULD STRENGTHEN AS IT
MOVES INTO THE EASTERN U.S. LATER TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THIS
SYSTEM WILL SEND A COLD FRONT...WHICH AT 19Z WAS MOVING THROUGH OK
AND KS...RACING THROUGH OUR REGION WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. WINDS WILL
PICK UP A BIT TONIGHT AS GRADIENTS INCREASE...THEN INCREASE
SHARPLY ALL DAY WEDNESDAY AS THE FRONT APPROACHES AND MOVES
THROUGH. WILL ISSUE WIND ADVISORY FOR THE ENTIRE REGION 12Z WEDNESDAY
THROUGH 00Z THURSDAY. LATER SHIFTS MAY NEED TO EXPAND ADVISORY A
FEW HOURS PAST 00Z.

MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRONGER TROUGH IS MARGINAL BUT ENOUGH
SHOULD EXIST FOR PRECIP TO CONTINUE FROM LATE WEDNESDAY INTO EARLY
THURSDAY MORNING...ESPECIALLY IN FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS. RAIN WILL
CHANGE TO SNOW WITH SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED IN THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS AND FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS.

NW FLOW ALOFT WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE REGION THURSDAY AS THE LARGE
TROUGH SLOWLY MOVES OFF THE EAST COAST. WEAK H5 RIDGE DEVELOPS
EARLY FRIDAY BUT A NEW H5 TROUGH SHOULD APPROACH FROM THE WEST
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. WILL GO WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS STARTING
FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH CHANCE POPS SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. AFTER A
COLD DAY ON THURSDAY...TEMPS WILL MODERATE FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY
BEFORE COOLING OFF AGAIN EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH THE ARRIVAL OF
ANOTHER COLD FRONT.

.DISCUSSION...
A SPRING LIKE DAY CONTINUES TO UNFOLD TODAY. FAIRLY ZONAL H5 FLOW
EXISTS ACROSS THE REGION BETWEEN COMPACT/WEAK H5 LOW OVER THE GULF
COAST AND ANOTHER ONE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS. AT SFC...HIGH
PRESSURE HAS MOVED EASTWARD...ALLOWING LIGHT SW WINDS TO COMBINE
WITH SUNNY SKIES TO MAKE TEMPS ABOUT 5 TO 10 DEGREES HIGHER THAN
THEY WERE 24 HOURS AGO. CURRENT FORECAST MAX TEMPS ARE ROUGHLY 5
DEGREES HIGHER THAN YESTERDAY/S MAX TEMPS...SO NO CHANGES NEEDED
FOR TODAY.

CHANGES ARE STILL ON THE WAY TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. THE ADVANCING
H5 LOW OVER THE GULF COAST WILL INCREASE MOISTURE ACROSS OUR REGION
AND COMBINE WITH THE DIGGING NORTHERN PLAINS LOW TO INCREASE PRECIP
CHANCES LATE TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THE SAME PATTERN WILL SEND
A VERY STRONG COLD FRONT THROUGH THE REGION WEDNESDAY

BEHIND SFC LOW AND FRONT. WHILE WE EXPECT SNOW SHOWERS ESPECIALLY
IN FAVORABLE WEST TO NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN LIKE THIS...MOST
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT MAY BE STRONG WINDS WHICH COULD GUST OVER 50 MPH
WED AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT. STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL SERVE
TO MIX DOWN STRONG WINDS ALOFT EVEN OVERNIGHT. AHEAD OF

REMAIN MEAGER WITH MOST UNSTABLE CAPE VALUES LESS THAN 150 J/KG.
HAVE LIMITED TSTM PROBABILITIES TO SLT CHC WITH CATEGORICAL POPS

PENCILED IN 1-3 INCHES IN FAVORABLE UPSLOPE AREAS FOR WEST TO

.DISCUSSION...

MANY APOLOGIES FOR THE DELAY IN GETTING PRODUCTS OUT THIS 
AFTERNOON...BUT UNFORTUNATELY NUMEROUS GFE AND AWIPS ISSUES 
RESULTED IN A LOSS OF ALL DATA WHICH REQUIRED A COMPLETE REDO OF 
THE AFTERNOON FORECAST PACKAGE FROM SCRATCH. IN ANY 
EVENT...BEAUTIFUL DAY ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE AND ADJACENT SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND 
TEMPERATURES IN THE 60S TO LOWER 70S. AN EVEN WARMER DAY IS ON TAP 
FOR TUESDAY WITH MUCH OF THE CWA REACHING THE 70S...WITH UPPER 70S 
POSSIBLE AROUND CHA. 

12Z GFS/ECMWF IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON AN INTENSE SURFACE LOW DEVELOPING 
ALONG THE LOWER OHIO RIVER THEN MOVING QUICKLY ENE ACROSS KY TUESDAY 
NIGHT WHILE DEEPENING TO SUB-990MB. AHEAD OF THE LOW...STRONG 
MOISTURE AND WARM AIR ADVECTION WILL BRING SHOWERS INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT TUESDAY NIGHT...WITH MOST WIDESPREAD 
ACTIVITY WEDNESDAY MORNING. FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE WEAK 
INSTABILITY WITH K INDEX VALUES IN THE 30S SO WILL CONTINUE MENTION 
OF A FEW THUNDERSTORMS AS WELL. INTENSE COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP 
THROUGH THE CWA LATE WEDNESDAY MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON WITH TEMPS 
RAPIDLY DROPPING THROUGH THE DAY. MAJORITY OF PRECIP WILL MOVE OUT 
BY AFTERNOON...BUT OROGRAPHIC UPLIFT EXPECTED TO BRING LIGHT SNOW TO 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EAST TENNESSEE 
WEDNESDAY EVENING BEFORE TAPERING OFF WEDNESDAY NIGHT. ADDED LIGHT 
SNOW ACCUMS AROUND A HALF AN INCH ABOVE 3000 FEET FOR THIS 
TIMEFRAME...ALTHOUGH AN INCH IS POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. 
VERY SHARP PRESSURE GRADIENT IN WAKE OF FRONT ALSO EXPECTED TO BRING 
QUITE BREEZY CONDITIONS TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WITH GFS INDICATING 
GUSTS TO 50 MPH...AND A WIND ADVISORY MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THE HIGH 
ELEVATIONS. 

DRY BUT COLDER WEATHER EXPECTED ON THURSDAY WITH LOWS WELL BELOW 
FREEZING IN THE TEENS AND 20S AND HIGHS ONLY IN THE 30S/40S FOR MOST 
AREAS. WARMING TREND EXPECTED OVER THE WEEKEND AS SURFACE HIGH 
SHIFTS EASTWARD AND RETURN FLOW OFF THE GULF OF MEXICO BEGINS. 
GFS/ECMWF DIFFER GREATLY IN PRECIP CHANCES AND TEMPS OVER THE 
WEEKEND WITH ACTIVE WEST TO NW JET STREAM ALOFT...SO WILL MAINTAIN 
LOW POPS FOR NOW WITH TEMPS NEAR MEX GUIDANCE NUMBERS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE CAROLINAS...WITH 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS HIGH PRESSURE 
AREA WILL LINGER OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH 
DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS EXPECTED OVER THE FORECAST AREA...ALONG 
WITH UNSEASONABLY WARM TEMPS DUE TO SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS DEVELOPING 
BY THIS AFTERNOON. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE 
IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL TREND CLOSER 
TO THE SLIGHTLY WARMER GFS NUMBERS DUE TO THE SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL 
CONTINUE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
ON TUESDAY AS A BRISK SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AND MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS 
WILL HELP TO PROMOTE A WARM-UP INTO LOWER 70S IN MOST SPOTS. 
HOWEVER...A QUICK CHANGE IN THE PATTERN IS EXPECTED AS AN UPPER- 
TROUGH SWINGS FROM THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT 
INTO WEDNESDAY...BRINGING A SOME WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND SOME 
SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA. THE BEST WINDOW FOR MEANINGFUL 
PRECIPITATION APPEARS TO BE FROM LATE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY...SO HAVE INCREASED POPS TO HIGH-END LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL 
DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. 

AS THE FRONT PASSES THROUGH...WINDS WILL QUICKLY SHIFT TO THE 
NORTHWEST AND INCREASE /BECOMING GUSTY AT TIMES/ DURING THE LATE 
AFTERNOON...EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS. THIS WILL ENHANCE COLD AIR 
ADVECTION AS TEMPERATURES WILL DROP WELL INTO THE 20S OVERNIGHT 
GIVEN THE MUCH COLDER AIR THAT WILL BE FILTERING INTO THE REGION 
BEHIND THE FRONT. AS A RESULT...A CHANGE OVER TO SOME LIGHT SNOW IS 
EXPECTED IN MANY AREAS ALONG THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY AND 
MOUNTAINS WEDNESDAY EVENING/NIGHT AS SOME NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW 
SHOWERS MAY LINGER THROUGH THE NIGHT. SOME MINOR ACCUMULATIONS OF 
HALF AN INCH TO LOCALLY ONE INCH IN SOME LOCATIONS MAY BE POSSIBLE 
THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING...PARTICULARLY ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. A MUCH COLDER DAY IN THE 
40S ON THURSDAY WILL QUICKLY GIVE WAY TO SOME SEASONABLE CONDITIONS 
IN THE LOWER 60S FOR FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND. AN APPROACHING STORM 
SYSTEM THIS WEEKEND WILL ALSO GIVE THE REGION ANOTHER DECENT SHOT OF 
PRECIPITATION THIS WEEKEND...THOUGH MODELS DIFFER ON THE TRACK AND 
TIMING OF THE UPPER-LOW ATTM.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...CLOUDS FINALLY CLEARED
OUT BEHIND THE WEAK COLD FRONT WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES EXPECTED
OVERNIGHT. SURFACE RIDGE SETTLES ACROSS THE REGION PROVIDING LIGHT
WINDS SO I WENT CLOSER TO THE COOLER GFS MINS.

FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SHORT TERM...CONTINUED DRY WEATHER WITH
ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS. UPPER RIDGE FOR MONDAY WILL FLATTEN TO A ZONAL
FLOW ALOFT BY TUESDAY. SURFACE RIDGE DOMINATES AND THE SW SURFACE
GRADIENT SHOULD TIGHTEN A BIT BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON AS A COLD FRONT
APPROACHES TUESDAY NIGHT. THE DRY AIRMASS AND W-SW LOW LEVEL FLOW
FAVORED NUDGING MAX TEMPS UP IN LINE WITH THE WARMER GFS MAXES.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SHOWERS AND EVEN THE 
POSSIBILITY OF THUNDER IS IN THE WORKS FOR THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AS A STRONG STORM SYSTEM BUILDS EAST 
FROM THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TO THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC COAST FROM 
TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. A HEALTHY AMOUNT OF 
LIFT AND INSTABILITY WOULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONVECTION 
AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT ON WEDNESDAY. STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION 
BEHIND THE DEPARTING LOW WITH MORE ENERGY DIVING THROUGH THE BACK 
SIDE OF THE DEEP UPPER TROUGH SHOULD ALLOW FOR A CONTINUATION OF 
RAIN SHOWERS AND EVEN SOME SNOW SHOWERS MAINLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AS NORTHWEST FLOW 
CRANKS UP IN THE TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THE ATLANTIC LOW 
AND APPROACHING MID CONTINENT RIDGE. THE GOOD NEWS IS DRIER WEATHER 
AND A MODEST WARMING TREND FILL IN BEHIND THE WET MID WEEK SYSTEM 
KEEPING IMPROVED WEATHER IN PLACE THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. MODELS 
NOT ALL ON THE SAME PAGE WITH A LATE WEEKEND SYSTEM SO CONFIDENCE 
LOW AT THIS POINT BUT ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN FOR 
SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.

WEATHER WISE FOR THESE PERIODS AS ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS CONTINUE. THE
WEAK COLD FRONT APPROACHING LATE TONIGHT LACKS MOISTURE AND FORCING
WITH BOTH OPERATIONAL SHORT TERM MODELS TRENDING EVEN DRIER ON THE
12Z RUN. TRIMMED POPS BACK TO VERY MINIMAL CHANCES...REMOVED FROM
SRN AREAS TONIGHT...AND REALLY LIMITED POPS TO MAINLY NE AREAS ON
SUNDAY MORNING. TEMPS SHOULD BE CLOSE TO GFS MOS VALUES TONIGHT
WITH CLOUDS INCREASING...THEN REBOUND TO SIMILAR MOS MAXES FOR
SUNDAY AFTERNOON.

OTHERWISE...DRY WEATHER FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY WITH UPPER
RIDGING OR ZONAL FLOW ALOFT. WEST TO SOUTHWEST LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL
KEEP TEMPS ON THE MILD TO WARM SIDE...WITH COOLEST NIGHT BEING
SUNDAY NIGHT AS SURFACE RIDGE SETTLES OVER THE REGION. GENERALLY
HARD TO BEAT THE GFS MOS TEMPS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS IN EVEN BETTER 
AGREEMENT WITH THE EXTENDED PERIOD. STILL LOOKS LIKE A RELATIVELY 
DECENT TUESDAY WITH MILD TEMPERATURES AND PRECIP ARRIVING MAINLY 
TUESDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF THE TWO WAVES MAKING PROGRESS INTO OR THROUGH 
THE EASTERN U.S. THE FIRST WAVE RIPS EAST ALONG THE GULF COAST AND 
THERE SHOULD BE SOME MOISTENING AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE DURING THE DAY 
TUESDAY BUT THE MAIN SYSTEM IS A NORTHERN STREAM WHICH AMPLIFIES 
INTO THE EASTERN STATES ON WEDNESDAY. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE NORTHERN TROUGH DEEPENS WHILE SHIFTING EAST 
NORTHEAST ALONG THE OHIO VALLEY LATE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. DEEP MOISTURE WILL BE LIFTED INTO A BROAD AREA OF LIGHT 
TO MODERATE SHOWERS INTO MID DAY WEDNESDAY AND EDGED LIKELY POPS A 
LITTLE HIGHER FOR THE BIG MID WEEK EVENT. ONCE AGAIN WITH THE 
SHARPENING EASTERN U.S. TROUGH...MUCH COLDER AIR WILL BE SPILLING 
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN BEHIND THE FRONT AND TRAILING SHORT 
WAVE ENERGY AND RELATIVELY DEEP MOISTURE SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO AN 
EXTENDED PERIOD OF POST FRONTAL SHOWERS WHICH WILL MIX WITH AND 
CHANGE TO SOME SNOW SHOWERS LATER WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY 
MORNING BEFORE ENDING. THE REMAINING TWO DAYS OF THE FORECAST SHOULD 
STAY ON THE DRY SIDE. COLD HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN BEHIND THE SYSTEM 
FOR THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY KEEPING TEMPERATURES SEVERAL DEGREES 
BELOW NORMAL. MODIFICATION GETS UNDERWAY OVER THE WEEKEND WITH HIGHS 
BACK CLOSE TO NORMAL WITH SUNSHINE EXPECTED ON SATURDAY.

SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS INCREASING AHEAD OF IT. THESE SOUTHWESTERLY 
WINDS WILL HELP TO PRODUCE AN UNSEASONABLY WARM DAY...WITH HIGHS IN

MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...WITH THE MODELS IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT A FEW POST-FRONTAL SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE AFTER

WILL MENTION ONLY CHANCE POPS...ESPECIALLY OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE 
SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...ANOTHER FAST MOVING UPPER- 
TROUGH WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION ON SUNDAY...BRINGING SOME LIGHT 
SHOWER ACTIVITY AND CLOUD COVER TO THE AREA WITH THE PASSAGE OF A 
WEAK FRONT. THIS FRONT WILL ACT TO LOWER TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY...BUT 
SOME CLEARING BY THE AFTERNOON WILL STILL ALLOW THE MERCURY TO CLIMB

EARLY NEXT WEEK FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY AS A BRISK SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW

UPPER-TROUGH WILL SWING A COLD FRONT OUT OF THE OHIO VALLEY AND 
BRING A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME WIDESPREAD SHOWER ACTIVITY 
WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. GIVEN THE INCREASED CONFIDENCE...HAVE 
INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY. ALSO HAVE SOME CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY AS 
WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ON THE BACK-SIDE OF THE SYSTEM COULD GIVE THE 
AREA ANOTHER SHOT OF LIGHT PRECIPITATION. GIVEN THE COLD AIR BEHIND 
THIS SYSTEM...SOME LIGHT SNOW COULD MIX IN WITH THE RAIN ACROSS THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS EARLY THURSDAY MORNING. WITH A COLDER AIR MASS IN 
PLACE...HIGHS WILL STRUGGLE TO CLIMB OUT OF THE UPPER 40S AND LOWER 
50S FOR THURSDAY...WITH A WARMING TREND THE OCCURRING FOR FRIDAY 
INTO THE WEEKEND AS CLEARING OCCURS AND WINDS VEER BACK TO THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SOME CLOUDS HANGING IN THE
TERRAIN ALONG THE TN-NC LINE AND ALSO A FEW CUMULUS CLOUDS
DEVELOPING OVER NRN PLATEAU AND SW VA COUNTIES. THINK SKIES WILL
BECOME GENERALLY CLEAR THIS EVENING WITH LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS.
THE BOUNDARY LAYER SHOULD BE DRY OVERNIGHT...AS RAINFALL ACROSS THE
VALLEY COUNTIES WAS NOT MUCH MORE THAN A TRACE TO 0.05 INCH...SO NO
FOG. FAVORED THE SLIGHTLY COOLER MINS WHERE MINOR DIFFS WERE NOTED
IN MOS.

REALLY AN EXCELLENT SATURDAY SHAPING UP WITH LOTS OF SUNSHINE
COUPLED WITH SW-W SURFACE WINDS. SHOULD SEE MAX TEMPS GET WELL INTO
THE 60S (MAYBE LOW 70S) LOWER ELEVATIONS...AND 50S IN THE MTNS. 

THE OUTLIER NAM MODEL (PREVIOUS RUNS) HAS COME MORE IN LINE WITH
OTHER MODELS ON THE STRENGTH OF A MINOR SHORTWAVE AND WEAK COLD
FRONT LATE SATURDAY NIGHT. PREVIOUS GRIDS LOOKED VERY REASONABLE
WITH NO MORE THAN 20 TO 30 PERCENT POPS. I DID OPT TO DROP THE POPS
IN NEARLY ALL AREAS BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. SIMILAR MOS MINS/MAXES
FOLLOWED AS THE NICE WEATHER CONTINUES!


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE ATMOSPHERE IS PROGGED 
TO BE RELATIVELY QUIET FOR THE ABOUT THE FIRST TWO AND A HALF DAYS 
OF THE FORECAST WITH SOME SUNSHINE AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENJOY 
ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES FOR A CHANGE...ESPECIALLY MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY AS THE UPPER FLOW TURNS TO THE SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF THE NEXT 
MAJOR STORM SYSTEM. THE MODELS INDICATE INCREASING MOISTURE AHEAD OF 
THE SPLIT STREAM SYSTEMS WITH A WAVE BUILDING EAST ALONG THE GULF 
COAST LATER TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT WITH TRAILING SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY DRIVING INTO THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION ON 
WEDNESDAY. WAS ABLE TO EXTEND HIGHER CONFIDENCE ON THIS PERIOD OF 
THE FORECAST WITH MODELS STAYING CLOSE TO PREVIOUS FORECAST 
SCENARIO. THEREFORE...RAISED POPS FOR SHOWERS TO LIKELY FROM LATE 
NIGHT TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. DEFINITELY HAVE TO HANG ONTO 
MEDIUM TO HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR MORE SHOWERS LATER IN THE DAY 
WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS DEEP MOISTURE IS LIFTED IN THE 
PRESENCE OF THE HEALTHY TRAILING UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM. CHILLY 
NORTHWEST FLOW WITHIN THIS FEATURE CONTINUES INTO THURSDAY AND THIS 
WOULD TEND TO ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF MORE SNOW SHOWERS IN THE 
NEVER ENDING WINTER SEASON.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OFF THE CAROLINA COAST...WITH TEMPS 
REMAINING ABOVE FREEZING OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. RECENT 
PHONE CALL TO THE JOHNSON COUNTY DISPATCH INDICATES THAT LIGHT SNOW 
WAS FALLING...BUT WITH LITTLE OR NO ACCUMULATIONS. MODEL SOUNDINGS 
INDICATE TEMPS AROUND FREEZING FROM THE SURFACE UP TO AROUND 800 
MB...SO IT APPEARS THAT SNOW WILL BE PREDOMINATE PRECIP TYPE THIS 
MORNING (UNTIL CHANGING BACK TO RAIN AS TEMPS WARM AFTER SUNRISE). 
AREA RADARS REVEAL THE BULK OF THE PRECIP REMAINING OVER THE 
CAROLINAS...WITH ONLY LIGHT ECHOES OBSERVED OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
THUS...IT APPEARS THAT THE ADVISORY MAY NOT VERIFY WITH ENOUGH 
SNOWFALL TO JUSTIFY CONTINUING IT UNTIL 9 AM. FOR NOW...WILL LET THE 
ADVISORY CONTINUE FOR A FEW MORE HOURS...BUT WILL PROBABLY CANCEL IT 
EARLY CLOSER TO SUNRISE. THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO 
SLOWLY MOVE NORTHEASTWARD UP THE ATLANTIC COAST TODAY...WITH CLOUDS 
AND PRECIP GRADUALLY DIMINISHING OVER THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE 
SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A WARM-UP WILL BE IN STORE 
FOR THE REGION ON SATURDAY AS A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE MOVES OVER THE 
AREA...PROMOTING MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS WITH HIGHS REACHING THE 60S 
TO LOWER 70S ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. ANOTHER FAST MOVING 
UPPER-TROUGH WILL THEN PUSH THROUGH THE REGION ON SUNDAY...THOUGH 
MODELS DIFFER WITH THE AMOUNT OF PRECIPITATION THAT WILL OCCUR. THE 
NAM IS MORE BULLISH AND INDICATES THE POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD 
SHOWER ACTIVITY MOVING IN AROUND DAYBREAK AND PERSISTING THROUGHOUT 
THE DAY. THE GFS ON THE OTHER HAND IS FASTER AND INDICATES ONLY 
LIGHT QPF SIGNALS...WITH CLEARING LATE IN THE AFTERNOON. FOR NOW... 
HAVE MAINTAINED A MODEL BLEND OF THE TWO. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED 
THAT TEMPERATURES APPEAR TO BE WARMER ENOUGH TO SUPPORT AN ALL RAIN 
EVENT AS HIGHS IN THE UPPER 50S AND 60S ARE EXPECTED FOR SUNDAY AS 
WELL. ANOTHER ROUND OF EARLY WEEK RIDGING WILL THEN ENSUE AS HIGHS 
CLIMB BACK INTO THE 60S AND LOWER 70S FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY BEFORE 
ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM LOOKS AS IF IT WILL IMPACT THE REGION FOR 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. MODELS DISAGREE WITH THE EXACT TRACK OF THE 
SYSTEM...BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR PRECIPITATION 
WILL BE WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WITH SOME LIGHT ACTIVITY 
POSSIBLE ON THURSDAY AS THINGS TAPER OFF. THUS...HAVE INCREASED POPS 
TO HIGH-END CHANCE DURING THE AFOREMENTIONED TIME PERIOD TO ACCOUNT 
FOR AN INCREASED CONFIDENCE IN THIS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...WINTER WEATHER NOT YET
READY TO GIVE WAY TO SPRING TIME. LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE
ERN GULF OF MEXICO WILL TRACK NE OVERNIGHT...WITH THE PROBLEM BEING
A LARGE WEDGE OF COLD AIR AT THE SURFACE ACROSS MUCH OF NC AND VA.
THIS COLD AIR HAS A CHANCE TO AT LEAST EDGE SW INTO OUR 3 NERN MOST
COUNTIES OVERNIGHT...SO OPTED TO ISSUE A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY
FOR THAT SMALL PART OF OUR FORECAST AREA. FORECAST SOUNDINGS JUST
DON'T SUPPORT MUCH IF ANY SNOW...BEING MORE INDICATIVE OF A LIGHT
SLEET AND/OR LIGHT FREEZING RAIN MIX. I DON'T EXPECT WIDESPREAD
OCCURRENCES OF BELOW 32 DEGREE TEMPS IN THE ADVISORY AREA...AND THE
PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE LIGHT. HOWEVER...I DID ALLOW FOR UP TO 1/10
INCH OF ICE ACCUMULATION IN THE ADVISORY AREA.

OTHERWISE...REMAINING AREAS GET RAIN OVERNIGHT WITH THE RAIN ENDING
FROM THE WEST AFTER FRIDAY MORNING. TEMPS SHOULD RECOVER AT LEAST
CLOSE TO A MOS BLEND FOR MAXES FRIDAY.

NOT REALLY MUCH IF ANY CHANGES FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY AS
SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGING SETTLE AT LEAST BRIEFLY OVER THE REGION. 
GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE SIMILAR GFS/NAM MOS TEMPS THROUGH THE
PERIOD. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...TYPICALLY MODELS NOT 
TOO FAR APART IN DEPICTION OF WEATHER EVENTS EARLY IN THE EXTENDED 
FORECAST BUT DIVERGE LATE. THIS IS THE CASE WITH THE CURRENT 
EXTENDED FORECAST WHICH ALLOWS FOR A WEAK UPPER TROUGH/SURFACE 
FRONTAL PASSAGE ON SUNDAY. SYSTEM IS MOISTURE STARVED WITH WEAK LIFT 
SO MAINTAINED THE SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THIS SYSTEM. THE 
FORECAST AREA ENJOYS AT LEAST A 36 HOUR PRECIPITATION FREE PERIOD 
WITH MAINLY DRY ADVECTION IN A ZONAL CONFIGURATION WITH SOME SURFACE 
RIDGING SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. BY TUESDAY MODELS 
GENERALLY INDICATE MORE SPLIT FLOW WEATHER MAKERS WITH A BROAD AND 
THUS WEAKER NORTHERN STREAM UPPER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS 
WHILE MORE AMPLIFIED CLOSED UPPER LOW FORMS OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO. THE CANADIAN AND GFS KEEP THE STREAMS MORE SEPARATED AS 
THEY PROGRESS THROUGH THE EASTERN U.S. WHILE THE ECMWF GENERATES A 
HIGHLY AMPLIFIED TROUGH DURING THE PERIOD WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO 
THURSDAY. BOTH THE GFS AND ECM DEVELOP RELATIVELY DEEP SURFACE LOW 
PRESSURE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH ON WEDNESDAY WHICH ENDS UP DRAGGING 
MUCH COLDER AIR BACK INTO THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO 
THURSDAY. DUE MODERATE LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY AT THIS TIME 
RANGE...JUST KEPT CHANCE POPS GOING WITH THE HIGHEST POP FOR RAIN 
SHOWERS ON WEDNESDAY AS THE DEEP SURFACE LOW SHIFTS EAST ACROSS THE 
VIEWING AREA. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY OF SNOW EXISTS IN THE UPSLOPE COLD 
AIR ADVECTION PATTERN BEHIND THE DEPARTING SURFACE SYSTEM WEDNESDAY 
EVENING INTO THURSDAY MORNING.

TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER 30S TO NEAR 40. AT THE SURFACE A LOW 
PRESSURE AREA OVER THE NORTHERN GULF WILL MOVE EAST TODAY AND THEN 
INTO THE ATLANTIC TONIGHT AND DEEPEN. MOISTURE WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL 
MOVE NORTH INTO THE TN VALLEY TODAY. ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL SPREAD
RAIN INTO THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS LATE TODAY AND THEN INTO THE
NORTHERN SECTIONS TONIGHT.

COMPLICATED FORECAST FOR TONIGHT INTO EARLY FRIDAY. THE RAIN MAY
CHANGE TO A MIXTURE OF SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN AND SNOW IN EXTREME
NE TN AND SW VA AS THE ATMOSPHERE COOLS LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO
EARLY FRIDAY BUT DEPTH OF COLD AIR WILL LIKELY BE SHALLOW. NAM
SOUNDING INDICATES ALL RAIN BUT GFS SHOWS SOME POSSIBLE ICING.
TEMPERATURES SHOULD ONLY DROP TO AROUND 30 LATE TONIGHT IN THE
COLDEST AREAS OF NE TN AND SW VA SO THINK ANY ACCUMULATION OF
SLEET OR FREEZING RAIN WILL BE MINIMAL. SNOWFALL OF AN INCH OR TWO
COULD FALL IN THE NE TN MOUNTAINS BEFORE TEMPERATURES WARM FRIDAY.
FOLLOWED BLEND OF NAM AND MAV FOR HIGHS TODAY AND COLDER MAV
NUMBERS TONIGHT. FRIDAY HIGHS CLOSER TO NAM IN THE UPPER 40S TO MID
50S BUT NEAR 60 AT CHA WHERE PRECIPITATION AND CLOUDS WILL DEPART
SOONER. WILL UPDATE HWO TO INDICATE SOME WINTRY PRECIPITATION
POSSIBLE NE SECTIONS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...WARM ON SATURDAY 
AHEAD OF WEAK CLIPPER SYSTEM. SYSTEM WILL BE LOSING MOISTURE AS IT 
MOVES THROUGH THE AREA WITH LIGHT RAINSHOWERS. AIRMASS DRIES OUT 
BEHIND CLIPPER WITH WARMING TREND EARLY NEXT WEEK. COLD CORE LOW 
SLIDES INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO BY TUESDAY. TRACK AND STRENGTH REMAIN 
IN QUESTION BUT SYSTEM SHOULD BRING SOME RAIN INTO THE AREA BY MID 
WEEK.

.SHORT TERM.../TONIGHT AND TOMORROW/...OVERALL...A PRETTY QUIET
SHORT TERM. CLEAR CONDITIONS THIS EVENING WILL START TO GIVE WAY TO
INCREASING CLOUD COVER LATE TONIGHT AND CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY
TOMORROW. CLOUD COVER WILL FIRST BEGIN TO INCREASE ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN VALLEY WHERE MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS WILL BE IN PLACE BY
LATE TOMORROW MORNING. CLOUD COVER WILL WORK ITS WAY NORTHWARD
DURING THE DAY WITH ALL AREAS BEING MOSTLY CLOUDY BY LATE
AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING. THIS IS DUE TO AN APPROACHING UPPER LEVEL
LOW THAT WILL SWING ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES THROUGH THE DAY
TOMORROW. IT LOOKS LIKE MOST AREAS WILL STAY DRY TOMORROW EXCEPT
FOR THE EXTREME SOUTHERN VALLY AND SWNC WHERE I HAVE PUT A SLIGHT
CHANCE POP IN PLACE DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS.

TEMPERATURES FOR TONIGHT WILL BE A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL TO NEAR 
NORMAL. WILL INCLUDE PATCHY FREEZING FOG IN GRIDS ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN PLATEAU...THE SAME AREAS THAT RECEIVED FOG THIS MORNING. 
TOMORROWS HIGH TEMPS WILL BE SLIGHTLY COOLER ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
VALLY WHERE CLOUD COVER WILL FIRST MOVE IN AND A FEW DEGREES WARMER 
ACROSS NETN AND UP INTO SWVA WHERE CLOUD COVER WILL HOLD OFF LONGER. 

.LONG TERM.../THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...STILL A RELATIVELY 
BUSY PATTERN WITH THREE WEATHER SYSTEMS DURING THIS PERIOD. THE 
FIRST SYSTEM IS ON THE DOORSTEP AS THIS PERIOD STARTS...THEN A WEAK 
CLIPPER SYSTEM FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...AND FINALLY A LARGER 
SYSTEM FOR THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK.

FOR THIS FIRST SYSTEM THE BIGGEST QUESTION IS WHETHER THERE WILL BE 
ANY WINTRY PRECIPITATION THURSDAY NIGHT. MODELS ARE NOT IN GREAT 
AGREEMENT...BUT FOR THIS MAIN QUESTION...IT APPEARS THAT THE THREAT 
FOR ICING IN OUR AREA IS RATHER SLIM...WITH BETTER CHANCES EAST OF 
THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE...THEREBY EAST OF OUR AREA.  MODELS THAT TAKE 
MIN TEMPERATURES BELOW FREEZING ALSO HAVE ZERO TO MINIMAL PRECIP IN 
THOSE AREAS...WHERE AS MODELS WITH MORE PRECIP KEEP OUR AREAS ABOVE 
FREEZING...SO THE PRECIP WOULD BE BRINGING WARMER AIR WITH IT.  FOR 
OUR GRIDS...AM GOING WITH RELATIVELY HIGH POPS IN OUR EASTERN AREAS 
FOR THURSDAY NIGHT...BUT KEEPING ALL TEMPERATURES ABOVE FREEZING.

THE NEXT SYSTEM IS A WEAK CLIPPER DUE TO RACE ACROSS THE AREA 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND/OR SUNDAY.  THIS SYSTEM WILL BE ALL LIQUID AND 
POPS WILL BE RELATIVELY LOW.  THEN IT SHOULD BE DRY FOR A COUPLE OF 
DAYS BEFORE A LARGER SYSTEM MOVES IN TOWARD THE END OF THE PERIOD.  
RIGHT NOW...LOOKS LIKE MOST OF THE HEAVIER PRECIP WILL STAY SOUTH OF 
US. ALSO...RIGHT NOW JUST HAVE OUR AREA AS SHOWERS...WILL NEED TO 
SEE IF THE THREAT OF STORMS CAN MOVE FARTHER NORTH.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
WITH A SURFACE TROUGH IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION PROMOTING A
NORTHEASTERLY FLOW...SOME DENSE LOW STRATUS HAVE HUNG ON THROUGHOUT
THE DAY DUE TO THE REINFORCEMENT OF THE COLDER AIR. THESE CLOUDS
HAVE KEPT TEMPERATURES LOWER THAN EXPECTED BY A FEW DEGREES.
STILL...MOST AREAS HAVE CLIMBED INTO THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S DUE
TO A FEW BREAKS IN THIS CLOUD COVER. GIVEN THE CLOUDS HANGING ON
AND THE COLD NORTHEAST FETCH OVERNIGHT...HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO
REDUCE CLOUD COVER MUCH TONIGHT. THINK THAT SOME DRY AIR MAY HELP
TO ERODE SOME OF THE SHIELD LATE TONIGHT...BUT AM EXPECTING
MOSTLY/PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS IN MOST LOCATIONS. THIS WILL HELP
TO TO KEEP TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES WARMER AS WELL...EXCEPT
ACROSS FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA WHERE SOME
DECENT CLEARING MAY TAKE PLACE. LOWS WILL RANGE FROM THE MID 20S IN
THE FAR NORTHEAST ZONES...TO THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S ELSEWHERE.
THE NORTHEAST FLOW ALONG WITH SOME CLOUDS WILL ALSO HELP TO KEEP
TEMPERATURES DOWN...BUT SOME ADDITIONAL BREAKS /ESPECIALLY BY THE
AFTERNOON/ WILL ALLOW HIGHS TO CLIMB INTO THE 50S IN MOST SPOTS.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/... 
THE PAST FEW RUNS OF THE NAM HAVE TRENDED MORE TOWARD THE GFS
SOLUTION FOR THE SYSTEM CROSSING THE SOUTHEAST REGION THURSDAY
THROUGH FRIDAY...HOWEVER THERE REMAIN SOME SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES
FOR PRECIP AMOUNTS OVER THE TN VALLEY. THE NAM WRAPS MUCH MORE
MOISTURE AROUND THE MID-LEVEL CIRCULATION OVER MS/AL THURSDAY
NIGHT...AND IS SLOWER WITH ITS EXIT ON FRIDAY COMPARED TO THE GFS.
THE GFS HAS SUPPORT OF THE ECMWF...CMC...AND SREF...AND HAS BEEN
MORE CONSISTENT WITH THIS SYSTEM. THUS...WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW
THE GFS. THE GFS HAS TRENDED A BIT SLOWER...SO POPS WILL BE REMOVED
FROM WEDNESDAY NIGHT...MEANING LESS POTENTIAL FOR SNOWFALL AT
ONSET. HIGHEST POPS WILL BE IN SOUTHERN AND EASTERN SECTIONS FOR
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...WITH POPS TAPERING OFF LATE THURSDAY NIGHT.

A RIDGE OVER THE REGION WILL PROVIDE DRY AND SLIGHTLY WARMER WEATHER 
FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. BEYOND THIS PERIOD...CONFIDENCE IS LOW AS 
THE GFS HAS CHANGED ITS TUNE FROM YESTERDAY. IT SWITCHED FROM A NW 
FLOW SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSAGE ON SUNDAY TO A SPLIT FLOW PATTERN 
DEVELOPING ON SUNDAY. THE GFS...ECMWF...AND CMC ALL SHOW A SOUTHERN 
STREAM CLOSED LOW DEVELOPING OVER TX...BUT TRACK IT EASTWARD AT 
DIFFERENT SPEEDS. ENSEMBLE MEMBERS ARE WIDELY VARIED AS WELL. THIS 
IS TYPICALLY A DIFFICULT PATTERN FOR MODELS TO HANDLE. WITH THIS

259 PM EST MON MAR 3 2014

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND TUESDAY/...
THE WINTER STORM THAT IMPACTED THE REGION TODAY IS WINDING DOWN
THIS AFTERNOON. EARLIER...SOME LOCALLY HEAVY FREEZING RAIN AND
SLEET FELL ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND ALONG THE CUMBERLAND
MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...WHERE UP TO A QUARTER INCH OF
ICING WAS OBSERVED ALONG WITH HALF AN INCH TO ONE INCH OF SLEET IN
SOME AREAS. A SECONDARY AREA OF LIGHT FREEZING RAIN BROUGHT SOME
ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS TO THIS AREA ALONG WITH A GOOD PORTION OF
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY AS SOME COLDER SUBFREEZING AIR
FILTERED IN BEHIND THE PASSAGE OF A COLD FRONT. AS TEMPERATURES
COOLED ALOFT BY THE EARLY AFTERNOON...THIS FREEZING RAIN QUICKLY
CHANGED OVER TO LIGHT SNOW. IN GENERAL...MOST LOCATIONS ACROSS THE
AREA HAVE RECEIVED A DUSTING TO UP ONE INCH OF SNOW...WITH A FEW
LOCATIONS ALONG THE CUMBERLAND AND CLINCH MOUNTAINS RECEIVING
AROUND TWO INCHES.

AS DRIER AIR MOVES IN...THE INTENSITY OF THE PRECIPITATION IS
BEGINNING TO WANE. FOR THIS REASON...HAVE OPTED TO CANCEL THE
WINTER STORM WARNING FOR THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND CUMBERLAND
MOUNTAINS WHERE SOME SIGNIFICANT ICING AND SOME SNOW ACCUMULATED
EARLIER AND REPLACE IT WITH AN ADVISORY. WILL ALSO KEEP THE
EXISTING ADVISORY FOR THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY GOING
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING AS WELL TO
ACCOUNT FOR THIS PRECIPITATION WHICH COULD STILL PRODUCE SOME LIGHT
ACCUMULATIONS AND ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCALIZED SLICK ROADS ON
THE EVENING RUSH HOUR COMMUTE. 

BY THIS EVENING...THE SKY SHOULD BEGIN TO CLEAR A BIT AS DRIER AIR
MOVES IN AND PRECIPITATION COMPLETELY ENDS. THE COLD AIR WILL
CONTINUE TO FILTER IN OVERNIGHT AND WILL BE REINFORCED BY A MODEST
NORTHERLY FLOW. TEMPERATURES WILL PLUNGE INTO THE TEENS ACROSS
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE PLATEAU...AND DROP
INTO THE LOWER 20S ACROSS THE VALLEYS. THE COLD AIR WILL ALSO ALLOW
ANY ICE AND SNOW COVER TO REMAIN IN PLACE OVERNIGHT AND INTO THE
MORNING HOURS ON TUESDAY WHICH WOULD RESULT IN HAZARDOUS TRAVEL
CONDITIONS PERSISTING IN THESE AREAS THROUGH THE RUSH HOUR COMMUTE.
THE MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS ON MONDAY WILL RESULT IN SOME WARMING
INTO THE 40S DESPITE THE NORTHERLY FLOW. HOWEVER...THESE
TEMPERATURES ARE STILL WELL BELOW NORMAL FOR EARLY MARCH...AND IT
WILL FEEL LIKE WINTER FOR MUCH OF THE DAY.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
THE NEXT CHANCE OF PRECIP WILL ARRIVE LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY. 
THE NAM AND GFS HAVE VERY DIFFERENT DEPICTIONS OF THIS SYSTEM. THE 
GFS SHOWS A CLOSED MIDLEVEL CIRCULATION DEVELOPING OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST...WHILE THE NAM HAS A SHARP OPEN TROUGH PASSING TO OUR 
NORTH. THE GFS HAS SUPPORT FROM THE CANADIAN AND THE ECMWF. THE 
PREVIOUS FORECAST LOOKS MORE LIKE THE GFS AS WELL...SO WILL NOT MAKE 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES BASED ON THE LATEST NAM. MOST OF THIS EVENT 
LOOKS TO BE LIQUID PRECIP...WITH ONLY THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND 
PERHAPS SW VA SEEING A LITTLE SNOW.

A RIDGE OVER THE REGION WILL PROVIDE DRY WEATHER FOR FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY WITH GRADUALLY WARMING TEMPS. THEN A POSITIVELY-TILTED 
TROUGH AND COLD FRONT MOVE THROUGH THE AREA ON SUNDAY. MODELS ARE IN 
DECENT AGREEMENT WITH THIS SYSTEM...SO POPS WILL BE RAISED INTO THE 
CHANCE RANGE FOR SUNDAY. THIS EVENT LOOKS TO BE ALL LIQUID PRECIP AS 
THE COLD AIR LAGS WELL BEHIND THE DEPARTING MOISTURE DUE TO THE 
POSITIVE TILT OF THE MIDLEVEL TROUGH. MONDAY LOOKS DRY WITH BELOW 
NORMAL TEMPS.

.DISCUSSION...
THE COLDER...SUBFREEZING AIR IS FINALLY INFILTRATING A GOOD CHUNK OF 
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON AS THE TEMPERATURE HAS DROPPED TO AT OR BELOW FREEZING 
ALONG AND NORTH OF THE INTERSTATE 40 TO INTERSTATE 81 CORRIDOR. THIS 
HAS RESULTED IN LIGHT RAIN QUICKLY TRANSITIONING TO LIGHT FREEZING 
RAIN AND DRIZZLE /WHICH HAS BEGUN TO ACCUMULATE ON SURFACES SUCH AS 
TREES AND UNTREATED ROADS/. THUS...SOME LOCALIZED SLICK SPOTS ARE 
EXPECTED OVER A GOOD PORTION OF THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY THIS 
AFTERNOON DUE TO THIS LIGHT ACCUMULATING ICE AS TEMPERATURES 
CONTINUE TO FALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY. LOCATIONS ALONG THE NORTHERN 
PLATEAU AND THE CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA HAVE 
PICKED UP CLOSE TO ONE-QUARTER INCH OF ICE ALONG WITH SOME SLEET 
FROM THE EARLIER FREEZING RAIN THAT OCCURRED AROUND DAYBREAK. THUS 
THE ADDITIONAL LIGHT ICE ACCUMULATIONS WILL ONLY EXASPERATE THE 
HAZARDOUS TRAVEL CONDITIONS IN THOSE AREAS.

SOME LIGHT SNOW WILL THEN MOVE INTO THE REGION AS TEMPERATURES COOL 
ALOFT BY THE EARLY AFTERNOON. TOTAL SNOWFALL OF 1 TO 2 INCHES WILL 
BE POSSIBLE WITHIN THE HEAVIEST BANDS OF THIS ACTIVITY ALONG THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS WITHIN THE WARNING AREA. THUS...WILL MAINTAIN 
THE WINTER STORM WARNING FOR THOSE AREAS THROUGH 00Z. THIS AREA OF 
LIGHT SNOW WILL ALSO TRACK THROUGH THE ADVISORY AREA ALONG THE 
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY...AND COULD BRING HALF AN INCH TO 
PERHAPS AN INCH OF SNOW ACCUMULATION IN SOME SPOTS BY THE MID TO 
LATE AFTERNOON. THUS...DID DECIDE TO EXTEND THE TIME ON THE ADVISORY 
TO ACCOUNT FOR THE POTENTIAL FOR THESE LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS LASTING 
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON. THEREAFTER...PRECIPITATION 
WILL SHIFT EAST AS DRIER AIR WAYS ITS WAY INTO THE AREA FROM THE 
WEST. HOWEVER...DUE TO THE SUBFREEZING TEMPERATURES...SLIPPERY ROADS 
WILL PERSIST OVERNIGHT.

IN FROM THE NW. THIS TRANSITION ZONE WILL MIGRATE SLOWLY SE. 
PRECIPITATION WILL CHANGE TO SNOW A BIT FARTHER NW OF THE FRONTAL

30S ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND SOUTHEAST KY. THIS VERY COLD AIR MASS WILL 
SLOWLY MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT...WITH THE MODELS 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT RAIN WILL CHANGE TO FREEZING RAIN...SLEET... 
AND SNOW BEFORE SUNRISE OVER THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND 
CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS (WHERE A WINTER STORM WARNING IS CURRENTLY IN 
EFFECT). FREEZING SURFACE TEMPS ARE EXPECTED IN THESE AREAS BEFORE 
SUNRISE (WITH BOTH ICE AND SNOW ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED)...BUT THE 
MODELS SUGGEST THIS COLDER AIR WILL BE SLOWER TO MOVE EASTWARD INTO 
THE GREAT TN VALLEY AFTER SUNRISE ON MONDAY MORNING. THUS...ANY 
ACCUMULATIONS MONDAY MORNING IN THE GREAT TN VALLEY MAY BE MORE SNOW 
THAN ICE. BOTH THE NAM AND GFS MODELS INDICATE THAT RAIN WILL 
INITIALLY CHANGE TO SLEET (OR FREEZING RAIN WHERE TEMPS ARE ABLE TO 
FALL TO THE FREEZING MARK)...BEFORE CHANGING COMPLETELY TO SNOW 
BEFORE THE PRECIP ENDS.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL UPDATE 
LATER THIS EVENING TO REMOVE ANY EVENING WORDING. ALSO...WILL ADD 
MARION COUNTY TO THE WINTER WX ADVISORY WHERE THERE COULD BE SOME 
LIGHT ICE OR SNOW ACCUMULATIONS DEVELOPING IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
ON MONDAY MORNING.

418 PM EST SUN MAR 2 2014

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND MONDAY/...
A VERY CHALLENGING FORECAST 
FOR THE SHORT TERM AS RAIN...FREEZING RAIN...SLEET...AND SNOW ARE 
ALL EXPECTED. A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL MAKE ITS WAY INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA LATER THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT WITH PLENTY OF QPF 
AND COLD AIR TO MAKE FOR A MESSY FORECAST AND TRAVEL PROBLEMS ACROSS 
MANY OF OUR COUNTIES. RAIN WILL TRANSITION TO FREEZING RAIN 
BEGINNING AROUND 06 UTC ACROSS THE COUNTIES IN THE WARNING...THEN A 
BRIEF PERIOD OF SLEET...FOLLOWED BY SNOW AFTER 12 UTC DUE TO THE 
850MB WARM NOSE BEING ERODED BY THE COLDER AIR. FREEZING RAIN WILL 
BEGIN AROUND 09 TO 12 UTC FOR COUNTIES IN THE ADVISORY AND LAST 
THROUGH AROUND 14 UTC WHERE THEN A TRANSITION TO SNOW IS EXPECTED. 
SNOW SHOULD TAPER OFF TO LIGHT FREEZING DRIZZLE ACROSS ALL AREAS BY 
THE AFTERNOON HOURS AS SOUNDINGS SHOW A LOSS OF THE DEEPER MOISTURE 
WHICH THEREFORE KEEPS THE MOISTURE OUT OF THE DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE. 
BY THIS POINT THOUGH...ONLY MINOR ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED AS THE 
MAJORITY OF THE MOISTURE WILL BE OFF TO OUR EAST BY AROUND 18 UTC. 
BACKWARD TEMPERATURE CURVE TOMORROW AS TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARMEST 
TOMORROW MORNING AND WILL STEADILY FALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THIS 
WILL ALLOW FOR WHAT WINTRY PRECIP THAT DOES FALL...TO STICK AROUND 
AS MOST AREAS WILL BE WELL BELOW FREEZING BY THE AFTERNOON HOURS. 
STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY IN REGARDS TO FREEZING RAIN AND SNOW AMOUNTS 
DUE TO WHEN THE TRANSITION TAKES PLACE. FUTURE SHIFTS WILL HAVE TO 
CLOSELY MONITOR TRENDS AND MAKE UPDATES AS NEEDED.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY/...
IN WAKE OF THE STORM SYSTEM THAT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION 
TONIGHT INTO MONDAY...A STOUT NORTHWEST FLOW WILL HELP TO REINFORCE 
THE COLDER AIR ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH AT LEAST THE MIDDLE OF THE 
UPCOMING WORK WEEK. SOME CLEARING WILL TAKE PLACE BY MONDAY EVENING 
/WHICH ALONG WITH THE COLD AIR MASS/ WILL PROMOTE LOW TEMPERATURES 
DROPPING INTO THE TEENS ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION. SOME SUNSHINE ON 
TUESDAY WILL ALLOW FOR SOME MELTING OF ICE AND SNOW ON THE ROADS BY 
THE LATE MORNING AND AFTERNOON...AND HIGHS SHOULD CLIMB WELL INTO 
THE 40S. WARMER...BUT STILL SUBFREEZING TEMPERATURES WILL RETURN 
TUESDAY NIGHT...BEFORE A SLIGHTLY WARMER DAY IN THE MID 40S TO LOWER 
50S WILL TAKE PLACE ON WEDNESDAY. MODELS DIFFER SLIGHTLY ON THE 
TIMING OF NEXT STORM SYSTEM THAT WILL CLIP THE REGION DURING THE 
LATER PART OF THE WORK WEEK. THE GFS IS A LITTLE FASTER THAN THE 
ECMWF AND SHOWS SOME SHOWERS SKIRTING THE REGION THURSDAY INTO 
THURSDAY NIGHT...WHILE THE ECMWF INDICATES A THURSDAY NIGHT INTO 
FRIDAY TIME FRAME. DURING THIS TIME FRAME...WINDS WILL ALSO SHIFT TO 
THE SOUTHWEST LATE IN THE WEEK INTO THE WEEKEND WHICH WILL ALLOW 
HIGHS TO RETURN INTO THE 50S TO LOWER 60S AND LOWS INTO THE UPPER 
30S AND 40S. THIS WOULD PROMOTE A MOSTLY LIQUID PRECIPITATION 
EVENT. AN ADDITIONAL CLIPPER FRONT WILL THEN DROP SOUTH FROM THE 
OHIO VALLEY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS SATURDAY INTO 
SUNDAY...THOUGH THE GFS IS AROUND 12 HOURS FASTER THAN THE ECMWF. 
FOR NOW...HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GIVEN THE WEAK QPF SIGNALS 
ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND WILL WAIT FOR BETTER MODEL AGREEMENT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...STRONG COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM 
WV THROUGH EAST CENTRAL KY TO W TN THIS MORNING. UPPER NORTHERN JET 
NEAR ZONAL THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES REGION TODAY. SHORT WAVE TROUGH 
MOVING EAST INTO OK LATER TODAY. INCREASED SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ACROSS 
THE TN VALLEY TODAY. THESE FEATURES LEAD TO LITTLE MOVEMENT OF THE 
FRONT TODAY. CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE TODAY WITH LIGHT RAIN 
MOVING INTO THE AREA LATE. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL WITH 
GOOD WARM AIR ADVECTION SE OF THE FRONT. SHORT WAVE MOVES INTO W TN 
TONIGHT WITH STRENGTHENING JET EAST OF THE TROUGH OVER THE TN 
VALLEY. PRECIPITATION WILL BECOME WIDESPREAD AND WITH THE POSITION 
OF THE SHORT WAVE ...BE ALONG AND MAINLY BEHIND SURFACE FRONT. 
STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL OCCUR BEHIND FRONT AS IT MOVES 
SOUTHEAST INTO THE MRX CWA EARLY MONDAY. FORECAST SOUNDINGS DEPICT 
INITIALLY SHALLOW COLD AIR WORKING ITS WAY UP TO H85 ACROSS NW AREAS 
BY 03/12Z. SOUNDINGS ARE NEAR O ISOTHERM UP TO H70 AT THAT TIME. 
SLEET IS AS LIKELY AS FREEZING RAIN AS PRECIPITATION TYPE IS IN 
TRANSITION. JET AXIS REMAINS BACK TOWARD MIDDLE TN SO MODERATE 
PRECIPITATION WILL CONTINUE ON BACKSIDE OF COLD FRONT. LEANED TOWARD 
A LOW RATIO OF ICE ACCRETION RATES SINCE PRECIPITATION RATES LOOK 
MODERATELY HEAVY INITIALLY. WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE UPPER TROUGH 
AXIS BY MID DAY MONDAY LAYER MOISTURE DROPS OF WITH BULK OF MOISTURE 
BELOW THE SNOW GROWTH REGION. PRECIPITATION TYPE COULD EASILY BE 
FREEZING DRIZZLE AS WELL AS SNOW...ESPECIALLY ACROSS VALLEY 
LOCATIONS. LIGHT SNOW WILL LINGER IN SW VA AND TN MOUNTAINS. 
DRAMATIC TEMPERATURE FALL EXPECTED MONDAY. ADVISORIES MAY NEED TO BE 
EXTENDED...MAINLY FOR ICE ON MONDAY PENDING SYSTEM EVOLUTION.


.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A FEW LINGERING LIGHT 
SNOW SHOWERS WILL REMAIN OVER FAR NORTHEASTERN LOCATIONS MONDAY 
EVENING AS THE MONDAY MORNING COLD FRONT EXITS THE AREA. NO 
ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED BY THIS TIME FRAME.  
HOWEVER...MUCH COLDER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO FILTER IN THROUGH THE 
NIGHT...PUSHING OVERNIGHT LOWS INTO THE TEENS AND 20S.  FLOW ALOFT 
BECOMES ZONAL THROUGH THE NIGHT AND WILL BE BETWEEN WEATHER SYSTEMS 
FOR THE REST OF MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH TEMPERATURES 
SLOWLY MODERATING.  THE NEXT SYSTEM WILL MOVE IN LATE WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT INTO THURSDAY.  PRECIP WILL MOVE IN FROM THE SOUTH AND SPREAD 
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE MRX CWA.  A MIX OF RAIN AND SNOWS IS POSSIBLE 
LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY MORNING...THE CHANCE OF SNOW 
WILL MAINLY BE OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS.  
THE SNOW SHOULD TRANSITION TO RAIN BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON AS 
TEMPERATURES WARM.  SCATTERED PRECIP WILL SLOWLY END THURSDAY NIGHT 
INTO FRIDAY MORNING BUT THESE LINGERING SHOWERS MAY ONCE AGAIN 
SWITCH BACK TO LIGHT SNOW LATE THURSDAY NIGHT AGAIN OVER HIGHER 
TERRAIN AND NORTHERN AREAS.  MODEL CONSISTENCY BECOMES QUIET POOR BY 
THE END OF THE PERIOD.  THE GFS INDICATES ANOTHER SYSTEM...A WEAK 
COLD FRONT...MAY MOVE IN FOR SATURDAY.  WITH CONFIDENCE LOW WILL 
KEEP POPS LOW FOR NOW.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
316 PM EST SAT MAR 1 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE WILL 
LINGER OVER THE AREA DURING THE PERIOD.  A COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY 
SAG INTO OUR AREA BY SUNDAY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON...BUT THE 
PRECIPITATION WILL BE MAINLY BEHIND IT.  WILL KEEP THINGS DRY FOR 
TONIGHT WITH CHANCE POPS REACHING INTO WESTERN ZONES AND SLIGHT 
CHANCE MUCH OF CENTRAL BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON.  WILL KEEP POPS OUT OF 
EASTERN MOUNTAINS THROUGH SUNDAY.  TEMPS WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL 
SUNDAY. WILL GENERALLY GO AT OR A BIT ABOVE MAV TEMPS FOR THE SHORT 
TERM. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A VERY COMPLICATED
FORECAST IN PLACE FOR LATE SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY REGARDING A LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THAT WILL LIKELY
BRING THE REGION A BOUT OF WINTER WEATHER. RAIN ON SUNDAY EVENING
WILL EVENTUALLY MIX WITH AND CHANGE OVER TO WINTERY PRECIPITATION
LATE SUNDAY NIGHT ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND CUMBERLAND
MOUNTAINS...AND EVENTUALLY SPREAD SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE VALLEY AND
INTO THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AFTER SUNRISE ON MONDAY. A GREAT
DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY STILL EXISTS REGARDING WHEN THE ONSET OF
SUBFREEZING AIR WILL ARRIVE AND HOW MUCH AVAILABLE MOISTURE WILL BE
PRESENT AT THAT TIME. HOWEVER...THE LATEST TRENDS ALL INDICATE A
SOUTHWARD MOVING COLD FRONT MOVING IN AROUND 12Z MONDAY AND SOME
SUBFREEZING AIR FILTERING INTO THE REGION IN ITS WAKE...WHICH WOULD
CHANGE RAIN OVER TO FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET INITIALLY AND
EVENTUALLY OVER TO SNOW AS TEMPERATURES ALOFT COOL AND THE SYSTEM
WINDS DOWN AND HEAD EAST.

THE NAM AND ECMWF SOLUTIONS BOTH INDICATE A COLDER BOUNDARY LAYER 
PROFILE AND A FASTER ONSET OF SUBFREEZING TEMPERATURES. THE NAM IN 
PARTICULAR SHOWS A PRONOUNCED WARM NOSE ALOFT ON MODEL SOUNDINGS FOR 
THE 09-15Z TIME PERIOD WHICH WOULD PROMOTE A LONGER DURATION 
FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET EVENT ONCE THE COLDER AIR SUBFREEZING AIR 
MOVES IN AT THE SURFACE. THIS ICING POTENTIAL IS EVIDENT ESPECIALLY 
ALONG THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS WHICH 
WILL EXPERIENCE THE COLDER SURFACE TEMPERATURES LONGER...COUPLED 
WITH SOME OF THE DEEPER MOISTURE. INCREASING THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME 
LOCALLY HEAVIER WINTERY PRECIPITATION IN THESE AREAS WILL BE SOME 
ENHANCED FRONTOGENESIS /AND ASSOCIATED LIFT/ TAKING PLACE ALOFT AS 
THE FRONT PUSHES THROUGH AROUND DAYBREAK. THE FREEZING RAIN/SLEET 
PROFILE WILL EVENTUALLY SAG SOUTHWARD TOWARD THE I-40/I-81 CORRIDOR 
AND THE KNOXVILLE/MORRISTOWN/TRI-CITIES METRO AREAS BY RUSH HOUR 
THROUGH PERHAPS MID-MORNING. WHILE THE MOISTURE IS NOT AS DEEP AT 
THIS TIME PERIOD...THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME LIGHT ICING AND 
POTENTIALLY SLIPPERY ROADWAYS WILL STILL EXIST ACROSS THE CENTRAL 
AND NORTHERN VALLEY. BY MID-MORNING...COLDER AIR WILL QUICKLY FILTER 
IN ALOFT AND A CHANGE OVER TO ALL SNOW IS EXPECTED ACROSS THE 
REGION. LOCATIONS ACROSS THE FOOTHILLS AND MOUNTAINS WILL LIKELY 
JUST EXPERIENCE THIS CHANGE OVER FROM RAIN TO SNOW BY THE LATE 
MORNING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AS THE SYSTEM WINDS DOWN. SOME LIGHT 
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OF UP TO HALF AN INCH ARE POSSIBLE IN MANY 
AREAS...WITH AMOUNTS OF 1 INCH TO PERHAPS 2 INCHES IN A FEW HIGHER 
ELEVATION AREAS POSSIBLE ACROSS FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. THE GFS ON THE OTHERHAND...IS SLIGHTLY SLOWER 
WITH THE ONSET OF THE COLDER AIR...BUT IT STILL SHOWS SOME BRIEF 
PERIODS OF FREEZING RAIN AND SNOW OVER MANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED 
AREAS DURING MORNING. 


ONE LAST NOTE ON THE ICING POTENTIAL SHOULD BE THAT THE WARM 
ANTECEDENT TEMPERATURES AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL HELP TO PREVENT 
PROBLEMS INITIALLY AS SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARMER...BUT ONCE 
THE COLDER SUBFREEZING AIR SETTLES IN AROUND DAYBREAK...ICE 
ACCUMULATIONS /ESPECIALLY IN THE AFOREMENTIONED FAVORED AREAS/ ARE 
EXPECTED. THUS...HAVE AMENDED THE FORECAST TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS 
INCREASED POTENTIAL. WHILE MOST LOCATIONS WILL EXPERIENCE A FEW 
HUNDREDTHS OF AN INCH OF ICE ACCUMULATIONS...SOME AREAS ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN PLATEAU AND CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS WILL SEE AMOUNTS OVER 
ONE-TENTH OF AN INCH. THESE LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS COMBINED WITH THE 
POSSIBLE LIGHT SNOW WOULD LEAD TO SOME POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS TRAVEL 
CONDITIONS IN THESE AREAS MONDAY MORNING. AN ADVISORY WILL LIKELY BE 
NEEDED FOR THESE AREAS...AND PERHAPS INTO THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL 
VALLEY FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING SHOULD THESE TRENDS 
CONTINUE. FOR NOW...WILL CONTINUE TO HANDLE WITH AN SPS. 

BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...MUCH COLDER AIR WILL RUSH INTO THE 
AREA...ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO FALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON MONDAY 
AND PLUMMET MONDAY NIGHT INTO THE TEENS AS COLD AIR ADVECTION TAKES 
PLACE. DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY BEFORE THE 
NEXT STORM SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO IMPACT THE REGION SOMETIME LATE IN 
THE WEEK. HOWEVER...THE GFS IS MUCH FASTER THAN THE ECMWF BY AROUND 
A DAY TO DAY AND A HALF. THUS...HAVE BEEN CAUTIOUS WITH ADJUSTING 
POPS TOO HIGH FOR NOW AND WILL WAIT FOR ADDITIONAL MODEL RUNS.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND SATURDAY/...
A WEAKENING SHORT WAVE WILL SWING ACROSS THE REGION TONIGHT/EARLY
SATURDAY. FORCING WILL BE UNIMPRESSIVE...BUT A BAND OF WEAK
ISENTROPIC LIFT MAY BRING SOME VERY LIGHT PRECIP TO THE AREA.
MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED...AND TREND OF THE MODELS HAS BEEN DRYER.
LOW LEVELS ESPECIALLY DRY TO START...SO WHAT LITTLE PRECIP FALLS
WILL HAVE A HARD TIME REACHING THE SURFACE AT LEAST AT FIRST. WILL
JUST CARRY LOW CHANCE POPS SOUTHWEST ZONES AND SLIGHT CHANCE
ELSEWHERE WITH THIS. WHILE ANY PRECIP IS EXPECTED TO BE QUITE LIGHT
AND MOST AREAS UNLIKELY TO MEASURE EVEN A HUNDREDTH...PRECIP TYPE
WILL BE PROBLEMATIC ANYWHERE PRECIP OCCURS. EVAPORATIVE COOLING MAY
LEAD TO SOME SNOW OR SLEET MIXING IN WITH THE RAIN...AND SURFACE
TEMPS MAY BE LOW ENOUGH FOR FREEZING RAIN AT LEAST IN A FEW SPOTS.
ONCE ANY PRECIP EXITS THE NORTHEAST ZONES SATURDAY...SHOULD SEE AT
LEAST SOME DECREASE IN CLOUDS...AND HIGH TEMPS CLOSE TO SEASONAL
NORMALS.

.LONG TERM SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...
A VERY COMPLICATED FORECAST IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD AS THE
POTENTIAL FOR SOME WINTER WEATHER WILL EXIST LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO
MONDAY AS A FAST-MOVING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SHIFTS FROM THE LOWER-
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY OVERNIGHT AND
EVENTUALLY THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AFTER DAYBREAK. AHEAD OF THIS
SYSTEM...BREEZY SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS WILL PUSH HIGH TEMPERATURES
INTO THE 60S IN MOST LOCATIONS BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THE FAIRLY MILD
CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST INTO EVENING HOURS BEFORE A COLD FRONT WILL
RAPIDLY APPROACH THE REGION LATE IN THE NIGHT. DEPENDING ON THE
TIMING OF THIS FRONT AND ITS ASSOCIATED COLD AIR...A CHANGE OVER TO
SOME FREEZING RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE LATE SUNDAY NIGHT ALONG THE
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THE CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS OF
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. THE NAM IS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THE COLDER AIR
MOVING IN FASTER...AND IS COUPLED WITH SOME HEAVIER BANDS OF
PRECIPITATION AND MOISTURE. THE GFS IS NOT QUITE AS BULLISH WITH
THE MOISTURE AND THE COLDER AIR...BUT IT TOO SHOWS A QUICKER
MOVING SYSTEM AND SOME FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET OCCURRING WITHIN
THESE AREAS AS WELL BY 12Z OR SO. THE WARM ANTECEDENT TEMPERATURES
AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL HELP TO PREVENT PROBLEMS INITIALLY AS
SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARMER...BUT ONCE THE COLDER
SUBFREEZING AIR SETTLES IN AROUND DAYBREAK SOME LIGHT ICE
ACCUMULATIONS OF A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF AN INCH WILL BE POSSIBLE IN
THESE AREAS. GIVEN THE LATEST MODEL TRENDS...HAVE AMENDED THE
FORECAST TO REFLECT THESE CHANGES FOR SOME MINOR ICING. THIS SYSTEM
WILL CERTAINLY NEED TO BE MONITORED AS THE NAM IS MORE BULLISH WITH
BRINGING THE POTENTIAL FOR FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET /POSSIBLY
HEAVIER/ FURTHER SOUTH AND EAST INTO THE VALLEY. HOWEVER...IT
SHOULD BE NOTED THAT CONFIDENCE IS STILL FAIRLY LOW CONCERNING ANY
WIDESPREAD ICING OF ONE-TENTH OF AN INCH OR MORE...SO WILL REMAIN
CAUTIOUS FOR THIS ISSUANCE AND WAIT TO SEE WHICH WAY THE MODELS
TREND IN SUCCESSIVE RUNS THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT. WILL HANDLE THIS
WITH A MENTION IN THE HWO AND A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT FOR THESE
AREAS FOR NOW.

BEHIND THE INITIAL BURST OF FREEZING RAIN AND RAIN...TEMPERATURES
WILL BEGIN TO FALL THROUGH THE DAY AS COLD AIR ADVECTION TAKES
PLACE. A CHANGE OVER TO LIGHT SNOW IS EXPECTED BY THE AFTERNOON
ALONG THE PLATEAU BEFORE TAPERING OFF BY EARLY EVENING IN THE
NORTHEAST ZONES. VERY MINOR ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED IN THESE
AREAS AND MOST LOCATIONS WILL SEE NO SNOWFALL. THE SKY MAY BEGIN TO
CLEAR SLIGHTLY SOONER AS THE SYSTEM DEPARTS MONDAY NIGHT...SO HAVE
REFLECTED THIS TREND IN THE GRIDS AS WELL. DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED
FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY BEFORE THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM IS PROGGED
TO IMPACT THE REGION SOMETIME LATE IN THE WEEK...YIELDING ANOTHER
DECENT CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION. THE GFS IS MUCH FASTER THAN THE
ECMWF BY AROUND A DAY OR SO. THUS...HAVE BEEN CAUTIOUS WITH
ADJUSTING POPS TOO HIGH FOR NOW AND WILL WAIT FOR ADDITIONAL MODEL
RUNS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...ATMOSPHERE QUITE DRY OVER

NORTH AND WILL BE TO OUR NORTHEAST FRIDAY.  SOME MOISTURE WILL START 
TO RETURN LATER TONIGHT AND FRIDAY...MAINLY IN THE FORM OF HIGH 
CLOUDS. WILL STICK CLOSE TO MAV TEMPS...WHICH LOOK GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE.   

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A SHORTWAVE CLIPPER
SYSTEM WILL TRACK THROUGH THE REGION FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY
MORNING...BRINGING A BRIEF PUSH OF COLDER AIR INTO THE REGION
BEHIND THE FRONT. SOME LIGHT SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE
ENTIRE REGION LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY SATURDAY
MORNING...THOUGH THE MODELS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY WITH QPF AMOUNTS.
THE NAM IS FAR MORE BULLISH SHOWING AROUND ONE-TENTH TO TWO-TENTHS
OF LIQUID PRECIP OVER A GOOD PORTION OF THE CWA...WHILE THE GFS
YIELDS ONLY A TRACE TO ONE-HUNDREDTH IN A FEW LOCATIONS AND
INDICATES DRY CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE. GIVEN THE ABUNDANT MOISTURE AND
SOME FORCING ARRIVING LATE IN THE NIGHT...THINK THERE IS A
REASONABLE SHOT THAT MOST LOCATIONS WILL EXPERIENCE SOME MEASURABLE
PRECIPITATION...BUT NOT FOR AS LONG OF A DURATION AS THE NAM
SUGGESTS. THE OTHER QUESTION WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR SNOW LATE
FRIDAY NIGHT IN THE NORTHEAST ZONES AS THE COLDER AIR MOVES IN.
THINK THAT A DUSTING TO PERHAPS HALF AN INCH WILL BE POSSIBLE
ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...WITH A COUPLE
SPOTS ALONG THE PEAKS POSSIBLY APPROACHING ONE INCH. HOWEVER...MOST
AREAS EXPERIENCE A COLD RAIN WITH SOME LIGHT SNOW MIXING IN LATE.

ANOTHER STRONGER FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION LATE 
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...BRINGING A MUCH BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR 
WIDESPREAD MEANINGFUL PRECIPITATION. HAVE INCREASED POPS TO HIGH-END 
LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL DURING THIS TIME PERIOD TO REFLECT THIS 
CONFIDENCE. A STRONG SOUTHWEST FLOW AHEAD OF THE FRONT ON SUNDAY 
WILL PUSH HIGHS WELL INTO THE 60S TO AROUND 70 DEGREES IN SOME 
SPOTS. THE WARM CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT INTO MONDAY WILL KEEP 
PRECIPITATION ALL RAIN EXCEPT AT THE TAIL END OF THE EVENT LATE 
MONDAY NIGHT WHEN SOME LIGHT SNOW COULD MIX IN LATE ALONG THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN OF THE NORTHEAST ZONES. A DRY AND FAIRLY SEASONABLE PATTERN 
WILL THEN SET-UP FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY BEFORE MODELS DIVERGE 
GREATLY FOR DAY 7 ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. THE ECMWF SHOWS A 
STRONG UPPER-LOW TRACKING OVER THE REGION BRINGING WIDESPREAD HEAVY 
PRECIPITATION TO THE AREA...WHILE THE GFS INDICATES A MUCH WEAKER 
TROUGH AND FAIRLY DRY WEATHER. FOR NOW...HAVE BEEN CAUTIOUS AND HAVE 
ONLY LOW-END CHANCE POPS FOR THE EXTENDED...AND WILL WAIT TO SEE HOW 
THINGS SHAKE OUT WITH FUTURE MODEL RUNS IN THE COMING DAY OR TWO.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LIGHT SNOW STREAKING OUT IN WEST 
THROUGH EAST FASHION JUST SOUTH OF THE OHIO VALLEY IN ASSOCIATION 
WITH AN UPPER TROUGH. KEPT THE SAME FORECAST IDEOLOGY GOING FROM 
PREVIOUS FORECAST WHICH BASICALLY HAS LIKELY POPS ACROSS SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA AND EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AS THIS BAND OF LIGHT SNOW 
DROPS SOUTH ACROSS THIS REGION OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
MOISTURE IS LIMITED AND LIFT NOT TERRIBLY IMPRESSIVE WITH THIS 
FEATURE AND ASSOCIATED MODIFIED ARCTIC SURFACE BOUNDARY. THEREFORE 
WHILE LIGHT SNOW MAY OCCUR IN THIS AREA...AND TO A LESSER EXTENT 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND OVER THE SMOKY 
MOUNTAINS...ACCUMULATION WILL BE MAINLY LIMITED TO THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN WHERE UP TO AN INCH IS POSSIBLE. ONLY A MINOR DUSTING IS 
EXPECTED IN THE VALLEYS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. FARTHER SOUTH 
ACROSS CENTRAL EAST AND A SMALL PART OF SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE WOULD 
EXPECT JUST A COUPLE FLURRIES. MODEL FORECASTS INDICATE A CLEARING 
TREND FOR THE AFTERNOOON HOURS AS THE UPPER TROUGH SHIFTS EAST. 
UNDERCUT MOS MAX TEMPS BY SEVERAL DEGREES TODAY AS THE NEW ARCTIC 
SURGE SPREADS ACROSS THE AREA AND WENT SLIGHTLY BELOW SUGGESTED MINS 
TONIGHT IN THE CLEAR SKY AND DRY AIR ENVIRONMENT EXPECTED ACROSS THE 
REGION.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD 
AIR MOVES IN THURSDAY AS A CLOSED LOW TRACKS ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. 
THE COLUMN REMAINS VERY DRY WITH THE FRONT/TROUGH PASSAGE...SO NO 
PRECIP IS EXPECTED. A RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE AREA FRIDAY...FOLLOWED 
BY A BACKING WINDS AHEAD OF A SHORTWAVE TROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS 
WILL RESULT IN SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT AND LIGHT PRECIP FRIDAY 
NIGHT...PERHAPS LINGERING INTO SATURDAY MORNING IN NE SECTIONS. 
TEMPS MAY BE COLD ENOUGH FOR A LITTLE SNOW IN SW VA AND HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS...BUT THE FAST MOVEMENT WILL KEEP ANY ACCUMULATIONS 
LIGHT. THE NAM SHOWS A BIT OF A WARM NOSE DEVELOPING BEFORE THE 
PRECIP ENDS...SUGGESTING A PERIOD OF SLEET/FZRA IS POSSIBLE. AT THIS 
TIME THE WARM NOSE APPEARS WEAK...SO WILL NOT MENTION ANY MIXED 
PRECIP YET...BUT IT WILL BEAR WATCHING IN LATER FORECASTS.

THE PATTERN TURNS WARMER AND MORE MOIST FOR THE WEEKEND AS HIGH 
PRESSURE OFF THE GA/FL COAST PROVIDES A DEEP SW FLOW. TEMPERATURES 
WILL RISE ABOVE NORMAL. A BOUNDARY SETS UP FROM TX/OK TO THE OHIO 
VALLEY...PARALLEL TO THE MID/UPPER FLOW. THUS PRECIP WILL BE SLOW TO 
MOVE INTO THE AREA ON SUNDAY...BUT BY SUNDAY NIGHT POPS BEGIN TO 
RISE AS THE FRONT BEGINS TO SAG SOUTHEAST AND TH UPPER JET DRAWS 
CLOSER. THE GFS AND ECMWF HAVE SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES DUE TO THE 
ECMWF HAVING A MORE WELL DEFINED AND PROGRESSIVE 500 MB TROUGH...BUT 
THE GEFS MEMBERS SEEM TO BE CLUSTERING AROUND MONDAY MORNING FOR 
HIGHEST PRECIP CHANCES. WILL RAISE POPS TO LIKELY THIS PERIOD. THE 
MORE PROGRESSIVE ECMWF ENDS PRECIP QUICKLY MONDAY NIGHT...BUT THE 
GFS BRINGS A SECONDARY TROUGH THROUGH ON TUESDAY...WITH ANOTHER SHOT 
OF COLD AIR BEHIND IT. WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING FOR 
TUESDAY AS WAS PREVIOUSLY FORECAST.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL QUICKLY 
MOVE THROUGH LATE TONIGHT INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING.  MODELS 
TRENDING A BIT DRIER AND WEAKER.  STILL EXPECT LOW TO MID LEVEL 
CLOUDS MOVING IN LATE TONIGHT.  LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP BUT 
COVERAGE SHOULD BE FAIRLY LOW WITH BEST CHANCE OVER NORTHERN AREAS 
AND HIGHER TERRAIN.  HOWEVER...THERE IS A DISTURBANCE TRACKING TO 
OUR SOUTH THAT MAY AID SHOWER DEVELOPMENT OVER SOUTHERN LOCATIONS.  
OVERALL...PRECIP AMOUNTS LOOK LOW WITH MOST LOWER ELEVATIONS SOUTH 
RECEIVING LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL.  A COUPLE OF TENTH OF 
SNOW IS POSSIBLE NORTH.  HIGHER ELEVATIONS MAY AVERAGE AROUND A HALF

MOVES OUT QUICKLY AND DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED BY AFTERNOON.  
BEHIND THE FRONT...MUCH COLDER AIR WILL BEGIN TO SETTLE INTO THE 
REGION...AND WEDNESDAY/S HIGHS WILL BE WELL BELOW NORMAL.

LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...GOOD CONTINUITY AND 
MODEL CONSENSUS FOR EXPECTED WEATHER PATTERNS THROUGH SATURDAY. 
HOWEVER...MODELS ARE STILL QUITE DIVERGENT WITH THE DEVELOPING UPPER 
TROUGH FOR SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...ESPECIALLY ON TIMING THE SYSTEM 
MOVING THROUGH THE APPALACHIANS. ECMWF IS STILL ABOUT 6 TO 12 HOURS 
FASTER...WHICH COULD LEAD TO DRY WEATHER AS EARLY AS MONDAY NIGHT 
AND CERTAINLY TUESDAY. GFS WAS MUCH SLOWER WITH THE 00Z MODEL RUN... 
BUT STILL SOMEWHAT SLOWER THAN LATEST ECMWF WITH THE 12Z RUN TODAY. 

MINOR CHANGES I MADE FOR SENSIBLE WEATHER WAS TO GO LOW END OF

INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH AXIS WILL EXTEND N TO NE INTO THE REGION 
SUNDAY NIGHT WITH A COLD FRONT APPROACHING BY MONDAY MORNING. WENT

328 AM EST TUE FEB 25 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
AN AREA OF DENSE CLOUD COVER IS BUILDING IN FROM THE WEST THIS 
MORNING. THE MODELS SEEM TO HAVE A HANDLE ON THIS...AND SHOW THESE 
CLOUDS DISSIPATING IN THE AFTERNOON. IN ADDITION...A 850 MB TROUGH 
MOVES THROUGH THIS MORNING...WITH WEAK COLD ADVECTION DEVELOPING 
BEHIND. THIS WILL MAKE FOR A TRICKY TEMPERATURE FORECAST TODAY. WENT 
A BIT BELOW MOS GUIDANCE CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF UPSTREAM CLOUD 
COVER...MAKING ME SKEPTICAL OF MUCH AFTERNOON CLEARING. WILL KEEP 
TODAY DRY AS MOISTURE IS CONFINED TO THE 850-700 MB LAYER WITH VERY 
WEAK LIFT. 

NAM AND GFS APPEAR TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE TROUGH PASSAGE 
TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING. BOTH SHOW A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE 
NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM JETS UNTIL THE TROUGH MOVES WELL EAST. 
THIS SHOULD MEAN WEAK FORCING AND LIMITED MOISTURE AS THE 
FAST-MOVING NORTHERN STREAM WILL BE THE MAIN PLAYER FOR OUR AREA. 
STRONG COLD ADVECTION DEVELOPS LATE TONIGHT...WITH LIGHT SNOW COMING 
MAINLY BETWEEN 08Z AND 12Z. HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA AND NE TN 
COULD SEE AROUND ONE INCH ACCUMULATION WHERE UPSLOPE FLOW WILL AID 
PRECIP...AND SNOW-LIQUID RATIOS MAY BE HIGH. MOST LOCATIONS IN THE 
NORTHERN PLATEAU AND NORTHERN VALLEY MAY SEE A FEW TENTHS AT BEST. 
TIMING AROUND SUNRISE COULD POSE SOME MORNING COMMUTE ISSUES...SO 
WILL ISSUE AN SPS. 

THE REST OF THE PERIOD WILL FEATURE TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW NORMAL 
AS THE LONGWAVE TROUGH SETS UP OVER THE EAST COAST AND A DEEP NW 
FLOW PERSISTS OVER THE AREA. ANOTHER SHOT OF COLD AIR ARRIVES ON 
THURSDAY AS A CLOSED LOW TRACKS ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
GFS/ECMWF RELATIVELY CLOSE IN DEPICTION OF EXPECTED WEATHER
THROUGH MOST OF THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST.
HOWEVER...DETERMINISTIC RUNS ARE WILDLY OUT OF SYNC LATER SUNDAY
NIGHT INTO MONDAY AND BEYOND. THEREFORE...CONFIDENCE QUITE A BIT
LOWER THAN USUAL AT THE END OF THE LONG TERM. FRIDAY BASICALLY
STARTS OUT DRY BUT A FAST MOVING LOW AMPLITUDE SHORT WAVE BUILDS
EAST FROM THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY LATER IN THE DAY FRIDAY EXITING
ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS AROUND THE 12Z SATURDAY TIME FRAME. STAYED
WITH MEDIUM TO HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR LIGHT RAIN AND SOME LIGHT SNOW
AS SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE TOO COLD FOR RAIN
ESPECIALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. LOWERED POPS QUITE A BIT BEHIND THIS
WAVE WHICH APPEARS TO DEPART SATURDAY MORNING. THIS ALLOWS FOR
ABOUT A 24 HOUR BREAK IN THE ACTION CONCERNING PRECIPITATION WITH
AMPLIFICATION IN THE UPPER PATTERN DEVELOPING. UPPER LEVEL RIDGING
WITH INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT HELPS TO BOOST MAX
TEMPERATURES BACK CLOSE TO NORMAL SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. ALONG WITH
THE WARM UP WILL COME INCREASING MOISTURE ON SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL
FLOW WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS SUNDAY AFTERNOON WITH AN
APPROACHING UPPER TROUGH. SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY IS WHERE THE
MODELS REALLY DIVERGE WITH THE ECMWF SMOKING AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH
AND MID LATITUDE CYCLONE THROUGH THE EASTERN U.S. WHILE THE GFS IS
MUCH SLOWER TO ADVANCE THIS SYSTEM EAST. (ALONG WITH SURROUNDING
WFOS) WENT CLOSER TO THE SLOWER GFS ALLOWING FOR HIGHEST POPS FOR
SHOWERS ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND THEN HOLDING ONTO AT LEAST 40 PERCENT
POPS MONDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT.

.DISCUSSION...
FAIRLY BENIGN CONDITIONS ARE IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION THIS
EVENING AS A COOL AND DRY POST-FRONTAL AIR MASS IS PROMOTING MOSTLY
CLEAR CONDITIONS. DEWPOINTS ARE ACTUALLY IN THE LOW TO MID TEENS
OVER MUCH OF THE REGION THIS EVENING...CREATING DEWPOINT
DEPRESSIONS OF 25 TO 30 DEGREES IN MANY SPOTS. THIS DRY AIR ALONG
WITH THE CLEAR SKY AND LIGHT WINDS HAS ALLOWED FOR GOOD RADIATIONAL
COOLING AS TEMPERATURES HAVE DROPPED INTO THE 40S AND EVEN THE
UPPER 30S IN A FEW SPOTS AS OF 9 PM EST. SOME CLOUD COVER SHOULD
INCREASE OVERNIGHT AS THE NEXT TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE APPROACHES
THE AREA FROM THE WEST...BUT THEY WILL MAINLY BE IN THE FORM OF
HIGH-LEVEL CLOUDS UNTIL DAYBREAK ON TUESDAY. THUS...AM STILL
EXPECTING LOWS TO BOTTOM OUT IN THE MID TO UPPER 20S ACROSS
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...WITH READINGS JUST IN
THE LOW TO MID 30S ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
AREA THIS EVENING WILL SLOWLY LIFT OUT OVERNIGHT ALLOWING A WEAK 
SHORT WAVE TO PUSH THROUGH ON TUESDAY.  THE RESULT WILL BE DRY 
CONDITION WITH INCREASING CLOUDS LATE TONIGHT.  ON TUESDAY...THE 
SHORT WAVE MOVES THROUGH.  LITTLE MOISTURE OR LIFT IS ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE WAVE AND EXPECT A BAND OF LOWER TO MID LEVEL CLOUDS TO MOVE 
IN WITH A FEW AREAS OF SLIGHT MAINLY RAIN OR SPRINKLES POSSIBLE 
MAINLY DURING THE LATE MORNING INTO EARLY AFTERNOON.  COVERAGE 
SHOULD BE MINIMAL AND WILL KEEP POPS AT 20.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...APPEARS TO BE 3 SYSTEMS 
CAPABLE OF CREATING CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION IN THE LONG TERM...AND 
WITH TEMPS FALLING FROM THOSE NICE AND MILD WEEKEND VALUES...A 
MENTION OF SNOW IS REQUIRED. THE INITIAL SYSTEM IS TUESDAY NIGHT 
INTO WEDNESDAY WITH VERY CLOSE TIMING AS FROM EARLIER MODEL RUNS. 
THERE IS UNCERTAINTY DUE TO SOME PHASING WITH THE NRN AND SRN STREAM 
ENERGY POSSIBLE...BUT HARD TO DETERMINE HOW STRONG ANY FORCING WILL 
BE. FAVORED THE NAM AND SREF SOLUTIONS OVER THE GFS SPREADING LIGHT 
PRECIPITATION OVER TOO MUCH OF THE REGION. THE NAM AND SREF ARE MORE 
LOCALIZED...WITH THE BEST LIFT AND LIGHTER QPF ACROSS SW VA/NE TN 
AND THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF E TN. THIS ALSO FITS WELL WITH PREVIOUS 
GRIDS...ADJACENT NWS GRIDS AND THE LATEST WWD GRAPHICS. THUS...WILL 
CONTINUE SOME LIKELY POPS ACROSS SW VA AND HIGHER TERRAIN OF NE 
TN...WITH A MENTION OF UP TO 2 INCHES OF SNOW FOR AREAS SUCH AS WISE 
COUNTY VA. ALSO ADDING THIS TO OUR HWO PRODUCT IN THE AFTERNOON 
UPDATE.

A SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM WILL THEN ATTEMPT TO BRING MOSTLY RAIN TO 
THE REGION FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. 850 MB TEMPS ARE COLD ENOUGH 
FOR A MENTION OF LIGHT SNOW FROM ABOUT 09Z TO 15Z SATURDAY...MAINLY 
ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN. NUDGED POPS UP TO AROUND 40 PERCENT FOR NOW.

A DEEPER SHORTWAVE TROUGH LOOKS MORE ROBUST FOR MONDAY...DEVELOPING 
ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION. THIS SYSTEM WOULD BE 
WARMER SO NO MENTION OF SNOW JUST RAIN SHOWERS (POSSIBLE THUNDER). A 
BIT EARLY TO INTRODUCE WITH LIKELY OR HIGHER POPS...SO WENT WITH A 
SOLID 40 PERCENT CHANCE. 

24/12Z GFSX MOS TEMPS WERE CLOSE TO 24/00Z GUIDANCE AND GENERALLY 
FOLLOWED. MODELS ARE ADVERTISING LESS CLOUDINESS ON SUNDAY...SO I 
DID BOOST OUR MAX TEMPS UP FOR SUNDAY ABOVE THE PREVIOUS GRIDS.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER WEST TN AND 
EASTERN KY...GENERALLY STRETCHING NORTHEAST ALONG A MEMPHIS TO 
NASHVILLE TO LEXINGTON LINE. THIS COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO ONLY 
SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTHWARD TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...AS THE 
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW REMAINS ZONAL AND NEARLY PARALLEL TO THE BOUNDARY. 
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS ONLY A FEW HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE FORECAST

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
WEAK CHANNELLED VORTICITY WILL BRING SOME MIDLEVEL CLOUDS TO THE 
AREA TODAY...BUT THE SURFACE AIR MASS REMAINS QUITE DRY. LOW LEVELS 
BEGIN TO MOISTEN A BIT MORE TOWARD THE EVENING AS A FRONT APPROACHES 
FROM THE NORTHWEST. SOME LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE NEAR THE FRONTAL ZONE 
PROVIDES SOME LIFT IN THE 03-09Z TIMEFRAME...MAINLY IN NORTHERN 
AREAS. BUT LIMITED MOISTURE DEPTH WILL KEEP QPF LIGHT AND POPS IN 
THE SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE RANGE. WITH FROPA BETWEEN 06Z AND 
09Z...TEMPS WILL BE FALLING AND MAY CHANGE PRECIP TO SNOW BRIEFLY 
LATE TONIGHT BEFORE MOISTURE MOVES OUT BY 12Z. EXPECT THAT THIS WILL 
BE MAINLY AT OR ABOVE 2500 FT ELEVATIONS. TEMPS WILL BE COOLER FOR 
MONDAY...WITH HIGHS IN THE MID 40S NORTH TO MID 50S SOUTH.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE OVER THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT. NAM
AND GFS DIFFER ON EXTENT OF MOISTURE RETURN FOR TUESDAY AS HIGH
MOVES EAST OF THE AREA. WILL CONTINUE WITH A LOW CHANCE POP FOR
TUESDAY BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW. FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY
MORNING...GFS AND ECMWF CONTINUES TO DIFFER ON THE EXTENT OF
PHASING BETWEEN THE NORTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE TROUGH OVER THE
GREAT LAKES AND SOUTHERN STREAM ENERGY MOVING ACROSS THE GULF
COASTS. THE ECMWF IS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE MODEL. WILL CONTINUE WITH
CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION. IF THE ECMWF IS RIGHT...THEN ANOTHER ROUND
OF SNOWFALL IS POSSIBLE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING.

MORE ZONAL UPPER FLOW AND SURFACE RIDGING FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING PRODUCING DRY CONDITIONS. BOTH THE GFS AND 
ECMWF SHOW A SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS THE GULF COAST 
STATES AND TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING.

OVERALL...COLDER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE EXTENDED

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE CAROLINAS...WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT 
OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THIS COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO ONLY 
SLOWLY DRIFT TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT AND SUNDAY...AS THE 
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW REMAINS ZONAL AND NEARLY PARALLEL TO THE BOUNDARY. 
AS A RESULT...THINK DRY CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON...BUT WITH CLOUDS INCREASING DURING THE DAY. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR 
TONIGHT AND SUNDAY...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES ARE 
NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH LATE SUNDAY NIGHT/EARLY MONDAY AND WILL BRING A SLIGHT 
CHANCE FOR PRECIP ACROSS NE TN...SW VA AND ACROSS THE SMOKIES. A FEW 
AREAS WILL SEE A TRANSITION FROM RAIN TO SNOW OVERNIGHT AS 
TEMPERATURES EVENTUALLY APPROACH FREEZING. PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED 
TO BE LIGHT AND NO SNOW ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED. 

MONDAY WILL BE ROUGHLY 10 TO 15 DEGREES COOLER COMPARED TO SUNDAY... 
AS WE WILL BE IN A POST FRONTAL AIRMASS. HAVING SAID THAT... 
TEMPERATURES WILL STILL BE CLOSE TO NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. 
MONDAY REMAINS DRY AS WE ARE IN ZONAL FLOW WITH THE FRONT WELL OFF 
TO OUR SOUTH AND EAST. 

TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY IS STILL IN QUESTION REGARDING PRECIP 
CHANCES AND AMOUNT DUE TO THE TIMING OF AN APPROACHING UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH AND SOUTHERN STREAM JET. LATEST MODEL RUNS LAG THE COLD FRONT 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH WELL BEHIND THE SOUTHERN STREAM 
MOISTURE TO OUR SOUTH. THIS KEEPS TUESDAYS TEMPS VERY SIMILAR TO 
MONDAY WITH THE BIG COOL DOWN NOT OCCURRING UNTIL WEDNESDAY...AS THE 
COLD FRONT DOESN'T MOVE THROUGH UNTIL LATE TUESDAY NIGHT/EARLY 
WEDNESDAY MORNING. THIS WOULD KEEP TUESDAY ALL RAIN WITH A 
TRANSITION OVER TO SNOW TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. THE GFS SHOWS 
THE BULK OF THE MOISTURE TO OUR SOUTH AND SUGGEST A DRIER FRONTAL 
PASSAGE. THE ECMWF ALSO KEEPS MOST OF THE MOISTURE SOUTH BUT SHOWS A 
WETTER FRONTAL PASSAGE. WILL LEAVE POPS RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM 
PREVIOUS SHIFT WITH CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY/TUESDAY NIGHT WITH 
SLIGHT CHANCE BY WEDNESDAY. POPS COULD STILL CHANGE QUITE A BIT 
DURING THE TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY PERIOD...DEPENDING ON TIMING OF 
THE AFOREMENTIONED FEATURES. WEDNESDAY LOOKS TO BE AROUND 15 DEGREES 
COOLER THAN TUESDAY...DUE TO THE FRONTAL PASSAGE RESULTING IN HIGHS 
AROUND 15 TO 18 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. WEDNESDAY NIGHT WILL BE THE 
COLDEST NIGHT OF THE WEEK WITH LOWS ALSO 15 TO 18 DEGREES BELOW 
NORMAL.  

WE REBOUND A LITTLE ON TEMPS FOR THURSDAY...AND THEN A FEW MORE 
DEGREES ON FRIDAY...AS WE RETURN TO ZONAL FLOW WITH SURFACE RIDGING 
BUILDING BACK IN. HOWEVER...ANOTHER SYSTEM IS POSSIBLE FRIDAY NIGHT 
INTO SATURDAY...AS THE SOUTHERN JET RETURNS ALONG WITH ANOTHER 
APPROACHING TROUGH. WILL ONLY MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THIS 
SYSTEM...AS THE ECMWF KEEPS US DRY WITH THE SYSTEM WELL TO OUR 
SOUTH...WHILE THE GFS BRINGS IT FURTHER NORTH INTO OUR AREA.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE AREA THIS MORNING WILL BE SHIFTING 
EAST THROUGH TODAY...AND WE WILL SEE A LIGHT SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL 
FLOW BY THE AFTERNOON. THIS WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO WARM INTO THE LOWER 
AND MIDDLE 60S TODAY...UNDER MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. THE PROXIMITY OF 
THE UPPER JET JUST NORTH OF THE AREA COULD BRING SOME CIRRUS 
CLOUDS...BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE LITTLE IMPACT TO TEMPERATURES. THE 
LIGHT SOUTHERLY FLOW TONIGHT WILL BRING DEWPOINTS UP A BIT...WITH 
LOWS TONIGHT MAINLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 30S. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA FOR SUNDAY. BEST
DYNAMICS...ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER JET ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO
VALLEY...WILL BE MAINLY NORTH OF THE REGION. HOWEVER..WILL MAINTAIN
BEST CHANCES OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE DUE TO
CLOSER PROXIMITY TO THE JET DYNAMICS.

SURFACE RIDGING AND ZONAL FLOW ALOFT EXPECTED FOR MONDAY WITH DRY 
CONDITIONS. AN ARCTIC COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH INTO THE OHO VALLEY 
FOR LATE MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...THEN SPILL INTO THE REGION FOR 
TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. ANOTHER SOUTHERN STREAM JET WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND GULF COAST STATES WITH CYCLOGENESIS 
OVER THE CAROLINAS LATE TUESDAY/TUESDAY NIGHT. MODELS DIFFER ON THE 
LOCATION OF CYCLOGENESIS OVER THE CAROLINAS/EASTERN ATLANTIC WITH THE
ECMWF CLOSEST TO THE COASTS. WILL CALL FOR A CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION 
FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT WITH RAIN CHANGING TO SNOW.

FOR THE LATTER HALF OF WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...SURFACE 
RIDGING WILL ONCE AGAIN DOMINATE WITH DRY CONDITIONS AND BELOW 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES. THE GFS AND ECMWF SHOW ANOTHER SOUTHERN STREAM 
WAVE MOVING ACROSS TEXAS THROUGH THE GULF COAST STATES FOR FRIDAY 
AND SATURDAY OF NEXT WEEK KEEPING PRECIPITATION SOUTH OF THE REGION.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
A COLD FRONT OVER THE CAROLINAS...WITH BREEZY WESTERLY WINDS 
BRINGING A COOLER AND DRIER AIR MASS (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY) INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA. HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TONIGHT...BRINGING DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS 
INTO SATURDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE 
SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SAME OVERALL THEME AS 
WAS DISCUSSED YESTERDAY WITH A FEW MINOR TWEAKS. MAINLY ZONAL FLOW 
SHIFTING TO A NW FLOW AS A BROAD UPPER LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHES BY 
MID WEEK WITH TEMPERATURES BELOW NORMAL STARTING MONDAY THROUGH THE 
END OF THE EXTENDED.

SURFACE RIDGING MOVES OFF TO OUR EAST ON SATURDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING. SUNDAY 
LOOKS TO BE THE LAST DAY WHERE TEMPS WILL BE WELL ABOVE NORMAL. THE 
NAM STILL WANTS TO SHOW MORE MOISTURE WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE FRONT 
THAN DOES THE GFS. DECIDED TO GO WITH A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO 
AND KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN PLACE OVERNIGHT SUNDAY WITH CHANCE 
ACROSS OUR FAR EASTERN COUNTIES AS WELL AS UP INTO NE TN AND SW VA. 
RAIN WILL TRANSITION TO SNOW SUNDAY NIGHT ACROSS AREAS THAT APPROACH 
FREEZING. NO ACCUMULATION EXPECTED AT THIS TIME. MONDAY LOOKS DRY 
BEHIND THE FRONTAL PASSAGE WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR NORMAL TO A FEW 
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. 

BY TUESDAY THE BROAD UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS BEGINNING TO TAKE SHAPE 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS WHILE THE SUB TROPICAL JET STARTS TO 
BRING IN MOISTURE FROM THE SW. A SHORTWAVE MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES ON TUESDAY WHILE ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT LOOKS TO DRAG 
THROUGH OUR AREA AND BRING SOME LIGHT PRECIP DURING THE DAY. WILL 
KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NOW AS FORCING BEGINS TO WEAKEN AS THE 
FRONT MOVES INTO OUR AREA. THIS COLD FRONT WILL ALSO BRING FURTHER 
REINFORCEMENT OF COLDER AIR FOR WEDNESDAY. 

TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...THE BASE OF THE BROAD TROUGH 
APPROACHES OUR REGION AS DOES THE SUBTROPICAL JET TO OUR SOUTH. THE 
GFS AND ECMWF BOTH WANT TO PHASE THESE TWO FEATURES OVER THE 
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. BUT EXACTLY WHEN/WHERE THEY PHASE WILL ALTER OUR 
PRECIP CHANCES AND AMOUNTS. THE GFS IS A WETTER SOLUTION ON TUESDAY 
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AS IT WANTS TO PHASE THESE TWO FEATURES CLOSER 
TO OUR AREA BRINGING US BETTER CHANCES FOR PRECIP AND MORE 
WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION. THE ECMWF HOWEVER WANTS TO PHASE THE 
AFOREMENTIONED FEATURES FURTHER SOUTH WHICH SUPPRESSES THE MOISTURE 
FROM THE SUBTROPICAL JET FURTHER SOUTH AND RESULTS IN A DRIER 
SOLUTION FOR US. WILL PUT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN PLACE TUESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY BUT POPS MAY HAVE TO BE RAISED IN FUTURE SHIFTS 
DEPENDING ON HOW THE MODELS HANDLE THE PHASING. ALSO...DEPENDING ON 
HOW MUCH COLD AIR CAN SINK SOUTH WITH THE BASE OF THE TROUGH...SOME 
AREAS COULD SEE RAIN/SNOW ON TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. STILL TOO 
EARLY TO TRY AND DETERMINE ANY ACCUMULATION AMOUNTS IF ANY.

WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...WE WILL BE ON THE BACK SIDE OF 
THE TROUGH WHICH WILL KEEP US IN A BRIEF NW FLOW PATTERN WHILE ALSO  
REMAINING DRY. FRIDAY LOOKS DRY FOR NOW AS WE SLOWLY RETURN TO A 
MORE ZONAL FLOW.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DRIER AIR AND SOMEWHAT COOLER 
AIR WILL MOVE IN QUICKLY BEHIND THE EXITING COLD FRONT...AS HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS IN TODAY. STRONGER WINDS SUBSIDING BEHIND LINE OF
THUNDERSTORMS...SO ALLOWED WIND ADVISORY TO EXPIRE...BUT STILL
SOME GUSTY WINDS INTO THIS MORNING. SOME LINGERING SHOWERS EAST
EARLY...AND SOME MORNING CLOUDS...BUT SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF
SUNSHINE MUCH OF TODAY. MOSTLY CLEAR SKY TONIGHT. MAV TEMPS
GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...WARMER WESTERLY FLOW
CONTINUES SATURDAY AS BROAD UPPER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHERN STATES
WITH DEEP UPPER LOW OVER HUDSONS BAY. THIS KEEPS A SUNNY AND MILD
PATTERN OVER THE FORECAST AREA. WEAK SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVES
SOUTHEAST TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT AS A
COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH. LOWS DROP TO NEAR FREEZING OR SLIGHTLY
BELOW NORTH WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN AND SNOW BUT NO
ACCUMULATION. MONDAY TEMPERATURES MUCH COOLER AS PATTERN BRINGS
COLDER AIR SE AS TROUGH DEEPENS OVER THE EAST MUCH OF THE WEEK.
ANOTHER WEAK FRONT TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT WILL REINFORCE THE
COOLER AIR MASS BUT PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS BOTH RAIN...AND SNOW
OVERNIGHT HOURS WILL AGAIN BE LIGHT. WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
HIGH PRESSURE REBUILDS AGAIN BUT TEMPERATURES TO STAY BELOW NORMAL
AS FLOW ALOFT STAYS FROM THE NW.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER NORTHEASTERN MISSOURI...WITH ITS 
ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT EXTENDING EAST ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
AND ITS COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS THE OZARKS AND ARKLATEX 
REGIONS. SOUTHERLY WINDS AHEAD OF THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL 
CONTINUE TO BRING WARM AND MOIST AIR INTO THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
EVENING. ALTHOUGH THE WINDS IN THE GREAT TN VALLEY SHOULD WEAKEN A 
LITTLE THIS EVENING AS THE SUN SETS...MODELS INDICATE THAT THE 850 
MB WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THIS EVENING (TO BETWEEN 60 AND 
70 KT) AS THE COLD FRONT APPROACHES. ALTHOUGH THE MODELS AGREE THAT 
THE CONVECTIVE SQUALL LINE ALONG THE COLD FRONT WILL AFFECT THE 
FORECAST AREA DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS AFTER MIDNIGHT...THINK 
THAT THIS SQUALL LINE COULD QUICKLY RACE AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT AND 
POSSIBLY ARRIVE SOONER (AROUND MIDNIGHT ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU). 
WITH THE STRONG 850 MB JET AND LARGE LOW-LEVEL HELICITY VALUES (0-1 
KM VALUES OF 300 TO 400 M2/S2)...IT CERTAINLY APPEARS THAT DAMAGING 
WINDS AND ISOLATED TORNADOES ALONG THE SQUALL LINE WILL BE POSSIBLE 
TONIGHT...EVEN IF THE INSTABILITY WEAKENS TO MARGINAL VALUES OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA AFTER SUNSET (AS THE MODELS SUGGEST). SCATTERED 
SHOWERS WILL LIKELY STILL BE LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA IN THE 
MORNING HOURS AROUND SUNRISE...BUT RAPID CLEARING IS EXPECTED BY THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TONIGHT AND FRIDAY...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE 
SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...NOT MUCH CHANGE FROM 
PREVIOUS DISCUSSION. A MUCH CALMER WEATHER PATTERN IN STORE THROUGH 
THE EXTENDED. OVERALL...MAINLY ZONAL FLOW THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
SWITCHING TO SOMEWHAT OF A NW FLOW TOWARD THE END OF THE PERIOD. WE 
WILL BE STARTING A COOLING TREND AFTER SATURDAY AND IT WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGH THE END OF THE EXTENDED WITH TEMPERATURES ROUGHLY 5 TO 10 
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.

FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY ZONAL FLOW WITH SURFACE RIDING LOOKS TO 
BE IN PLACE. MODELS SHOW A WEAK COLD FRONT COMING THROUGH LATE 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING WITH THE GFS AND NAM DIFFERING ON AMOUNT OF 
MOISTURE PRESENT. THE GFS SUGGEST A MAINLY DRY FRONTAL PASSAGE WITH 
THE NAM BEING A WETTER SOLUTION. WILL KEEP TRENDING TOWARD THE DRIER 
GFS SOLUTION AT THIS POINT IN TIME. THE COLD FRONT BRINGS IN COOLER 
AIR FOR MONDAY WITH HIGHS A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL AREA WIDE. 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY...OUT AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING BROAD UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH...WE GET CAUGHT IN BETWEEN THE POLAR AND SUB-TROPICAL 
JET WHICH WILL HELP TO SLIGHTLY INCREASE MOISTURE ACROSS THE AREA 
BUT STILL ONLY WARRANTING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF PRECIP.  ANOTHER WEAK 
COLD FRONT WILL ACCOMPANY THE ARRIVAL OF THE BROAD UPPER TROUGH ON 
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING BUT LOOKS TO REMAIN DRY FOR NOW. 
THIS TROUGH WILL SHIFT US INTO MORE OF A NW FLOW. THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE WILL DROP TEMPERATURES EVEN FURTHER ON WEDNESDAY WITH HIGHS 
8 TO 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. HIGH TEMPERATURES GO UNCHANGED FOR 
THURSDAY WHILE WE REMAIN IN NW FLOW AS WELL AS STAYING PRECIP FREE. 

FOR TEMPS...CONTINUED TO AGREE WITH PREVIOUS SHIFT THAT FAVORING THE 
COOLER ECMWF MOS FOR SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY IS THE BEST COURSE TO 
TAKE.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
353 AM EST THU FEB 20 2014

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
THE MAIN FOCUS FOR THE SHORT TERM WILL BE THE STRONG STORM SYSTEM
THAT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS THIS
AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT...BRINGING THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG TO SEVERE
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ALONG/AHEAD OF A COLD
FRONTAL BOUNDARY THAT WILL SWEEP EAST. AHEAD OF THE FRONT DURING
THE DAY...BREEZY SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL HELP TO PUSH HIGH
TEMPERATURES INTO THE LOWER 70S ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION AND
DEWPOINTS WELL INTO THE MIDDLE 50S. THIS WARM/MOIST AIR WILL LINGER
AHEAD OF THE FRONT WELL INTO THE EVENING HOURS. ALOFT...A STRONG
UPPER-LEVEL JET OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL PLACE THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY IN THE FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION AND PROMOTE STRONG
UPPER-LEVEL DIVERGENCE AND LIFT ALONG THE ADVANCING FRONTAL BOUNDARY
THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT.

THE LATEST MODEL PROJECTIONS ARE SLIGHTLY SLOWER WITH THE
TIMING...AND INDICATE A LINE OF STORMS APPROACHING THE WESTERN
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU ZONES AROUND 03-04Z AND MOVING INTO THE
SOUTHERN/CENTRAL VALLEYS AROUND 06Z FRIDAY. DESPITE THE SLIGHTLY
LATER PROJECTIONS FOR THE ONSET OF THIS ACTIVITY...AN ENVIRONMENT
FAVORABLE FOR THE SUSTAINMENT OF STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS
WILL STILL BE PRESENT...PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE VERY STRONG BULK
SHEAR VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM. HOWEVER...MODEL SOUNDINGS
AT KCHA...KCSV..AND KTYS ALSO INDICATE APPRECIABLE SURFACE BASED
INSTABILITY AOA 400 TO 500 J/KG...WITH SOME ADDITIONAL CAPE TO WORK
WITH ALOFT. HELICITY VALUES ARE ALSO FAIRLY HIGH AND UP TO 500 TO
600 M2/S2 OVER THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN VALLEY. ALL SAID...THIS
WILL RESULT IN THE SUSTAINMENT OF THE SQUALL-LINE AND SEVERE
WEATHER THREAT INTO OUR AREA WELL AFTER SUNSET.

GIVEN THE LINEAR MODE OF THE THUNDERSTORMS AND THE STRONG WIND
FIELD IN PLACE...AM EXPECTING DAMAGING STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS IN
EXCESS OF 60 MPH TO BE THE PRIMARY THREAT. HOWEVER...THE STRONG 0-1
KM SHEAR AND HELICITY VALUES WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR AN ISOLATED
TORNADO THREAT...PARTICULARLY IN AREAS WHERE LOW-LEVEL WINDS MAY
STAY LOCALLY BACKED AHEAD OF THE LINE...AND WITH ANY SUPERCELLUAR
OR BOOK-END VORTEX STRUCTURES WITHIN THE LINE. SOME LOCALLY HEAVY
RAINFALL WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE...THOUGH GIVEN THE FAST MOVING
NATURE OF THESE STORMS...ANY LONG-TERM FLOODING CONCERNS WILL BE
MINIMAL. EVENTUALLY LATE TONIGHT THE LINE WILL OUTPACE THE
FAVORABLE UNSTABLE AREA AND BEGIN TO WEAKEN AS IT APPROACHES THE
MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE BY DAYBREAK. HOWEVER...THE THREAT
FOR STRONG WINDS WITHIN THE EXISTING LINE WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE IN
THESE AREAS AS WELL. ON FRIDAY...THE LINE WILL BEGIN TO MOVE EAST
OF THE REGION...LEAVING SOME LINGERING MORNING SHOWERS BEFORE
CLEARING OCCURS BY THE AFTERNOON.


.LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
WEATHER BECOMES QUITE 
TRANQUIL AFTER THE STRONG STORM SYSTEM IN THE SHORT TERM PERIODS. 
NEARLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT THROUGH THE WEEKEND...THEN SOME UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGHING DEVELOPS OVER NRN PLAINS AND UPPER MIDWEST STATES. THIS 
SHIFTS THE FLOW ALOFT TO SLIGHTLY NW...BUT GENERALLY NOT MUCH 
MOISTURE INDICATED FOR ANY SYSTEM TO WORK WITH. A WEAK COLD FRONT 
SAGGING SOUTH ON SUNDAY LOOKS STARVED FOR MOISTURE...SO I DROPPED 
THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. SURFACE RIDGING SHOULD KEEP MONDAY DRY AND I 
KEPT THE LOW POPS IN FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY FOR NOW. NO REASON 
TO MENTION ANY RAIN FOR WEDNESDAY.

FOR TEMPS...AGREE WITH PREVIOUS SHIFT THAT FAVORING THE COOLER ECM 
MOS FOR SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY IS THE BEST COURSE TO TAKE. THE LOW 
LEVEL FLOW STAYING W TO N NOT ONLY LIMITS MOISTURE...BUT SHOULD KEEP 
TEMPS NEAR OR SLIGHTLY BELOW SEASONAL VALUES. THE WARMEST DAY WILL 
CLEARLY BE SATURDAY WITH HIGHS MOSTLY IN THE 60S.

325 PM EST WED FEB 19 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...COLD FRONT IS MOVING
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. LITTLE TO NO CONVECTION
WITH THE BOUNDARY. THIS FRONT WILL BECOME STATIONARY JUST SOUTH OF
THE AREA OVERNIGHT...THEN PULL NORTH THURSDAY. SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT
WILL RETURN OVER THE FRONT LATER TONIGHT...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A
SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVER THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES.

FOR THURSDAY...FRONTAL BOUNDARY PULLS NORTH AS STRONG SOUTHERLY
WINDS DEVELOP OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING SHORT-WAVE.
STRONG UPPER LEVEL JET WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY PLACING THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET
AND STRONG DIVERGENCE. THE DIRECT CIRCULATION WITH THE JET WILL
PRODUCE STRONG FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING ALONG AN IN-COMING FRONTAL
BOUNDARY FOR THURSDAY NIGHT. 

FOR THURSDAY...STRONG SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL PULL WARM AND MOIST AIR
INTO THE REGION...ESPECIALLY FOR THE WESTERN AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS
OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/PLATEAU. VERY LITTLE FORCING FOR
THURSDAY...SO PRECIPITATION CHANCES LOW. FOR THURSDAY
NIGHT...WIDESPREAD THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPMENT OVER THE
WESTERN/MIDDLE TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL PULL INTO THE AREA BETWEEN 9
AND 11 PM PLATEAU TO 1 AND 3 AM FAR NORTHEAST SECTIONS. DUE TO A
65-70 KT LOW-LEVEL JET...MAIN CONCERN WILL BE DAMAGING STRAIGHT
LINE WINDS. ALSO...ENOUGH SHEAR...ESPECIALLY SPEED SHEAR...TO
PRODUCE HIGH HELICITY VALUES. ISOLATED TORNADOES ARE POSSIBLE...
MAINLY AT/WEST AND SOUTH OF KNOXVILLE...TENNESSEE. GREATEST CHANCES
WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH ANY BOOK-END VORTICES ALONG THE IN-COMING
SQUALL-LINE. WENT FOR CAT POPS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY STAY IN THE 
SAME BALLPARK CONCERNING THE LONG TERM PERIOD WHICH FEATURES A 
DEPARTING STRONG COLD FRONT DURING THE MORNING ON FRIDAY. 
THEREFORE...HELD ONTO A GRADIENT OF LIKELY POPS NEAR THE MOUNTAINS 
THROUGH SLIGHT CHANCE POP ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. DRY AIR AND 
SURFACE RIDGING BUILD IN BEHIND THE SYSTEM TO KEEP PRECIPITATION OUT 
OF THE FORECAST ALL THE WAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. 
HOWEVER...ANOTHER WEAK SHORT WAVE AND A COLD FRONT ARE DEPICTED 
(WITH SOME STRENGTH AND TIMING ISSUES) TO MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA ON SUNDAY SO ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP HERE FOR RAIN SHOWERS. 
WAS ABLE TO KEEP SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE DAYTIME PERIOD MONDAY DRY.
A MORE AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH AND SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM MOVE INTO 
THE APPALACHIAN REGION MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY AND THIS 
AMPLIFICATION APPEARS LIKE IT WILL LEAD TO ANOTHER PERIOD OF WELL 
BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES. WITH THIS IN MIND...THERE WILL BE THE 
POSSIBILITY OF MORE WINTER PRECIPITATION DURING THIS TIMEFRAME. 
STAYED CLOSER TO THE COLDER ECM TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE ESPECIALLY 
LATER IN THE LONG TERM PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO PUSH ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS MORNING AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT DRAPED
ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE. WINDS ARE MAKING A TRANSITION FROM
NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST...AND THIS IS ACTUALLY HELPING TO RAISE
TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY INTO THE UPPER 50S AND LOWER 60S OVER THE
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY...WHILE LOCATIONS ACROSS NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA REMAIN IN THE 40S AS OF 3 AM. A
LINE OF STRONGER STORMS WILL MOVE INTO THE NORTHERN PLATEAU WITHIN
THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS...BRINGING WITH IT SOME GUSTING WINDS AND
LIGHTNING. THIS ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE AFTER SUNRISE OVER THE
REGION...BEFORE DIMINISHING BY THE LATE MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON
FROM WEST TO EAST AS THE SKY BEGINS TO CLEAR. THE PREFRONTAL
SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL ALSO HELP TO PUSH HIGHS WELL UP INTO THE MID TO
UPPER 60S IN MOST SPOTS BEFORE THE POST-FRONTAL NORTHWEST FLOW
OCCURS BY THE AFTERNOON. SOME ADDITIONAL SHOWERS WILL BEGIN TO WORK
THEIR WAY INTO THE REGION TONIGHT AHEAD OF THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM
THAT WILL IMPACT THE AREA ON THURSDAY EVENING. 


.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
MAIN WEATHER OF CONCERN 
OCCURS ON THURSDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY FRIDAY. MODELS CONSISTENT WITH 
DEVELOPING A DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS ON 
THURSDAY. THE TROUGH BECOMES NEGATIVELY TILTED BY THURSDAY EVENING 
WITH THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW TRACKING NE FROM UPPER MIDWEST 
STATES. 50 TO 60 KNOT LOW LEVEL JET ACROSS PLATEAU COUNTIES BY 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...THEN MOVES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY 
NIGHT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. STRONG SHEAR AND MARGINAL INSTABILITY 
SHOULD ALLOW A LINE OF SEVERE STORMS TO MOVE INTO WRN AREAS THURSDAY 
EVENING...WITH A THREAT FOR DAMAGING STRAIGHT LINE WINDS AND 
ISOLATED TORNADOES. POTENTIAL FOR WEAKENING OF STORMS AFTER MIDNIGHT 
SO I STOPPED SHORT OF MENTIONING SEVERE STORMS IN ZONE FORECAST 
PRODUCT. BEEFED THUNDERSTORM WORDING UP TO SCATTERED OVER SRN AND 
CENTRAL AREAS WITH ISOLATED WORDING IN NE TN/SW VA AREAS.

NAM 12KM WINDS WERE USED FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH A 
VERY TIGHT GRADIENT PLUS LOW LEVEL JET...SO MAY VERY WELL NEED A 
WIND ADVISORY POSTED FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA FOR THOSE PERIODS. 

OTHERWISE...REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM PERIODS LOOKS QUITE TRANQUIL 
COMPARED TO THE FIRST 3 PERIODS. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE TO 
PREVIOUS GRIDS...AS THE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY DOES NOT CREATE THE 
CONFIDENCE TO TWEAK GRIDS AT THIS POINT. GOOD CONTINUITY ON DRY 
WEATHER FROM FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...THEN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. MAJOR TEMP DIFFERENCES BTWN 18/12Z 
GFSX MOS AND 19/00Z GFSX MOS...GENERALLY FROM THE WEEKEND THRU 
TUESDAY. EXPECTED SYNOPTIC SURFACE PATTERN DID NOT FAVOR BUMPING UP 
TO THE WARMER 19/00Z MOS TEMPS...SO STAYED CLOSE TO PREVIOUS MAX/MIN 
TEMPS AND ADJACENT NWS GRIDS FOR NOW.

BETTER LIFT DEVELOPS IN ASSOCIATION WITH A VORT MAX NOW OVER
MISSOURI. A FEW LIGHTNING STRIKES HAVE OCCURRED IN NORTHERN

REMNANT CLOUDS HANGING IN ACROSS THE FOOTHILLS AND ERN MTNS AT THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...TEMPERATURES AGAIN RISING
MUCH MORE QUICKLY THIS AFTERNOON THAN THE MODELS ANTICIPATED.
ORIGINAL GUIDANCE SUGGESTED AN OVERCAST DECK THROUGH THE DAY AND
NIGHT...BUT THE CLOUD SHIELD THAT IS CURRENTLY OVER MIDDLE AND
EASTERN TENNESSEE IS PROGRESSING VERY SLOWLY TOWARDS THE
APPALACHIANS...THUS LEAVING AMPLE HEATING TO TAKE PLACE. HAVE
ADJUSTED TEMPERATURES A COUPLE OF DEGREES HIGHER FOR TODAY AND
TONIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS.

TONIGHT...A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MAKE ITS WAY EAST OVER THE OHIO 
VALLEY WITH AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT SWINGING DOWN THROUGH THE AREA. 
THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO ENTER FOR THE FORECAST AREA LATE EVENING 
AND MOVE QUICKLY TO THE EAST OF THE SMOKIES WELL BEFORE SUNRISE. THE 
TEMPERATURES DO NOT TREND CLOSE TO THE FREEZING LINE UNTIL DAY 
BREAK...WHICH IS AFTER THE MOISTURE EXITS THE AREA. THEREFORE ONLY 
RAIN IS EXPECTED. LIGHT AMOUNTS CAN ACCUMULATE AS THIS SYSTEM HAS 
VERY LITTLE LIFT AND A WARM MID LEVEL LAYER CREATING A DECENT
INVERSION THROUGH THE NIGHT.

DRY WEATHER WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THIS FRONT...WITH SKIES CLEARING 
QUICKLY TUESDAY MORNING. FOR TEMPERATURES...HAVE GONE A COUPLE OF 
DEGREES ABOVE GUIDANCE THROUGH TUESDAY DUE TO THE SOUTHWEST FLOW 
PRESENT AND THE SHORT TEMPORAL COVERAGE OF CLOUDS EXPECTED.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY DAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT 
AGREEMENT OVERALL FOR MUCH OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD...BUT SOLUTION 
DIVERGENCE INCREASES LATE.  FORECAST CONFIDENCE ABOUT AVERAGE FOR 
THIS TIME OF YEAR.  IT LOOKS LIKE THERE MAY BE TWO PERIODS OF WEAK 
ISENTROPIC LIFT EARLY ON...ONE TUESDAY NIGHT AND ANOTHER WED NIGHT.  
APPEARS MOISTURE WILL BE SHALLOW AND LIFT WEAK BOTH PERIODS.  WILL 
JUST CARRY A LOT OF CLOUDS AND SOME LOW END POPS BOTH PERIODS.  MAIN 
EVENT WILL BE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY FRIDAY.  A COLD FRONT WILL 
SWEEP IN AS AN UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES...WITH MORE SIGNIFICANT 
MOISTURE AND FORCING. MAY BE SOME THUNDER WITH THIS SYSTEM THURSDAY 
NIGHT...SO WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY IN THE FORECAST.  WILL GO WITH HIGH
LIKELY TO CAT POPS...ONLY REASON NOT TO GO WITH CAT POPS ALL ZONES 
IS DUE TO POSSIBLE TIMING ISSUES.  LOOKS LIKE A QUIETER PERIOD FOR 
THE WEEKEND...WITH TEMPS NOT TOO FAR FROM NORMAL.  MONDAY THE ECMWF 
IS PUSHING THE NEXT SYSTEM IN...WHILE THE GFS STILL IS DRY.  FOR NOW 
WILL KEEP PRECIP OUT SIMILAR TO THE GFS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CLOUDS A BIT SLUGGISH TO SPREAD 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA SO FAR THIS MORNING...SO HOURLY AND MIN TEMPS 
WERE LOWERED A BIT WHERE CLOUDS REMAINED THIN OR ABSENT. LOW CLOUD 
DECK FORMED AT LNP (WISE CO VA)...BUT SO FAR NO FOG INDICATED. 

SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING EAST OUT OF THE MID MS VALLEY REGION WILL 
BRING SOME MUCH WELCOMED WARMING TODAY...BUT MODELS IN GENERAL HAVE 
SLOWED DOWN THE ONSET OF LIGHT RAIN (AHEAD OF THE WARM FRONT). 
APPEARS THERE WILL BE ABOUT A 3 TO 6 HOUR PERIOD OF LIGHT TO 
MODERATE SHOWERS AHEAD OF OR WITH THE COLD FRONT TONIGHT. THE 
STRONGER DYNAMICS AND FORCING/LIFT ARE NORTH OF OUR AREA...SO JUST 
SHOWERS.

ALTHOUGH THE RAIN ARRIVES SLIGHTLY LATER...STILL EXPECT GENERALLY 
ALL RAIN TO END BY 09Z TUESDAY. TEMPS SHOULD STILL BE NO COOLER THAN 
MID TO UPPER 30S WHEN MOISTURE IS TOTALLY DEPLETED...SO NO WINTRY 
PRECIPITATION WITH THIS SYSTEM.

OTHERWISE...BASED ON HOW WARM TEMPS GOT YESTERDAY...WENT SLIGHTLY 
ABOVE THE MILDER MAXES FOR TODAY...ALSO FACTORING A SLOWER INCREASE 
IN CLOUDS. LIKED THE MILDER NAM MOS MINS TONIGHT FOR SRN AND CENTRAL 
PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA...AS BETTER COLD AIR ADVECTION SEEMS 
LIMITED TO SW VA AND NE TIP OF TN.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BRINGS A
MOSTLY SUNNY MILD LATE WINTER DAY TO THE EASTERN TN VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TUESDAY. FOLLOWED CLOSE TO MAV GUIDANCE WITH
HIGHS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S. THE COLD FRONT
THAT PASSED THROUGH LATE MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT WILL MOVE JUST
SOUTH OF THE REGION. TUESDAY NIGHT THIS FRONT MOVES BACK NORTH AS
A WARM FRONT AS DEVELOPING SYSTEM TO THE NORTH MOVES THROUGH THE
GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY. THERE WILL BE ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR
INCREASED CLOUDS AND SOME RAIN LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY
WEDNESDAY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BUT THE BULK OF THIS FRONTS
MOISTURE STAYS TO THE NORTH. SKIES CLEAR QUICKLY WEDNESDAY AS
ANOTHER HIGH PRESSURE AREA SHIFTS EAST INTO THE EASTERN TN VALLEY.
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY A STRONGER SYSTEM DEVELOP THROUGH THE
PLAINS STATES. THURSDAY WILL LIKELY BE THE WARMEST DAY OF THE
EXTENDED AS WARM SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM MOVE
INTO THE REGION. AIR MASS WILL BECOME SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE WITH
THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE LATE THURSDAY OR THURSDAY EVENING. THE COLD
FRONT IS PROGGED TO NOT REACH EAST TN UNTIL THE LATE NIGHT OR
MORNING HOURS FRIDAY SO TO EARLY TO TELL IF STORMS WILL BE STRONG.
UPPER FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL BEHIND THE FRONT AS EASTERN STATES
BECOME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A BROAD TROUGH. WEAK SHORTWAVE ENERGY
ROTATES THROUGH BROAD TROUGH OVER THE WEEKEND WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE
OF SHOWERS OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA EACH DAY. TEMPERATURES
WILL BE COOLER MOSTLY IN THE 50S FROM FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY.

WELL EAST OF THE AREA...HOWEVER GIVEN THE PAST FEW MISLEADING MODEL 
RUNS THE PRECIP MAY HANG AROUND A LITTLE LONGER. THE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WILL REMAIN CLOSE BY AND MAY SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR 
ADDITIONAL SHOWERS TO MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY. 
WEDNESDAY WILL BE A TRANSITION DAY AND CERTAINLY THE LOWEST CHANCES 
OF RAINFALL FOR THE WEEK. ANOTHER FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA ON 
THURSDAY. AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM THERE MAY BE A FEW THUNDERSTORMS 
ESPECIALLY OVER THE SOUTHERN TN VALLEY. THURSDAY NIGHT TRANSITIONS 
INTO MORE STABLE AIR BUT CHANCES FOR RAIN INCREASE DRAMATICALLY. AS 
WE MOVE INTO FRIDAY THE CONFIDENCE OF THE FORECAST IS VERY LOW. THE 
GFS IS MUCH DRIER THAN THE ECMWF. HAVE TRENDED TOWARD THE ECMWF IN 
THE LONG TERM. 

DAYTIME TEMPS FOR THE WEEK WILL GENERALLY BE IN THE 50S AND 60S. 
WHILE OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPERATURES FROM TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WILL 
GENERALLY BE IN THE 40S. WEEKEND LOW TEMPERATURES WILL FALL BACK 
INTO THE 30S BY NEXT SUNDAY.

427 AM EST SUN FEB 16 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SNOW TAPERING OFF OVER THE CENTRAL 
VALLEY AND SMOKIES AT THIS TIME...AND SHOULD MAINLY AFFECT NE TN AND 
SW VA THROUGH ABOUT 12Z TODAY. LOWERED POPS FOR THE PRE 12Z GRIDS A 
BIT IN LINE WITH LATEST RADAR TRENDS AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS. SEEMS 
TO BE ABOUT A 1 TO 2 HR PERIOD FOR LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WITH THE 
SNOW EARLY THIS MORNING. ENDED UP WITH VERY CLOSE TO 1/2 INCH OF 
SNOW AT OUR NWS OFFICE IN MORRISTOWN. CARRIED SOME LINGERING SNOW 
SHOWERS WITH CHANCE POPS FOR EXTREME NE AREAS FROM 12Z TO 15Z.

OTHERWISE...CLOUDS WILL DECREASE BEHIND THIS PASSING DISTURBANCE... 
WHICH I WON'T REFER TO AS WEAK...SINCE WE DID GET A BAND OF 1 TO 2 
INCHES OF SNOWFALL OVERNIGHT. MODELS...OTHER THAN RUC...REALLY UNDER 
FORECAST THIS FEATURE. SUNSHINE MAKES A WELCOMED APPEARANCE AND WE 
SHOULD WARM QUITE CLOSE TO THE GFS MOS HIGHS.

GOING TO SPREAD SOME CLOUDS BACK INTO THE FORECAST GRIDS FOR TONIGHT 
BUT NOT ADDING ANY PRECIPITATION CHANCES AT THIS TIME. UPPER RIDGE 
PUSHES ITS WAY EASTWARD TONIGHT...SO THINKING THE DISTURBANCE TRACK 
WILL BE NORTH OF THE SRN APPALACHIANS. THE CLOUDS RETURNING WOULD 
FAVOR A BLEND BETWEEN THE COOLER GFS AND MILDER NAM MOS MINS. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...WARMING TREND CONTINUES
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA EARLY IN THE WEEK. TRANSITORY HIGH
PRESSURE AREA SHIFTS EAST EARLY MONDAY. SHORT RANGE MODELS BRING
A WEAK FRONTAL SYSTEM TOWARDS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS MONDAY. A
WARM FRONT WILL WARM TEMPERATURES SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE TODAYS HIGH
TEMPERATURES MONDAY. THE COLD FRONT MONDAY NIGHT WILL ACTUALLY
USHER IN EVEN MILDER TEMPERATURES TUESDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE WITH
A SOURCE REGION FROM THE SOUTHWEST BUILDS OVER THE TN VALLEY.
EXPECTING HIGHS IN THE UPPER 50S TO THE MID 60S. THE COLD FRONT TO
THE SOUTH WILL THEN MOVE BACK NORTH TUESDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL BRING
AN UNSETTLED PERIOD AS THE FRONT STAYS NEAR THE FORECAST AREA
THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY CLOUDY
WITH SHOWERS POSSIBLE EACH DAY AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY AND
SATURDAY.

.DISCUSSION...OPTED TO DO A QUICK UPDATE OF THE FORECAST GRIDS AND
PRODUCTS AS LIGHT SNOW CONTINUES TO FALL ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY
COUNTIES OF EAST TN. THE LATEST RUC MODEL AND ACTUALLY THE 16/00Z
GFS MODEL BOTH TAKE THIS LIGHT SNOWFALL ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF NE
TN AND SW VA. SURFACE OBSERVATIONS UNDER THE SNOW BANDS EARLIER
INDICATED THE SNOW WOULD GRADUALLY REACH THE SURFACE AFTER FALLING
FROM A MID DECK FOR ABOUT AN HOUR OR TWO. KEPT ACCUMULATIONS TO
AROUND AN INCH OR LESS...BUT ALLOWED FOR UP TO 2 INCHES LOCALLY
OVER SW VA AND NRN MTNS OF E TN. SMOKIES NOT PROGGED TO BE UNDER
THE SNOW BANDS SO JUST SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS THERE AND LITTLE
ACCUMULATION. LOCALLY WE HAVE JUST UNDER 1/2 INCH OF NEW SNOW
ACCUMULATION AT OUR NWS OFFICE IN MORRISTOWN. 

SPS ISSUED EARLIER STILL LOOKS GOOD...BUT WILL ALSO UPDATE OUR
GRAPHICAST.

.DISCUSSION...WEAK UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE 
THROUGH OUR AREA OVERNIGHT AND INTO TOMORROW MORNING. DECIDED TO 
INCLUDE SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A LIGHT SNOW SHOWER DOWN INTO THE CENTRAL 
VALLEY AS CURRENT RADAR IMAGERY IS SHOWING SOME RETURNS ACROSS THE 
AREA WITH -SN AT CROSSVILLE HAVING BEGUN AN HOUR OR SO AGO. LOW 
LEVELS ARE VERY DRY SO IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME FOR THEM TO MOISTEN. 
HOWEVER...THE NASHVILLE OFFICE HAS RECEIVED REPORTS OF 1/2 AN INCH 
OF SNOW WITH A SOMEWHAT MODERATE BUT NARROW BAND OF PRECIP THAT IS 
CURRENTLY MOVING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND DOWN INTO 
THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AREAS UNDER THIS BAND COULD PICK UP BETWEEN A 
TRACE AND 1/2 INCH OF SNOW. NOT ALL AREAS WILL SEE SNOW AS THE DRY 
AIR WILL BE TOO MUCH TO OVERCOME. AFTER THIS BAND MOVES 
THROUGH...PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND NORTHWARD TO SWVA WILL 
CONTINUE TO SEE LIGHT PASSING SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES THROUGH THE 
REST OF THE NIGHT. TRACE ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE. MADE A FEW 
OVERNIGHT MIN TEMP ADJUSTMENTS...ESPECIALLY ACROSS SWVA WHERE 
CURRENTLY CLEAR SKIES HAVE ENABLED TEMPS TO DROP CLOSE TO PREVIOUSLY 
FORECAST MINS. WILL UPDATE ZONES TO REMOVE EVENING WORDING AND TO 
INCLUDE SLIGHT CHANCE SNOW FOR AFOREMENTIONED AREAS. WILL TWEAK 
HOURLY TEMPS AND DEWPOINTS TO MATCH UP WITH CURRENT OBS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOW PRESSURE
OVER WRN NC AND CENTRAL VA CONTINUES TO MOVE EAST TO NORTHEAST
THIS MORNING. THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT HAD JUST MOVED EAST OFF THE
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AT 09Z. TEMPS STAYED ON THE MILD SIDE OVERNIGHT
AND HAD JUST RECENTLY FALLEN BELOW 32 DEGREES ACROSS OUR NRN
PLATEAU COUNTIES AND PARTS OF LEE AND WISE COUNTIES OF SW VA.

WRAP AROUND MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT MAINLY SW VA AND NE TN 
THIS MORNING...BUT WAS ALREADY BECOMING VERY SHALLOW OVER WRN AREAS.
THE MOISTURE DECREASE AND MILD TEMPS OVERNIGHT SEVERELY HINDERED 
GETTING MUCH SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ON OUR PLATEAU AND CENTRAL VALLEY 
COUNTIES...SO OPTED TO CANCEL THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR THOSE 
AREAS. KEEPING THE ADVISORY AND WARNING AREAS INTACT FOR NOW FOR SW 
VA...NE TN AND THE NRN/SMOKY MTNS OF E TN. RUC AND NAM MODELS SHOW A 
DECENT AMOUNT OF W-NW UPSLOPE LOW LEVEL FLOW AND SOME INSTABILITY 
THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS...PLUS SOUNDINGS IN THESE AREAS INDICATED 
A GOOD POSSIBILITY OF SNOW OCCURRING ABOVE 2500 TO 3000 FEET 
OVERNIGHT. 

OTHERWISE...TEMPS WILL PROBABLY MAX OUT THIS MORNING OR AT BEST WARM 
A FEW DEGREES IN THE AFTERNOON WITH SUNSHINE EXPECTED. MID AND HIGH 
CLOUDS SHOULD INCREASE TONIGHT WHICH SUPPORTED MORE OF A BLEND OF 
THE DIFFERING MOS MINS. ANY PRECIPITATION FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE 
A TRACE EVENT WITH FLURRIES...WHICH WAS DOWNPLAYED IN THE GRIDS. 
LATER SHIFTS MAY BE ABLE TO DROP ALL MENTION OF ANY FLURRIES FOR 
TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEAK DISTURBANCE IN NW FLOW
WILL BRUSH NE TN AND SW VA SUNDAY MORNING. SOME LIGHT SNOW OR SNOW
FLURRIES WILL END BY LATE MORNING THEN WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL
BUILD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH FLOW BECOMING MORE ZONAL. SKIES
WILL BECOME MOSTLY SUNNY CENTRAL AND SOUTH WITH TEMPERATURES WARMING
TO NEAR AVERAGE ACROSS THE SOUTH AND CENTRAL BUT LINGERING CLOUDS
ACROSS THE NORTH WILL KEEP HIGHS THERE IN THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER
40S. SUNDAY NIGHT HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO SHIFT EAST. MONDAY LOW
PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND DEVELOPING FRONTAL SYSTEM
SPREADS CLOUDS INTO THE TN VALLEY WITH CHANCE OF RAIN BY AFTERNOON.
SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL WARM TEMPERATURES
INTO THE 50S. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A MUCH WARMER PATTERN. AS THE
FRONT MOVES THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT SKIES WILL CLEAR EARLY TUESDAY AS
HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS EAST. TUESDAY WILL CONTINUE TO BE MILDER AND
SUNNY WITH HIGHS IN THE 50S TO LOWER 60S. TUESDAY NIGHT MOISTURE
SPREADS BACK NORTH AND AN UNSETTLED PATTERN SETS UP WITH SHOWERS
WEDNESDAY AS A DEEPER AREA OF LOW PRESSURE FORMS OVER THE PLAINS BY
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THIS STRONGER SYSTEM BRINGS EVEN WARMER CONDITIONS
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AS THE MAIN FRONTAL SYSTEM APPROACHES. SHOWERS
AGAIN WILL BE ON THE INCREASE WITH THE AIR MASS BECOMING UNSTABLE
THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY WITH THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE AS HIGHS REACH
INTO THE 60S IN ALL BUT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS BOTH DAYS.

SNOWFALL TOTALS JUST A TAD FOR ALL AREAS BELOW 3000 FEET AS LATEST 
MODEL RUNS SHOWING A LITTLE LESS ACCUMULATION. UPPER TROUGH WILL 
CONTINUE MOVING THROUGH OUR REGION OVERNIGHT WITH RAIN EVENTUALLY 
CHANGING OVER TO ALL SNOW AS COLD AIR GETS PULLED IN ON THE BACK 
SIDE OF THE LOW. SOUNDINGS SHOW THAT AREAS ABOVE 3000/3500 FEET 
SHOULD BE ALL SNOW AT THIS POINT. FREEZING LEVEL WILL CONTINUE TO 
DROP THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH MOST LOCATIONS CHANGING OVER TO SNOW BY 
AROUND 07Z. LIGHT TO MODERATE SNOWFALL RATES ARE ARE STILL EXPECTED 
OVERNIGHT ACROSS SOME AREAS. AS WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST...SURFACE 
ABILITY TO ACCUMULATE SNOWFALL IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS IS 
QUESTIONABLE...BUT HAZARDOUS IMPACTS ARE STILL ANTICIPATED AND WILL 
THEREFORE LEAVE ALL ADVISORIES AND WARNINGS IN PLACE. WILL UPDATE

.SHORT TERM...UPPER TROUGH MOVING EAST ACROSS TN VALLEY TONIGHT. 
STRENGTHENING BACK SIDE JET MAX SLOWING TROUGH DOWN AND DEEPENING 
IT. RELATIVELY SMALL SURFACE LOW TRACKING ALONG N TN BORDER TONIGHT 
TO OVER TRI BY SATURDAY MORNING. THINGS WE KNOW ARE SYSTEM IS A 
SMALL ... FAST AND IS CARRYING ITS OWN MOISTURE. PROGS STARTING TO 
LEAN TOWARD MORE MOISTURE ON COLD SIDE OF CYCLONE. VERY GOOD WARM UP 
TODAY BUT FREEZING LEVEL ONLY REACHING NEAR 6200 FEET. WITH ONSET OF 
RAIN TONIGHT...HIGHER ELEVATIONS WILL EASILY COOL TO BELOW FREEZING. 
MAJORITY OF PRECIPITATION ABOVE 3500 WILL LIKELY BE SNOW THROUGH THE 
EVENT. FREEZING LEVEL DOESNT DROP BELOW 3500 TIL ~15/07Z. STRONG 
COLD AIR WRAPPING AROUND LOW AFT 15/07Z. THAT IS THE TIME WHEN 
VALLEY LOCATIONS WILL BEGIN TO SEE RAIN CHANGE TO MOSTLY SNOW. THE 
FREEZING LEVEL WILL LOWER TO OR NEAR THE SURFACE THROUGH 15/12Z. 
LIGHT TO MODERATE SNOWFALL RATES ARE EXPECTED OVERNIGHT. SURFACE 
ABILITY TO ACCUMULATE IS QUESTIONABLE BUT HAZARDOUS IMPACTS WARRANT 
ADVISORY CONDITIONS WERE POSTED. ELEVATED AREAS OF THE SOUTHERN 
PLATEAU WILL BE MONITORED BUT POST COLD AIR PRECIPITATION/SNOW LOOKS 
BRIEF. SW NC HOLDS ON TO WARM AIR A BIT LONG TO INCLUDE IN ADVISORY 
FOR NOW. GOOD SPEED AND DIRECTION FOR MORNING UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWERS. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
SPRING PROMISES TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE NEXT WEEK...BUT FIRST ONE MORE 
QUICK AND INSIGNIFICANT CHANCE OF SNOW FLAKES DURING SATURDAY NIGHT 
AND SUNDAY MORNING...NO REAL ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED. THE JET STREAM 
WILL THEN LIFT NORTHWARD AND PRETTY MUCH STAY THERE ALL WEEK...
KEEPING AWAY ARCTIC AIR. A WARMING SOUTHERLY FLOW AT THE SURFACE AND 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL BRING SPRINGLIKE TEMPS TO THE REGION 
THROUGH THE WEEK NEXT WEEK. THIS FLOW WILL BRING GULF MOISTURE INTO 
THE AREA...INCREASING THE HUMIDITY AND KEEPING OVERNIGHT LOW 
TEMPERATURES QUITE MILD FOR THE SECOND HALF OF NEXT WEEK...SOME 
TENNESSEE VALLEY LOW TEMPS DURING LATE NEXT WEEK MAY NOT FALL BELOW 
50. WITH THE INCREASED MOISTURE COMES A GENERAL CHANCE FOR 
DISORGANIZED SHOWERS THAT WILL PERSIST MUCH OF THE WORK WEEK...WITH 
THE BEST CHANCES FOR ORGANIZED RAINFALL BEING FOCUSED MAINLY ON 
MONDAY NIGHT...AND AGAIN THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...SHORT TERM PROBLEM EARLIER 
WAS SOME PATCHY AREAS OF FOG OR FREEZING FOG. SURFACE WINDS PICKED 
UP A BIT AND A FEW CLOUDS DRIFTED OVERHEAD...SO FOG HAS LIFTED FOR 
THE MOST PART.

MODELS SLOWING DOWN THE PRECIPITATION AHEAD OF THE UPPER TROUGH AND 
COLD FRONT...SO POPS WERE TRIMMED BACK SIGNIFICANTLY FOR TODAY. ALSO 
BUMPED UP POPS FOR AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT DUE TO THE SLOWER TIMING.
00Z GFS AND NAM MODELS CRANKING OUT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SNOW MAINLY 
NWRN PARTS OF OUR FORECAST AREA...BUT THIS IS SUSPECT DUE TO HOW 
WARM TEMPS GET AHEAD OF THE FRONT...PLUS HOW QUICKLY THE DEEPER 
MOISTURE EXITS THE REGION. 

THUS...I STAYED WITH SNOW ACCUMULATIONS SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS GRIDS 
AND LATEST WWD GRAPHICS. COORDINATED WITH ADJACENT NWS OFFICES ON 
BUMPING THE WATCH AREA TO A LOW END WARNING EVENT (2 TO 6 INCHES)... 
AND WILL ISSUE A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR REMAINING AREAS OTHER 
THAN SE TN AND SW NC COUNTIES. NO CHANGE TO STARTING TIMES BUT DID 
EXTEND ENDING TIME FOR WARNING AND NE TN/SW VA ADVISORY OUT TO 10 AM 
EST SATURDAY. 

OTHERWISE...TRENDED VERY CLOSE TO SIMILAR MOS TEMPS FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...THEN FAVORED THE COOLER GFS MOS FOR MAX TEMPS ON 
SATURDAY.  

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...ANOTHER WEAKER
CLIPPER TYPE SYSTEM TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT AND
EARLY SUNDAY. HAVE KEPT PRECIPITATION CHANCES LOW AND ONLY MINOR
ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED. AFTER THIS FAST MOVING SYSTEM MOVES OUT
LATER SUNDAY TEMPERATURES REBOUND AS FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL. ONLY
A BRIEF PERIOD OF CLEARING SUNDAY NIGHT AND EARLY MONDAY BEFORE A
STRONGER SYSTEM TO BRING A CHANCE OF JUST RAIN LATE MONDAY INTO
TUESDAY. GFS BRINGS FRONT THROUGH BRINGING DRIER WEATHER TO THE
REGION TUESDAY WHILE ECMWF KEEPS FRONT CLOSE BY TO THE SOUTH. WILL
FOLLOW THE WETTER ECMWF SOLUTION. SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AND LOWER
PRESSURE DEVELOPING TO THE SOUTHWEST WILL INDUCE MORE LIFT ALONG
THE FRONT. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE ALONG FRONT SPREADS RAIN BACK NORTH
TUESDAY AND THE WET PATTERN CONTINUES THROUGH THURSDAY. SOUTHERLY
FLOW WILL ADD GULF MOISTURE INTO THE TN VALLEY WITH WARMING
TEMPERATURES INTO THE 60S BY WEDNESDAY SOUTH AND THURSDAY ALL THE
WAY NORTH INTO VIRGINIA AND A CHANCE OF A FEW THUNDERSTORMS.
HEAVIER RAINS BY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY ANY ANY LEFTOVER SNOW MELT
MAY CREATE SOME RIVER RISES.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED 
OFF THE NEW JERSEY COAST...WITH AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED 
OVER THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS THAT 
CLOUDS HAVE CLEARED OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH TEMPS 
RANGING FROM THE UPPER 20S OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN TO THE 
UPPER 30S OVER SOUTHEAST TN. WITH LIGHT WINDS ALSO EXPECTED 
TONIGHT...GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING AND ADDITIONAL COOLING FROM THE 
SNOW COVER WILL CAUSE TEMPS TO FALL WELL INTO THE 20S OVER MOST OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. A POTENTIAL CONCERN FOR TONIGHT WILL BE THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF BLACK ICE FROM THE REFREEZING OF LINGERING MOISTURE 
ON AREA ROADWAYS.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...AND 
WILL NOT PLAN TO UPDATE THIS EVENING.

.NEAR TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...SHORT WAVE SURFACE RIDGE MOVES 
ACROSS THE AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT. CLEAR SKIES WILL LEAD TOWARD GOOD 
COOLING EARLY TONIGHT. THIS COUPLED WITH SNOW FIELDS LEADS FORECAST 
TO LOW END OR BELOW GUIDANCE FOR MINS TONIGHT. STRONG LOW LEVEL 
INVERSION SETS UP TONIGHT. EVAPORATION AND SUBLIMATION OF SNOW 
SHOULD LEAD TO A RELATIVELY MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER. MODEL T/TD SPREADS 
ARE FAIRLY WIDE BUT FEEL LATE NIGHT PATCHY FREEZING FOG WILL OCCUR. 
DECENT WARM AIR ADVECTION IN SOUTHWEST FLOW FRIDAY AS UPPER TROUGH 
APPROACHES FROM THE WEST LATE. INCREASING CLOUDINESS THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON. PRECIPITATION MOST LIKELY HOLDING OFF THROUGH DAY TIME 
HOURS.  

.SHORT TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY)...ANOTHER DYNAMIC SYSTEM 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS...OHIO VALLEY INTO THE CENTRAL 
AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. MODELS SHOW A 
NICE LOBE OF Q-VECTOR FORCING ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHORT-WAVE AS WELL
AS FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING ALONG THE FRONT AND ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD 
OF THE FRONT. THE STRONG FORCING WILL PRODUCE ANOTHER ROUND OF 
PRECIPITATION STARTING 00Z SATURDAY. THE UPPER TROUGH WILL BRING 
WITH IT FAIRLY GOOD 500MB TEMPERATURES BETWEEN -30 TO -32 DEGREES 
CELSIUS ALONG WITH STRONG 850MB COLD AIR ADVECTION FRIDAY EVENING. 

MODELS SHOW GOOD LIFT WITHIN THE DENDRITIC GROWTH REGION BETWEEN 
00-04Z...HOWEVER...SOUNDINGS INDICATE THE FIRST 100MB WILL BE TOO 
WARM FOR SNOW. I FEEL THAT THE STRONG FORCING AND COLD AIR ALOFT 
WILL HELP OVER-COME THE SHALLOW BOUNDARY LAYER WARM AIR TO 
EVENTUALLY CHANGE RAIN TO SNOW FRIDAY EVENING. FOR THE 
MOUNTAINS...ABOVE 2500 FEET...CHANGE TO SNOW WILL OCCUR FAIRLY 
QUICKLY TO WARRANT A WATCH FOR 3 TO 6 INCHES. WILL ISSUE A SPS FOR 
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA WITH 1 TO 2 INCHES POSSIBLE.

SYSTEM MOVES OUT FOR SATURDAY WITH RETURN OF SUNSHINE IN THE MORNING.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
THERE IS A WARM-UP COMING! TENNESSEE VALLEY DAYTIME HIGHS MAY BE IN 
THE 60S BY MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. DEFINITELY A GLIMPSE OF SPRING. 

NORTHWEST FLOW SAT NGT AND SUNDAY MAY ALLOW A WEAK SYSTEM TO QUICKLY 
MOVE SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA LATE 
SATURDAY NIGHT...NO ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED. ZONAL FLOW AFTER SUNDAY 
WILL KEEP AWAY ARCTIC AIR WHILE PUSHING A WEAK FRONTAL SYSTEM 
THROUGH THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT WITH A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS. ONE 
CAVEAT IS IF A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF SNOW REMAINS ON THE GROUND OVER 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS UNTIL MONDAY NIGHT...THEN THE MONDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH MID-WEEK RAINS WOULD RAPIDLY MELT THE SNOW AND PROVIDE 
SNOWMELT-ASSISTED RIVER RISES. BY TUESDAY...SOUTHERLY SURFACE WINDS 
WILL DEVELOP WHILE UPPER LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE MID 
ATLANTIC STATES...PLACING US IN SW FLOW ALOFT TOO. THE RESULT WILL 
BE THE INVASION OF HIGHER TEMPERATURES AND DEWPOINTS FROM TUESDAY 
THROUGH SATURDAY...WITH A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS EACH DAY. EXPECT THE 
AFOREMENTIONED HIGHS IN THE 60S WHILE OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL DIP ONLY 
INTO THE 40S THANKS TO THE INCREASED MOISTURE.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...UPPER LOW MOVING THROUGH THE TN 
VALLEY TONIGHT...THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS EARLY 
THURSDAY...THEN TO NEAR THE NC/VA COAST BY LATE THURSDAY. SURFACE 
LOW OVER FL PNHDLE WILL DEEPEN AND MOVE NORTHEAST TONIGHT AND ALONG 
THE ATLANTIC COAST ON THU. 

INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDS INTO THE EASTERN MIDDLE TN VALLEY 
FROM SOUTHERN LOW. LAYER MOISTURE HAS BEEN ON THE RISE TODAY AND 
WILL MAINTAIN IN ADVANCE OF UPPER LOW/TROUGH AXIS OVERNIGHT. +3C 
WARM LAYER...SHOWING UP NICELY IN 12/18Z FFC SOUNDING PROVING TO BE 
INTERESTING FEATURE IN RELATION TO PRECIPITATION TYPE ACROSS 
SOUTHERN AREAS. THESE SWINGS IN PRECIP TYPE HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS FAR N 
AS ATHENS MID DAY TODAY. A DOWN VALLEY LOWER LAYER FLOW IS TAKING 
SHAPE AND THE WARM LAYER IS EXPECTED TO MOVE SOUTH OF THE TN BORDER 
SHORTLY. H70 DEFORMATION ZONE MODELED NICELY AND ESTABLISHING ALONG 
NW MRX CWA BORDER. LATEST SAT PIX VERIFYING POSITION. SNOW BANDS 
SHOULD BE ON THE INCREASE THIS EVENING AND CONTINUE OVERNIGHT. BEST 
FRONTOGENESIS DEPICTED FROM 13/00-13/06Z. ORIENTATION/PIVOT OF 
DEFORMATION ZONE OVERNIGHT SUPPORTS SNOW LINGERING IN NE AREAS EARLY 
THU. A CRACK OF THUNDERSNOW POSSIBLE WHEN COLDER CORE MID LEVEL TEMPS 
SLIDE IN OVERNIGHT. BEST CHANCE ALONG SOUTHERN MOUNTAINS. 
TEMPERATURES WILL MOVE LITTLE AND LEANED COOLER FOR THU EXPECTING CU 
FIELD TO LINGER A BIT LONGER THAN CURRENT MODEL DEPICTION.    

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
IN WAKE OF TODAY WINTER STORM...CLEARING WILL BEGIN TO TAKE PLACE BY 
THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING ON THURSDAY. THE SUBFREEZING 
TEMPERATURES WILL RESULT IN A REFREEZING OF ANY LINGERING SNOW AND 
SLUSH ON ROADWAYS...CREATING SOME HAZARDOUS TRAVEL CONDITIONS 
OVERNIGHT AND THROUGH THE FRIDAY MORNING COMMUTE. THIS OTHERWISE 
BOUT OF QUIET WEATHER WILL BE SHORT-LIVED HOWEVER...AS ANOTHER 
SHORTWAVE WILL SWING THROUGH THE AREA ON FRIDAY. AHEAD OF THIS 
SYSTEM...SOME BREEZY SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL HELP TO PUSH HIGHS WELL 
INTO THE UPPER 30S TO MID 40S. THIS WILL HELP TO MELT SOME OF THE 
LINGERING SNOWPACK AND ALLOW FOR SOME RAIN SHOWERS TO SPREAD OVER 
THE REGION AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM BY THE AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...AS 
TEMPERATURES COOL BY THE EVENING...THE RAIN WILL MIX WITH AND CHANGE 
OVER TO SNOW. ONLY VERY MINOR ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED IN MOST 
LOCATIONS...BUT HIGHER ELEVATIONS AREAS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE COULD SEE SOME LOW-END ADVISORY-LEVEL 
ACCUMULATIONS. 

ANOTHER CLIPPER SYSTEM WILL BRING SOME LIGHT SNOW AND RAIN SHOWERS 
FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY BEFORE RIDGING WILL PROMOTE A WARM-UP 
INTO THE 50S ACROSS THE REGION SUNDAY AND MONDAY. ANOTHER STRONG 
STORM SYSTEM LOOKS AS IF IT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION SOMETIME 
INTO THE EARLY PART OF THE WORK WEEK...BUT THE LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS 
DIFFER WITH THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF THE PRECIPITATION. HAVE 
ATTEMPTED A BLEND OF THE GFS AND  ECMWF AND HAVE SOME CHANCE POPS 
WORKING THEIR WAY MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY...WITH IT LOOKING AS 
IF IT WILL BE WARM ENOUGH TO BE A MOSTLY RAIN EVENT FOR NOW. 
THEREAFTER...TEMPERATURES MAY APPROACH THE UPPER 50S AND LOWER 60S 
RIDGING MOVES BACK IN TO CLOSE OUT THE PERIOD.

320 PM EST TUE FEB 11 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...SKIES HAVE BECOME 
MOSTLY SUNNY THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE NORTHWEST TWO THIRDS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. DEWPOINTS HAVE DROPPED TO THE TEENS AND COLDER IN 
NORTHERN SECTIONS. TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED TO AROUND 40 IN THE 
LOWER ELEVATION SUNNY AREAS TO 30S ELSEWHERE. ONLY LIGHT SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS OCCURRED MAINLY SE TN AND SW NC MOUNTAINS. 

MODELS STILL SHOWING DIFFERENCES IN SYSTEM WITH GFS...CANADIAN AND 
ECMWF SHOWING A DEEPER TROUGH DIGGING SOUTH WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
THURSDAY OVER THE EASTERN STATES AND SURFACE LOW TRACKING FROM THE 
NE GULF ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA AND UP THE EAST COAST COMPARED TO THE 
NAM. THIS DEEPER TROUGH IS EXPECTED TO INDUCE MORE LIFT OVER EAST TN 
AND ADJACENT NC MOUNTAINS WEDNESDAY AND SHIFTING NORTHEAST WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT WITH SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL EXPECTED. INCREASED QPF AMOUNTS 
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS MODELS SHOWING INCREASED 
FORCING DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. INCREASED TOTAL SNOWFALL AMOUNTS A 
COUPLE INCHES EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST AND AROUND ONE INCH 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND NORTHERN PLATEAU. INCREASED POPS SLIGHTLY 
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AND EARLY TOMORROW AND KEPT SOME LIGHT RAIN OR 
SLEET IN GRIDS IN SE TN SECTIONS THROUGH 12Z WEDNESDAY. LOWS TONIGHT 
WILL ONLY FALL TO AROUND 30 ACROSS THE EXTREME SOUTH WHERE CLOUDS 
WILL LIKELY NOT THIN MUCH. FARTHER NORTH TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TO 
DROP INTO THE MID TO UPPER 20S EXCEPT ALONG THE KY BORDER AND SW VA 
WHERE SKIES MAY STAY CLEAR MOST OF THE NIGHT. WEDNESDAY TEMPERATURES 
NOT LIKELY TO RISE MUCH IN THE MORNING SOUTH WITH SNOW STARTING 
EARLY. CENTRAL AND NORTH SECTIONS STARTING COLDER COULD SEE 
TEMPERATURES RISING TO AROUND FREEZING OR SLIGHTLY HIGHER BEFORE 
SNOW STARTS TO FALL. WENT A COUPLE DEGREES BELOW MAV GUIDANCE 
WEDNESDAY MOST LOCATIONS. WEDNESDAY NIGHT GENERALLY FOLLOWED MAV 
GUIDANCE FOR LOWS AS SNOW CONTINUES BUT WILL LIKELY TAPER OFF FROM 
WEST TO EAST AFTER MIDNIGHT. WINTER STORM WATCH WILL BE CHANGED TO 
WARNING WITH THIS FORECAST AND ONLY THREE NORTHERN PLATEAU COUNTIES 
WILL HAVE LOW ENOUGH TOTALS FOR ADVISORY. WARNING WILL BE STAGGERED 
FROM SOUTH 12Z...CENTRAL AREAS 15Z AND 18Z NORTHEAST ENDING AT 12Z 
THURSDAY. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN REASONABLE 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL THREE QUICK-MOVING SYSTEMS AFFECTING 
THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE FRIDAY/FRIDAY NIGHT...SATURDAY NIGHT/ 
SUNDAY...AND MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT TIME PERIODS. THERE REMAIN SOME 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODELS REGARDING THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE 
EXPECTED WITH EACH OF THESE SYSTEMS...BUT THE MODELS SHOW VERY GOOD 
TIMING AGREEMENTS WITH THESE THREE SYSTEMS. THE GFS...CANADIAN...AND 
ECMWF MODELS ALL AGREE THAT THE FIRST CLIPPER SYSTEM ON FRIDAY/ 
FRIDAY NIGHT WILL BRING A GOOD COVERAGE OF PRECIP FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. WITH TEMPS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE UPPER 30S 
TO LOWER 40S ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON...IT APPEARS THAT THE INITIAL 
PRECIP WILL BEGIN AS RAIN...BUT THIS RAIN SHOULD THEN QUICKLY CHANGE 
TO SNOW AS THE SUN SETS FRIDAY EVENING. RIGHT NOW...IT APPEARS THAT 
SOME LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH THIS SYSTEM 
BY FRIDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. ANOTHER 
WEAKER UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL THEN MOVE ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY DURING THE SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY TIME PERIOD...BRINGING A 
RAIN/SNOW MIXTURE AGAIN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 

ANOTHER FAIRLY STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS THEN PROGGED TO REMAIN 
NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA (OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION) DURING THE 
MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT TIME PERIOD...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT 
TRIGGERING MOSTLY RAIN SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. BECAUSE OF 
ITS MORE NORTHERLY TRACK...IT APPEARS RIGHT NOW THAT WARMER TEMPS 
WILL BE PULLED NORTHWARD INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY RESULTING IN 
MAINLY A RAIN EVENT FOR THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
GENERALLY TREND COOLER THAN THE GFS NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...WHICH IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS...AND 
ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE EXPECTED SNOW COVER WHICH WILL LIKELY 
KEEP TEMPS COOLER THAN GUIDANCE.

DURING THE MORNING HOURS. LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS STILL LOOK POSSIBLE IN 
THE ADVISORY AREA...SO WILL LEAVE IN PLACE.  HOWEVER...WILL MOVE 
ENDING TIME UP TO NOON AS IT APPEARS ACCUMULATING SNOW SHOULD BE 
OVER BY THEN. SHOULD BE A FAIRLY TIGHT GRADIENT ON THE PRECIP...SO 
WILL KEEP THINGS DRY FURTHER NORTH. TONIGHT...MOISTURE WILL START TO

SLEET MAY BEGIN TO MOVE INTO MAINLY SOUTHERN AREAS LATE.  WILL CARRY 
CHANCE POPS FAR SOUTH...SLIGHT CHANCE CENTRAL.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS COMING INTO BETTER 
AGREEMENT REGARDING A STRONG WINTER STORM SYSTEM THAT WILL MOVE INTO 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  
HOWEVER...THIS IS STILL SOME MINOR DIFFERENCES IN EXACT TRACK OF 
LOW.  THIS SYSTEM HAS DEEP MOISTURE AND STRONG LIFT.  THIS COMBINED 
WITH A COLD TEMPERATURE PROFILE WILL GENERATE A SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL 
EVENT.  AROUND 4 INCHES OF SNOW IS POSSIBLE ACROSS MANY VALLEY 
LOCATIONS...WITH 6 TO 9 EXPECTED IN THE MOUNTAINS.  THE WINTER STORM 
WATCH WILL BE EXPANDED ACROSS ALL AREAS BUT THE NORTHERN PLATEAU.  
THE SYSTEM WILL SLOWLY PULL OUT LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY.

INTO THURSDAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN.  THE NEXT 
SYSTEM...A QUICK CLIPPER SYSTEM...MOVES IN ON FRIDAY.  AS THE PRECIP 
MOVES IN FRIDAY MORNING...EXPECTED MAINLY LIGHT SNOW...HOWEVER AS 
TEMPERATURES WARM DURING THE AFTERNOON THE SNOW WILL TRANSITION TO 
RAIN.  ANY LINGER SHOWERS WILL SWITCH BACK TO LIGHT SNOW FRIDAY 
NIGHT.  ANOTHER CLIPPER SYSTEM MOVES IN AROUND THE SATURDAY NIGHT 
TIME FRAME.  THIS ONE HAS LESS MOISTURE AND WILL KEEP POPS LOW AT 20

.AVIATION...CONDITIONS HAVE IMPROVED TO VFR...EVEN AT TYS PER LATEST 
OBSERVATION. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TO OUR SOUTH MAY EXTEND JUST FAR 
ENOUGH NORTH TO AFFECT CHA OVERNIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING...BUT ONLY
MINIMAL AT THIS TIME. THUS...LOWERING CHA BACK TO BETWEEN MVFR AND 
IFR BEFORE DAYBREAK...THEN NUDGING BACK UP TO VFR BY 18Z TUESDAY.

OTHERWISE...THE COOLER AIR IN PLACE MAY LEAD TO BRIEF MVFR AT 
TYS/TRI BY 11/08Z...THEN QUICKLY BACK UP TO VFR. A BREAK BEFORE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
320 PM EST MON FEB 10 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...COLDER MODIFIED ARCTIC AIR MASS 
CONTINUES TO FILTER COLD AIR INTO THE REGION TODAY. LIGHT SNOW 
SHOWERS AND FLURRIES HAVE DEVELOPED FIRST AROUND CHA AND THEN LATER 
TODAY ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA. ONLY A FEW ACCUMULATION REPORTS HAVE 
COME IN AND THEY HAVE BEEN LIGHT. CURRENT TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE 
UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF PLATEAU AND EASTERN AND 
NORTHERN MOUNTAINS TO MID 30S TO JUST ABOVE 40 LOWER VALLEYS. 
CURRENT PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE NORTH AND MOUNTAINS SHOULD SHIFT 
EAST INTO NC AFTER 00Z. THERE THEN MAY BE SOME CLEARING NORTHERN 
AREAS AS DRIER AIR CONTINUES FILTERING. LOWS WILL BE IN THE TEENS 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SW VA TO 20S TO NEAR 30 
ELSEWHERE. A SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS AL AND GA TUESDAY WILL ENHANCE 
LIFT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH SOME 
LIGHT SNOW FROM ABOUT 9Z THROUGH MID TO LATE AFTERNOON. UP TO ABOUT 
ONE INCH OF SNOW IS POSSIBLE OVER THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN VALLEY 
AND ONE TO THREE INCHES SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC MOUNTAINS 
DURING THE DAY TUESDAY. WITH CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
SECTIONS TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TO BE BELOW GUIDANCE WITH UPPER 20S 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO 30S LOWER ELEVATIONS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN REASONABLE 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...BUT ARE BACK TO SHOWING SOME DIFFERENCES WITH PATH OF THE 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM FOR WEDNESDAY/WEDNESDAY NIGHT. A LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP ALONG THE NORTHERN GULF COAST WEDNESDAY 
MORNING...AND WILL THEN MOVE NORTHEASTWARD UP ALONG THE CAROLINA 
COAST ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT. ITS ASSOCIATED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS 
PROGGED TO SWING ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON INTO 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WHICH WILL HELP TO CREATE A DEFORMATION ZONE OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA AND WILL PULL SOME MOISTURE FROM THE SURFACE LOW 
(OVER THE CAROLINA COAST) FARTHER WEST OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THE 
LATEST NAM MODEL RUN SHOWS MOST OF THIS SYSTEM'S MOISTURE REMAINING 
EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS OVER THE CAROLINAS...WITH ONLY SOME LIGHT 
PRECIP AMOUNTS OVER THE GREAT TN VALLEY. HOWEVER...THE LATEST RUNS 
OF THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS CONTINUE TO BRING SOME DECENT MOISTURE 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT... 
WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN AT LEAST ADVISORY SNOWFALL AMOUNTS (GENERALLY 
ONE TO FOUR INCHES) BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. RIGHT NOW...IT APPEARS THAT 
TEMPS ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON WILL BE WARM ENOUGH FOR THE INITIAL 
PRECIP TO BEGIN AS RAIN...BUT THIS RAIN SHOULD THEN QUICKLY CHANGE 
TO SNOW AS THE SUN SETS WEDNESDAY EVENING. SINCE THE FORECAST AREA 
WILL BE ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE PRECIP AREA ASSOCIATED WITH THIS 
SYSTEM...LATER MODEL RUNS COULD EASILY CHANGE PRECIP AMOUNTS OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA...ESPECIALLY IF THE NAM MODEL IS RIGHT ABOUT THE 
BULK OF THE MOISTURE REMAINING FARTHER EAST OVER THE CAROLINAS. WITH 
ALL OF THIS IN MIND...IT APPEARS RIGHT NOW THAT SOUTHWEST NC AND THE 
MOUNTAINS OF EAST TN COULD SEE SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS OF FOUR TO 
EIGHT INCHES (WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS ON THE HIGHEST PEAKS) BY 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THUS...WILL CONTINUE THE WINTER STORM WATCH FOR 
THESE AREAS. OUTSIDE OF THESE AREAS (FOR THE GREAT TN VALLEY AND THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU)...IT APPEARS THAT ONE TO FOUR INCHES OF SNOW 
WILL BE POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THUS...WILL ISSUE A SPECIAL 
WEATHER STATEMENT FOR THESE AREAS.

AFTER THE WEDNESDAY/WEDNESDAY NIGHT SYSTEM MOVES NORTHEASTWARD UP 
THE NORTHEAST COAST...A COUPLE OF QUICK-MOVING CLIPPER SYSTEMS WILL 
THEN AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE FRIDAY/FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY TIME PERIODS. FOR NOW...WILL MENTION CHANCE 
POPS WITH THESE SYSTEMS SINCE THE MODELS HAVE DISAGREEMENT WITH THE 
AMOUNT OF MOISTURE WITH THESE SYSTEMS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY 
TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN THE GFS NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...WHICH IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

THIS MORNING WITH PATCHY LIGHT DRIZZLE AND SNOW OVER SOUTHEAST
TENNESSEE. RADAR SHOWING SOME LIGHT RETURNS MAINLY OVER THE ABOVE
MENTIONED AREA AT THIS TIME AND JUST EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COLDER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH 
INTO THE AREA TODAY BEHIND THE COLD FRONT.  EXPECT AN AREA OF LIGHT 
PRECIP TO DEVELOP IN AREA OF WEAK FRONTOGENETIC FORCING...BUT EXACT 
PLACEMENT AND TIMING PROBLEMATIC.  APPEARS BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIP 
WILL BE ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEYS AND INTO 
THE MOUNTAINS SO WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS THERE.  CHANCE ELSEWHERE.  
PRECIP TYPE WILL LIKELY BE SNOW...BUT SOME RAIN MAY MIX IN ACROSS 
THE VALLEY.  SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION WILL ALSO BE 
POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE AN INCH OF 
SNOW MAY ACCUMULATE.  NO WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY...BUT WILL INCLUDE 
IN HWO.  TONIGHT WILL BE DRY OVER MUCH OF THE AREA...BUT WILL 
INCLUDE SOME LOW POPS FAR SOUTH CLOSER TO THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. WILL 
GENERALLY UNDERCUT MAV TEMPS A BIT FOR HIGHS GIVEN EXPECTED CLOUDS 
AND RECENT TRENDS.  AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE MAV TEMPS TONIGHT.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVES ACROSS 
THE MID SOUTH ON TUESDAY AND THERE IS A SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE FOR 
SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION DURING THE DAY TUESDAY FOR CENTRAL EAST 
TENNESSEE. THE CHANCE IS A LITTLE HIGHER ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE 
AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA WHERE TIMING OF PRECIP DURING THE 
MORNING BEFORE TEMPERATURES RISE ABOVE FREEZING WOULD MEAN A 
POSSIBLE LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION ON THE ORDER OF A DUSTING TO 
PERHAPS ONE INCH...MAINLY HIGHER CUMBERLAND PLATEAU TERRAIN AS WELL 
AS HIGHER MOUNTAIN PEAKS ACROSS SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. THE MAIN 
EVENT APPEARS TO BE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY WHEN A STRONGER 
SHORT WAVE BUILDS ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. THE SYSTEM WILL 
GENERATE AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE ACROSS THE  
NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO BY TUESDAY EVENING. AS THE LOW MOVES 
NORTHEAST INTO ALABAMA AND GEORGIA LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FROM THE GULF 
WILL OVERSPREAD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. TEMPERATURES SHOULD 
BE COLD ENOUGH FOR ACCUMULATING SNOW ACROSS THE APPALACHIAN 
MOUNTAINS WHERE ONE TO THREE INCHES OF SNOW MAY FALL BY DAYBREAK 
WEDNESDAY. ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATION WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
COULD BRING TOTALS TO AROUND 3 TO 5 INCHES IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH 
LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS ABOVE 5000 FEET. LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS 
ON THE ORDER OF 1 TO 2 INCHES ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE GREAT VALLEY 
MAINLY ON WEDNESDAY AS THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MOVES SLOWLY EAST 
TOWARD THE ATLANTIC COAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...A COLD FRONT LOCATED
FROM E KY TO MIDDLE TN AT THE MOMENT WILL BE PUSHING ACROSS THE
AREA THIS EVENING. THE MAIN IMPACT OF THE FRONT WILL BE LOWER
SURFACE DEWPOINTS...SLIGHTLY COLDER LOW TEMPS TONIGHT...AND A WIND
SHIFT TO N-NW. IT MAY PROVIDE SOME WEAK LIFT ACROSS NORTHERN
AREAS...AND SO WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING THERE. MID AND
HIGH CLOUDS INCREASE LATER TONIGHT...WHICH MAY PROVIDE FOR SOME
SEEDING OF THE LOWER CLOUD DECK AND THUS SOME BETTER CHANCES OF
PRECIP LATE TONIGHT...MAINLY NORTH.

THE NAM AND GFS HAVE COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT FOR 
MONDAY...ALTHOUGH THE NAM STILL SHOWS MORE QPF THAN THE GFS. BOTH 
SHOW PLENTY OF MOISTURE...ALONG WITH SOME FRONTOGENETIC FORCING AND 
AGEOSTROPHIC LIFT IN THE 850-700 MB LAYER MONDAY MORNING...THOUGH 
THE NAM IS STRONGER WITH THIS. GIVEN THE INCONSISTENCIES OF THE NAM 
OF LATE...PREFER THE QPF OF THE GFS...WHICH HAS SUPPORT FROM THE 
SREF. WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS AND SNOW ACCUMULATIONS UP TO 1 INCH IN 
SW VA AND NE TN MOUNTAINS...WITH CHANCE POPS AND LESS THAN 1 INCH 
FROM TRI-CITIES TO KNOXVILLE. WILL ISSUE A SPS SINCE THE SNOW WILL 
BE ARRIVING AROUND THE MORNING COMMUTE TIME.

DEEP MOISTURE GETS PUSHED TO OUR SOUTH ON MONDAY NIGHT AS THE 
925-850 MB FLOW TURNS NORTHERLY. CYCLOGENESIS BEGINS ALONG THE 
BOUNDARY TO OUR SOUTH...AND MOST PRECIP SHOULD STAY OUT OF OUR AREA 
UNTIL DAYBREAK TUESDAY. WILL BRING POPS UP TO A CHANCE VERY LATE 
MONDAY NIGHT ACROSS SW NC AND THE SOUTHERN VALLEY COUNTIES IN CASE 
THE MODELS SHOULD CHANGE THEIR MINDS AND BRING THINGS NORTH A LITTLE 
MORE QUICKLY. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...WITH CYCLOGENESIS ALONG
THE COLD FRONT ALONG THE GULF COAST ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE FRONT
WILL PRODUCE SNOWFALL BEGINNING EARLY TUESDAY OVER SE TN AND SW NC.
IN COLD AIR MASS TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S WILL BE
SLOW TO RISE POSSIBLY REACHING THE MID TO UPPER 30S LATE IN THE
DAY. LOWER ELEVATIONS MAY SEE A CHANGE OVER TO RAIN BUT HIGHER
ELEVATIONS SHOULD SEE ALL SNOW. ONLY LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS ARE
EXPECTED ON THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN VALLEY BUT A FEW INCHES ARE
POSSIBLE IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS OF THE SE TN AND SW NC MOUNTAINS
AND POSSIBLY FOUR TO SIX INCHES IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS TUESDAY
AND TUESDAY NIGHT. PLACES FARTHER NORTH IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY NORTH
WILL BE DRIER WITH A SHARP MOISTURE GRADIENT. MAY SEE SOME CLOUDS
AND A FEW FLURRIES BUT NO SIGNIFICANT SNOW EXPECTED. TUESDAY NIGHT
AND WEDNESDAY TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES DEEPENS AND AN
INVERTED TROUGH INCREASES MOISTURE OVER THE EAST TN VALLEY. THIS
WILL SPREAD SNOW AND RAIN NORTH INTO NE SECTIONS OF THE AREA.
 
SNOWFALL AMOUNTS RIGHT NOW ARE EXPECTED TO BE LIGHT WITH HEAVIER 
AMOUNTS OF A COUPLE INCHES POSSIBLE ALONG THE APPALACHIAN CREST OR 
EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS IN THE 24 HOUR PERIOD FROM TUESDAY NIGHT 
INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS DEVELOP A SURFACE LOW ALONG THE FRONT OVER THE 
NORTHERN GULF AS UPPER TROUGH DIGS SOUTH AND THEN MOVE IT NE ACROSS 
THE SE STATES THROUGH THE CAROLINAS. THIS SYSTEMS TRACK MAY GIVE THE 
EASTERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA A MORE SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL. WITH 
UPPER FLOW SWITCHING TO THE NW LATE WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY MORE 
ACCUMULATING SNOW IS POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS AND HIGH KNOB AREA OF VIRGINIA. MODELS SHOW A POSSIBLE 
BRIEF DRY PERIOD THURSDAY NIGHT OR FRIDAY BEFORE ANOTHER SYSTEM 
MOVES IN SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. FORECASTED TEMPERATURES BELOW 
GUIDANCE TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY DUE TO CLOUDS AND PRECIPITATION AND 
ONLY SLIGHTLY WARMER THURSDAY. TEMPERATURES FRIDAY THROUGH THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL SWING 
THROUGH THE AREA LATER TODAY.  MOISTURE WILL BE RATHER SHALLOW AND 
FORCING WILL BE WEAK...SO JUST SOME LOW POPS MAINLY NORTHERN HALF 
TODAY. PRECIP TYPE WILL BE PRIMARILY LIQUID GIVEN THERMAL PROFILES.  
SOME ADDITIONAL WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL MOVE ACROSS 
TONIGHT...AND MOISTURE SHOULD DEEPEN A BIT.  HOWEVER...FORCING LOOKS 
QUITE WEAK...SO JUST SOME SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
TONIGHT FOR SOME RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE...SO WILL STAY CLOSE WITH JUST SOME TWEAKS DOWN FOR MAX 
TEMPS TODAY AND A FEW TWEAKS UP FOR LOWS TONIGHT GIVEN EXPECTED 
CLOUD COVER.        

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...STILL A FAIR AMOUNT OF 
UNCERTAINTY IN THE LONGER TERM FORECAST MODEL DIFFERENCES NOTED. 
LEADING EDGE OF COLDER CANADIAN AIRMASS DROPS WELL SOUTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY WITH LARGE SURFACE HIGH SLIPPING SLOWLY EAST 
ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION. ANOTHER IN A SERIES 
OF SHORT WAVE FEATURES WILL BUILD THROUGH THE EASTERN U.S. LATER 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY INDUCING A SURFACE WAVE ON THE DEEP SOUTH 
COLD FRONT. PACIFIC MOISTURE WILL BE LIFTED ISENTROPICALLY OVER THE 
CHILLY SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN AIRMASS MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. WOULD 
EXPECT SOME VERY LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES ACROSS THE REGION DURING THE 
DAY MONDAY AS THE COLD AIR PRESSES FURTHER SOUTH. LIFT INCREASES 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WITH MODELS COMING TOGETHER ON A SHARP 
MOISTURE GRADIENT NEAR OR JUST SOUTH OF THE TENNESSEE/GEORGIA 
BORDER. IN THIS SCENARIO THE BEST CHANCE OF LIGHT SNOWFALL 
ACCUMULATION WOULD BE ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH 
CAROLINA...PERHAPS AN INCH OR TWO IN THE LOWEST ELEVATIONS WITH A 
LITTLE MORE IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. THIS SYSTEM WOULD BE MOVING AWAY 
TO THE EAST LATER IN THE DAY TUESDAY. HOWEVER...THE LONG TERM MODELS 
SHOW A MORE AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH FORMING ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY ON WEDNESDAY. THIS LEADS TO MORE ISENTROPIC LIFTING ALONG 
WITH INCREASING DYNAMICS WITH THE DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH. TIMING OF 
PRECIP IS CRITICAL DUE TO DIURNAL RISE IN SURFACE TEMPS BUT IT 
APPEARS THERE WILL BE ANOTHER CHANCE FOR SOME LIGHT SNOW 
ACCUMULATION ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY. HELD ONTO SOME 
SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR OROGRAPHIC SNOW WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO 
EARLY THURSDAY BUT MOST OF THE REGION COULD ENJOY A BREAK IN THE 
ACTION FOR MOST OF THE DAY THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT WITH SOME 
DRY ADVECTION. FORECAST CONFIDENCE DROPS OFF EVEN MORE TOWARD THE 
WEEKEND WITH SHORT WAVE TIMING BETWEEN MODELS OUT OF SYNC BUT WENT 
WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR A MIX OF LIGHT RAIN AND SNOW FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY WITH A COUPLE MORE UPPER TROUGH APPEARANCES TO ROUND OUT 
THE WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS GOOD. A FAST MOVING
SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY OVERNIGHT. MODELS
SHOW DECENT ISENTROPIC LIFT WITH THIS WAVE...BUT AVAILABLE MOISTURE
IS QUITE LIMITED. WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY. SATELLITE SHOWS A GOOD
DEAL OF BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. AS WAVE MOVES INTO THE AREA AND
ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASES...CLOUDS WILL RETURN...SO SKIES WILL
BECOME CLOUDS AREA-WIDE TOWARD SUNDAY MORNING.

DUE TO THE BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS...PATCHY FOG IS POSSIBLE ACROSS
MAINLY SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...
SOME ISOALTED FLURRIES ARE LINGERING OVER SW VA THIS
AFTERNOON...BUT WILL EXIT BY SUNSET. CONFIDENCE IS LOW EVEN
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM PERIOD AS WEAK VORT MAXES MOVE ACROSS THE
REGION IN THE WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. THERE ARE NO WELL-DEFINED
PERIODS OF LIFT TO PRODUCE MUCH MEASUREABLE PRECIP. ADDING TO THE
DIFFICULTY IS THAT MOISTURE IS MAINLY CONFINED TO 850 MB AND BELOW
THROUGH THE PERIOD...SO DRIZZLE MAY OCCUR AT TIMES SUNDAY AND
SUNDAY NIGHT. THE NAM AND GFS DO SHOW SOME MIDLEVEL MOISTURE
ARRIVING SUNDAY NIGHT...WHICH MAY ALLOW FOR SOME DENDRITE GROWTH
AND SNOWFALL...MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT IN THE NORTHERN HALF. WILL
KEEP POPS IN THE SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE RANGE SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH
LIGHT QPF. HIGH TEMPS SUNDAY WILL UNDERCUT MOS GUIDANCE BY A FEW
DEGREES GIVEN EXPECTED OVERCAST/BROKEN CLOUD COVER AND MOS WARM
BIAS OF LATE.

LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
OVERALL FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS LOW DUE TO LARGE AND CONSISTENT
MODEL DIFFERENCES. PRECIP CHANCES WILL BEGIN TO DECREASE THROUGH
THE DAY MONDAY AS THE MID LEVEL MOISTURE MOVES OUT OF THE AREA. A
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM BEGINS TO FORM ON THE GULF COAST...AND THEN
PROGRESS NORTHEASTWARD THROUGH MIDWEEK. ECMWF AND NAM ARE
AGGRESSIVE WITH THE PRECIPITATION MOVING INTO THE CWA...WITH GFS
AND SREF KEEPING MAIN CHANCES FOR ANY PRECIP AND SNOW ACCUMULATION
TO SOUTHEASTERN TN AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. GFS SEEMS TO BE
THE MOST CONSISTENT BETWEEN MODEL RUNS...WITH ADDITIONAL MODELS
ALIGNING TO THE GFS OUTPUT. HAVE GONE WITH THE GFS FOR NOW.

BELOW FREEZING TEMPERATURES AND AMPLE MIDLEVEL MOISTURE WILL LEAD TO 
SNOWFALL ACCUMULATION ACROSS THE AREA...WITH THE HIGHER AMOUNTS 
SOUTH OF KNOXVILLE. MID LEVEL DRY AIR BEGINS TO MOVE IN FOR LATE 
TUESDAY EVENING AND NIGHT. ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BE PRESENT 
FOR LIGHT ADDITIONAL SNOWFALL AMOUNTS ACROSS THE AREA. THE ECMWF 
MODEL APPEARS TO PICK UP THE EXIT OF THE SYSTEM BETTER THAN THE 
GFS...SO WENT CLOSER TO THAT MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE EXTENDED. 
SNOW WILL SLOWLY CHANGE TO RAIN THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS THE 
TEMPERATURES APPROACH THE LOWER TO MID 40S...THEN BACK TO SNOW 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE TEMPERATURES DROP BACK TO AROUND FREEZING. 
RAIN IS THEN EXPECTED TO SLOWLY DECREASE FROM WEST TO EAST THROUGH 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES UP THE EAST 
COAST. 

CLOUD COVER EXPECTED TO BE MOSTLY CLOUDY THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED...CLEARING SLIGHTLY BY THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. HAVE 
LOWERED TEMPERATURES FROM GUIDANCE A COUPLE OF DEGREES DUE TO THE 
CLOUD COVER AND AIRMASS MOVING INTO THE AREA. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A 
COUPLE OF DEGREES BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THE EXTENDED.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL EXIT BY 
THIS AFTERNOON.  BAND OF LIGHT SNOW ENTERING THE AREA WILL PUSH 
THROUGH FAIRLY QUICKLY.  STILL LOOKS LIKE BEST CHANCES FOR SNOW 
ACCUMULATION WILL BE NORTH.  NOT CONFIDENT WE WILL GET MORE THAN AN 
INCH ANYWHERE...BUT WILL LEAVE ADVISORY IN PLACE ACROSS NORTHERN 
PLATEAU AND SW VA FOR NOW. SNOW MAY MIX WITH SOME RAIN BEFORE 
ENDING.  ONCE THE PRECIP EXITS...CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE WILL 
LINGER...SO EXPECT CLOUDS TO HANG AROUND FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE 
PERIOD.  WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON POSSIBILITY OF SOME 
DRIZZLE/FREEZING DRIZZLE ESPECIALLY NORTH TONIGHT...BUT PROBABILITY 
LOOKS ON THE LOW SIDE SO WILL KEEP OUT OF FORECAST FOR NOW. WILL 
GENERALLY UNDERCUT MAV MAX TEMPS A BIT TODAY GIVEN EXPECTED CLOUD 
COVER...WILL GO AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE FOR MINS TONIGHT.      

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...JUST AN ALL AROUND LOW 
CONFIDENCE FORECAST WITH MODELS INDICATING DIFFERING SOLUTIONS IN 
TERMS OF SYSTEM LOCATION...TIMING AND AMPLIFICATION. PAINTED SOME 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE KENTUCKY BORDER AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS FOR SUNDAY AS AN UPPER TROUGH 
PRESSES EAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY. DON'T EXPECT MUCH OUT OF THIS. 
ON MONDAY...THE GFS IS RADICALLY DIFFERENT WITH LITTLE HAPPENING 
WHILE THE ECM/CANADIAN AND WRF SHOW A NICE LITTLE WAVE PASSAGE WITH 
SOME ASSOCIATED DEEP MOISTURE. SUB-FREEZING OVERNIGHT THROUGH MONDAY 
MORNING TEMPERATURES WOULD ARGUE FOR SOME LIGHT SNOW IN THIS 
SCENARIO. KEPT AMOUNTS ON THE LIGHT SIDE DUE TO LOWERED CONFIDENCE 
WITH THIS SYSTEM. THE REST OF THE FORECAST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER 
WITH VARYING MODEL SOLUTIONS BUT IT APPEARS THAT THERE WILL BE AN 
ACTIVE SOUTHERN STREAM ON TUESDAY WITH A SURFACE WAVE THAT HAS 
GREATER IMPACT ON THE DEEP SOUTH INTO THE SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC COASTAL 
STATES. MODELS GENERALLY INDICATE MORE AMPLIFICATION WITH AN UPPER 
TROUGH PASSAGE ON WEDNESDAY WITH SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SHIFTING 
NORTHEAST FROM THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO AROUND 12Z WEDNESDAY TO 
THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC COAST BY 12Z THURSDAY. THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM WOULD 
TEND TO GENERATE SOME SNOWFALL ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA IN THE 
COLDER AIR PRESENT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH BUT DUE TO LOW CONFIDENCE 
KEPT POPS AROUND 40 PERCENT. MODEL SOLUTION DIVERGENCE CONTINUES 
WITH BRAVADO LATE IN THE PERIOD. STAYED CLOSEST TO THE ECMWF FOR 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WHICH ALLOW THE MID WEEK UPPER TROUGH TO MOVE 
OUT TO SEA FOLLOWED BY LESS AMPLIFICATION TO THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW 
AND THEREFORE LESS ACTION ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION AT 
THE END OF THE WORK WEEK.

A 140KT JET WILL MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS OVERNIGHT
ENHANCING FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING (850-700MB LEVEL) ACROSS THE
NORTHERN PLATEAU EASTWARD TO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. MODELS SHOW A

TEMPERATURE PROFILE DEFINITELY SUPPORTS SNOW WITH MOISTURE
EXTENDING INTO THE DENDRITIC SNOW GROWTH AREA.

MAIN LIMITATION IS MOISTURE. INITIALLY A GOOD DEAL OF VIRGA IS
EXPECTED...BUT MODEL SOUNDINGS DO SHOW THE BOUNDARY LAYER
MOISTENING. SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OF 1 TO 2 INCHES ARE EXPECTED IN THE
ADVISORY AREA. AREAS JUST SOUTH...WHICH INCLUDES KNOXVILLE AND THE

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
WE WILL BE IN A RATHER ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE
EXTENDED. SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...A MINOR TROUGH WITH A WEAK
SHORT WAVE MOVING THROUGH TO OUR NORTH MAY GENERATE A FEW ISOLATED
SHOWERS OVER FAR NORTHERN AREAS AND ACROSS HIGHER ELEVATIONS.
TEMPERATURES SATURDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING WILL BE COLD ENOUGH
FOR LIGHT SNOW AND MINOR SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OF A FEW TENTHS ARE
POSSIBLE. THE SNOW SHOULD TRANSITION OVER TO LIGHT RAIN SUNDAY
AFTERNOON.

SUNDAY NIGHT...A BOUNDARY TO OUR NORTH WILL BEGIN TO DROP SOUTH
INTO THE MRX CWA...SPREADING A BAND OF ISOLATED LIGHT PRECIP ACROSS
THE AREA. RAIN WILL SWITCH TO SNOW OVERNIGHT. THE BOUNDARY WILL
SLOWLY MOVE SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT PROVIDING
OUR BEST CHANCE OF PRECIP FOR THE EXTENDED. MONDAY MORNING
TEMPERATURES WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW BUT AS TEMPERATURES WARM
THROUGH THE DAY THIS WILL TRANSITION TO RAIN FOR THE
AFTERNOON...THEN SWITCH BECK TO SNOW MONDAY NIGHT AS TEMPERATURES
ONCE AGAIN FALL. MODELS DIVERGE THROUGH THE REST OF THE PERIOD AND

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...LOW CLOUDS OVER THE 
AREA SHOULD BREAK UP BEFORE NOON...BUT HIGH CLOUDS WILL BE MOVING IN 
AHEAD OF NEXT SHORT WAVE.  MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT WITH NEXT 
SHORT WAVE...BRINGING SOME LIGHT PRECIP FOR A BRIEF PERIOD 
ESPECIALLY NORTH LATE TONIGHT INTO EARLY FRIDAY.  PRECIP TYPE SHOULD 
BE PRIMARILY SNOW GIVEN THERMAL PROFILES...ALTHOUGH SOME RAIN MAY 
MIX IN TONIGHT SOUTH AND ALL AREAS SATURDAY BEFORE THE LIGHT PRECIP 
TAPERS OFF. SNOW AMOUNTS LOOK TO BE ON THE LIGHT SIDE WHERE ANY 
ACCUMULATION OCCURS...MAINLY NORTH.  WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS TONIGHT 
ALL ZONES EXCEPT LIKELY NORTHEAST...THEN LIKELY POPS FAR NORTH TO 
SLIGHT CHANCE FAR SOUTH EARLY SATURDAY.  NO SNOW ADVISORY AT THIS 
POINT...AS RIGHT NOW ACCUMULATIONS LOOK LIKE THEY WILL GENERALLY BE 
AROUND AN INCH OR LESS EVEN IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS NORTH.    

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...WENT WITH A BLEND OF 
THE GFS AND ECMWF FOR THIS PART OF THE FORECAST. AT LEAST A COUPLE 
SHORTER WAVELENGTH TROUGHS RIP RAPIDLY EAST ACROSS THE EASTERN 
STATES EARLY IN THE PERIOD WITH DEEPEST MOISTURE AND BETTER LIFTING 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. IN THE RATHER COLD AIR THAT WILL BE A COMMON 
FEATURE DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD...HAD TO MIX SOME SNOW IN AT 
TIMES...MAINLY DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AND IN THE MOUNTAINS. THE 
EARLY THROUGH MIDDLE PART OF THE WORK WEEK LOOKS INTERESTING WITH 
TEMPERATURES A FEW TO SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW NORMAL FOR EARLY 
FEBRUARY AND AN ENERGETIC SOUTHERN STREAM JET. THE MODELS BRING AN 
AMPLIFIED SHORT WAVE ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. DURING THIS 
TIMEFRAME WITH A POTENTIAL SURFACE LOW TRACK EMERGING FROM THE 
WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO TUESDAY ON ITS WAY INTO THE CAROLINAS AROUND 
THE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING PERIOD. OF COURSE 
THIS STORM TRACK WOULD RESULT IN MORE SNOW FOR THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION. AS ALWAYS...THIS IS AN EVENT THAT IS BEING 
MODELED SEVERAL DAYS PRIOR TO REALITY SO SYSTEM STRENGTH...TRACK AND 
POSITION OF TEMPERATURE GRADIENT WILL LIKELY BE CHANGING TO SOME 
DEGREE OR ANOTHER IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...
SATELLITE SHOWS A MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER LA/MS THIS 
AFTERNOON...AND MODELS SHOW THIS FEATURE TRACKING QUICKLY TO THE 
E-NE THROUGH THE EVENING. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER LIFT WILL BE 
ADEQUATE OVER OUR AREA TO OVERCOME DRY LOW LEVEL AIR. THE GFS IS 
MORE BULLISH ON PRECIP FOR OUR SW NC COUNTIES THAN THE NAM AND THE 
SREF. WILL KEEP MEASURABLE PRECIP OUT OF THE FORECAST FOR THAT AREA 
TONIGHT...BUT WILL MENTION SCATTERED SPRINKLES/FLURRIES THROUGH 
MIDNIGHT. 

THE JET STREAM REMAINS POSITIONED OVER KY/WV THROUGH FRIDAY...WHICH 
SHOULD KEEP SOME AMOUNT OF MID TO HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE AREA. THIS 
WILL MAKE FOR A TRICKY TEMPERATURE FORECAST. SINCE MOS GUIDANCE 
APPEARS TO BE A BIT TOO WARM LATELY...WILL LEAN TOWARD THE COOLER 
GFS MOS GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL QUICKLY MOVE NORTHEAST AS A SHORTWAVE MOVES
ACROSS THE AREA. PRECIP WILL START AS SNOW AND TRANSITION TO RAIN
THROUGH THE LATE MORNING SATURDAY AS TEMPERATURES SLOWLY CLIMB
ABOVE FREEZING. TEMPERATURES DROP BELOW FREEZING SUNDAY
MORNING...WITH THE RAIN TRANSITION BACK TO SNOW THROUGH THE REST OF
THE DAY. LIFT IS NOT IMPRESSIVE...BUT THE MOISTURE PROFILE WOULD
SUPPORT A COUPLE OF TENTHS OF AN INCH IN NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WITH
SLIGHTLY CLEARING SKIES SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. MONDAY LOOKS TO BE
DRY AS HIGH PRESSURE TRIES TO BUILD IN OVER THE OHIO VALLEY.

MODELS DISAGREE ON TIMING OF NEXT CHANCE OF PRECIP MOVING IN ON 
TUESDAY. WENT WITH MORE OF THE ECMWF...KEEPING PRECIP CHANCES IN 
FROM EARLY TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT FOR MOST OF THE 
AREA. SNOW WILL TRANSITION TO RAIN TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS THE 
TEMPERATURES WARM...AND TRANSITION BACK TO SNOW THROUGH THE NIGHT AS 
THE TEMPERATURES COOL. OVERALL TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE WEEK WILL BE 
NEAR NORMAL...WITH OVERCAST SKIES THROUGH THE REST OF THE WORK WEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A FAIRLY BENIGN FORECAST FOR
TODAY AND TONIGHT. A GOOD DEAL OF COLD AIR STRATO-CU ACROSS THE
REGION WITH FLURRIES OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. MODELS CONTINUE TO
SHOW SHALLOW DEPTH OF BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE DISSIPATING BY MID TO
LATE MORNING...SO FLURRIES WILL END THIS MORNING.

UPPER FLOW IS GENERALLY ZONAL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WITH A
SERIES OF FAST MOVING WAVES GOING ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES. A
FEW SPRINKLES OR FLURRIES IS POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING DUE 
WEAK/MODERATE ISENTROPIC LIFT. PRECIPITATION WILL BE COMING OUT OF
A MID-LEVEL DECK WITH A GOOD DEAL OF DRY BOUNDARY LAYER AIR.

GENERALLY MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS THROUGH THE PERIOD. FOLLOWED MOS
GUIDANCE CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND REVEAL A FAIRLY QUIET PATTERN 
UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE IS 
PROGGED TO SETTLE OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION ON FRIDAY... 
WITH ZONAL UPPER-LEVEL FLOW HELPING TO PRODUCE A TRANQUIL PATTERN 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. WITH A MID LEVEL INVERSION PROGGED TO BE 
LINGERING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON FRIDAY (LIMITING ANY VERTICAL 
MIXING) AND AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS...THINK THAT EXTENSIVE CLOUDS COULD BE OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
ON FRIDAY...SO WILL PLAN TO BE PESSIMISTIC WITH CLOUD COVER. THE 
UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS IS THEN 
PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON SATURDAY...WITH 
ANOTHER SHORT WAVE TROUGH QUICKLY MOVING IN BEHIND IT ON SUNDAY. THE 
GFS...CANADIAN...AND ECMWF MODELS ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT 
THESE TWO UPPER-LEVEL TROUGHS WILL PRODUCE ONLY LIGHT PRECIP OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS WEEKEND...WITH ANY LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
MOST LIKELY CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS THEN PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE 
NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO ON TUESDAY...AND THEN MOVE EASTWARD OVER 
THE SOUTHEAST ON WEDNESDAY. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS AGREE THAT 
THIS SYSTEM WILL BRING AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF PRECIP OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA BY TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...BUT THEY DISAGREE ON HOW COLD 
THE AIR MASS WILL BE OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THUS...THE WARMER ECMWF 
MODEL REVEALS MORE OF A RAIN EVENT...WHILE THE COOLER GFS MODEL 
INDICATES MORE POSSIBILITIES FOR SNOW...ESPECIALLY OVER THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. FOR NOW...WILL COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO 
MODELS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND COOLER THAN THE GFS 
NUMBERS THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK (WHICH IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH 
THE ENSEMBLE MEANS)...BUT WILL THEN TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS NUMBERS 
FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.

A COLD FRONT IS MOVING ACROSS THE AREA THIS MORNING...WITH
ADVECTION OF COLDER AND DRIER ARI TO FOLLOW THE FRONT THIS
AFTERNOON. THE 12Z OHX SOUNDING SHOWS PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
UPSTREAM...BUT WE ARE ALSO SEEING SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS IN THE
VALLEY FROM DOWNSLOPE WINDS OFF THE PLATEAU. THIS BALANCE OF CLOUD
COVER/COLD ADVECTION WILL MAKE FOR A DIFFICULT TEMPERATURE FORECAST
THIS AFTERNOON. WILL ADJUST TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY TO BRING THEM IN
LINE WITH THE LATEST GUIDANCE AND OBS...SHOWING A SLOW COOLING
TREND THROUGH THE DAY. WITH VERY DRY AIR ABOVE 850 MB IN THE 12Z
OHX SOUNDING...ACCUMULATING PRECIP SEEMS UNLIKELY THROUGH THE REST
OF THE DAY...AND WILL DROP POPS FROM THE FORECAST AND MENTION
ISOLATED SPRINKLES NORTH AND EAST.

332 AM EST WED FEB 5 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...REPORTS FROM COVE MOUNTAIN AND
CAMP CREEK..TENNESSEE SHOWED 60KT+ WIND GUSTS. MODELS SHOW THE
850MB JET MOVING EAST OF THE AREA BY 12Z...SO CURRENT TIMING OF
HIGH WIND WARNING LOOKS GOOD.

FRONTO-GENETIC BAND OF RAIN WILL EXIT THE AREA AROUND 12Z THIS
MORNING. COLD AIR ADVECTION IS EXPECTED TODAY WITH A GOOD DEAL OF
LOW-LEVEL CLOUDS. THE COLD AIR ADVECTION MAY SQUEEZE OUT SOME
ADDITIONAL DRIZZLE OR LIGHT SHOWERS TODAY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE
MOUNTAINS. FOR TONIGHT...WINDS BECOME NORTHWEST WITH WEAK
OROGRAPHIC LIFT INTO THE MOUNTAINS. BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE IS
QUITE SHALLOW...SO PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT.
TEMPERATURES ARE COLD ENOUGH FOR SOME SNOW SHOWERS OR
FLURRIES...BUT LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATION ANTICIPATED.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN FAIRLY GOOD 
AGREEMENT THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A LESS 
ACTIVE PATTERN COMPARED TO PREVIOUS RUNS. A LARGE DOME OF HIGH 
PRESSURE IS PROGGED TO SETTLE OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION 
FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...WITH ZONAL UPPER-LEVEL FLOW HELPING TO 
PRODUCE A TRANQUIL PATTERN OVER THE FORECAST AREA. WITH A MID LEVEL 
INVERSION EXPECTED TO LINGER OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON THURSDAY 
AND FRIDAY...THINK THAT CLOUDS WILL LIKELY LINGER DUE TO A LACK OF 
VERTICAL MIXING. THUS...WILL PLAN TO BE PESSIMISTIC WITH CLOUD COVER 
THROUGH THIS PERIOD. A SHORT WAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS THEN PROGGED 
TO SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...AS 
A COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT. GFS... 
CANADIAN...AND ECMWF MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THIS SYSTEM 
WILL BE WEAKER AND WITH LESS MOISTURE (COMPARED TO PREVIOUS MODEL 
RUNS). A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OFF THE GA AND 
SC COASTS ON SATURDAY...BUT THE MODELS INDICATE THAT IT WILL REMAIN 
FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR ONLY LIGHT PRECIP 
TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA OVER THE WEEKEND. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
GENERALLY TREND COOLER THAN THE GFS NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...WHICH IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

RAIN SHOWERS...CURRENTLY OVER MIDDLE TN...WILL CONTINUE TO PROGRESS 
EASTWARD AND EVENTUALLY MOVE THROUGH OUR CWA OVERNIGHT AND INTO 
TOMORROW MORNING. SHOWERS SHOULD DECREASE IN INTENSITY THE FURTHER

NORTHERN VALLEY WILL CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING WITH MILD TEMPS AND
DRY CONDITIONS. BUT BATTLING FROM THE OTHER DIRECTION IS
APPROACHING COLD FRONT AND ASSOCIATED RAIN SHIELD /AND AN ISOLATED
TSTM OR TWO/. THINK THE BEST RAINFALL WILL BE OVER THE PLATEAU WITH
LESSER AMOUNTS ELSEWHERE. RAIN WILL EVEN OVERTAKE THE NORTHERN
VALLEY OVERNIGHT BUT THIS WILL HOPEFULLY BE WHERE THE LEAST RAIN
FALLS...GIVEN THE CONTINUED RISES ON THE CLINCH AND POWELL RIVERS FROM

SHOWERS CONTINUE WEDNESDAY NIGHT. LARGE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
SETTLES INTO THE OH VALLEY THROUGH FRIDAY WITH RIDGING INTO THE TN 
VALLEY AND THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. TRENDING SLIGHTLY COOLER AND 
DRY THROUGH END OF WORK WEEK. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE LATER FRIDAY AS
LOW LEVEL ISENTROPIC LIFT GETS UNDERWAY. LIGHT PRECIPITATION WILL 
COMMENCE OVERNIGHT INTO SATURDAY. LIGHT SNOW CHANGING TO MORE 
WIDESPREAD RAIN BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. PATTERN REMAINS MUDDLED 
THROUGH EARLY SUNDAY. SHORT WAVE MOVING THROUGH TN VALLEY SUNDAY 
MORNING. ECMWF/CMC FASTER AND MORE SHEARED THAN GFS. SURFACE LOW

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY ALONG THE NORTHERN GULF COAST... 
WITH AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDING NORTH OF IT ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. CURRENT OBS FROM THE CROSSVILLE AND 
LONESOME PINE AIRPORTS ARE REPORTING FREEZING DENSE FOG THIS 
MORNING...SO HAVE ISSUED A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT TO MENTION THE 
POSSIBILITY OF BLACK ICE ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU/MOUNTAINS. 
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN SHOWING AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS DEVELOPING A SURFACE LOW OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER 
VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS THEN PROGGED TO 
MOVE NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY THIS EVENING...WITH 
ITS ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT TRIGGERING SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA BEGINNING THIS AFTERNOON. MODELS INDICATE A BRIEF LULL 
IN SHOWER ACTIVITY OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...BEFORE THE 
MAIN AREA OF SHOWERS ALONG THE LOW PRESSURE AREA AND ITS ASSOCIATED 
COLD FRONT MOVE INTO FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS 
INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY AFTER MIDNIGHT 
OVER THE SOUTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA...SO WILL MENTION 
THE POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED TSTORMS AFTER MIDNIGHT IN THESE AREAS.

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A VERY STRONG (BETWEEN 60 AND 70 
KT) 850 MB JET WILL DEVELOP NORTHWEST OF THE MOUNTAINS BY LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND INTO TONIGHT. WITH A STABLE LAYER EXTENDING ABOVE THE 
MOUNTAINS (UP TO AROUND 700 MB)...SOUTHERLY WINDS ORIENTED 
PERPENDICULAR TO THE MOUNTAINS...AND A VEERING VERTICAL WIND PROFILE 
THAT INCREASES WITH HEIGHT...IT APPEARS THAT A HIGH END MOUNTAIN 
WAVE EVENT WILL BE POSSIBLE LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND INTO TONIGHT 
ALONG THE FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. THUS...WILL 
UPGRADE THE HIGH WIND WATCH TO A WARNING DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF 
WIND GUSTS IN EXCESS OF 60 MPH ALONG THE FOOTHILLS (AND POSSIBLY UP 
TO 100 MPH AT THE COVE MTN OBS SITE). AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT 
WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...THERE ARE STILL FAIRLY LARGE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS...ESPECIALLY FOR FRIDAY 
THROUGH SUNDAY. DUE TO THE LARGE DIFFERENCES IN TIMING AND STRENGTH 
OF THE WEEKEND SYSTEM...CONFIDENCE IS LOW. HOWEVER...DUE TO NCEP 
DISCUSSION AND HANDLING OF ENSEMBLE MODELS...WILL TREND CLOSER TO 
THE ECMWF SOLUTION...WHICH BRINGS CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION SOONER.

FOR WEDNESDAY...STRONG SYSTEM HAS MOVED NORTHEAST OF THE AREA WITH 
COLD AIR ADVECTION AND NORTHWEST FLOW PRODUCING OROGRAPHIC 
PRECIPITATION FOR THE MOUNTAINS. HIGHS WILL LIKELY BE IN THE 
MORNING...THEN DROP IN THE AFTERNOON.

UPPER FLOW REMAINS WEST TO SOUTHWEST FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK 
WITH MOISTURE RETURNING TO THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. A 
QUICK MOVING UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. CYCLOGENESIS WILL DEVELOP JUST OFF THE 
CAROLINAS WITH NORTHERLY PULLING COLDER AIR INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. PRECIPITATION WILL CHANGE TO SNOW SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
CONTINUE THROUGH PARTS OF SUNDAY. AGAIN...THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF 
QUESTION IN REGARD TO HOW STRONG THE UPPER TROUGH WILL BE AND 
ASSOCIATED CYCLOGENESIS...AND TRACK OF LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM.

HOWEVER...SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE AREA-WIDE WITH SIGNIFICANT 
SNOWFALL ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS. WILL INCLUDE IN THE HWO.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...QUIET NIGHT TONIGHT WILL
GIVE WAY TO THE NEXT APPROACHING WEATHER SYSTEM TUESDAY. RAIN WILL
MOVE INTO THE WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA DURING TUESDAY MORNING
AND INCREASE IN COVERAGE DURING THE AFTERNOON. BY TUESDAY NIGHT
RAIN CHANCES ARE CATEGORICAL. SOME OF THE RAIN MAY EXCEED AN INCH
OR TWO ESPECIALLY OVER THE WESTERN AREAS LIKE THE PLATEAU. WITH
RIVERS ALREADY UP FROM LAST NIGHT/S RAIN...MAY SEE A FEW RIVER
FORECAST POINTS GO ABOVE FLOOD...BUT THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE
TIME OF YEAR AND HAS LIMITED IMPACTS. NOT CONFIDENT OF THE NEED FOR
ANY GENERAL FLASH FLOOD WATCH AND WILL NOT GO THAT DIRECTION.
NOW...A MOUNTAIN WAVE WIND EVENT IS POSSIBLE FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON
AND NIGHT...AND HIGH WIND WATCH HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THAT. THOSE
SOUTHERLY DOWNSLOPING WINDS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PLAY GAMES WITH
MAX TEMPS AND POPS IN THE VALLEY TOMORROW...SO BE AWARE. WE FIND
OURSELVES ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE SYSTEM WEDNESDAY WITH NW FLOW
TYPE OF SCATTERED LIGHT PRECIP.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
ELONGATED AREA OF LOW PRESSURE STRETCHING ALONG THE SPINE OF THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH NEAR FREEZING TEMPS APPROACHING THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS. SO FAR...TEMPS ALONG 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU/MOUNTAINS HAVE REMAINED JUST ABOVE FREEZING 
THIS MORNING...BUT FREEZING TEMPS ARE CURRENTLY BEING REPORTED OVER 
MOST OF EASTERN KY. THUS...WILL CONTINUE THE WINTER WX ADVISORY 
ACROSS THESE AREAS THIS MORNING FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF ICE 
ACCUMULATIONS FROM FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET. MODEL SOUNDINGS STILL 
INDICATE A VERTICAL TEMP PROFILE SUPPORTIVE OF SLEET AND FREEZING 
RAIN...WITH A WARM ABOVE-FREEZING LAYER LINGERING AROUND 800 MB. 
CURRENT OBS AT CROSSVILLE AND LONESOME PINE AIRPORTS ARE REPORTING 
RAIN...SO THINK THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE THE POSSIBILITY OF LIGHT ICE 
ACCUMULATIONS. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT PRECIPITATION WILL 
END OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY THIS AFTERNOON...AS THE LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM MOVES EASTWARD OUT OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY 
AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL 
IMPACT THE REGION MIDWEEK...BRINGING GOOD CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION 
TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...AND SOME COLDER AIR BY WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON AS ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA. SOME 
LIGHT WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS DURING THE MORNING ON TUESDAY WILL 
INCREASE IN COVERAGE BY THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS LIFT INCREASES 
FROM A 60-70 KT 850 MB JET OVER MIDDLE/EAST TENNESSEE. THE BEST 
OPPORTUNITY FOR PRECIPITATION AND PERHAPS SOME LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL LOOKS TO BE TUESDAY EVENING THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING 
AS A PREFRONTAL TROUGH MOVES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. SOME 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS MAY ALSO BE POSSIBLE WITH THIS ACTIVITY GIVEN 
THE STRONG DYNAMICS...BUT THE BEST INSTABILITY WILL BE DISPLACED TO 
THE WEST OF THE AREA SO THINK SHOWERS WILL BE THE DOMINANT 
PRECIPITATION MODE. ANOTHER BIGGER CONCERN FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON/ 
EVENING WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR MOUNTAIN WAVES ALONG THE SMOKY 
MOUNTAIN FOOTHILLS GIVEN THE STRONG JET TO THE NORTHWEST AND THE 
STOUT SOUTHEAST FLOW AHEAD OF THE FRONT. WILL MAKE A MENTION OF THIS 
IN THE HWO DUE TO GUSTY CONDITIONS EXPECTED IN THE VALLEYS AND THE 
STRONG WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS DURING THIS TIME PERIOD.
 
BY LATE WEDNESDAY MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON...COLDER AIR WILL MOVE 
INTO THE AREA AS A COLD FRONT WILL MAKE IT THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA...CLEARING THE EASTERN ZONES BY 00Z THURSDAY. THE REMAINING 
WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE TROUGH AND THE STRONG 
NORTHWEST FLOW WILL HELP TO GENERATE SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS 
THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...WHICH MAY 
PRODUCE SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN BY THE LATE 
EVENING.  

ANOTHER SHORT-LIVED PERIOD OF CALM AND DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED 
FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY BEFORE THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM MOVES 
INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. LATE THIS WEEK. THERE ARE STILL SOME 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODELS ON THE TRACK AND TIMING OF THIS 
SYSTEM. THE ECMWF IS A LITTLE MORE PROGRESSIVE AND SHOWS A WARMER 
SOLUTION...INDICATING A MAINLY LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN EVENT. THE GFS 
INDICATES THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL BUT ALSO 
HINTS AT THE UPPER-LOW TRACKING FURTHER SOUTH. THIS WOULD PROMOTE 
SOME COLDER AIR WORKING ITS WAY INTO THE AREA AS THE BASE OF THE 
TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH...CREATING SOME WINTER WEATHER CONCERNS 
SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. GIVEN THE HIGH VARIABILITY IN THE 
MODELS...CONFIDENCE IS NOT TERRIBLY HIGH ON THE EVOLUTION OF THIS 
SYSTEM ATTM. HOWEVER...THERE IS GOOD CONSENSUS FOR PRECIPITATION 
OCCURRING THIS WEEKEND SO HAVE INCREASED POPS TO MODERATE TO HIGH 
CHANCE LEVELS THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MORE INTERESTING SYSTEM
WILL BE AFFECTING THE REGION TONGIHT AND MONDAY...WITH THE SURFACE
LOW PRESSURE CENTER OVER CENTRAL MS EXPECTED TO TRACK NE TO JUST SW
OF CHA BY 06Z MONDAY...THEN TO THE CAROLINAS BY MID MORNING MONDAY. 
MODELS AGREE ON INCREASING FRONTOGENTICAL FORCING OVERNIGHT WITH
OPF AMOUNTS INDICATING MODERATE TO LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS BRIEFLY.

NOW...WHAT ABOUT THE FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET POTENTIAL? STILL A
POSSIBILITY BUT REALLY LIMITED TO THE FAR NRN FRINGES...ALONG THE
NRN MOST PLATEAU COUNTIES INTO LEE AND WISE COUNTIES OF SW VA.
SOUNDINGS REMAIN MUCH TOO WARM FOR ANY SNOW...AND ALSO THE COLDER
AIR SEEMS DELAYED A FEW HOURS. THUS...OPTED TO KEEP THE ADVISORY
INTACT AS ISSUED EARLIER TODAY...BUT DELAYED THE ONSET OF ANY
WINTRY MIX BY A FEW HOURS OR SO. THE STRONGER LIFT EQUATES TO
HEAVIER RAINS WHICH COULD BRING THE WARMER AIR ALOFT TO THE
SURFACE. THIS LEAVES JUST A FEW SPOTS THAT DROP BELOW 32 DEGREES
...SUCH AS SHELTERED VALLEYS OF WISE COUNTY VA. BASED ON THESE
CHANGES I LOWERED THE ICE AMOUNTS TO BETWEEN A FEW HUNDREDTHS AND
1/10TH OF AN INCH IN THE ADVISORY AREA.

RAIN SHOULD GENERALLY BE GONE BY MONDAY AFTERNOON...SO LEFT THE
AFTERNOON GRIDS DRY FOR NOW. THAT DRY PERIOD IS REALLY SHORTLIVED
AS LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS AGAIN OVER THE LOWER MS VALLEY REGION ON
TUESDAY. SHOWERS SPREAD QUICKLY NE ON TUESDAY WITH LIKELY TO
CATEGORICAL POPS NEEDED AT THAT TIME. IF RAIN IS DELAYED ENOUGH ON
MONDAY NIGHT THEN SOME PATCHY FOG...LOCALLY DENSE...IS POSSIBLE IN
THE FAVORED VALLEY SPOTS.

FOR TEMPS...MOS MINS WERE GENERALLY CLOSE EACH NIGHT AND FOLLOWED
SOMEWHAT. MOS MAX TEMPS HAVE BEEN OFF A GOOD BIT OVER THE PAST
COUPLE OF DAYS...AND LOOKED JUST A BIT TOO WARM FOR MONDAY. FOR
TUESDAY IT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW FAST CLOUDS INCREASE AND SHOWERS
DEVELOP. I WENT BELOW GUIDANCE IN SRN AND PLATEAU AREAS...BUT ABOVE
GUIDANCE FOR TRI WHERE DOWNSLOPE LOW LEVEL WINDS WERE INDICATED.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...DEEP MOISTURE AND SOME 
SHORT WAVE LIFTING WITH DEPARTING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TUESDAY NIGHT 
INTO WEDNESDAY KEEPS THE CHANCE FOR RAIN ALIVE DURING THIS PERIOD. 
HOWEVER...THE RAIN WILL BE TAPERING OFF THROUGH THE DAY. COLD 
NORTHWEST FLOW AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE COULD LEAD TO A FEW LIGHT 
FLURRIES OR SNOW SHOWERS IN THE SW VA MOUNTAINS AND TN/NC BORDER 
REGION THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING BEFORE ENDING. THE FORECAST STILL 
ALLOWS FOR A TWENTY FOUR HOUR DRY PERIOD FOR THE ENTIRE AREA ON 
THURSDAY. POPS SLOWLY CRANK UP AGAIN FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE 
SOUTHERN STREAM BECOMES ACTIVE WITH SHORT WAVE ENERGY INDUCING 
LOWERING PRESSURES FROM THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO NORTHEAST INTO 
THE MID SOUTH. A STRENGTHENING SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT AND 
SOUTHERLY COMPONENT OFF THE GULF SHOULD STEADILY MOISTEN THE LOCAL 
ATMOSPHERE TO GENERATE SOME LIGHT RAIN FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. 
FORECAST DETAIL CONCERNING THE EXACT TRACK OF SYSTEMS AND 
TEMPERATURE STRUCTURE THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN IS LACKING AT 
THIS TIME RANGE AND THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEKEND BUT THERE IS THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A MIXED BAG OF WINTERY PRECIP FRIDAY MORNING BEFORE 
THE LOW LEVEL AIRMASS WARMS ABOVE FREEZING AND AGAIN FRIDAY NIGHT 
WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SUB-FREEZING SURFACE TEMPERATURES. BASICALLY 
STAYED WITH THE OLD BROAD BRUSHED APPROACH CONCERNING CLOUD 
COVER...POP AND EVEN TEMPERATURE HERE. THUS...THE THREAT FOR WINTERY 
PRECIP IN THE FORECAST. THE GFS AND ECMWF START OUT SOMEWHAT ON THE 
SAME PAGE FOR THE WEEKEND BUT THE ECM IS FASTER AND LESS AMPLIFIED 
WITH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY'S SYSTEM PROGRESSION ACROSS THE EASTERN 
U.S. WENT WITH THE FASTER ECM IDEA WHICH LEADS TO INCREASING CHANCE 
FOR RAIN SATURDAY INTO SATURDAY NIGHT WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
TRACKING NORTHEAST OUT OF THE WESTERN GULF ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. 
WITH TEMPERATURES DROPPING OFF BEHIND THE PRESSURE SYSTEM'S COLD 
FRONT SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...RAIN WOULD BE CHANGING TO SNOW 
DURING THIS PERIOD. KEPT A BIT OF SNOW MIXED WITH RAIN ON SUNDAY 
INTO THE WRAP AROUND NORTHWEST FLOW BEHIND THE DEPARTING STORM 
SYSTEM.

.DISCUSSION...THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT HAS PASSED EAST OF A 
BOWLING GREEN KY TO NASHVILLE TN TO MUSCLE SHOALS AL LINE PER 14Z 
SURFACE MAP. SEEING MAINLY LIGHT SHOWERS AT THIS POINT...JUST NOW 
STARTING TO ENTER WRN MOST COUNTIES OF OUR FORECAST AREA. COVERAGE 
DOES NOT APPEAR TO WARRANT ANY HIGHER THAN 60 TO 70 PERCENT...SO
LITTLE CHANGES PLANNED FOR REST OF THE FIRST PERIOD GRIDS. WILL 
CHECK HOURLY GRIDS AND MAKE A FEW TWEAKS AS NEEDED...SUCH AS MAX 
TEMPS WHICH MAY BE OFF A BIT DUE TO SOME PATCHY FOG AND LOW CLOUDS 
AND THE ONSET OF SHOWERS SHORTLY. 

RAIN LOOKS TO BE MODERATE OR HEAVIER THIS EVENING AS A SURFACE LOW 
DEVELOPS ALONG THE COLD FRONT...AROUND NRN AL THEN TRACKS NE TO THE 
CAROLINAS BY MONDAY MORNING. 

WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY LOOKS GOOD AS ISSUED FOR BOTH TIMING AND 
AREAL COVERAGE. MODEL SOUNDINGS ONLY SUPPORT RAIN CHANGING BRIEFLY 
TO LIGHT FREEZING RAIN OR SLEET IN THE ADVISORY AREA...NO SNOW. THE 
WINTRY PRECIPITATION (PCPN) SHOULD BE LIMITED TO SHELTERED VALLEYS 
WHERE COLD AIR IS MORE LIKELY TO BE TRAPPED. MOS GUIDANCE HAS 
STEADILY FORECAST A LOW AT LONESOME PINE (WISE CO) AROUND 32 TO 33 
DEGREES...SO ICE ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE SPOTTY AND STAY 1/10TH OF 
AN INCH OR LESS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
A COLD FRONT OVER THE WESTERN TN RIVER VALLEY...WITH TEMPS AND 
DEWPOINTS SLOWLY RISING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS COLD FRONT IS 
PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON... 
WITH MOST OF ITS ASSOCIATED RAIN OCCURRING BEHIND THE FRONT. THUS... 
IT APPEARS THAT THE BULK OF THE RAINFALL WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU/CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS BY LATE AFTERNOON...WITH THE 
REST OF THE FORECAST AREA RECEIVING THE BULK OF THE RAINFALL 
TONIGHT. MODELS HAVE COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE EASTWARD 
EXTENT OF SOME LOW-LEVEL SUB-FREEZING AIR LATER TONIGHT...WITH MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATING A VERTICAL TEMP PROFILE SUPPORTIVE OF SLEET AND 
FREEZING RAIN DUE TO A WARM ABOVE-FREEZING LAYER LINGERING AROUND 
800 MB. WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A WINTER WX ADVISORY 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THE CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS 
OF SOUTHWEST VA FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF ICE ACCUMULATIONS BETWEEN 
MIDNIGHT TONIGHT AND NOON ON MONDAY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT THIS SUB-FREEZING LOW-LEVEL AIR WILL NOT PROGRESS MUCH FARTHER 
EAST THAN THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU/MOUNTAINS...WITH TEMPS REMAINING IN 
THE MID 30S TO LOWER 40S OVER THE GREAT TN VALLEY. AN AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHEASTWARD FROM THE DEEP SOUTH UP 
ALONG THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY ON MONDAY MORNING...BUT THIS LOW SHOULD 
STAY EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH PRECIP ENDING OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES FOR TODAY...AND WILL GENERALLY 
TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO. THESE GFS AND NAM 
NUMBERS ARE IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TONIGHT AND MONDAY...AND 
LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A BRIEF BOUT OF 
SUBTROPICAL RIDGING MONDAY NIGHT WILL PROMOTE MOSTLY DRY CONDITIONS 
AS A SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ADVECTS GULF MOISTURE INTO THE REGION TO SET 
THE STAGE FOR A WETTER PERIOD TUESDAY AND ESPECIALLY TUESDAY NIGHT. 
SHOWERS DURING THE DAY ON TUESDAY SHOULD BE GENERALLY LIGHT AND 
SCATTERED IN NATURE FOR THE MOST PART AS THEY MOVE IN FROM THE 
SOUTH...BUT THEY WILL BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD BY THE AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING AS AN UPPER-TROUGH AND COLD FRONT APPROACH FROM THE WEST. 
THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR PRECIPITATION AND PERHAPS SOME LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAINFALL LOOKS TO BE TUESDAY EVENING THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH. IN WAKE OF THE FRONT...COLDER 
AIR WILL MOVE IN COMBINE WITH SOME WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ON THE 
BACKSIDE OF THE TROUGH TO GENERATE SOME LIGHT NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA...WHICH MAY PRODUCE SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. 

ANOTHER SHORT-LIVED PERIOD OF CALM AND DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED 
FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...BEFORE THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM 
MOVES INTO THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON FRIDAY AND EVENTUALLY THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY BY SATURDAY. ATTM...THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN THE MODELS ON THE TIMING OF THE ONSET OF PRECIPITATION /WITH 
THE ECMWF BEING A LITTLE FASTER/. HOWEVER...BOTH MODELS INDICATE THE 
POTENTIAL FOR SOME APPRECIABLE RAINFALL SATURDAY AND SATURDAY 
NIGHT...SO HAVE BUMPED POPS UP TO SOLID CHANCE IN THIS PERIOD. 
DEPENDING ON THE TIMING/TRACK OF THIS SYSTEM...THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SOME WINTERY PRECIPITATION MAY ALSO EXIST AS WELL.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...CLOUDS WILL INCREASE TONIGHT 
WITH CLEAR SKIES LONG ENOUGH IN MANY LOCATIONS...TO ALLOW PATCHY 
AREAS OF FOG AND LOW CLOUDS TO DEVELOP. LOW TEMPS ABOVE FREEZING 
TONIGHT FOR A CHANGE SHOULD CAUSE THE BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE TO BE 
TAPPED INTO FOR THE FOG DEVELOPMENT. OTHERWISE...MODELS SLOWING DOWN 
THE LIGHT RAIN AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT...SO I LOWERED POPS 
CONSIDERABLY FOR EARLY TONIGHT AND KEPT POPS ONLY 20 TO 30 PERCENT 
CHANCE FOR LATE TONIGHT.

SHOWERS SHOULD DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT SUNDAY...AND EASILY 
SPREAD INTO WESTERN AREAS BY THE AFTERNOON. QUESTIONABLE IF RAIN 
REACHES FAR NE TN AND SW VA SECTIONS BEFORE 7PM SUNDAY...WITH 
WETTEST PERIOD TO BE SUNDAY NIGHT UP TO ABOUT 16Z MONDAY. PUSHED 
POPS UP NEAR 100 PERCENT FOR SUNDAY NIGHT. 

12Z MODELS VERY CONSISTENT IN LIMITING ANY WINTRY PRECIPITATION 
(PCPN) TO NRN MOST PLATEAU COUNTIES TO LEE/WISE AND RUSSELL COUNTIES 
OF SW VA...MAINLY LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY MORNING (ABOUT 6 
HOURS OR SO). WINTER WEATHER DESK GRAPHICS NOW REFLECT THIS THINKING 
WITH A MUCH LESSER THREAT OF ANY SIGNIFICANT ICING OR SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS IN THESE AREAS. THUS...PER COORDINATION...NO NEED FOR 
A WINTER STORM WATCH AT THIS TIME...BUT WILL FRESHEN OUR HAZARDOUS 
WEATHER PRODUCT. 

MOS TEMPS SIMILAR AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED THROUGH THESE PERIODS
WITH MAX TEMPS MORE CHALLENGING THAN MIN TEMPS. LOW CLOUDS AHEAD OF 
THE SHOWERS ON SUNDAY SHOULD KEEP CHA COOLER THAN AREAS TO THE NE 
SUCH AS TRI. RAIN TAPERS OFF FROM THE WEST MONDAY WITH AT LEAST 
PARTIAL CLEARING IN THE AFTERNOON...BUT I FAVORED THE SLIGHTLY 
COOLER NAM MOS FOR HIGHS ON MONDAY.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A COUPLE SYSTEMS AFFECT 
THE REGION DURING THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. THE FIRST SHORT WAVE 
SWINGS NORTHEAST OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON TUESDAY WITH WARM AND 
MOIST AIR RETURNING AND A SURFACE WAVE SHIFTING FROM THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY EARLY ON TUESDAY ON ITS WAY ACROSS THE CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS BY 12Z WEDNESDAY. RAIN BUILDS IN DURING THE DAY TUESDAY 
WITH THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE TUESDAY NIGHT IN THE 
BETTER LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM COLD FRONT. IN THE STILL 
MOIST ENVIRONMENT BEHIND THE FRONT THERE COULD BE A FEW SHOWERS 
AROUND DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY AND AN UPSLOPE COMPONENT COULD LEAD 
TO A FEW OROGRAPHIC SHOWERS WEDNESDAY EVENING. THE RAIN MAY CHANGE 
TO SOME LIGHT SNOW IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN BEFORE WRAPPING UP AROUND 
MIDNIGHT. THE FORECAST AREA GETS TO ENJOY A DRY TWENTY FOUR HOUR 
PERIOD ON THURSDAY BUT ANOTHER LONG WAVE TROUGH WILL BE AMPLIFYING 
ACROSS THE WESTERN STATES AND SOME SHORTWAVE ENERGY AND 
STRENGTHENING ISENTROPIC LIFT SHOULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
PRECIPITATION ON FRIDAY. WARM AND MOIST AIR STREAMING IN OVER THE 
COLD LOWER LEVEL AIRMASS COULD ALLOW FOR A MIXED BAG OF WINTERY 
PRECIPITATION THROUGH AT LEAST EARLY AFTERNOON FOR MOST AREAS UNTIL 
SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL WARMING TAKES PLACE. FRIDAY NIGHT IS IN 
QUESTION CONCERNING SURFACE TEMPERATURES SO HAD TO MIX SOME MORE 
WINTER TIME PRECIP INTO THE EQUATION AT THIS TIME BUT IF THE 
SOUTHERLY FLOW AHEAD OF A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ACROSS THE 
PLAINS IS STRONG ENOUGH THIS WON'T BE AN ISSUE BECAUSE THE PRECIP 
WILL ENTIRELY LIQUID. BOTH THE ECMWF AND THE GFS INDICATE A MID 
LATITUDE CYCLONE TRACK WELL WEST OF THE VIEWING AREA ON SATURDAY SO 
WELL ABOVE FREEZING TEMPERATURES APPEAR TO BE IN STORE AND THUS RAIN 
RATHER THAN SNOW FOR DAY SEVEN.

FOR THE WINTRY SYSTEM SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...WAITING FOR THE 12Z 
DATA TO ARRIVE TO COMPARE TO 06Z RUNS. 06Z RUNS OF GENERALLY BOTH

MID WEST. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE TOWARDS 
THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...WITH SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF IT 
PRODUCING AN INCREASE CLOUDS OVER THE FORECAST AREA AND A CHANCE OF 
RAIN MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS WILL INCREASE OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA TODAY AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT...WHICH WILL HELP 
TO PRODUCE ANOTHER WARM DAY WITH TEMPS ACTUALLY RISING FIVE TO TEN 
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES FOR TODAY...AND WILL GENERALLY TREND 
TOWARDS THE WARMER GFS NUMBERS SINCE THEY VERIFIED BETTER YESTERDAY. 
GFS AND NAM NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TONIGHT...AND LOOK 
REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AN ACTIVE PATTERN IS EXPECTED 
FOR THE WEEK AHEAD...WITH SEVERAL SHORTWAVE TROUGHS OF LOW PRESSURE 
SCOOTING THROUGH THE REGION...AND BRINGING A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR 
PRECIPITATION DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.

TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING...SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO 
ADVECT WARMER AIR AND GULF MOISTURE INTO THE FORECAST AREA. AREAS OF 
RAIN SHOWERS WILL OVERSPREAD THE AREA FROM WEST TO EAST THROUGHOUT 
THE DAY ON SUNDAY. THEN BY MIDDAY...A COLD FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH

CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN COVERAGE AHEAD OF THE MAIN TROUGH WHICH IS 
PROGGED TO MOVE AROUND 12-15Z MONDAY MORNING. WITH COLDER AIR 
FILTERING INTO THE AREA...A CHANGEOVER TO SOME SNOW AND/OR FREEZING 
RAIN/SLEET WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THE 
CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS OF ALONG THE KENTUCKY/TENNESSEE BORDER AND IN 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA LATE SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING. THERE ARE 
SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODELS REGARDING THE DEPTH OF THE COLD 
AIR. THE NAM SOUNDING IS INDICATING A COLDER ATMOSPHERE WHICH WOULD 
PROMOTE ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL. THE GFS SHOWS A WARMER LAYER OF ABOVE 
FREEZING AIR ALOFT...INDICATING A HIGHER POTENTIAL OF SOME SLEET AND 
FREEZING RAIN TO OCCUR ALONG WITH SOME SNOW IN THESE AREAS. GIVEN 
THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE EXACT DETAILS AND THE LOCALIZED NATURE OF 
THIS ACTIVITY...HAVE HELD OFF ON A WATCH FOR NOW AS SNOWFALL AND ICE 
ACCUMULATION PROJECTIONS FOR NOW FALL WITHIN ADVISORY CRITERIA. THIS 
WINTERY ACTIVITY IS ONLY EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE AFOREMENTIONED 
NORTHERN CWA AREAS AS LOCATIONS ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND THE 
EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS WILL BE IN WARMER AIR FOR THE 
DURATION OF THE EVENT BEFORE THE PRECIPITATION TAPERS OFF BY THE 
LATE MORNING AND AFTERNOON.

A SECOND SHORTWAVE WILL BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF WIDESPREAD SHOWERS 
INTO THE REGION TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT...PROVIDING ANOTHER 
OPPORTUNITY FOR WIDESPREAD RAINFALL ACCUMULATIONS. THEN BY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING...A CHANGEOVER TO SOME LIGHT NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW SHOWERS 
WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG THE EAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AS COLDER AIR FILTERS IN AND COMBINES WITH 
SOME WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE TROUGH. A BRIEF 
BOUT OF DRIER AND WARMER WEATHER IS EXPECTED ON THURSDAY AS SOME

RAIN SHOWERS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME WINTERY PRECIPITATION AS 
WELL.

328 PM EST FRI JAN 31 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...LOW CLOUD DECK FROM 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WESTWARD HAS BEEN ERODING SLIGHTLY ON THE EASTERN 
PERIPHERY THIS AFTERNOON...BUT COULD SPREAD EAST INTO AT LEAST OUR 
PLATEAU AND SE TN COUNTIES EARLY TONIGHT. EXPECTING HIGH CLOUDS ALSO 
IN THE ZONAL FLOW ALOFT...SO WILL RUN PARTLY CLOUDY ACROSS THE BOARD 
FOR TONIGHT. GFS MOS MINS WERE 3 TO 5 DEGREES TOO COLD FOR FRIDAY 
MORNING LOWS...SO I BLENDED THE MINOR DIFFERENCES OUT FOR TONIGHT.
DID FAVOR THE MILDER NAM MOS MINS WHERE CLOUDS OR LIGHT SOUTH WINDS 
ARE FACTORS TO CONSIDER. 

SATURDAY STILL SHAPING UP TO BE A NICE MILD AND DRY DAY...AND I 
CHOSE TO DROP POPS FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON IN THE WEST. RAIN CHANCES 
FOR SATURDAY NIGHT NOT WORTH MORE THAN CHANCE POPS...WITH NO CHANGES 
MADE TO PREVIOUS POP/WX GRIDS FOR NOW. SHOWERS SPREAD ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA SUNDAY WITH AND JUST AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. SOME 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE LATEST GFS AND NAM MODEL RUNS...ON 1) HOW 
STRONG THE COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL BE ACROSS THE NRN 1/3 OF THE 
FORECAST AREA LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON...AND 2) HOW MUCH LIGHT SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS MAY OCCUR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. NOT ABLE TO HIT 
THE SNOW MUCH JUST YET THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON...GIVEN THE WARMER 
SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND THE FACT THAT THE TOP OF THE SATURATED 
COLUMN WON'T FAVOR SNOW/ICE CRSYTAL GROWTH UNTIL SUNDAY EVENING. 

WINTER WEATHER DESK PROGS SHOW SOME ICE POTENTIAL FROM 12Z SUNDAY TO 
12Z MONDAY...BUT MODEL SOUNDINGS LOOK MORE SUPPORTIVE OF RAIN...THEN 
A MIX WITH SLEET...AND FINALLY A CHANGE TO LIGHT SNOW FOR MAINLY NRN 
AREAS. GFS MODEL KEEPS SURGING WARM AIR NORTHWARD INTO SE TN AND SW 
NC...WHICH GIVES LOW CONFIDENCE FOR ANY WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY 
CRITERIA BEING MET OUTSIDE OF SW VA AND THE NRN MTNS OF E TN. 

OTHERWISE...MOS TEMPS GENERALLY FOLLOWED FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY 
NIGHT. SUNDAY MAXES SHOULD OCCUR IN THE MORNING OR NO LATER THAN 
VERY EARLY AFTERNOON...AS REFLECTED IN FORECAST GRIDS.

THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK PRODUCT (HWO) WAS UPDATED EARLIER TO 
HIGHLIGHT THE WEEKEND SYSTEM...AND A WEBINAR ALSO WAS DONE.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE EXTENDED PERIOD 
INCLUDES THREES SYSTEMS TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA. COLDER AIR 
FLOWS INTO THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT BEHIND A DEPARTING FRONTAL SYSTEM 
WHILE A FAST MOVING SHORT WAVE TRAILS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. MODEL 
FORECASTS INDICATE SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND LIFTING OCCURS FOR 
PRECIPITATION BEHIND THE FRONT. TEMPERATURES WILL BE FALLING THROUGH 
THE EVENING AND LIGHT SNOW APPEARS LIKELY AFTER MIDNIGHT ACROSS THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...MUCH OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AS WELL AS HIGH NORTH CAROLINA BORDER TERRAIN THROUGH 
MONDAY MORNING BEFORE PRECIP TAPERS OFF AS THE WAVE DEPARTS. 
ANOTHER...MORE WELL DEVELOPED SHORT WAVE ENTERS THE PICTURE LATER 
TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT. BECAUSE SOME MOISTURE AND WARM AIR 
ADVECTION WILL BE MOVING IN WELL AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE ALOFT...THERE 
WILL BE JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA AND TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME LIGHT 
FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY TUESDAY MORNING 
BEFORE THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE WARM SUFFICIENTLY FOR A 
CHANGEOVER TO LIQUID PRECIP. THE MAIN BRUNT OF THIS SYSTEM BUILDS 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TUESDAY AFTERNOON INTO TUESDAY 
NIGHT WITH A NICE MILD SOUTHERLY FLOW. THEREFORE...THIS EVENT WILL 
BE A RAIN EVENT. THE SYSTEM COLD FRONT MOVES AWAY TO THE EAST DURING 
THE DAY WEDNESDAY WITH THE CHANCE OF RAIN TAPERING OFF. MODELS SHOW 
SOME LINGERING LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND WITH TEMPERATURES DROPPING 
BELOW FREEZING HAD TO INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR LIGHT SNOW IN THIS 
AREA. THE FINAL SYSTEM APPEARS ON THE HORIZON AT THE END OF THE 
PERIOD ON FRIDAY. AT THIS RATHER REMOTE PERIOD OF THE 
FORECAST...WHERE UNCERTAINTY STILL ABOUNDS...ANOTHER SOUTHERN STREAM 
WAVE BUILDS EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WITH SURFACE LOW 
PRESSURE FORMING OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO. WHILE TRACK OF 
THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM IS IN QUESTION THIS FAR OUT IN THE FORECAST...A 
SOUTHERN TRACKING LOW EMERGING NORTHEAST OUT OF THE GULF WOULD BE IN 
A FAVORABLE POSITION TO GENERATE MORE FREEZING/FROZEN PRECIPITATION. 
TEMPERATURES APPEAR TO BE COLD ENOUGH FOR THIS POSSIBILITY IF THE 
SYSTEM DEVELOPS ACCORDING TO CURRENT MODEL FORECASTS. STAYED BELOW 
THE WARMER MEX MOS TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE THROUGHOUT THE LONG TERM 
PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE CAROLINAS...WITH A QUASI- 
STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY AND MID 
WEST. THIS HIGH PRESSURE AREA IS PROGGED TO REMAIN ANCHORED OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST TODAY AND TONIGHT...BRINGING DRY AND WARMER CONDITIONS AS 
A DEEP SOUTHWESTERLY WIND FLOW DEVELOPS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AS 
FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES 
FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS THE WARMER 
GFS NUMBERS FOR TODAY AND THE WARMER NAM NUMBERS FOR TONIGHT DUE TO 
THE SOUTHWESTERLY WIND FLOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...WARMER AIR IS ON THE WAY 
FOR THE WEEKEND AS A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE 
REGION AND AN UPPER-TROUGH OVER THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS WILL PROMOTE A 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER THE REGION FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...AND 
ALLOW HIGHS TO CLIMB BACK INTO THE UPPER 40S AND 50S. SOME GULF 
MOISTURE WILL ALSO INCREASE ACROSS THE REGION AS WELL...AND A 
PASSING SHORTWAVE LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY WILL LIKELY 
TRIGGER SOME AREAS OF SHOWERS ON SUNDAY. ANOTHER STRONGER SHORTWAVE 
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...WILL TRIGGER SOME ADDITIONAL HEAVIER 
SHOWERS DURING THIS TIME PERIOD /AND EVEN A CHANGEOVER TO SOME LIGHT 
SNOW ACROSS THE NORTHERN ZONES LATE SUNDAY NIGHT/...BEFORE THINGS 
TAPER OFF BY MONDAY AFTERNOON.

SOME BRIEF RIDGING ON MONDAY NIGHT WILL PROMOTE SOME MOSTLY/PARTLY 
CLEAR AND DRY CONDITIONS BEFORE THE NEXT SHORTWAVE WILL DRIVE A WEAK 
COLD FRONT THROUGH THE REGION ON TUESDAY. THIS WILL PROVIDE ANOTHER 
OPPORTUNITY FOR LIKELY POPS TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...BEFORE 
THINGS TAPER OFF FROM WEST TO EAST ON WEDNESDAY. AS SOME COLDER AIR 
FILTERS INTO THE REGION WEDNESDAY EVENING/NIGHT...ANOTHER 
OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE 
/MAINLY ACROSS THE NORTHEAST AND MOUNTAIN ZONES/ FROM THE WRAP- 
AROUND MOISTURE ON THE BACKSIDE OF THIS LOW. THEREAFTER...SOME DRIER 
AND WARMER CONDITIONS BACK INTO THE 50S CAN BE EXPECTED TO CLOSE OUT

314 PM EST THU JAN 30 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...SOME SIGNIFICANT
IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR WEATHER AFTER WE GET THROUGH ONE MORE COLD
NIGHT. THE CORE OF THE ARCTIC HIGH IS STILL GENERALLY OVER OR JUST
SE OF THE APPALACHIANS OVERNIGHT...SO MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT
WINDS. LINGERING SNOW COVER IS ALSO A FACTOR...MAINLY IN SHELTERED
VALLEYS WHERE WINDS MAY BE NEAR CALM. A STRONG LOW LEVEL
TEMPERATURE INVERSION WILL BE SETUP TONIGHT...SO RIDGE-LINES AND
PEAKS SHOULD BE NOT NEARLY AS COOL AS THOSE SHELTERED VALLEYS. THE
FIRST PERIOD OF THE ZONE FORECAST REFLECTS THIS.

AREA ROADS...ALTHO MUCH IMPROVED DURING THE DAY...WILL RE-FREEZE
AND BE HAZARDOUS AGAIN OVERNIGHT. A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT WAS
ISSUED EARLIER TO HIGHLIGHT THIS.

OTHERWISE...DRY WITH A WARMING TREND FOR FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY...
AS FLOW ALOFT BECOMES ZONAL FRIDAY AND INCREASINGLY SW BY THE
WEEKEND. CLOUD AND MOISTURE RETURN IS PRETTY SCANT UNTIL SATURDAY.
KEPT IN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR WRN AND SE AREAS LATE SATURDAY FOR
WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT.

MOS MAX TEMPS WERE CLOSE EACH DAY AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED. A LARGE
DISPARITY IN LOWS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH SOME ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO
FIT THE LIKELY SURFACE PATTERN. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...AN WELCOME UPPER 
LEVEL PATTERN CHANGE IS IN STORE WHICH WILL REVERSE THE RECENT TREND 
OVER THE EASTERN U.S. AN AMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL BE IN 
PLACE ACROSS THE WESTERN STATES WITH A RIDGE DEVELOPING ACROSS THE 
EAST WHICH MEANS THE FLOW WILL SHIFT FROM NORTHERLY TO SOUTHERLY 
BRINGING MILDER AIR INTO THE REGION. THE PERIOD STARTS OUT WITH A 
SHORT WAVE AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM SO HIGH CHANCE POPS 
SATURDAY NIGHT BUMP UP TO LIKELY PROBABILITIES FOR SHOWERS ON 
SUNDAY. TRAILING SHORT WAVE ENERGY BUILDS IN BEHIND THE DEPARTING 
SURFACE SYSTEM SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AND TEMPERATURES DROP BACK 
INTO THE UPPER 20S AND LOWER 30S ACROSS THE NORTHWESTERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. THEREFORE KEPT SOME LIGHT RAIN CHANGING TO LIGHT SNOW 
IN THIS AREA LATER SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING BEFORE THE 
PRECIP TAPERS OFF. ANOTHER...STRONGER SYSTEM WILL BE ON THE APPROACH 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WITH INCREASING WAVE AMPLIFICATION SO 
SLIGHT THROUGH LOW CHANCE POPS FOR RAIN SHOWERS INCREASE TO LIKELY 
CATEGORY BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE 
WAVE MOVES FROM THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO NORTHEAST INTO THE 
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. COLDER AIR SPILLS IN 
BEHIND THE SYSTEM COLD FRONT LATER IN THE DAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
WITH SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND LIFT FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME SNOW 
SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE 
MOUNTAINS OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. WENT CLOSER TO A GUIDANCE BLEND 
FOR MAX AND MIN TEMPS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE NOW
CENTERED OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. TEMPERATURES HAVE
REALLY BOTTOMED OUT DUE TO THE CALM CONDITIONS AND STILL
SUBSTANTIAL SNOW COVER. CURRENT TEMPERATURES ARE AT OR BELOW
THIS MORNINGS FORECAST LOWS WITH 8 AT CHA...5 AT TYS AND -1 AT TRI
AT 400 AM. THINK LOWS COULD DROP A FEW MORE DEGREES BY MORNING
WHICH COULD REACH ZERO IN KNOXVILLE. SOME LIGHT SOUTHERLY WINDS
HAVE AFFECTED TEMPERATURES ON THE PLATEAU AND MIDDLE ELEVATIONS IN
THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS WITH THOSE TEMPERATURES STILL IN THE TEENS.
WITH THE HIGH PRESSURE AREA SHIFTING EAST TODAY WINDS WILL BECOME
SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST AT ABOUT 5 TO 10 MPH. TEMPERATURES STILL LOOK TO
WARM SIGNIFICANTLY TODAY MOSTLY IN THE 30S TO POSSIBLY LOWER 40S BY
MID AFTERNOON. VERY DRY AIR MASS WOULD NORMALLY ALLOW A FAST WARM UP
BUT THIS WILL BE INHIBITED BY THE SNOW COVER. TONIGHT SOME HIGH
CLOUDS WILL MOVE IN FROM THE WEST BUT SHOULD NOT BE THAT THICK.
WITH SNOW COVER THERE COULD BE A WIDE RANGE OF LOWS...FROM LOWER TO
MID 20S WHERE SOUTH WINDS PERSIST OVERNIGHT AND INTO THE TEENS IN
CALMER AREAS. SOME LOCATIONS MIGHT EVEN FALL INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS
AGAIN. KEPT HIGHS AND LOWS BELOW GUIDANCE A FEW DEGREES BASED ON
CURRENT SNOW COVER. EXPECTING NOT ALL THE SNOW TO MELT BY LATE
AFTERNOON TODAY WHICH WILL ALLOW MORE RADIATIONAL COOLING TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SE OF THE AREA WITH WARMING TREND UNDERWAY. 
NIGHT TEMPERATURES REMAIN ON THE COOL SIDE WITH DRY AIR MASS IN 
PLACE. SW TO NE ORIENTATED UPPER JET OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL 
SLOWLY MOVE INTO THE TN VALLEY THIS WEEKEND. LIGHT RAIN BECOMES 
POSSIBLE ON SATURDAY BUT BETTER CHANCES INCREASE INTO SUNDAY. COLD 
FRONT NEARLY PARALLEL WITH UPPER FLOW SLOWLY MARCHES INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS SUNDAY WITH GOOD LIFT PROVIDED BY ENTRANCE 
REGION OF UPPER JET. TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN FALLING SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON. UPPER TROUGH AXIS MOVES INTO SW VA SUN NIGHT WITH

FILTER INTO NW AREAS WHILE RAIN IS TAPERING OFF. FREEZING RAIN A 
POSSIBILITY ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA MONDAY MORNING. SURFACE RIDGE 
MOVES EAST THROUGH CENTRAL APPALACHIANS MONDAY NIGHT WITH WARM 
RETURN FLOW TO TN VALLEY ON TUESDAY WITH RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF

EDGES. HOWEVER...A SOLID PART OF THE FORECAST AREA (OUTSIDE OF NW
PLATEAU COUNTIES) WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY SNOW OVERNIGHT.
OTPED TO EXPAND THE RANGE OF MIN TEMPS...AS SHELTERED VALLEYS
SHOULD PLUNGE A FEW DEGREES BELOW MOS MIN TEMPS...WHILE HIGHER
TERRAIN OVER WRN AREAS MAY GET A LIGHT SOUTHERLY FLOW BETWEEN 06Z
AND 12Z THURSDAY (MILDER MINS THAN THIS MORNING'S MINS).

ALSO THINKING THAT IT WOULD BE WISE TO UNDERCUT MOS MAX TEMPS FOR
THURSDAY...GIVEN THE EXTENSIVE AREA OF AT LEAST 1 TO 3 INCHES OF
SNOW LIKELY LINGERING FOR EARLY THURSDAY. 

ROADS MAY HAVE IMPROVED DURING THE DAY BUT SNOW AND ICE COVERED
ACROSS THE BOARD OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY SHELTERED BACK ROADS WHERE
HEAVIER SNOW OCCURRED AND LESS TRAFFIC FLOWED TODAY. UPDATED
HAZARDOUS WEATHER PRODUCT PLUS ISSUED A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT TO
HIGHLIGHT THE TREACHEROUS ROADS.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
WARMING TREND WILL BE UNDERWAY WITH TEMPERATURES STARTING TO REACH 
ABOVE NORMAL LEVELS BY THE WEEKEND. THE PERSISTENT COLD LONGWAVE 
TROUGHING WE/VE BEEN EXPERIENCING WILL BE REPLACED WITH WEAK RIDGING 
ALONG THE EAST COAST AND TROUGHING OUT WEST. THUS...SW FLOW ALOFT 
WILL BE DEVELOPING BY THE WEEKEND...WHICH WILL HELP TO GRADUALLY 
INCREASE SUBTROPICAL MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. A COLD FRONT WILL DROP 
DOWN INTO THE AREA SUNDAY WITH RAIN AND SHOWERS ALONG IT. GFS HINTS 
AT A SECOND QUICK WAVE OUT OF TEXAS THAT MAY TOUCH OFF ADDITIONAL 
PRECIP MONDAY...WHILE THE ECMWF KEEPS US MAINLY DRY MONDAY. WILL 
HEDGE WITH SOME CHANCE POPS MONDAY UNTIL OUR FOCUS SHARPENS. EVEN 
SO...BOTH MODELS ARE SHOWING ANOTHER H5 TROUGH MOVING THROUGH THE 
SOUTHERN ROCKIES AND INTO THE HIGH PLAINS DURING MONDAY/TUESDAY... 
AND INTO THE MIDATLANTIC STATES LATE WEDNESDAY. AN ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT MAY STALL OVER MIDDLE TN WITH HIEST PRECIP AMOUNTS THERE...BUT 
THIS SYSTEM WILL LIKELY PRODUCE SOME MODERATE RAINFALL AMOUNTS IN 
OUR AREA AS IT MOVES THROUGH. CURRENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE FRONT 
HANGING UP IN MIDDLE TN WILL KEEP OUR AREA IN THE WARM SECTOR... 
MINIMIZING ANY WINTRY PRECIP RISK FOR US...AT LEAST TROUGH THE 
DAYTIME WEDNESDAY. PERHAPS WILL SEE LOW-POP LIGHT WINTRY PRECIP WITH 
UPSLOPE CONDITIONS OVER THE PLATEAU AND APPALACHIANS WED NGT AFTER 
THE FRONT PASSES BY.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SNOWFALL HAS NOW ENDED ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA. A FEW SNOW SHOWERS AND FLURRIES HAD LINGERED ACROSS 
PARTS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA IN WISE COUNTY AND EXTREME NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE THE LAST FEW HOURS. SKIES WERE MOSTLY CLEAR FROM ABOUT 
I-75 AND I-81 WESTWARD WITH SOME LOWER CLOUDS STILL LINGERING FROM 
THE SE TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS NE INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. 
TEMPERATURES RANGED FROM THE LOWER TO MID TEENS ALONG THE MOUNTAINS 
AND IN SW NORTH CAROLINA TO THE SINGLE DIGITS LOWER ELEVATIONS OF 
THE TN VALLEY TO NEAR ZERO ON THE PLATEAU WHERE SKIES CLEARED 
EARLIER.

FOR TODAY SKIES WILL BE SUNNY AND COLD WITH LIGHT NORTH WINDS 
BECOMING NEAR CALM AS ARCTIC HIGH BUILDS OVERHEAD. TEMPERATURES WILL 
ONLY RISE INTO THE 20S. TONIGHT SURFACE HIGH STAYS OVERHEAD OR 
SHIFTS SLIGHTLY EAST. WITH SNOW COVER EXPECT LOWS TO DROP TO SINGLE 
DIGITS AGAIN MOST LOCATIONS POSSIBLY NEAR ZERO OR SLIGHTLY BELOW IN 
NORMALLY COLDER LOCATIONS. ON THE PLATEAU LOWS MAY BE SLIGHTLY 
WARMER AS READINGS ARE ALREADY NEAR ZERO THIS MORNING BUT STILL 5 TO 
10 DEGREES.    

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY) ...
SURFACE RIDGE SLIDES SOUTHEAST OF THE AREA ALLOWING SOUTHWEST LOW 
LEVEL FLOW AND WARM AIR ADVECTION. DRY CONDITIONS WITH TEMPERATURES 
APPROACHING NORMAL BY LATE FRIDAY. PERSISTENT UPPER FLOW SW TO NE 
WITH JET CORE OVER THE N OH VALLEY. SURFACE FRONT BECOMES 
STATIONARY NW OF MRX CWA. LOW CHANCE FOR RAIN ACROSS WESTERN AREAS 
LATE FRIDAY. UPPER JET AND FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHIFT SE CLOSER TO MRX 
CWA WITH SLIGHT INCREASE IN RAIN CHANCE. TEMPS WARMING TO SLIGHTLY 
ABOVE NORMAL. 

MODEL SOLUTION BEGIN TO SPREAD WITH EVENTUAL COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE 
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON SUNDAY. LEANED TOWARD A 
SLOWER...WARMER AND WETTER SOLUTION THROUGH SUNDAY. AS SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE AND COOLER TEMPERATURES BUILDS IN SUNDAY UPPER JET AXIS 
REMAINS NW OF AREA. ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL AID IN CONTINUED

241 PM EST TUE JAN 28 2014

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY/...
AREAS OF LIGHT TO LOCALLY MODERATE SNOW CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON AS A
BROAD UPPER STORM SYSTEM CONTINUES TO PUSH GULF MOISTURE INTO THE
REGION. THIS MOISTURE...COMBINED WITH THE VERY COLD TEMPERATURES AND
THE SYNOPTIC LIFT PROVIDED BY THE JET HAS HELPED TO GENERATE AND
MAINTAIN THIS PRECIPITATION THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE DAY. HELPING TO
MAINTAIN IT AS WELL HAS BEEN AN INVERTED TROUGH THAT IS STRETCHING
FROM GEORGIA UP INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. ADDITIONALLY...HIGHER
PWATS HAVE ADVECTED INTO THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH HAS
ALLOWED THIS SNOW TO FALL AND ACCUMULATE DESPITE SOME OF THE HIGHER
DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS THAT WERE OBSERVED EARLIER. GENERALLY...
BETWEEN 1 TO 2 INCHES OF SNOW HAS BEEN OBSERVED ALONG THE VALLEYS
AND FOOTHILLS /WITH THE MOUNTAINS LIKELY RECEIVING 1 TO 2 INCHES
MORE/.

MODELS ARE STILL INDICATING THE PRECIPITATION WANING BY LATE EVENING
TO AROUND MIDNIGHT FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST AS THE BEST
LIFT/MOISTURE QUICKLY SLIDES TO THE SOUTH. STILL...MODELS ARE
INDICATING THERE WILL BE A WINDOW FOR SOME ADDITIONAL LIGHT
ACCUMULATIONS OF AROUND AN INCH ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AND PORTIONS OF
THE CENTRAL VALLEYS UP INTO NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA.
THUS...HAVE ADJUSTED THE POP AND SNOW GRIDS ACCORDINGLY. STILL THINK
THAT THE ADVISORY FOR 1 TO 3 INCHES IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE VALLEYS
AND FOOTHILLS...WITH 2 TO 4 INCHES ACROSS SOUTHWEST NC AND THE
EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS THROUGH THE LATE EVENING /THOUGH SOME OF
THE PEAKS MAY HAVE SLIGHTLY HIGHER AMOUNTS/.

THEREAFTER...DRY AIR MOVES IN AND CLEARING WILL BEGIN TO OCCUR SO
WILL KEEP THE ADVISORY FOR THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN VALLEYS THROUGH
03Z AND THE MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST TN/SOUTHWEST VA THROUGH 06Z. BY
EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING...THE COMBINATION OF THE ARCTIC AIR
MASS...THE CLEARING TAKING PLACE...THE FAIRLY LIGHT WINDS AND SNOW
PACK WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO DROP WELL INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS
AREAWIDE. WIND CHILLS WILL DROP INTO A 0 TO -10 DEGREE RANGE LATE
TONIGHT...BUT GIVEN THE LIGHT WINDS HAVE OPTED TO HOLD OFF ON A
WIND CHILL ADVISORY. MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR
WEDNESDAY...BUT WITH AN ARCTIC AIR IN PLACE...HIGHS IN THE UPPER
TEENS TO MID 20S SEEM PLAUSIBLE.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/ ...
TEMPS WILL BE WARMING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD AS LOW LEVEL 
WINDS BACK TO SW AHEAD OF A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CROSSING THE GREAT 
LAKES. THIS LOW LEAVES A TRAILING COLD FRONT ACROSS KY...WHICH 
BECOMES ORIENTED PARALLEL TO THE MID-LEVEL FLOW...AND STALLS IN THAT 
AREA. MOST PRECIP FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT WILL BE NORTH OF OUR 
AREA...BUT WILL HAVE A SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE POP NORTH BOTH PERIODS. 
TEMPS LATE FRIDAY NIGHT COULD DROP TO NEAR OR BELOW FREEZING IN 
NORTHERN AREAS...AND A SHORT PERIOD OF SNOW OR FREEZING RAIN MAY 
OCCUR. FOR NOW WILL JUST MENTION A RAIN/SNOW MIX AS FINER DETAILS OF 
THE THERMAL PROFILE ARE TOO UNCERTAIN TO MENTION FZRA.

A TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE PLAINS TO THE MS VALLEY WILL BEGIN TO 
ADVECT GREATER MOISTURE INTO THE AREA SATURDAY. FAVORABLE JET 
POSITIONING AND THE SOUTHEASTWARD PUSH OF THE FRONT WILL INCREASE 
POPS TO THE LIKELY RANGE SATURDAY NIGHT. THE 12Z GFS AND ECMWF HAVE 
COME INTO GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS TIMING. PRECIP EXITS TO THE EAST 
ON SUNDAY.

THE 12Z GFS IS VERY QUICK TO BACK THE LOW LEVEL FLOW TO THE SOUTH 
AND ADVECT ABUNDANT MOISTURE INTO THE AREA FOR MONDAY. THE ECMWF 
SHOWS A SIMILAR PATTERN...BUT SLOWER TIMING OF THE APPROACHING 
TROUGH. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SPREAD AMONG ENSEMBLE MEMBERS FOR 
MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT...BUT THEY SEEM TO CONVERGE ON PRECIP FOR 
TUESDAY. THUS WILL KEEP MONDAY DRY...WITH CHANCE POPS MONDAY NIGHT 
AND TUESDAY...WITH TEMPS SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL.

.DISCUSSION...
AREAS OF LIGHT SNOW CONTINUE TO OVERSPREAD THE REGION TODAY AS AN 
UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM CONTINUES TO DRAW MOISTURE FROM THE 
LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND GULF OF MEXICO INTO THE REGION THIS 
MORNING. AT THE SURFACE...AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH REMAINS 
ORIENTED FROM THE SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC COAST UP THROUGH THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. THIS BOUNDARY...ALONG WITH A STRENGTHENING UPPER-JET 
AND SOME MODEST FRONTOGENESIS ALOFT WILL HELP TO CREATE SOME 
APPRECIABLE LIFT. THIS LIFT...COMBINED WITH THE INCREASED MOISTURE 
AND COLD TEMPERATURES WILL GENERATE A BROAD AREA OF LIGHT TO MODERATE
SNOW THROUGH THE LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING. THE BEST WINDOW APPEARS TO
BE FROM 15Z THROUGH 21-00Z AS THE BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTENS AND
HIGHER PWAT VALUES ADVECT IN /ALLOWING FOR SOME HIGHER RH VALUES
WITHIN THE SNOW GROWTH REGION DURING THE LATE MORNING AND
AFTERNOON/. THE MOST FAVORED AREAS FOR ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL WILL BE
ALONG AND EAST OF THE I-75 CORRIDOR. LOCATIONS ACROSS SOUTHWEST
NORTH CAROLINA AND ALONG THE MOUNTAINS OF EAST TENNESSEE SHOULD SEE
BETWEEN 2 TO 4 INCHES WITH SOME LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS ALONG THE
PEAKS. ANOTHER FAVORED AREA WILL FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA /ESPECIALLY AREAS ALONG AND SOUTHEAST OF THE
I-81 CORRIDOR/...WHERE 1-3 INCHES SEEM PROBABLE BY THIS EVENING.
ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY...1 TO 2 INCHES IS POSSIBLE
/WITH HALF AN INCH TO 1 INCH IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY/.

THUS...WILL STICK WITH A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY THROUGH 06Z IN
SOUTHWEST VA...NORTHEAST TN...SOUTHWEST NC AND THE MOUNTAINS
THROUGH 06Z. DO THINK THERE WILL BE SOME LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS
ALONG THE PEAKS...BUT THEY WILL NOT BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO UPGRADE
TO A WARNING. ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL

TO SETTLE OVER THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY WITH BELOW FREEZING 
TEMPERATURES. FORECASTED ON THE COLD SIDE OF GUIDANCE WITH EXPECTED 
SNOW COVER AND WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION. WINDS STRONGEST IN THE 
NORTHEAST WHERE THEY WILL BE WEST TO NORTHWEST AROUND 10 MILES PER 
HOUR. THERE COULD BE WIND CHILLS BELOW ZERO IN THE MORNING HOURS IN 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE TN MOUNTAINS. CENTER 
OF THE HIGH MOVES OVER REGION WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON SO WINDS BECOME 
LIGHT. WEDNESDAY NIGHT NOT QUITE AS COLD EXCEPT HIGHER VALLEYS OF 
THE NE AND TRI CITIES AIRPORT WHERE COLD AIR DRAINAGE WILL DROP LOWS 
INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS. MOST OTHER LOCATIONS NEAR 10 OR SLIGHTLY 
WARMER. THURSDAY THE WARMING BEGINS IN EARNEST AS WINDS SHIFT TO THE 
SOUTHWEST AND SOUTH BRINGING IN A WARMER AIR MASS. HIGHS THURSDAY 10 
TO 15 DEGREES ABOVE WEDNESDAY. TROUGH BEGINS TO REPLACE RIDGE OVER 
THE WESTERN STATES WITH UPPER FLOW BECOMING MORE ZONAL. HIGH LEVEL 
MOISTURE INCREASES THURSDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF FRONTAL SYSTEM MOVING 
INTO THE OHIO AND MS VALLEYS. LOWS WILL BE MUCH WARMER LOWER TO MID 
20S. PRECIPITATION CHANCES INCREASE FRIDAY AS COLD FRONT APPROACHES. 
THE FRONT SLOWS AND DOES NOT PUSH THROUGH THE REGION UNTIL SATURDAY

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
312 PM EST MON JAN 27 2014

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
AN ARCTIC FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION THIS EVENING...BRINGING
DANGEROUSLY LOW TEMPERATURES AND WIND CHILLS TO THE REGION TONIGHT
THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AND SOME LIGHT WINTRY PRECIPITATION ALONG
THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS ON TUESDAY.

ARCTIC AIR HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO OOZE INTO THE REGION THIS
AFTERNOON IN THE NORTHWEST ZONES...AND WILL CONTINUE MAKE ITS WAY
SOUTH AND EAST INTO THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN VALLEYS AND THE SMOKY MTNS
BY THIS EVENING. THE BRISK NORTHWEST FLOW WILL HELP TO REINFORCE
THIS COLD AIR OVERNIGHT...AND DESPITE SOME CLOUD COVER ALLOW
TEMPERATURES TO DROP INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS TO LOWER TEENS IN MOST
SPOTS BY TUESDAY MORNING. THESE STRONG WINDS COMBINED WITH THE COLD
TEMPERATURES WILL DROP WIND CHILLS TO 5 TO 15 DEGREES BELOW ZERO
LATE TONIGHT ALONG THE PLATEAU...THE EAST TENNESSEE MTNS AND FAR
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. THUS...A WIND CHILL
ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR THESE LOCATIONS LATE THIS EVENING THROUGH
DAYBREAK AS THE SUBFREEZING WIND CHILLS WILL PERSIST FOR SEVERAL
HOURS. OTHER VALLEY LOCATIONS WILL BE A LITTLE WARMER...BUT IT WILL
STILL BE AND FEEL VERY COLD TONIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING OVER THE
ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. THUS...PRECAUTIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN BY ANYONE
THAT MUST TO BE OUTSIDE DURING THIS TIME PERIOD.

THE BIG QUESTION WITH THE FORECAST WAS THE AREA OF LIGHT
PRECIPITATION THAT THE NAM AND NOW THE GFS AND ECMWF ARE SHOWING
ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AND BRIEFLY OVER THE VALLEYS ON TUESDAY. GIVEN
THE COLD AIR IN PLACE AND THE DEEP MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
WAVE...SOME ACCUMULATING SNOW WILL BE POSSIBLE /PRIMARILY OVER THE
HIGHER TERRAIN/. AM THINKING THAT SOME OF THESE QPF SIGNALS
/ESPECIALLY THE WIDESPREAD ONES OVER THE VALLEY/ AND A BIT OVERDONE
AS THERE IS FAIRLY WEEK FRONTOGENESIS TAKING PLACE. HOWEVER...SOME
UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT IS THERE WITH THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE
JET ROTATING OVER THE REGION DURING THE AFTERNOON. THUS...INCREASED
POPS FOR SOME LIGHT SNOW OVER THE VALLEYS AND SOME ACCUMULATING
SNOW OVER THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA
DURING THE AFTERNOON. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY OF HOW WIDESPREAD THIS
ACTIVITY WILL BE...HAVE BEEN CONSERVATIVE WITH SNOWFALL AMOUNTS. DO
THINK THAT PERHAPS AN INCH OR TWO WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG THE HIGH
MTNS GIVEN THE AVAILABLE MOISTURE AND HIGH RATIOS...WITH UP TO A
DUSTING ELSEWHERE IN PARTS OF THE SURROUNDING VALLEYS AS A BULK OF
THE HEAVIEST PRECIPITATION WILL BE WELL TO THE SOUTH AND EAST.

AN EVEN COLDER NIGHT SEEMS LIKELY FOR LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE
SKY CLEARS AND WINDS DECOUPLE...ALLOWING FOR LOWS TO DROP TO
AROUND ZERO IN SOME AREAS ACROSS THE NORTHEAST ZONES...AND IN THE
3-9 DEGREE RANGE IN MOST OTHER AREAS. WIND CHILL VALUES MAY NOT BE
QUITE AS LOW IN SOME SPOTS WITH THE LIGHTER WINDS...BUT IT WILL
CERTAINLY FEEL BITTERLY COLD AS VALUES DROP TO BETWEEN -5 TO -10
DEGREES ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. THUS...A
WIND CHILL ADVISORY SEEMS LIKELY FOR THE SAME AREA ONCE AGAIN AND
PERHAPS MORE OF THE VALLEY AS WELL. AT LEAST ONE MORE VERY COLD
NIGHT WILL BE IN STORE FOR THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS LOWS WILL
BOTTOM OUT IN THE 5 TO 15 DEGREE RANGE BEFORE A GRADUAL WARMING
TREND WILL OCCUR BY LATE WEEK.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
HE GENERAL PATTERN THROUGH THE PERIOD WILL BE A NEARLY ZONAL FLOW 
IN THE MID-UPPER LEVELS. THIS SHOULD BRING AN END TO THE VERY COLD 
TEMPS THAT WE HAVE BEEN SEEING. IT MAY ALSO RESULT IN A PERIOD OF 
RAIN THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS A BOUNDARY STALLS E-W NEAR THE AREA. 

LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION IS EXPECTED TO BRING WARMER TEMPS THURSDAY 
AND FRIDAY...ALONG WITH INCREASING CLOUD COVER. THE NORTHWARD PUSH 
OF WARMER AIR STALLS ACROSS KY...PRODUCING A BOUNDARY THAT SITS 
PARALLEL TO THE UPPER FLOW. A JET STREAK OVER THE OH VALLEY BRINGS 
SOME PRECIP CHANCES INTO OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES FRIDAY NIGHT. SOME 
WEAK MID-LEVEL AMPLIFICATION ALLOWS THE BOUNDARY TO SAG SOUTH ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT...AND MOVE ACROSS THE AREA SUNDAY. THESE PERIODS LOOK 
LIKE THE BEST CHANCES OF SEEING PRECIP...BUT WILL STAY IN THE CHANCE 
RANGE AS CONFIDENCE IN DETAILS WITH THIS PATTERN IS LACKING. THERE 
IS ALSO A LOT OF SPREAD IN THE GEFS MEMBERS OVER THE WEEKEND. 

A PERIOD OF DRYING IS EXPECTED MONDAY...FOLLOWED BY RETURNING RAIN 
CHANCES MONDAY AS LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS IN THE PLAINS. OVERALL 
CONFIDENCE IS LOW THROUGH THE LONG TERM PERIOD.

A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL TRACK THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA LATE THIS
MORNING AND EARLY THIS AFTERNOON...BRINGING MUCH COLDER AIR INTO
THE REGION AND SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION TO THE REGION. MOST
LOCATIONS HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED THEIR HIGH TEMPERATURE THIS
MORNING /IN THE LOW 30S TO AROUND 40 DEGREES/...AND WILL BEGIN TO

DRIZZLE WAS OBSERVED ALONG SHELTERED VALLEY THE FOOTHILLS OF THE
SMOKIES AND IN SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA RESULTING IN SOME SLICK
ROADS. PRECIPITATION HAS WANED IN THESE AREAS FOR THE MOST
PART...SO HAVE ALLOWED THE ADVISORY TO EXPIRE...BUT HAVE STILL MADE
A MENTION OF SOME PATCHY BLACK ICE IN A NEWLY UPDATED SPS...AS
TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY NOT REACH MUCH ABOVE FREEZING IN THESE

CENTRAL...AND LOW LIKELY FAR NORTH FOR MAINLY MONDAY MORNING/EARLY 
AFTERNOON.  APPEARS PRECIP MAY START TO MOVE IN LATE TONIGHT AS RAIN 
OR A RAIN SNOW MIX GIVEN WARM AIR ABOVE THE SURFACE AND SURFACE 
TEMPS MAINLY ABOVE FREEZING AT PRECIP ONSET...WITH A GRADUAL 
TRANSITION TO MAINLY SNOW BEFORE ENDING.  NOT MUCH SNOW ACCUMULATION 
EXPECTED...WITH AN INCH OR LESS POSSIBLE OVER SOME OF THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS.  TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY BE FALLING DURING THE 
AFTERNOON MOST AREAS.  WILL ADJUST SOME MAV TEMPS UP TONIGHT INTO 
EARLY TOMORROW GIVEN EXPECTED LOW LEVEL SOUTHWEST FLOW. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...AN ARCTIC FRONT WILL
MOVE THROUGH THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT...BRINGING DANGEROUSLY LOW
TEMPERATURES AND WIND CHILLS TO THE REGION THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF
NEXT WEEK.

BY MONDAY EVENING...ARCTIC AIR WILL BEGIN TO FILTER INTO THE REGION 
AND BE ACCOMPANIED BY SOME BREEZY NORTHWEST WINDS. THESE WINDS... 
COMBINED WITH THE BITTER COLD AIR IN PLACE /WITH TEMPERATURES LIKELY 
IN THE SINGLE DIGITS/ WILL CREATE WIND CHILL VALUES BETWEEN -5 TO 
-15 DEGREES OR LOWER IN MANY LOCATIONS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE 
ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN...WHERE THESE CONDITIONS WILL LAST FOR 
SEVERAL HOURS. WINDS WILL BEGIN TO RELAX A BIT BY THE AFTERNOON ON 
TUESDAY...BUT WITH THE COLD AIR IN PLACE TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY 
REACH THE MID TEENS TO LOWER 20S. AN EVEN COLDER NIGHT SEEMS LIKELY 
FOR LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE SKY CLEARS AND WINDS DECOUPLE... 
ALLOWING FOR LOWS TO DROP BELOW ZERO IN SOME AREAS ACROSS THE 
NORTHEAST ZONES...AND IN THE 0-5 DEGREE RANGE IN MOST OTHER AREAS. 
THOUGH WIND CHILL VALUES WILL NOT BE QUITE AS LOW WITH THE CALM 
CONDITIONS...IT WILL STILL FEEL BITTERLY COLD AS VALUES DROP TO 
BETWEEN -5 TO -10 ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. 
THUS...A WIND CHILL ADVISORY SEEMS LIKELY FOR THE MOUNTAINS AND AT 
LEAST PORTIONS OF THE VALLEY MONDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. AT LEAST ONE 
MORE VERY COLD NIGHT WILL BE IN STORE FOR THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
AS LOWS WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE 5 TO 15 DEGREE RANGE BEFORE A GRADUAL 
WARMING TREND WILL OCCUR BY LATE WEEK. 

WINDS WILL EVENTUALLY SHIFT TO THE SOUTH AND WEST BY THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY...ALLOWING SOME WARMER AIR AND MOISTURE TO RETURN. DEPENDING 
ON THE STRENGTH OF SOME PASSING SHORTWAVES...SOME ISOLATED LIGHT  
PRECIPITATION MAY BE POSSIBLE LATE IN THE WORK WEEK /THOUGH THE 
ECMWF FAVORS THIS FAR MORE THAN THE GFS/. DID NOT GO TOO HIGH ON 
POPS FOR NOW...AS DISAGREEMENT EXISTS BETWEEN THE MODELS ON THE 
STRENGTH AND TIMING OF THESE PASSING WAVES. HIGHS WILL RETURN TO THE 
40S AND 50S BY THE WEEKEND AS SOUTHWEST FLOW PERSISTS AND AN

ADVISORY IN PLACE THROUGH 4 AM FOR THE E TN MOUNTAINS.  TOMORROW 
WILL BE DRY WITH QUITE A BIT OF SUNSHINE. IT WILL ALSO BE WARMER AS

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)... AN ARCTIC FRONT
WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION ON MONDAY INTO MONDAY
EVENING...BRINGING DANGEROUSLY LOW TEMPERATURES AND WIND CHILLS TO
THE REGION THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK.

AHEAD OF THE INITIAL ARCTIC FRONT...ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE 
THROUGH THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT/MONDAY MORNING...BRINGING SOME 
SCATTERED AREAS OF LIGHT SNOW TO NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA. MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS WILL RECEIVE A DUSTING TO AROUND

TUESDAY MORNING...LOW TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 0-5 DEGREES ACROSS MUCH 
OF THE VALLEY /AND SUBZERO TEMPERATURES IN THE MOUNTAINS/...WILL 
COMBINE WITH THESE WINDS TO CREATE DANGEROUSLY COLD WIND CHILLS IN 
THE -10 TO -20 DEGREE RANGE. TEMPERATURES ON TUESDAY WILL ONLY REACH

LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE SKY CLEARS AND WINDS SUBSIDE...ALLOWING 
FOR LOWS TO DROP BELOW ZERO IN SOME AREAS ACROSS THE NORTHEAST

AT LEAST ONE MORE BITTERLY COLD NIGHT IN THE SINGLE DIGITS SEEMS 
LIKELY FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT BEFORE A GRADUAL WARMING TREND WILL THEN

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER JET MOVING THROUGH THE TN 
VALLEY EARLY TODAY. LARGE AREA OF SURFACE LOW PRESSURE OVER GREAT 
LAKES WITH COLD FRONT EXTENDING SW INTO TX. THIS FRONT WILL MOVE 
RAPIDLY EAST THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY THIS AFTERNOON. 
WINDS WILL INCREASE IN ADVANCE OF FRONT WITH LOW LEVEL JET NEAR 50 
KNOTS. WINDS WILL CONTINUE STRONG THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS AS 
STRONGER WINDS MIX DOWN BEHIND FRONT. WEAK WARM AIR ADVECTION 
UNDERWAY IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT. TEMPERATURE WILL CLIMB WITH 
SOUTHERN AREAS RISING ABOVE FREEZING FOR A FEW HOURS TODAY. SNOW 
BANDS WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONT. ONCE AGAIN...INITIAL CONDITIONS VERY 
DRY AND AVAILABLE MOISTURE WILL BE LOWERING AS COLD FRONT MOVES
THROUGH TODAY. SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE GENERALLY LIGHT AND 
FAVORING WESTERN FACING SLOPES AS THE EVENT UNFOLDS THIS AFTERNOON. 
POST FRONTAL AIRMASS DRIES CONSIDERABLY THIS EVENING AS BRISK WEST 
WINDS CONTINUE INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. SOME AREAS MAY REQUIRE A 
WIND ADVISORY TODAY. STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION OVERNIGHT WILL RESULT 
IN TEMPERATURE DROPPING FAST. TEMPERATURES COUPLED WITH THE BRISK 
WINDS WILL LIKELY REQUIRE A WIND CHILL ADVISORY FOR MANY AREAS 
OVERNIGHT.   

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...DEEP...BROAD UPPER TROUGH OVER 
THE EASTERN U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE AREA WEATHER THOUGH MUCH 
OF THE EXTENDED.  SUNDAY WILL BE THE WARMEST DAY OF THE EXTENDED AS 
WINDS BECOME SOUTHERLY AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING SYSTEM.  THESE 
SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL BE A BIT BREEZY BUT WILL CARRY IN WARMER AIR.  
HOWEVER...THIS WARMING WILL BE SHORT-LIVED AS THE NEXT SYSTEM MOVES 
IN LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY.  WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST 
BEHIND A STRONG COLD FRONT.  SCATTERED LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS WILL 
ACCOMPANY THE FRONT WITH SOME ACCUMULATING SNOW POSSIBLE OVER THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN.  HOWEVER...THE MAIN CONCERN WILL BE THE BRISK 
NORTHWEST WINDS BRINGING IN ANOTHER ROUND OF VERY COLD ARCTIC AIR.  
SINGLE DIGIT TEMPERATURES COMBINED WITH THE WINDS MANY CREATE 
DANGEROUS WIND CHILLS...ESPECIALLY OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS MONDAY 
NIGHT.  THE VERY COLD TEMPERATURES WILL STAY OVER THE REGION TUESDAY 
AND TUESDAY NIGHT.  TEMPERATURES WILL SLOWLY MODERATE WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY.  MODELS IN POOR AGREEMENT BY THE END OF THE PERIOD...BUT 
THE NEXT SYSTEM SHOULD MOVE IN AROUND THE FRIDAY TIME FRAME.

CONCERNING LOW TEMPERATURES TONIGHT WITH A TIGHTENING PRESSURE
GRADIENT DEVELOPING AHEAD OF THE NEXT CLIPPER SYSTEM. TEMPERATURES
ARE DROPPING PERHAPS NOT QUITE AS RAPIDLY AS ONE WOULD EXPECT DUE
TO THE SURFACE FLOW PICKING UP OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST. IT DOESN'T

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...ANOTHER IN OUR SERIES OF 
SHORT WAVES/COLD FRONTS WILL AFFECT THE AREA ON SATURDAY. MOISTURE 
WILL BE LIMITED ONCE AGAIN AS HAS GENERALLY BEEN THE CASE WITH THESE 
SYSTEMS.  12Z NAM A BIT MORE BULLISH WITH THE ISENTROPIC LIFT AND 
MOISTURE...BUT LOOKS A BIT OVERDONE. WILL GENERALLY USE A COMPROMISE 
SOLUTION.  THINK PRECIP AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT GIVEN THE LOW LEVEL 
DRY AIR IN PLACE...WHICH WILL ALSO HELP TO DELAY ONSET OF PRECIP 
REACHING THE GROUND.  WILL KEEP TONIGHT DRY...THEN CHANCE POP SOUTH 
TO CAT POPS FAR NORTH FOR SATURDAY.  WILL CARRY POSSIBILITY OF SOME 
LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION WITH THE INITIAL BAND IN THE MORNING INTO 
VERY EARLY AFTERNOON. SOME SNOW SHOWERS WILL LIKELY LINGER THROUGH 
THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY IN THE NORMALLY FAVORED 
HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS AS THE FLOW TURNS MORE NORTHWEST AND COLD 
ADVECTION BEGINS.  SOME ADDITIONAL LIGHT ACCUMULATION CAN BE 
EXPECTED MAINLY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN THE AFTERNOON WITH THESE 
SNOW SHOWERS. MAY END UP NEEDING A SNOW ADVISORY FOR SOME OF OUR 
AREA...ESPECIALLY THE MOUNTAINS OF SW VA AND THE CENTRAL AND 
NORTHERN MOUNTAINS OF E TN.  HOWEVER...CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO 
ISSUE AT THIS TIME SO WILL JUST KEEP MENTION IN THE HWO. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...A BROAD UPPER-
TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE PREDOMINANT
WEATHER FEATURE OVER THE EASTERN CONUS FOR MUCH OF THE UPCOMING
WEEK...PROMOTING BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH MOST OF THE
PERIOD.

A BRIEF SURFACE RIDGE WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING UPPER-TROUGH ON SUNDAY. THE SUBSEQUENT CLEARING 
CONDITIONS AND STOUT SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL HELP PUSH TEMPERATURES 
TO THEIR WARMEST LEVELS IN ABOUT A WEEK AS HIGHS WILL PEAK IN THE 
MID TO UPPER 40S IN MOST SPOTS. AS MENTIONED HOWEVER...THIS BOUT OF 
WARMER WEATHER WILL BE SHORT-LIVED AS ANOTHER UPPER-TROUGH WILL 
SWING THROUGH THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT...BRING SOME SCATTERED SNOW 
SHOWERS TO NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA /PARTICULARLY 
ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN ABOVE 2500 FEET WHICH COULD RECEIVE AN INCH 
OR TWO OF ACCUMULATION/. THE BIGGER STORY HOWEVER...WILL BE THE 
BITTER COLD AIR THAT WILL FOLLOW /WHICH COMBINED WITH THE BRISK 
NORTHWEST FLOW WILL CREATE SOME DANGEROUSLY LOW SUBZERO WIND CHILLS/ 
ONCE AGAIN MONDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHTS. LOWS DURING THIS TIME PERIOD 
WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE SINGLE DIGITS IN MANY AREAS...WHILE HIGHS ON 
WILL STRUGGLE TO CLIMB MUCH ABOVE 20 DEGREES IN MANY PARTS. THOUGH A 
GRADUAL WARMING TREND WILL OCCUR BY MID TO LATE WEEK...THE CHILLY 
AND DRY CONDITIONS WILL LINGER THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...ARCTIC AIR CONTINUES TO PUSH 
INTO THE AREA...BUT WINDS WILL WEAKEN OVERNIGHT AND COLD ADVECTION 
WILL END BY LATE TONIGHT.  CLOUDS AND ANY LINGERING MOUNTAIN SNOW 
SHOWERS WILL DECREASE OVERNIGHT...AND IT SHOULD BE MAINLY SUNNY FOR 
FRIDAY.  TEMPS TONIGHT WILL BE QUITE COLD...WITH SINGLE DIGITS 
FAIRLY COMMON IN THE VALLEY.  WILL NOT APPROACH RECORDS AS RECORD 
LOWS FOR THE 24TH ARE BELOW ZERO.  WINDS WILL BECOME LIGHTER 
OVERNIGHT.  WINDS MAY BE A BIT ON THE LIGHT SIDE FOR THE WIND SPEED 
PORTION OF THE WIND CHILL ADVISORY CRITERIA ESPECIALLY OVER THE 
PLATEAU LATE TONIGHT...BUT WIND CHILL VALUES WILL BE QUITE LOW SO 
WILL KEEP ADVISORY IN PLACE THROUGH THE NIGHT FOR THE PLATEAU...AND 
THROUGH 11 AM FOR THE MOUNTAINS OF E TN AND SW VA. WILL NOT STRAY 
FAR FROM MAV TEMPS...WHICH LOOK REASONABLE OVERALL.  

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)... A BROAD UPPER-
TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE PREDOMINANT
WEATHER FEATURE OVER THE EASTERN CONUS...PROMOTING BELOW NORMAL
TEMPERATURES AND A FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOME WINTERY PRECIPITATION
ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AND IN NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA. THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF UPPER-LEVEL TROUGHS WILL PASS
THROUGH THE REGION LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY NIGHT...
BRINGING SOME SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS TO MUCH OF THE NORTHERN AND
CENTRAL VALLEYS AND THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF EAST TENNESSEE AND
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. VALLEY LOCATIONS ACROSS THESE AREAS MAY RECEIVE
A DUSTING UP TO ONE INCH OF SNOW...ESPECIALLY OVER FAR NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. UP TO TWO INCHES OF SNOW IS
POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

AFTER A BRIEF PUSH OF COLDER AIR FILTERS INTO THE AREA SATURDAY 
NIGHT...WINDS WILL QUICKLY BACK TO THE SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF THE NEXT 
WAVE. THIS WILL ALLOW HIGHS TO REACH THE MID 40S TO AROUND 50 
DEGREES OVER MUCH OF THE AREA ON SUNDAY...WITH MOSTLY/PARTLY SUNNY 
CONDITIONS PREVAILING. THE NEXT COLD FRONT WILL PASS ACROSS THE 
REGION SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...BRINGING SOME ADDITIONAL SCATTERED 
SNOW SHOWERS TO NORTHEAST ZONES AND HIGHER TERRAIN...BUT MORE 
IMPORTANTLY A MORE SIGNIFICANT PUSH OF COLDER AIR TO BEGIN THE NEW 
WORK WEEK. HIGHS ON TUESDAY WILL STRUGGLE TO CLIMB OVER 20-25 
DEGREES IN MOST SPOTS AND LOWS MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY NIGHT WILL 
CRATER INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS IN MANY SPOTS ONCE AGAIN /WITH WIND 
CHILLS AROUND OR BELOW ZERO/. THOUGH A SLIGHT WARM UP WILL OCCUR BY 
LATE WEEK...THE CHILLY AND DRY CONDITIONS WILL LINGER THROUGH THE 
REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...NO REST FOR THE WEARY WITH YET 
ANOTHER ARCTIC COLD FRONT DUE IN THE REGION TODAY. MORE SUB-FREEZING 
HIGH TEMPERATURES...A GOOD 20 TO 25 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL...IN STORE 
TODAY WITH BONE CHILLING SINGLE DIGIT LOWS EXPECTED TONIGHT. ADDING 
MORE MISERY TO THE MIX WILL BE THE HEALTHY NORTHWEST BREEZE 
GENERATED BY THE TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT AS ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. THE COMBINATION OF WIND AND 
TEMPERATURE WILL BE RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION 
BUT WILL BE MOST CRITICAL ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN ON THE NORTHERN 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND MOST OF THE TERRAIN 
ALONG THE TENNESSEE-NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. IN THESE AREAS A WIND 
CHILL ADVISORY CONTINUES THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING. THERE WILL BE JUST 
ENOUGH MOISTURE WITH THE ARCTIC SURGE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SNOW 
SHOWERS ACROSS MUCH OF THIS HIGHER TERRAIN AREA AS OROGRAPHIC LIFT 
STRENGTHENS IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW. WOULD EXPECT SOME ACCUMULATION 
WITH AMOUNTS FROM A DUSTING TO AROUND ONE INCH. SNOW FLURRIES WILL 
BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE GREAT VALLEY OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE 
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. SNOW SHOWERS WILL TAPER OFF ACROSS THE 
MOUNTAINS DURING THE EVENING.    

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO 
THE FORECAST ARE NEEDED THIS PERIOD. A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES MOVE 
THROUGH THE LARGER LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN SEABOARD. EACH 
ONE WILL BRING A REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR TO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. 

THE BEST CHANCES OF PRECIP APPEAR TO BE ON SATURDAY AS THE POLAR JET 
NOSES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. THE BEST LIFT WILL BE SATURDAY MORNING 
ACROSS SW VA IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE JET EXIT REGION AND 500 MB VORT 
MAX. IT MOVES THROUGH FAIRLY QUICKLY...WITH MOST POPS ENDING IN THE 
EVENING. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE LOWER POPS OF THE GFS...AND STAY IN 
THE CHANCE RANGE. A QUICK INCH OR TWO OF SNOW ACCUMULATION COULD BE 
POSSIBLE IN SW VA. ANOTHER FAST-MOVING BUT BROAD SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
PASSES TO THE NORTH SUNDAY NIGHT/MONDAY MORNING...AND WILL HAVE JUST 
A SLIGHT CHANCE POP WITH THIS AS MOISTURE IS LACKING. THERE IS 
ANOTHER STRONG SURGE OF ARCTIC AIR FOLLOWING THIS SYSTEM...BRINGING 
LOWS TEMPS INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS MONDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHTS...AND 
HIGHS IN THE TEENS AND 20S TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.

FOR THIS ONE...SO WILL JUST CARRY CHANCE POPS IN SOME OF OUR 
NORMALLY FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS...WITH SOME FLURRIES MENTIONED 
ELSEWHERE EXCEPT FAR SOUTH.  WINDS WILL COMBINE WITH COLD TEMPS TO 
PRODUCE LOW WIND CHILL VALUES.  WILL ISSUE A WIND CHILL ADVISORY FOR 
LATER TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY FOR NORTHERN PLATEAU...SW VA...AND 
MOST OF OUR TN MOUNTAIN ZONES. WILL ISSUE AN SPS HIGHLIGHTING THE
COLD FOR OTHER AREAS WHERE ADVISORY CRITERIA WILL NOT BE MET.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A DEEP COLD LONGWAVE 
TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES CONTINUES THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD 
KEEPING TEMPERATURES MOSTLY WELL BELOW NORMAL. THURSDAY NIGHT BEHIND 
A REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR FROM CANADA TEMPERATURES WILL DROP 
INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS LOWER ELEVATIONS TO SLIGHTLY BELOW ZERO 
HIGHER MOUNTAINS. WINDS WILL STAY UP OVER NIGHT AND INTO FRIDAY 
MORNING WITH WIND CHILL TEMPERATURES IN THE ADVISORY CATEGORY. THE 
HIGHEST ELEVATIONS OF SW VA AND NE TN INCLUDING THE SMOKIES MAY SEE 
SLIGHTLY LOWER WIND CHILLS SO MAY HAVE TO ISSUE A WARNING FOR THOSE 
AREAS IN LATER SHIFTS. FRIDAY WINDS RELAX AS COLD SURFACE HIGH MOVES 
OVERHEAD HOWEVER TEMPERATURES STAY BELOW FREEZING. FRIDAY NIGHT 
CLOUDS INCREASE AHEAD OF NEXT SHORTWAVE MOVING SOUTHEAST IN NW FLOW. 
TEMPERATURES WARM TO JUST ABOVE FREEZING MOST LOCATIONS. THIS SYSTEM 
BRINGS SOME MORE SNOW SHOWERS AND FLURRIES BUT AMOUNTS WILL BE 
MOSTLY TRACE TO A FEW TENTHS LOWER ELEVATIONS AND AND INCH OR TWO 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. A MORE SIGNIFICANT SURFACE LOW IN THE LONGWAVE 
PATTERN SUNDAY MOVING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES WILL CAUSE 
MORE SIGNIFICANT WARMING SUNDAY. THIS WARMING WILL BE SHORT LIVED 
AHEAD OF ANOTHER SHOT OF LIGHT PRECIPITATION SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
MONDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL REACH ABOVE FREEZING WITH MID 30S HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS AND LOWER TO MID 40S LOWER ELEVATIONS. BEHIND THIS SYSTEM 
MONDAY TEMPERATURES FALL BACK BELOW FREEZING WITH A SURGE OF 
BITTERLY COLD ARCTIC AIR. LOWS FALL BACK TO THE SINGLE DIGITS AND 
TEENS MONDAY NIGHT. HIGHS TUESDAY ONLY IN THE 20S. HIGHEST 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES AROUND 40 PERCENT AGAIN IN NORTHERN SECTIONS. 
AMOUNTS LOOK TO BE ABOUT THE SAME AS SATURDAYS SYSTEM. WEDNESDAY THE

LOCATIONS AND 3 TO 6 OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE THE WARNING IS 
IN PLACE.  ADDITIONALLY...WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE TODAY AS 
THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH...PROVIDING BRISK..GUSTY CONDITIONS.  THESE 
WINDS WILL USHER IN ANOTHER BLAST OF COLD AIR AND EXPECT 
TEMPERATURES TO REMAIN STEADY AND EVEN FALL DURING THE AFTERNOON.  
THE WINDS AND COLD WILL COMBINE TO CREATE WIND CHILLS INTO THE TEENS 
FOR THE LATE AFTERNOON.  CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS GOOD AND WILL UPDATE 
TO REMOVE MORNING WORDING.

.AVIATION...FLIGHT CONDITIONS NOT TOO BAD TO START THE PERIOD WITH
VFR IN PLACE. DETERIORATING WEATHER BEGINS LATER THIS MORNING AS
THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS BUILDS ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. CHA MAY
HAVE THE BEST FLYING WEATHER WITH CEILINGS POSSIBLY HOLDING JUST
ABOVE MVFR. WOULD EXPECT TYS AND TRI TO SEE CEILINGS DROP INTO MVFR
CATEGORY AROUND 17Z-18Z WHEN LIGHT SNOW BEGINS. BEST CHANCE FOR LOW
END MVFR VSBY REDUCTION IN LIGHT SNOW WILL BE AT TRI BUT TYS MAY
ALSO BRIEFLY DIP INTO AN MVFR CATEGORY IN LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS AS THE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
400 AM EST TUE JAN 21 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...THE GFS AND NAM HAVE 
SOME SIGNIFICANT QPF DIFFERENCES EARLY THIS MORNING WITH PRECIP TO 
OUR NORTH. THE GFS APPEARS TO BE CRANKING OUT WAY TOO MUCH SNOWFALL 
ACROSS SERN KY AND SW VA EARLY THIS MORNING THAT IS UNSUPPORTED BY 
OBS...AS MOST OBS SHOW SNOW REACHING THE GROUND FARTHER NORTH. GFS 
SOUNDINGS ALSO APPEAR TO HAVE TOO MUCH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE COMPARED 
TO 00Z OBSERVED SOUNDINGS. THE NAM APPEARS TO HAVE A BETTER HANDLE 
ON THINGS...AND IS THE PREFERRED MODEL FOR THE SHORT TERM. THE 
CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS PRETTY WELL IN LINE WITH THE NAM...SO NO 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WILL BE MADE.

PRECIP WILL BE INTENSIFYING OVER NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA LATER 
THIS MORNING AS THE 500 MB VORT MAX MOVES INTO KY. CURRENT TEMPS ARE 
QUITE WARM IN MANY LOCATIONS...IN THE 40S...SO SOME SPOTS WILL START 
AS RAIN. THE PEAK OF PRECIP LOOKS TO COME AROUND 18Z WHEN THE 700-50 
MB TROUGH AXIS SWINGS THROUGH...PROVIDING SOME INSTABILITY IN 
ADDITION TO THE QG FORCING. COLD ADVECTION WILL KICK IN STRONGLY 
AROUND THIS TIME AS THE 850 MB LOW TAKES SHAPE OVER VA...SO ALL 
PRECIP SHOULD BE CHANGED TO SNOW BY THEN. THE EVENT TRANSITIONS INTO 
A NW FLOW PATTERN AFTER 18Z...AFTER WHICH TIME MOST ACCUMULATIONS 
WILL BE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THIS CONTINUES INTO THE 
EVENING...GRADUALLY TAPERING OFF THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH 
STABILIZATION AND DIMINISHING MOISTURE. 

3 TO 6 INCHES OF SNOW STILL LOOK LIKE THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO FOR 
THE WINTER STORMS WARNING AREA...WITH 1 TO 3 IN THE ADVISORY AREA. 
WIND CHILL VALUES WILL ALSO BE VERY LOW IN THE MOUNTAINS AND SW VA 
TONIGHT. WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION THIS IN THE WSW FOR NOW...THOUGH 
LATER FORECASTS WILL LIKELY NEED A WIND CHILL ADVISORY. 

VERY COLD TEMPS CONTINUE WEDNESDAY...WITH HIGHS ONLY IN THE 20S TO 
LOWER 30S SOUTH DESPITE MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. LOWS WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
WILL BE MAINLY IN THE TEENS. LEANED ON THE COLD SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE 
FOR TEMPS IN AREAS WHERE SNOW COVER IS EXPECTED TO LINGER.


.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T 
APPEAR THAT THERE WILL BE ANY MAJOR WARMING THROUGH THE PERIOD AS
THE BLOCKING PATTERN SHOULD CONTINUE. THE AIRMASS SOURCE REGION
WILL REMAIN OUT OF THE ARCTIC AND A CONVOY OF CLIPPER SYSTEMS WILL 
CONTINUE TO HAUL THE CHILLY AIR INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION. MODELS KEY ON ABOUT THREE SYSTEMS WITH THE FIRST MOVING 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY EVENING. THE SECOND 
BUILDS ACROSS THE REGION SATURDAY INTO SATURDAY NIGHT WHILE THE 
THIRD APPEARS TO AFFECT THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. THERE 
IS SOME LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE EXACT TIMING AND TRACK OF 
EACH SYSTEM AND HOW MUCH MOISTURE WILL BE AVAILABLE. AT THIS TIME 
THE MODELS INDICATE THAT MAINLY THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA WILL BE IMPACTED...WITH EMPHASIS OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
FEATURES. WITH THIS IN MIND PLAYED DOWN POPS ACROSS THE VALLEY IN 
CENTRAL EAST TENNESSEE WITH NO MENTION ACROSS THE VALLEY IN 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE A GOOD TEN TO TWENTY DEGREES BELOW NORMAL 
BOTH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS THE NORTHERLY FLOW CONTINUES UNABATED. 
TEMPERATURES WILL MODIFY TO SOME DEGREE SATURDAY AND SUNDAY BUT WILL 
BE TRENDING SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW NORMAL AGAIN BY MONDAY AS CHILLY 
AIR FILLS IN BEHIND THE LATE WEEKEND CLIPPER SYSTEM. IN THIS COLD 
REGIME...ALMOST ALL OF THE PRECIPITATION THAT FALLS DURING THE LONG 
TERM WILL BE IN THE FORM OF SNOW.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...STRONG WINTER STORM 
SYSTEM MOVING IN FOR THE SHORT TERM.  MODELS A BIT SLOWER WITH THE 
APPROACH OF A STRONG COLD FRONT LATE TONIGHT/TUESDAY MORNING.  THIS 
SHOULD KEEP THE BULK FOR THE PRECIP FROM MOVING IN UNTIL VERY LATE 
TONIGHT OR EARLY TUESDAY.  CLOUDS WILL INCREASE OVERNIGHT WITH LOWER 
CLOUDS PUSHING IN LATE.  A FEW SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS MAY WORK INTO 
FAR NORTHERN LOCATIONS TOWARDS SUNRISE.  MAIN BAND OF SNOW WILL PUSH 
IN ON TUESDAY.  ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL IS EXPECTED...ESPECIALLY OVER 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN.  THE FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH RATHER 
QUICKLY...IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY NORTHWEST FLOW AND NORMAL 
ADDITIONAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS MAINLY OVER HIGHER TERRAIN TUESDAY 
NIGHT.  TOTAL SNOWFALL OVER HIGHER TERRAIN SHOULD BE 3 TO 5 INCHES 
WITH SOME HIGHER AMOUNTS OVER THE HIGHEST PEAKS...1 TO 2 INCHES 
POSSIBLE OVER THE LOWER ELEVATIONS OF NORTHEAST TN AND SW VA.  THE 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN TN VALLEY SHOULD SEE LESS THAN AN INCH.  A 
WINTER STORM WARNING IS IN EFFECT LATE TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY NIGHT 
FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  A SNOW ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR THE 
SAME PERIOD FOR THE LOWER ELEVATIONS OF THE NORTHEAST CWA.  
ADDITIONALLY...MUCH COLDER AIR WILL ONCE AGAIN SLIDE INTO THE AREA.  
TEMPERATURES WILL FALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY TUESDAY AND DROP INTO THE 
TEENS AND SINGLE DIGITS TUESDAY NIGHT.  ALSO...BREEZY TO BRISK WINDS 
WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONT.  THE WINDS COMBINED WITH THE COLD 
TEMPERATURES WILL CREATE WINDS CHILLS IN NEAR ZERO OR LOWER TUESDAY 
NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MAIN ADJUSTMENTS MADE FOR 
THESE PERIODS WAS UNFORTUNATELY TO GENERALLY LOWER MAX AND MIN TEMPS 
AS A LONGWAVE TROUGH HOLDS OR RE-DEVELOPS OVER THE ERN 1/3 TO 1/2 OF 
THE NATION THROUGH THESE PERIODS. THESE LOWER TEMPS FROM THE 12Z 
GFSX MOS WERE CLOSER TO ADJACENT NWS GRIDS...AND REASONABLE GIVEN 
PERIODS OF COLD AIR ADVECTION. A WEAK LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW NEVER 
GETS ESTABLISHED BEFORE CLOUDS ARRIVE WITH THE NEXT WEAK SHORTWAVE 
IN THE NW FLOW ALOFT. 

WITH THIS SAID...MOISTURE STILL LOOKS VERY LACKING WITH THE NEXT 
WEAK AND FAST MOVING SHORTWAVE LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. 
FEEL THIS IS A TRACE EVENT/FLURRIES AT BEST...SO OPTED TO JUST CARRY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SW VA AND NE TN ON THURSDAY. ARCTIC HIGH 
SETTLES ACROSS THE REGION FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...THEN A STRONGER 
AND DEEPER SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY.
MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT...EVEN THE CANADIAN MODEL FROM LATEST RUN
FOR THIS SYSTEM. PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS LOOKED GOOD FOR NOW WITH 
SLIGHT CHANCE SATURDAY NIGHT...AND 40 PERCENT CHANCE SW VA/NE TN TO
20 PERCENT CHANCE SE TN ON SUNDAY. INTRODUCING MONDAY AS DRY BUT

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A DRY WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL PROVIDE A SUNNY AND RELATIVELY MILD 
DAY TODAY...WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 40S NORTH TO UPPER 50S SOUTH. 
LEANED ON THE HIGH SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE FOR TEMPS...AS MOS HAS BEEN 
TOO COOL WITH HIGH TEMPS THE PAST FEW DAYS. 

TONIGHT THE FLOW BEGINS TO AMPLIFY AS A POTENT MIDLEVEL VORT MAX 
MOVES FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE MID MS VALLEY REGION...WHICH 
INDUCES CYCLOGENESIS ON THE NC SIDE THE APPALACHIANS TUESDAY 
MORNING. THE NAM DEVELOPS THIS LOW FARTHER SOUTH THAN THE 
GFS/CMC/SREF SOLUTIONS...AND THUS HAS GREATER QPF ALONG THE SPINE OF 
THE APPALACHIANS. PREFER THE GFS/CMC/SREF DEPICTION TO START THE 
EVENT...WHICH LOOKS TO BE LATE TONIGHT. SYNOPTIC QG FORCING AHEAD OF 
THE VORT MAX LOOKS GREATEST BETWEEN 12Z AND 18Z. STILL...JET 
DYNAMICS AND FRONTOGENESIS ARE LACKING WITH THIS SYSTEM OVER OUR 
AREA...SO QPF AMOUNTS ARE NOT IMPRESSIVE. THIS WILL KEEP SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS LIGHT.

AFTER 18Z...THE SYNOPTIC FORCING EXITS...AND WE WILL SEE A NW FLOW 
PATTERN DEVELOP AS THE SURFACE-850 MB LOW STRENGTHENS TO OUR EAST. 
850-700 MB COLD ADVECTION WILL CAUSE FALLING TEMPS THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON ON TUESDAY. A 25-30 KT NORTHERLY FETCH IN THE 925-850 MB 
LAYER WILL HAVE A CONNECTION TO THE GREAT LAKES...PROVIDING 
INSTABILITY AND STEEP LAPSE RATES FOR SNOW SHOWERS AND ENHANCED SNOW 
AMOUNTS IN HIGHER TERRAIN. VERY COLD AIR ALOFT MOVING IN WILL LEAD 
TO HIGH SNOW-TO-LIQUID RATIOS IN THE MOUNTAINS. 

IT APPEARS THAT THERE IS THE POTENTIAL TO REACH 4+ INCHES IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VA AND E TN...SO A WINTER STORM WATCH WILL BE 
ISSUED FOR THESE AREAS BEGINNING AT 09Z TONIGHT. LOWER ELEVATIONS OF 
SW VA AND NE TN APPEAR MORE LIKELY TO BE IN THE 1-3 INCH 
RANGE...WITH AN INCH OR LESS IN THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND CENTRAL 
VALLEY AREAS. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
THE ALBERTA-CLIPPER TYPE SYSTEM AND DEEPENING CYCLOGENESIS OFF THE 
COASTS WILL BE MOVING WELL NORTHEAST OF THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. 
NORTHWEST FLOW WILL BE WEAKENING TUESDAY EVENING...BUT WILL CONTINUE 
WITH HIGH POPS FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING WITH ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATONS OF 1 TO POSSIBLY 2 INCHES. THE 
WATCH WILL CONTINUE INTO TUESDAY NIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS 
ADDITIONAL SNOWFALL.

MAIN CONCERN/STORY FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WILL BE ARCTIC-LIKE 
COLD TEMPERATURES. ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKE 
STATES WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH ANOTHER ARCTIC FRONT 
MOVING THROUGH EARLY THURSDAY MORNING. MOISTURE IS VERY LIMITED WITH 
MAIN EFFECTS BEING RE-ENFORCEMENT OF VERY COLD AIR. THE ARCTIC HIGH 
WILL BUILD INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY.

FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE MOVES THROUGH 
THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY WITH A COLD FRONT MOVING 
THROUGH SUNDAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS FOR NOW.

.DISCUSSION...
ONLY MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO THE FORECAST TONIGHT AS EVERYTHING
APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK. LOWERED WINDS A BIT AS BRIEF RIDGING TAKES
PLACE TONIGHT. THIS HAS PROMOTED MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS AS
WELL...ALLOWING FOR GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING AS TEMPERATURES HAVE
DROPPED INTO THE LOW TO MID 30S /WITH A FEW UPPER 20S READINGS
ALONG THE MOUNTAINS/. DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW TO MID 20S WILL PREVENT
TEMPERATURES FROM DROPPING TOO MUCH FARTHER...AND THEY WILL BOTTOM
OUT GENERALLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 20S BY DAYBREAK.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
250 PM EST SUN JAN 19 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER THE CAROLINAS...WITH A DRY AIR MASS 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE THAT A SOUTHWESTERLY WIND 
FLOW WILL DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY...AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT FROM THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY. AS A 
RESULT...A BRIEF WARMING TREND WILL DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
ON MONDAY WITH HIGHS RISING INTO THE 50S. HOWEVER...ANOTHER SHORT 
WAVE TROUGH IS PROGGED TO DIVE SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH THE LONG WAVE 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH THAT HAS PERSISTED OVER THE EASTERN PART OF THE 
NATION. THIS SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL PUSH ANOTHER CLIPPER SYSTEM AND 
ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE LATE 
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING TIME PERIOD. NORTHWESTERLY WINDS 
BEHIND THE TROUGH AXIS WILL PRODUCE UPSLOPE FLOW OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA ON TUESDAY...WITH SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS DEVELOPING ESPECIALLY 
OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. MODEL SOUNDINGS 
INDICATE THAT THE LOWER LEVELS WILL BE FAIRLY DRY AFTER THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE EARLY TUESDAY MORNING...SO IT APPEARS THAT MOST SNOWFALL 
ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THIS NEXT 
COLD FRONT ON TUESDAY WILL BRING IN MUCH COLDER AIR...WITH TEMPS 
EXPECTED TO FALL BETWEEN 15 AND 20 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES 
ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...AS WITH YESTERDAYS 
DISCUSSION...NOT MUCH CHANGE IN OVERALL PATTERN. LONG WAVE TROUGH 
WILL REMAIN OVER OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES THROUGH THE LONG 
TERM PROVIDING US WITH A GENERALLY NORTHWEST FLOW. DURING THIS 
FORECAST PERIOD...WE SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY CLIPPER SYSTEMS AFFECTING 
OUR AREA IN TERMS OF SNOWFALL ACCUMULATION...AS THE TWO CLIPPER 
SYSTEMS THAT MOVE THROUGH SHOULD STAY MAINLY TO OUR NORTH. THEY WILL 
HOWEVER BRING MORE ROUNDS OF REINFORCING COLDER AIR. 

EXPECT WEDNESDAY TO BE CHILLY WITH HIGHS IN THE 20S AND 30S WITH 
MORE CLOUDS NORTH THAN SOUTH. ANOTHER WEAK WAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH 
LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY. AS MENTIONED...THE WAVE WILL 
STAY MAINLY TO OUR NORTH AND SHOULD ONLY BRING POSSIBLE FLURRIES TO 
THE SMOKY MTNS...NE TN AND SW VA...ALONG WITH INCREASED CLOUD COVER. 
TEMPS WARM UP SLIGHTLY ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. 
HIGHS AROUND 40 FOR THE SOUTHERN VALLEY...UPPER 30S CENTRAL 
VALLEY...MID 30S NE TN...AND NEAR 30 TO MID 30S FOR SW VA. WARMER 
LOWS ALSO FOR FRIDAY NIGHT WITH LOW IN THE TEENS TO LOW 20S AREA 
WIDE.  

THE END OF THE LONG TERM STILL HAS A LOT OF DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE 
GFS AND ECMWF. GFS STILL SHOWING MOISTURE COMING OUT OF GULF BUT 
LONGWAVE TROUGH KEEPING IT SUPPRESSED TO GULF COAST WHICH WOULD KEEP 
US DRY. THE ECMWF SHOWS THE SAME LONGWAVE TROUGH BUT ALLOWS THE 
MOISTURE TO SPREAD MUCH FURTHER NORTH...UP INTO MID MISSISSIPPI/ 
ALABAMA/AND GEORGIA...AND TRIES TO PHASE IT WITH THE LONGWAVE TROUGH 
WHICH WOULD GIVE US A SHOT AT PRECIP. WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW 
FUTURE MODEL RUNS HANDLE THIS BEFORE TRYING TO NAIL DOWN A FORECAST. 
ALSO...MODELS ARE HINTING AT BREAK IN THE LONGWAVE PATTERN A FEW 
DAYS PAST THE END OF THE LONG TERM. THIS WOULD RESULT IN A RETURN TO 
MORE OF A ZONAL FLOW.

HAVING SAID ALL THAT...MAIN WEATHER STORY WILL BE ARCTIC AIR 
SPILLING INTO THE REGION FOR TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING. WIND 
CHILLS MAY DROP TO NEAR ZERO FOR THE VALLEYS AND 5 TO 15 DEGREES 
BELOW ZERO FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AT TIMES THROUGH THE PERIOD.

321 AM EST SUN JAN 19 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
SHOWERS ON RADAR DO NOT APPEAR TO BE REACHING THE GROUND...AS NO 
SURFACE OBS HAVE REPORTED ANY PRECIP FOR THE PAST SEVERAL 
HOURS...AND THE 00Z OHX SOUNDING IS VERY DRY BELOW 700 MB. WEAK LIFT 
ALOFT WILL NOT LIKELY BE ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THIS DRY AIR...AND SO 
ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL LOOKS UNLIKELY. AT MOST...A DUSTING MAY BE 
POSSIBLE IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY WILL BE 
CANCELLED. 

SATELLITE TRENDS SHOW MIDLEVEL CLOUDS WILL BE CLEARING THE AREA BY 
MID MORNING...BUT SOME LOWER CLOUDS CURRENTLY OVER W KY AND S IL 
WILL KEEP CLOUDS IN NORTHERN AREAS INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON. TEMPS 
IN NORTHERN AREAS WILL REMAIN IN THE 30S AS A RESULT...WITH CENTRAL 
AND SOUTHERN VALLEY AREAS IN THE LOWER TO MID 40S. BEHIND THE 
EXITING UPPER TROUGH TONIGHT...WE WILL SEE A NEARLY ZONAL FLOW 
PROVIDING DRY AIR AND CLEAR SKIES...BUT PERHAPS BREEZY IN THE 
MOUNTAINS AS A SURFACE LOW TRACKS ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. LOWS WILL 
BE MAINLY IN THE 20S.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
THE EXTENDED PERIOD WILL REMAIN UNDER NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT DUE TO A 
LONG-WAVE TROUGH OVER SOUTHEAST CANADA. A SERIES OF ALBERTA-LIKE 
CLIPPERS WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST INTO THE TROUGH...BUT MOISTURE IS 
LIMITED. A WAVE DOES MOVE ACROSS THE AREA LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY...THEN ANOTHER FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY.

THE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY SYSTEM IS THE STRONGEST WITH THE BEST 
MOISTURE. LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE FAVORED 
NORTHWEST FLOW OROGRAPHIC LIFT. LATEST NAM MODELS DOES SHOW SOME 
LOW-LEVEL INSTABILITY WITH CAPES OF 50-80 J/KG FOR TUESDAY...SO WILL 
LIKELY SEE SOME SNOW SHOWERS ACTIVITY EVEN INTO THE NORTHERN AND 
CENTRAL VALLEYS AND NORTHERN PLATEAU. OVERALL...BESIDES THE 
MOUNTAINS ONLY A DUSTING ANTICIPATED.

THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY SYSTEM IS FARTHER NORTH AND WEAKER FOR 
OUR AREA. HAVE ONLY INCLUDED FLURRIES.

MAIN WEATHER STORY WILL BE ARCTIC AIR SPILLING INTO THE REGION FOR

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
739 PM EST SAT JAN 18 2014

.DISCUSSION...
THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE UPDATE THIS EVENING WAS ON THE NEED FOR
AN EXPANDED WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR THE NORTHERN
PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA AND
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE...WHICH COMPLIMENTS THE EXISTING ADVISORY FOR
THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE SMOKIES. DESPITE SOME DRY AIR PRESENT IN
THE BOUNDARY LAYER...CONDITIONS LOOK FAVORABLE FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF
SNOW SHOWERS AGAIN TONIGHT INTO EARLY SUNDAY MORNING...WHICH COULD
PRODUCE ACCUMULATIONS OF 1 TO 2 INCHES IN THESE AREAS...AND UP TO 4
INCHES ALONG THE SPINE OF THE MOUNTAINS. SOUNDINGS INDICATE VERY
COLD AIR ALOFT /AND COMBINED WITH INCREASED MOISTURE/RH VALUES
LATER TONIGHT AND SOME GOOD FRONTOGENESIS SEEN AT 700 MB/...THE
POTENTIAL FOR BANDING FEATURES AND SOME BURSTS OF LIGHT TO MODERATE
SNOW IN THESE AREAS SEEMS PROBABLE. GIVEN THE COLD AIR
ALOFT...SNOW RATIOS SHOULD BE HIGH ONCE AGAIN...ALLOWING AN INCH
OR TWO OF SNOW TO QUICKLY ACCUMULATE IN THESE AREAS. SNOW SHOWERS
HAVE ALREADY MOVED INTO THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND PORTIONS OF
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...AND WILL EXPAND SOUTH AND EAST OF THE COURSE
OF THE EVENING/NIGHT. THUS THE REASONING FOR EXPANDING THE ADVISORY
FROM 00Z THIS EVENING THROUGH 15Z SUNDAY MORNING. BY MID-SUNDAY
MORNING...THE PRECIPITATION WILL HAVE TAPERED OFF...EXCEPT FOR A FEW
LINGERING SPOTS ALONG THE MOUNTAINS.

&&

.AVIATION...
UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE SE THROUGH THE TN VALLEY TONIGHT. MID LEVEL 
CLOUD DECK WILL LOWER TO MVFR OVERNIGHT WITH LIGHT SNOW AT TRI AND 
TYS. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE TAF SITES EARLY ON SUNDAY. 
SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL SHIFT SLIGHTLY TO THE WEST AND INCREASE 
BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. CLOUD DECKS WILL CLEAR FROM THE SW ON SUNDAY 
BUT CONTINUE AT TRI UNTIL THE END OF THE PERIOD. SON

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
305 PM EST SAT JAN 18 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE NORTHERN GULF 
COAST...WITH THE NEXT CLIPPER SYSTEM OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY. 
THIS CLIPPER SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD TOWARDS 
THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...SPREADING LIGHT PRECIP OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS EVENING. NORTHWESTERLY UPSLOPE FLOW THEN DEVELOPS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA BEHIND THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS AFTER MIDNIGHT...WITH 
SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS EXPECTED. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT LAPSE 
RATES WILL NOT BE AS STEEP WITH THIS SYSTEM (AS COMPARED TO THE LAST 
CLIPPER SYSTEM)...BUT MID LEVEL FORCING APPEARS TO BE A LITTLE 
STRONGER. OVERALL...MODELS INDICATE SIMILAR PRECIP AMOUNTS WITH THIS 
SYSTEM COMPARED TO THE LAST SYSTEM. SINCE A FEW INCHES OF SNOW 
ACCUMULATED OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WITH THE LAST SYSTEM...THINK 
A WINTER WX ADVISORY WILL BE A GOOD IDEA FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
OF SOUTHWEST VA AND EAST TN. THE UPPER LEVELS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE 
AS COLD WITH TONIGHT'S SYSTEM (COMPARED TO THE LAST SYSTEM)...SO 
THINK THE LIQUID TO SNOW RATIOS SHOULD NOT BE AS HIGH AS WHAT WAS 
OBSERVED WITH LAST NIGHT'S SYSTEM (WHEN A 1:30 OF 1:40 LIQUID TO 
SNOW RATIO WAS OBSERVED).

YET ANOTHER SHORT WAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE 
SOUTHEASTWARD ON MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE LONG WAVE UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH PATTERN LINGERING OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. WILL 
MENTION SOME LOW CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY NIGHT IN ADVANCE OF THIS 
NEXT SYSTEM. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE 
SOME DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A NEW DAY BUT YET THE SAME 
OLD STORY. NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST 
DISCUSSION. A LARGE SCALE UPPER TROUGH WILL REMAIN OVER THE EASTERN 
UNITED STATES DUE TO RIDGING ACROSS THE WESTERN U.S. THROUGHOUT THE 
LONG TERM WE WILL HAVE TWO MORE MORE CLIPPERS SWING DOWN OUT OF 
CANADA AND ACROSS OUR REGION...GIVING US CHANCES FOR LIGHT SNOW WITH 
EACH SYSTEM AND YET MORE SHOTS OF COLDER AIR.

AS WITH THE PAST FEW CLIPPERS...MOISTURE FOR TUESDAYS SYSTEM STILL 
LOOKS RATHER LIMITED WHICH WILL LIMIT ANY SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS 
ACROSS THE LOWER ELEVATIONS. THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS COULD STILL SEE 
SOME MINOR ACCUMULATIONS AS THEY ARE TYPICALLY THE WINNERS WITH 
THESE TYPE OF SYSTEMS...IN TERMS OF ACCUMULATION...DUE TO THE 
OROGRAPHIC LIFT PRODUCED BY THE NORTHWEST FLOW. THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS COULD SEE AN INCH OR TWO BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON.

ANOTHER WEAKER WAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. 
MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE BULK OF THE ENERGY TO OUR NORTH AND HAVE 
EVEN FURTHER LIMITED MOISTURE COMPARED TO THE TUESDAY WAVE. THIS 
WILL LIKELY LIMIT ANY SNOWFALL TO EXTREME NE TN AND INTO SW VA... 
WHICH WILL AGAIN BE ON THE LIGHT SIDE DUE TO LIMITED MOISTURE. NOT 
EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF ANY ACCUMULATION AT THIS POINT. 

GENERALLY...HIGH TEMPERATURES TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY IN THE 20S/30S 
AND LOWS IN THE SINGLE DIGITS AND TEENS. WIND CHILLS WILL LIKELY 
DROP BELOW ZERO ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION WITH 5 TO 15 BELOW ZERO 
FOR THE MOUNTAINS. MODELS IN DISAGREEMENT ON PATTERN FOR SATURDAY. 
PREVIOUS RUNS WERE SHOWING POTENTIAL LOW AND ASSOCIATED MOISTURE 
COMING UP OUT OF THE GULF WHILE NEW RUNS CONTINUE THE LONGWAVE 
TROUGH AND NORTHWEST FLOW OVER OUR AREA.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS AND FLURRIES EARLY THIS MORNING SHOULD EXIT THE 
AREA BY 12Z AS WE SEE MIDLEVEL DRYING AND STABILIZATION. TODAY LOOKS 
TO BE MOSTLY SUNNY WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPS IN THE 30S TO LOWER 40S 
WITH A SHORTWAVE RIDGE OVERHEAD. 
 
THE NEXT CLIPPER SYSTEM...CURRENTLY OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS...WILL 
BEGIN TO AFFECT THE AREA THIS EVENING. THE FAST MOVEMENT AND WEAK 
LIFT OF THIS SYSTEM SHOULD KEEP PRECIP AMOUNTS LIGHT...BUT TEMPS 
WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW FROM START TO FINISH. SW TO W WINDS 
THROUGH 850 MB ARE NOT FAVORABLE FOR ENHANCED SNOWFALL IN HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS...SO WILL KEEP SNOW AMOUNTS BELOW ADVISORY LEVELS. 2 
INCHES LOOKS TO BE ON THE HIGH END IN THE MOUNTAINS...WITH A DUSTING 
TO 1 INCH POSSIBLE IN NE TN AND SW VA. THE 850 MB THERMAL TROUGH 
MOVES OVERHEAD 12Z-15Z SUNDAY MORNING...SO WILL KEEP SOME SNOW 
SHOWERS AND FLURRIES GOING AFTER 12Z. THIS SHOULD END BY NOON AS 
MOISTURE PULLS OUT. SW WINDS TONIGHT MAY APPROACH ADVISORY CRITERIA 
IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS...BUT WILL STAY JUST BELOW THIS LEVEL FOR NOW. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
A LARGE SCALE UPPER TROUGH WILL REMAIN ACROSS SOUTHEAST CANADA
WITH FLOW NORTHWESTERLY THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE EXTENDED. A SERIES
OF SHORT-WAVES (ALBERT-CLIPPER TYPE SYSTEMS) WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST
INTO THE UPPER TROUGH. AS SHORT-TERM FORECASTER MENTIONED...FIRST
WAVE GOES THROUGH LATE TONIGHT AND SUNDAY WITH THE NEXT ONE FOR
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. THESE WAVES WILL BRING IN RE-ENFORCEMENT
OF COLDER AIR.

MOISTURE FOR THE TUESDAY SYSTEM REMAINS LIMITED...BUT ENOUGH TO 
SQUEEZE OUT LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS...MAINLY FOR THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS WHERE OROGRAPHIC LIFT WILL ENHANCE SNOWFALL. 

ANOTHER WEAK WAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. 
THIS WAVE IS QUITE WEAK WITH THE BRUNT OF THE ENERGY STAYING WELL 
NORTH OF THE AREA. HOWEVER...ANOTHER RE-ENFORCEMENT OF COLD AIR 
ANTICIPATED. WILL MENTION ARCTIC-LIKE AIR FOR TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY 
WITH HIGHS IN THE 20S/30S AND LOWS IN THE SINGLE DIGITS AND TEENS. 
WIND CHILLS WILL LIKELY DROP BELOW ZERO ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION 
WITH 5 TO 15 BELOW ZERO FOR THE MOUNTAINS.

INCREASED POPS ALONG THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS TO ACCOUNT FOR A GREATER
COVERAGE OF SNOW SHOWERS THIS EVENING. SOME SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS
OF UP TO AN INCH WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA AND EAST TENNESSEE /PARTICULARLY THROUGH 06Z/...BUT THE
ACTIVITY WILL BEGIN TO WANE BY LATE TONIGHT. A FEW LOCALLY HIGHER
AMOUNTS MAY BE POSSIBLE FOR LOCATIONS UNDERNEATH THE HEAVIER BANDS
AND ALONG THE PEAKS OF THE MOUNTAINS. ADDITIONALLY...HAVE INCREASED
CLOUD COVER TO OVERCAST ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA THROUGH 06Z
AS DECK OF LOW STRATUS HAS MOVED OVER THE REGION FROM THE WRAP-
AROUND MOISTURE ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE LOW. THINK THAT THIS CLOUD
COVER WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT NORTHEASTWARD AND BEGIN TO BREAK UP BY
LATE TONIGHT...ALLOWING FOR AT LEAST A PARTLY CLOUDY SKY OVER MUCH
OF THE REGION BY EARLY THIS MORNING. WITH THE CLOUD AIR ADVECTION
TAKING PLACE...LOWS WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE TEENS AREAWIDE BY
DAYBREAK. THE SOMEWHAT BREEZY WINDS WILL ALLOW RESULT IN SOME NEAR-
ZERO TO SUBZERO WIND CHILLS ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AFTER 06Z...THOUGH
ALL BUT A FEW SPOTS WILL REMAIN ABOVE ADVISORY CRITERIA.

FRONT. CURRENT SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS AN AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH OVER THE OHIO AND TN RIVER VALLEYS VERY WELL...WITH ITS SWIRL 
OF CLOUDS CENTERED AROUND SOUTHERN INDIANA. AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME 
LIGHT PRECIP OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS 
OCCURRING IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH...BUT THIS 
ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE IN COVERAGE AS THE SUN SETS THIS 
EVENING. PERSISTENT WESTERLY WINDS TONIGHT WILL COMBINE WITH COLD 
TEMPS TO PRODUCE VERY COLD WIND CHILL VALUES. IN FACT...IT APPEARS 
THAT WIND CHILL VALUES OVER THE MOUNTAINS COULD FALL TO NEAR -5 
DEGREES (WIND CHILL ADVISORY CRITERIA) LATER TONIGHT...BUT THESE 
ADVISORY VALUES SHOULD BE BRIEF AND LIMITED TO THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN 
PEAKS. THUS...WILL NOT ISSUE  A WIND CHILL ADVISORY FOR THE 
MOUNTAINS TONIGHT.

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT ANOTHER UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE 
WILL QUICKLY DIVE SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH THE LONG WAVE TROUGH OVER 
THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION ON SATURDAY...AND WILL PUSH ANOTHER 
FAST-MOVING COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY MORNING. MODELS ALSO AGREE THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL HAVE LIMITED 
MOISTURE...WITH ONLY LIGHT PRECIP AMOUNTS EXPECTED OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME 
DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...OVERALL WEATHER PATTERN THROUGH 
THE EXTENDED WILL BE AN UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WITH A 
SERIES OF WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS AND DISTURBANCES DROPPING IN 
ALONG THE UPPER FLOW. MONDAY SHOULD BE THE MOST PLEASANT DAY OF THE 
EXTENDED WITH GENERALLY DRY AND WARM CONDITIONS. THE FIRST SYSTEM 
MOVING THROUGH WILL BE A WEAK COLD FRONT PUSHING IN MONDAY NIGHT 
INTO TUESDAY. LITTLE MOISTURE WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONT FOR SCATTERED 
LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES. ALSO ACCOMPANYING THE FRONT WILL BE ANOTHER 
BLAST OF COLDER AIR. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BRIEFLY NOSE IN ON 
WEDNESDAY. A WEAK DISTURBANCE WILL MOVE THROUGH TO OUR NORTH ON 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. THIS MAY GENERATE A MINOR WEAK 
NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW OR FLURRIES. MODELS DIVERGE SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE

THURSDAY NIGHT. CONFIDENCE LOW ON THIS BUT DID INTRODUCE 20 TO 30

CURRENT SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS AN AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER

CENTERED OVER SOUTHERN INDIANA. AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME LIGHT PRECIP 
OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU OCCURRING IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AND ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. THIS UPPER TROUGH 
WILL HELP TO CREATE SOME STEEP LAPSE RATES OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH SHOULD HELP TO GENERATE SOME SCATTERED 
SNOW/RAIN SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. SOUNDINGS REVEAL A VERY DRY AIR MASS BELOW 850 MB... 
WITH ONLY A SHALLOW OF MOISTURE AROUND 850 MB. ALSO...A MID LEVEL 
INVERSION BETWEEN 750 AND 600 MB SHOULD HELP TO LIMIT MUCH VERTICAL 
DEVELOPMENT OF THESE SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON. THUS...EXPECT PRECIP 
AMOUNTS WITH THESE SHOWERS TO BE LIGHT...AND TEMPS IN THE LOWER 40S 
SHOULD HELP TO LIMIT ANY POSSIBLE SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS IN THE 
LOWER ELEVATIONS BELOW 2500 FEET.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
PRECIP MOVING QUICKLY ACROSS THE AREA THIS MORNING IS ASSOCIATED 
WITH A STRONG 500 MB VORT MAX...WHICH SHOULD BE CLOSE TO EXITING THE 
NE PORTIONS OF OUR AREA AROUND 12Z. WILL KEEP SOME CHANCE POPS IN SW 
VA AND NE TN THROUGH 14Z. THE FAST MOVEMENT OF THIS VORT MAX SHOULD 
MEAN ANY ACCUMULATION WILL BE LIGHT WITH NO NEED FOR AN ADVISORY. 

AFTER THIS VORT MAX EXITS...WE SHOULD SEE A DRY PERIOD WITH CLEARING 
SKIES UNTIL AROUND NOON. FALLING TEMPS ALOFT IN THE AFTERNOON WILL 
GENERATE CONVECTIVE RAIN SHOWERS IN THE VALLEY...AND SNOW SHOWERS IN 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. SOME VALLEY LOCATIONS COULD SEE A BRIEF BURST OF 
SNOW WITH HEAVIER PRECIP...BUT SURFACE TEMPS LOOK TOO WARM FOR ANY 
ACCUMULATION OUTSIDE ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FT. THE SURFACE COLD 
FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH 18-21Z...LOWERING THE FREEZING LEVEL AND 
CHANGING ALL PRECIP TO SNOW SHOWERS BY 00Z. THIS WILL ALSO BRING A 
DECREASE IN INSTABILITY...SO COVERAGE OF SHOWERS WILL BE DECREASING 
AFTER DARK. 

THE 20 KT WESTERLY WINDS UP TO 850 MB WILL NOT BE IDEAL FOR 
SIGNIFICANT UPSLOPE ENHANCEMENT...ALTHOUGH SNOW-LIQUID RATIOS WILL 
BECOME QUITE HIGH OVERNIGHT AS TEMPS DROP QUICKLY. DECREASING 
MOISTURE DEPTH AND INCREASING MIDLEVEL TEMPS WILL END MOST OF THE 
SHOWERS BEFORE 12Z. FORECAST SNOW AMOUNTS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
OF SW VA AND THE TN MOUNTAINS...MAINLY AT OR ABOVE 2500 FT...WILL BE 
1 TO 2 INCHES. OTHER PARTS OF SW VA ARE EXPECTED TO SEE A DUSTING TO 
1 INCH...WITH A DUSTING POSSIBLE IN THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND NE TN 
VALLEY AREA.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE EXTENDED A DEEP LONG-WAVE UPPER TROUGH WILL 
BE CENTERED ACROSS SOUTHEAST CANADA/FAR NORTHEAST UNITED STATES. A 
SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST INTO THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. FIRST SUCH WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY WITH A CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS/FLURRIES...ESPECIALLY OVER THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN WHERE OROGRAPHIC NORTHWEST FLOW WILL ENHANCE SNOWFALL.
LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN. 

NEXT WAVE COMES INTO THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. THIS WAVE 
WILL PULL A VERY COLD ARCTIC FRONT THROUGH THE AREA WITH SNOW 
SHOWERS/FLURRIES ANTICIPATED. AT THIS TIME...MOISTURE IS QUITE 
SHALLOW AND TRAJECTORY IS NOT FAVORABLE FOR GOOD OROGRAPHIC 
NORTHWEST FLOW SNOWFALL. WILL KEEP ONLY LOW POPS FOR NOW.

WAVE NUMBER THREE COMES INTO THE REGION FOR LATE WEDNESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. LATEST GFS AND ECMWF HAVE BIG DIFFERENCES IN AMOUNT 
OF MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS. THE 00Z ECMWF IS THE STRONGEST. NCEP IS 
FAVORING A BLEND OF 00Z GFS AND PREVIOUS 12Z ECMWF...WHICH SUGGEST A 
LIGHTER SNOWFALL. WILL ONLY HAVE LOW POPS AT BEST FOR NOW. HOWEVER...
THIS WAVE WILL BRING EVEN COLDER AIR INTO THE REGION.

OVERALL...MAIN WEATHER STORY FOR THE EXTENDED...ESPECIALLY FOR NEXT 
WEEK...WILL BE THE RETURN OF ARCTIC AIR INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH 
ANOTHER SECONDARY COLD FRONT BEHIND IT OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER 
VALLEY. THIS SECONDARY COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO CATCH UP WITH THE 
LEAD COLD FRONT AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AROUND SUNRISE 
ON FRIDAY MORNING. AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH PUSHING THESE COLD FRONTS 
IS PROGGED TO FURTHER AMPLIFY OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION ON 
FRIDAY...WITH THE TROUGH AXIS SWINGING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
DURING THE LATE FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING HOURS. MODELS ARE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THIS UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL NOT HAVE MUCH 
MOISTURE WITH IT...ESPECIALLY IN THE LOWER LEVELS. THUS...ANY PRECIP 
SHOULD BE LIGHT AND SCATTERED IN NATURE. IN ADDITION...TEMPS SHOULD 
RISE INTO THE MID 30S TO LOWER 40S OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA... 
SO THINK THAT ANY SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE LIGHT AND MAINLY 
CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET. NORTHWESTERLY 
UPSLOPE FLOW DOES NOT DEVELOP UNTIL FRIDAY EVENING...WHEN MOST OF 
THE MOISTURE WILL HAVE EXITED THE REGION. SO...NOT SURE THAT THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS WILL SEE MUCH MORE SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS THAN AN 
INCH OR TWO. BECAUSE OF THIS...WILL NOT ISSUE ANY WINTER WEATHER 
ADVISORIES FOR THE MOUNTAINS AT THIS TIME. ANOTHER FAST-MOVING 
CLIPPER SYSTEM WILL RACE INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY NIGHT... 
BUT AGAIN...THIS SYSTEM APPEARS TO HAVE LIMITED MOISTURE WITH ONLY 
LIGHT PRECIP AMOUNTS EXPECTED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES 
ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...WILL SEE A SERIES OF WEAK 
SYSTEMS/SHORT WAVES RIDING THROUGH UPPER FLOW THROUGHOUT THE

OUT TO BE LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES. MONDAY WE WILL BE BETWEEN IMPULSES

BUT WITH LITTLE MOISTURE ATTACHED AND WILL KEEP POPS 20 TO 30 WITH 
BEST CHANCES NORTH. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE NUDGES IN BRIEFLY FOR

1010 AM EST THU JAN 16 2014

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED 
ALONG THE NORTHERN GULF COAST...WHICH EXTENDS NORTHWARD OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE AREA OF 
CLOUDS OVER THE WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WHICH WERE 
OCCURRING AHEAD OF A DEEPENING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE UPPER MS 
RIVER VALLEY. THIS UPPER TROUGH IS PROGGED TO CONTINUE AMPLIFYING 
OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY TODAY...SO THINK INCREASING CLOUDS WILL BE 
THE TREND THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 

WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS MORNING TO MENTION 'INCREASING 
CLOUDINESS' EVERYWHERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON...AND TO TWEAK TEMPS A 
LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
CLEARING BEHIND THE SHORTWAVE THAT MOVED THROUGH YESTERDAY WILL
CONTINUE EARLY THIS MORNING...ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO COOL INTO THE
UPPER TEENS AND LOWER 20S BY DAYBREAK. SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS WILL
INCREASE OVER THE COURSE OF THE MORNING AND INTO THE AFTERNOON
AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING UPPER-TROUGH. THOUGH THERE MAY BE SOME
PASSING CLOUD COVER...PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS AND THE SOUTHWEST
FLOW WILL HELP TO PUSH HIGHS BACK INTO THE 40S...BEFORE SOME MORE
DENSE CLOUD COVER AND LIGHT PRECIPITATION MOVE IN AFTER SUNSET.
MODELS /PARTICULARLY THE NAM/ HAVE BEEN TRENDING DRIER...SO HAVE
REMOVED MENTIONABLE POPS FROM THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE CWA BEFORE
06Z. WITH COLDER AIR FILTERING IN...SOME LIGHT ISOLATED TO
SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED /GENERALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN
HALF OF THE CWA/ AFTER MIDNIGHT. HOWEVER...ONLY MINOR ACCUMULATIONS
ARE EXPECTED AND THEY SHOULD BE CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
MODELS ARE APPEARING TO BE 
DRIER FOR THE SHORTWAVE AND COLD FRONT APPROACHING ON FRIDAY. OPTED 
TO LOWER POPS FOR FRIDAY MORNING GIVEN THIS DRIER TREND. HOWEVER...
THE LAPSE RATES STEEPEN BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS
CREATING LOW LEVEL POSITIVE CAPES OF 50 TO 100 J/KG. THE UPSLOPE 
COMPONENT OF SFC-850 MB WINDS IS NOT REAL IMPRESSIVE...BUT FEEL THAT 
THE DAYTIME INSTABILITY AND MODERATE COLD AIR ADVECTION SHOULD 
PRODUCE AT LEAST SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS. PROBABLY GREATER COVERAGE 
AT TIMES FOR SW VA AND EXTREME NE TN COUNTIES...THUS WENT LIKELY FOR 
THOSE AREAS. THIS BLENDED NICELY WITH ADJACENT GRIDS FROM 
JKL/RLX/RNK. DUE TO HIGHER POPS A MENTION OF POSSIBLE LIGHT SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS.

THE PROLONGED UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL KEEP TEMPS BELOW NORMAL AT 
LEAST INTO SUNDAY...BUT MOISTURE LOOKS VERY LIMITED WITH ANY PASSING 
SHORTWAVE ENERGY OVER THE WEEKEND. KEPT POPS LIMITED TO SATURDAY 
NIGHT FOR NOW...MORE IN LINE WITH GFS AND SREF. WARMEST DAY WILL BE 
MONDAY AND MILDEST NIGHT MONDAY NIGHT...THEN HEIGHTS FALL AGAIN AS 
UPPER TROUGH DEEPENS FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...DROPPING TEMPS 
BELOW CLIMO AGAIN. LOW POPS KEPT FOR MONDAY TO WEDNESDAY FOR 
CONTINUITY IN GENERAL...ALTHOUGH AGAIN MOISTURE SHOULD BE LACKING.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER THE CAROLINAS...WITH FAIRLY WARM 
TEMPS IN THE MID 30S TO MID 40S LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
AREA RADARS REVEAL ONLY VERY LIGHT PRECIP OVER NORTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST VA THIS AFTERNOON...WITH NOT MUCH PRECIP OCCURRING OVER 
MIDDLE TN AND CENTRAL KY IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN AMPLIFIED UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH. AS A RESULT...WILL PLAN TO CANCEL THE WINTER WX 
ADVISORY FOR THE MOUNTAINS...SINCE ANY ADDITIONAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
THIS EVENING SHOULD BE ONLY AROUND AN INCH OR LESS. MODELS INDICATE 
THAT ANOTHER UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL QUICKLY AMPLIFY OVER THE 
CENTRAL PART OF THE NATION ON THURSDAY...WHICH WILL PUSH ANOTHER 
COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. 
MODELS HAVE DISAGREEMENTS WITH HOW MUCH MOISTURE WILL BE AVAILABLE 
WITH THIS COLD FRONT...BUT THEY ALL GENERALLY AGREE THAT MOISTURE 
WILL BE FAIRLY LIMITED WITH ONLY LIGHT PRECIP AMOUNTS EXPECTED. WITH 
TEMPS EXPECTED TO RISE INTO THE UPPER 30S TO MID 40S OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...THINK THAT ANY SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS WITH 
THIS NEXT COLD FRONT WILL BE LIGHT...AND MAINLY CONFINED TO THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...AND 
LOOK REASONABLE. FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...WILL GENERALLY 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO SETS OF GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...BASICALLY WENT CLOSER TO 
THE ECMWF FOR THE PERIOD ALTHOUGH MODELS WERE SIMILAR WITH MUCH OF 
THE LONG TERM EXCEPT FOR DAY SEVEN. ANOTHER FAST MOVING SHORT WAVE 
DROPS SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE CENTRAL CANADIAN PROVINCES DURING THE DAY 
SATURDAY IN TIME TO PRODUCE A BRIEF PERIOD OF SNOW SHOWERS MAINLY IN 
THE MAJOR TERRAIN AREAS SATURDAY NIGHT. DRY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW TAKES 
OVER SUNDAY INTO MONDAY HOWEVER ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH BUILDS INTO AND 
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY 
NIGHT GENERATING SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION. DUE TO UNCERTAINTY AT 
THIS TIME RANGE AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BELOW FREEZING 
TEMPERATURES...ESPECIALLY DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS INCLUDING THE 
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY NIGHT PERIODS...KEPT A MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW 
IN THE FORECAST. STAYED CLOSE TO SIMILAR GUIDANCE BLEND FOR 
TEMPERATURES THROUGH MOST OF THE PERIOD WHILE ADJUSTING CLOSER TO 
THE COOLER MEX MOS ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER THE CAROLINAS... 
WITH TEMPS ABOVE FREEZING STILL LINGERING OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL ONLY VERY LIGHT PRECIP OVER NORTHEAST TN 
AND SOUTHWEST VA...WITH NOT MUCH PRECIP OCCURRING BEHIND THIS

HOWEVER...MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE LIMITED AND GENERALLY IN A SHALLOW 
LAYER AROUND 850 MB. THUS...SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS WILL STILL BE 
POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON WITH THIS UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH...BUT ANY SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS SHOULD BE SCATTERED AND LESS 
THAN AN INCH (ESPECIALLY WITH HIGH TEMPS EXPECTED TO BE AROUND 40

329 AM EST WED JAN 15 2014

.SHORT TERM.../TODAY AND TONIGHT/... 
AN UPPER-TROUGH EXTENDING FROM THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE SOUTHERN
TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL PUSH A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE REGION THIS
MORNING. ALONG/AHEAD OF THE BOUNDARY...LIGHT PRECIPITATION HAS
FORMED ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND IS NOW AT THE DOORSTEP OF THE
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES. THERE IS LIMITED MOISTURE AND WEAK
FRONTOGENTIC LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM...WHICH WILL HINDER
THE POTENTIAL FOR MUCH IN THE WAY OF APPRECIABLE PRECIPITATION
TOTALS. COLDER AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE AREA THIS MORNING...WHICH
WILL PUSH LOW TEMPERATURES TO AT OR JUST BELOW FREEZING IN MOST
LOCATIONS BY DAYBREAK. THIS...ALONG WITH THE TIMING OF THIS LIGHT
PRECIPITATION WILL LEAD TO SOME LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS OF UP
TO AN INCH ALONG THE PLATEAU...THE CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS AND FAR
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...WITH PERHAPS SOME SLIGHTLY
HIGHER AMOUNTS LOCALLY.

GIVEN THE TIMING OF THIS LIGHT PRECIPITATION MOVING IN AROUND
DAYBREAK AND RUSH HOUR...HAVE MAINTAINED THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY
FOR ALL BUT THE SOUTHERN VALLEY TODAY. A WINTER STORM WARNING IS
ALSO IN EFFECT FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE SMOKIES...BUT THINK
THAT TOTALS THERE WILL LIKELY ONLY APPROACH THE FOUR INCH CRITERIA
ALONG THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN PEAKS. AS MENTIONED...HAVE CANCELLED THE
ADVISORY FOR THE SOUTHERN VALLEY GIVEN THE SLIGHTLY WARMER
TEMPERATURES THERE AND THE VERY MINOR ACCUMULATION POTENTIAL.
LOCATIONS ALONG THE CENTRAL VALLEY MAY RECEIVE A DUSTING TO AROUND
HALF AN INCH THOUGH THIS MORNING...BEFORE IT TAPERS OFF DURING THE
AFTERNOON TO THE MOUNTAINS. CLEARING WILL OCCUR OVERNIGHT AS COOLER
AIR FILTERS INTO THE REGION...ALLOWING LOWS TO DROP BACK INTO THE
UPPER TEENS AND LOWER 20S. 


.LONG TERM.../THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...FOCUSED MOST ATTENTION ON
FRIDAY'S GRIDS AS A STRONGER SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES EARLY
FRIDAY MORNING. THIS SYSTEM ACTUALLY MAY PRODUCE MORE SNOW THAN
TODAY'S CLIPPER SYSTEM. SURFACE TEMPS WILL BE COLDER FRIDAY MORNING
AND MORE SUPPORTIVE OF ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL...WITH STRONG COLD AIR
ADVECTION AT 850 MBS. MOISTURE LOOKS QUITE DEEP WITH TEMPS AT LEAST
-20 DEGS CELSIUS AT TOP OF THE SATURATED LAYER. BETTER LOW LEVEL
W-NW UPSLOPE FLOW INDICATED WITH SURFACE BASED CAPES PROGGED TO BE
60 TO 90 J/KG DURING THE DAYTIME. THUS...I INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY
ACROSS FAVORED AREAS FOR AN UPSLOPE SNOW EVENT AND HIGHER CHANCE
POPS ELSEWHERE. A LIGHT TO MODERATE SNOW ACCUMULATION IS MENTIONED.

OTHERWISE...DRY WEATHER LOOKS GOOD FOR THURSDAY AND ALSO STILL FOR
SUNDAY TO MONDAY. A WEAKER LOOKING SHORTWAVE CLIPS THE REGION
SATURDAY NIGHT IN THE NW FLOW...BUT NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE AND COVERED
ALREADY IN FORECAST GRIDS. KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN FOR TUESDAY. 
TEMPS SHOULD STAY BELOW SEASONAL NORMALS RIGHT INTO THE WEEKEND...
SO I UNDERCUT GFSX MOS IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR THOSE DAYS. 
HOWEVER...FOR MOST PERIODS THE GFSX 15/00Z MOS WAS GENERALLY CLOSE
TO 14/12Z TEMPS...AND FOLLOWED.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
1007 PM EST TUE JAN 14 2014

.DISCUSSION...
ON RADAR...PRECIP MOVING ACROSS MIDDLE TN LOOKS UNIMPRESSIVE AND
APPEARS TO BE FALLING APART. HOWEVER THE 00Z NAM SHOWS A
STRENGTHENING CONVERGENCE ZONE AND FRONTOGENESIS DEVELOPING AROUND
09Z. IN ADDITION...AS THE UPPER TROUGH DIGS SOUTH AND BECOMES MORE
AMPLIFIED...THE EASTWARD MOVEMENT OF THE LIFT AND MOISTURE SLOWS
DOWN. SO ANY HOPE FOR ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL IS NOT COMPLETELY LOST.
HOWEVER...THE 00Z OHX SOUNDING IS VERY DRY UP TO 700 MB...SO
FALLING PRECIP WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO REACH THE GROUND. ALSO...THE
WINDOW OF ADEQUATE MOISTURE DEPTH FOR ACCUMULATING SNOW IN THE
VALLEY IS NARROW...ABOUT 6 HOURS AT BEST. SURFACE TEMPS IN THE
VALLEY WILL BARELY TOUCH FREEZING...WHICH WILL FURTHER LIMIT ANY
ACCUMULATION.

THE UPDATE WILL LOWER SNOW AMOUNTS SLIGHTLY...WITH A DUSTING TO 2
INCHES IN THE VALLEY AND PLATEAU...2 TO 5 IN THE MOUNTAINS...AND 1
TO 4 IN SW VA. ALTHOUGH WARNING/ADVSIROY SNOW AMOUNTS WILL PROBABLY
NOT BE REACHED IN MOST SPOTS...THE TIMING OF THE PEAK OF SNOW AROUND THE
MORNING COMMUTE IS AN ADDITIONAL CONCERN...AND SO THE CURRENT
WARNING/ADVISORY AREAS WILL BE KEPT IN PLACE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...POTENT LITTLE
CLIPPER HEADED TOWARD AREA. NOT GREAT AMOUNTS OF MOISTURE...BUT
GOOD LIFT AND RELATIVELY SLOW MOVEMENT OVER THE AREA. WILL HAVE
ADVISORIES OVER MUCH OF THE AREA AND WARNINGS OVER THE HIGHER
TERRAIN ALONG THE TN/NC BORDER AND IN WISE AND RUSSELL IN VA.
NORTHEASTERN AREAS AND SPINE OF APPALACHIANS WILL RUN TILL
MIDNIGHT...WITH SOUTHWESTERN AREA RUNNING TILL 1PM...AND REST TILL
6PM. MAIN MOTIVATION FOR ADVISORY IN THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL
VALLEY IS THAT THE PRIME TIME FOR THE HEAVIEST SNOWS WILL BE NEAR
THE MORNING RUSH HOUR. LOOKS LIKE ONSET OF PRECIP WILL BE
RAIN...BUT WILL QUICKLY TURN TO SNOW. MOUNTAINS WILL LIKELY LINGER
OVERNIGHT WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(THU THROUGH TUE)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT WITH THE 
OVERALL PATTERN FOR THE LONG TERM...BUT STILL SOME DIFFERENCES IN 
THE DETAILS.  ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH TO DIG IN THUR 
NIGHT/FRIDAY...ALONG WITH ANOTHER COLD FRONT.  MOISTURE WILL BE 
LIMITED...BUT STILL MAY SEE SOME LIGHT SNOW/SNOW SHOWERS LATE THU 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...WITH SOME LINGERING COLD ADVECTION/NORTHWEST 
FLOW SNOW SHOWERS INTO FRIDAY NIGHT.  WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION THE 
POSSIBLE SNOWFALL IN THE HWO.  ANOTHER WAVE FORECAST TO COME DOWN IN 
THE NORTHWEST FLOW DURING THE WEEKEND...BUT MODELS DO NOT AGREE ON 
HOW MUCH MOISTURE/HOW FAR SOUTH AND TIMING.  FOR NOW WILL CARRY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AND CONFINE THEM TO SAT NIGHT.  FLOW STARTS TO 
FLATTEN A BIT LATTER PART OF THE PERIOD.  WILL GO DRY SUNDAY AND

.SHORT TERM.../TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
ACTIVE WEATHER CERTAINLY CONTINUES THIS MORNING...AS WE ARE NOT YET
RID OF ONE WEATHER SYSTEM WITH ANOTHER FAST MOVING DISTURBANCE AND
COLD FRONT HEADED OUR WAY BY EARLY TONIGHT.

FOR TODAY...THE BACK EDGE OF THE LIGHT RAIN AND DRIZZLE WON'T CLEAR
FAR NE TN AND SW VA AREAS UNTIL A BIT AFTER 12Z TODAY...SO KEPT
CHANCE POPS IN FOR THOSE AREAS JUST IN THE 12Z TO 15Z PERIOD. 08Z
TEMPS AND DEW POINT TEMPS WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN HOURLY GRIDS...SO
IT WON'T BE HARD TO REACH THE UPPER 40S TO MID OR UPPER 50S THIS
AFTERNOON WITH CLEARING EXPECTED.

MODELS CONSISTENT ON TIMING THE ONSET OF THE NEXT ROUND OF
PRECIPITATION (PCPN) TONIGHT...BRIEFLY RAIN SHOWERS THEN QUICKLY
PRE-DOMINANTLY SNOW SHOWERS AFTER MIDNIGHT. MODELS DIFFER
CONSIDERABLY ON DEPTH OF MOISTURE AND HOW MUCH QPF OCCURS THROUGH
WEDNESDAY. NAM AND CANADIAN WERE THE WETTER SOLUTIONS...WHILE GFS
SREF AND ECMWF WERE MUCH DRIER. MY CONFIDENCE ON GETTING ADVISORY
SNOW AMOUNTS ACROSS AREAS OTHER THAN FAVORED HIGHER TERRAIN IS LOW
AT THIS POINT. EVEN THE NAM MODEL DID NOT SHOW IMPRESSIVE MOISTURE
DEPTH OR W-NW LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW INTO WEDNESDAY. BASED ON THIS
AND COORDINATION WITH NWS NEIGHBORS...OPTING FOR AN SPS WITH A
MENTION OF POSSIBLE SNOW AMOUNTS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE ZFPMRX
PRODUCT.

MOS TEMPS CLOSE AND REASONABLE FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT REALLY
TOO OPTIMISTIC FOR WEDNESDAY GIVEN THE STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION
AND TUMBLING 850 MB TEMPS. 


.LONG TERM.../WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA DURING THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...BRINGING THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME SCATTERED 
PRECIPITATION /PARTICULARLY ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN/ ON THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...SATURDAY NIGHT...AND AGAIN ON MONDAY NIGHT. THE 
FIRST SHORTWAVE WILL DEPART THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY...ALLOWING FOR 
SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WEDNESDAY NIGHT ALONG THE EAST 
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA MOUNTAINS. BY THURSDAY...WINDS WILL 
VEER TO THE SOUTHWEST AND ALLOW FOR A BRIEF WARM-UP INTO THE 
40S...BEFORE THE NEXT TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS THAT NIGHT...BRINGING WITH IT A STRONGER SHOT OF COLDER 
AIR. THIS WILL COMBINE WITH THE MOISTURE IN PLACE TO PRODUCE SOME 
SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY 
NIGHT AND FRIDAY...BEFORE TAPERING OFF BY FRIDAY EVENING/NIGHT. 
GIVEN THE COLDER AIR THAT WILL BE IN PLACE BY FRIDAY MORNING...SOME 
LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS MAY BE POSSIBLE FOR THE MORNING COMMUTE ACROSS 
PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN VALLEY AND THE HIGHER TERRAIN. AFTER SOME 
PARTIAL CLEARING OCCURS ON SATURDAY...ANOTHER SHORTWAVE WILL CLIP 
THE AREA...AND BRING SOME ISOLATED SNOW SHOWERS TO THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN SATURDAY NIGHT. THEREAFTER...WINDS WILL VEER BACK TO THE 
SOUTHWEST AND ALLOW HIGHS TO CLIMB BACK INTO THE 50S ON SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY. ANOTHER TROUGH WILL APPROACH THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT INTO 
TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK...PERHAPS BRINGING A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR 
WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...LARGE SHIELD OF RAIN NOW 
TRYING TO SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA.  THE AXIS OF THIS SHIELD IS 
FARTHER EAST THAN MODELS HAD DEPICTED...WITH A WEAK DRY SLOT WORKING 
INTO MIDDLE TN.  SHOWERS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP TO THE WEST OF THE DRY 
SLOT.  SO WILL CONTINUE WITH HIGH POPS THROUGH MIDNIGHT.  DID HAVE 
100% ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA THROUGH MIDNIGHT...BUT HAVE NOW TRIMMED 
BACK A BIT OVER THE WESTERN 1/4 OF THE AREA.  AFTER MIDNIGHT HAVE 
POPS TAPERING OFF WEST TO EAST...AND FOR TUESDAY MORNING ONLY HAVE 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF LINGERING SHOWERS IN THE E TN MOUNTAINS...THEN DRY 
AFTER MID MORNING.  THE NEXT SYSTEM WILL BE APPROACHING...BUT 
HOLDING OFF POPS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON TUESDAY.  WENT VERY CLOSE TO 
GUIDANCE TEMPS OVERALL.  LEAVING FOG OUT OF THE GRIDS OVERNIGHT AS 
WIND SHIFT WILL TRY TO START BRINGING SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR INTO THE 
REGION LATE TONIGHT.  UNTIL AFTER DAYBREAK THERE WON'T BE MUCH 
MIXING...SO LIGHT FOG WILL LIKELY LINGER...BUT THINK CHANCES OF 
DENSE FOG LESSEN WITH WINDSHIFT.  FOR QPF...JUST GOING GENERALLY 
BETWEEN 1/10 AND 2/10 INCH.  HEAVIER AMOUNTS HAVE FALLEN WEST OF 
HERE...BUT SYSTEM IS BEGINNING TO MOVE FASTER AND DRY SLOT WILL
LIKELY LIMIT DURATION/AMOUNTS.

.LONG TERM...(TUE NIGHT THROUGH MON)...UNFORTUNATELY MODEL RUN TO 
RUN CONSISTENCY AND INTERMODEL AGREEMENT IS NOT GREAT FOR THE LONG 
TERM PERIOD.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR THE EARLY PART OF 
THE PERIOD WITH THE SHARP UPPER TROUGH AND COLD FRONT THAT MOVES 
THROUGH.  GFS IS QUICKER WITH THE UPPER TROUGH AND ALMOST SHOWS A 
NEGATIVE TILT.  IT ALSO TRIES TO DEVELOP MORE OF A SURFACE WAVE ON 
THE FRONT.  THUS IT SHOWS MORE SIGNIFICANT PRECIP OVER THE 
AREA...WITH THE BULK OF IT LATE TUE NIGHT AND EARLY MONDAY AND MUCH 
OF IT SNOW.  THE NAM AND ECMWF SHOW THE UPPER TROUGH HANGING BACK 
MORE...WITH LESS INTERACTION WITH THE FRONT. THEY SHOW THE PRECIP 
MOVING IN FASTER AND EXITING MORE QUICKLY...AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE 
OF THE PRECIP MAY BE LIQUID.  HOWEVER...WITH THE UPPER TROUGH 
HANGING BACK IN THE NAM...LAPSE RATES GET QUITE STEEP BY WED 
AFTERNOON GENERATING A BETTER CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS IN THE COLD 
ADVECTION.  WHILE THE GFS SOLUTION CANNOT BE RULED OUT...IT IS A 
CHANGE FROM RECENT RUNS AND IT HAS LITTLE SUPPORT (THE CMC AGREES 
FAIRLY WELL WITH PRECIP AMOUNTS AND TIMING ALTHOUGH IT GETS THERE A 
LITTLE DIFFERENTLY).  WILL USE MORE OF AN ECMWF/NAM/GFS BLEND. WILL 
BRING LIKELY POPS INTO ALL BUT SOUTH TUE NIGHT...AND LIKELY 
NORTHEAST AND MOUNTAINS WED.  PRECIP TYPE SHOULD START AS 
RAIN...WITH A TRANSITION TO SNOW MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT.  AT THIS 
TIME...IT APPEARS SOME MINOR ACCUMULATION MAY BE POSSIBLE OVER 
MAINLY THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEYS...WITH HIGHER AMOUNTS 
EXPECTED OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  WILL HAVE AMOUNTS BELOW 24 
HOUR WARNING CRITERIA IN THE MOUNTAINS FOR NOW...SO NO WINTER STORM 
WATCH.  WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION IN THE HWO.  ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH 
FORECAST TO DIG IN THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH ANOTHER 
POSSIBILITY OF SOME MORE SNOW SHOWERS.  WILL GO DRY SATURDAY THROUGH 
MONDAY FOR NOW...AS MODELS SHOW THE NEXT WEAK SYSTEM STAYING NORTH 
FOLLOWED BY A FLATTENING OF THE UPPER FLOW AND DRIER AIR OVER OUR 
AREA.

.DISCUSSION...
SYSTEM FROM THE GULF IS SLOWLY MOVING THIS WAY...ALREADY INITIAL
RADAR ECHOS SHOWING UP OVER WESTERN TIER OF COUNTIES...ALTHOUGH
SOME OF THIS IS PROBABLY EVAPORATING BEFORE REACHING THE GROUND.  

FOR THIS AFTERNOON...WILL BACK DOWN ON POPS IN THE EASTERN AREAS AS
MORE MOVEMENT NORTH VS. EAST...LOOKS LIKE AFTER 00Z FOR BETTER
CHANCES IN THE EAST. ALSO WILL ADJUST QPF DOWN IN EAST FOR THIS
AFTERNOON.

TEMPERATURES RUNNING A LITTLE WARMER THAN FORECAST IN THE WESTERN
AREAS DUE TO BLANKETING OF THICKER CLOUDS AND MORE WINDS TO STIR UP
THE BOUNDARY LAYER. HOWEVER...THINK THAT TEMPS WILL BE VERY
SLUGGISH TO RISE IN THAT AREA WITH RAINS ON THE DOORSTEP. WILL KEEP
AFTERNOON HIGH TEMPS AS- IS...BUT BUMPED UP HOURLY TEMP GRIDS TO
MATCH CURRENT CONDS.

LOOKING UPSTREAM TOWARD THE GULF...FAIR AMOUNT OF LIGHTNING DOWN
THERE...BUT MODELS SUGGEST THAT WE WON'T GET ENOUGH SURFACE-BASED
NOR ELEVATED INSTABILITY TO GET THUNDER THIS FAR NORTH.

.AVIATION...WEAK RADAR RETURNS ACROSS SE TN AND OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES 
ARE JUST MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS AT THIS POINT. DRY AIR BELOW 700 
MBS SHOULD HOLD OFF ANY SIGNIFICANT RAINS UNTIL 16Z TO 20Z FOR OUR

14/02Z...THEN LOOK FOR VISBYS AND CEILINGS TO FALL STEADILY DOWN TO 
IFR CONDITIONS BY OR AFTER 14/00Z TO 14/06Z. PRECIPITATION MAY TAPER 
OFF OR END LATE AT CHA...BUT LIKELY TO PERSIST AT TRI THROUGH THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH CLOUDS INCREASING EARLY THIS 
MORNING FROM NRN AL AND MIDDLE TN WESTWARD. ISENTROPIC LIFT UNDERWAY 
WAS ALREADY PRODUCING AN INCREASING AREA OF RAIN JUST WEST OF I-65. 
PREVIOUS GRIDS TIME THE ONSET OF RAIN TODAY QUITE WELL...WITH RAIN 
OVERTAKING OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES BEFORE NOON EST...THEN REMAINDER OF 
FORECAST AREA IN THE MID TO LATE AFTERNOON. RAINFALL AMOUNTS NOT 
THAT SIGNIFICANT...BUT COMING IN AFTER A SHORT LIVED DRY PERIOD. 

TEMPS THIS MORNING VARY GREATLY WHERE SKIES REMAIN CLEAR WITH CALM 
WINDS TO AREAS WITH HIGH CLOUDS AND LIGHT SOUTH WINDS. SLIGHTLY 
UNDERCUT GFS MOS MAXES WHERE CLOUDS AND RAIN START THIS MORNING...
BUT ALLOW FOR WARMING INTO THE LOWER TO MID 50S IN ERN MOST AREAS.

A TRAILING WEAK COLD FRONT FOR TONIGHT...BUT SHOWERS SHOULD BE 
ENDING BY OR BEFORE 06Z TO 09Z TUESDAY...WELL BEFORE ANY COLD AIR 
ARRIVES. THE CLOUDS WILL BE RELUCTANT TO DISSIPATE TONIGHT...WINDS 
HOLD AROUND 5 TO 10 MPH...AND COLD AIR ADVECTION IS WEAK. THUS...I 
NUDGED OUR MIN TEMPS UP CLOSER TO THE MILDER/SIMILAR 13/00Z MOS 
MINS. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...INITIAL COLD FRONT JUST
EAST OF FORECAST AREA TUESDAY MORNING WITH AIR MASS RAPIDLY DRYING
AS WEAK HIGH PRESSURE TEMPORARILY CLEARS SKIES AND WITH SW WINDS
WARMS TEMPERATURES INTO THE LOWER TO MID 50S. BIG CHANGE TUESDAY
NIGHT AS FLOW BECOMES NW AND BRINGS IN MUCH COLDER AIR MASS INTO
THE TN VALLEY WEDNESDAY. SHOWERS DEVELOP DURING THE EVENING AND
CHANGE TO SNOW LATE IN THE EVENING AND AFTER MIDNIGHT AS FREEZING
LEVELS DROP TO NEAR THE SURFACE. SLIGHT ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE LOWER
VALLEY ELEVATIONS AND LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS HIGHER ELEVATIONS EXCEPT
PREFERRED AREAS IN WISE COUNTY VA AND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE
SMOKY MOUNTAINS AND NE TN COULD GET 3 TO 6 INCHES FOR THE 24 HOUR
PERIOD FROM TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. STRONG COLD AIR
ADVECTION WEDNESDAY WILL KEEP HIGHS ONLY REACHING THE 30S LOWER
ELEVATIONS AND 20S HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WEST TO NORTH WEST WINDS AT
10 TO 20 MPH WILL MAKE IT FEEL ONLY IN THE TEENS AND TWENTIES.
DEEPENING TROUGH OVER EASTERN STATES WILL RELAX A LITTLE THURSDAY.
TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY WARMER THURSDAY. THEN A NEW SYSTEM DROPS SE
FROM CANADA THURSDAY INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND INTO TN FRIDAY AND
FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS BRINGS A CHANCE OF SNOW AND FLURRIES AND
REINFORCES COLDER AIR MASS OVER THE REGION WHICH CONTINUES THROUGH
THE WEEKEND. ECMWF BRINGS EVEN ANOTHER SYSTEM INTO NORTHERN HALF OF
THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. RIGHT NOW KEEPING THOSE PERIODS
DRY AS OTHER MODELS KEEP SYSTEM TO THE NORTH.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
CONTINUES TO WEAKEN OVER THE AREA TONIGHT. CONDITIONS REMAIN DRY 
WITH LITTLE OR NO CLOUD COVER. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR GOOD COOLING 
OVERNIGHT AND LEANED TOWARD THE COOL SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE. WEAK WARM 
AIR ADVECTION GETS GOING TONIGHT AND CONTINUES ON MONDAY. SW TO NE 
UPPER JET STRENGTHENS OVER THE SOUTH AND THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
EARLY MONDAY. INCREASED CLOUD COVER WITH SUFFICIENT ISENTROPIC LIFT 
FOR WIDESPREAD RAIN ACROSS THE AREA BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. DESPITE 
CLOUDS AND RAIN...TEMPS WILL RISE INTO THE 50S. UPPER TROUGH MOVES 
EAST THROUGH THE TN VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT WITH A STRONGER JET SEGMENT 
EAST OF THE TROUGH. RAIN WILL CONTINUE OVERNIGHT AND LINGER IN NE 
AREAS TUESDAY MORNING AS JET SEGMENT AND WEAK SURFACE COLD FRONT 
EXITS THE AREA TO THE EAST. POST FRONTAL CONDITIONS FAIR BUT VERY 
SHORT LIVED AND NEXT MAJOR UPPER TROUGH MOVES INTO THE MID MS 
VALLEY.  


.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...DURING THIS 
PERIOD...LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE TWO ALBERTA CLIPPERS MOVING 
THROUGH THE AREA.  AT THE FIRST OF THIS PERIOD...CLIPPER #1 IS AT 
THE DOORSTEP TUESDAY EVENING.  THIS SYSTEM EXIT THE MOUNTAINS BY 12Z 
THURSDAY.  THEN CLIPPER #2 WILL BE SWEEPING THROUGH THE AREA AROUND 
FRIDAY. 

CLIPPER #1 WILL HAVE BETTER MOISTURE AND OFFERS A CHANCE OF SOME 
MEASURABLE SNOW AT LOCATIONS IN THE THE UPPER HALF OF THE 
VALLEY...ALBEIT SMALL AMOUNTS.  IN THE MOUNTAINS...THIS SYSTEM 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET MEASURABLE SNOW.  THIS SYSTEM WILL BE WET ON 
THE FRONT END HOWEVER...SO THAT WILL AFFECT HOW MUCH SNOW CAN 
ACCUMULATE.  THERE IS ALSO THE ISSUE DURING THE CHANGEOVER PERIOD 
FROM RAIN TO SNOW ABOUT HOW MUCH OF THE PRECIPITATION WILL FALL AS 
RAIN.  LOOKING LIKE MOST OF THE AREA WILL CHANGE OVER BY MIDNIGHT 
TUESDAY NIGHT...THEN ANOTHER PUSH OF MOISTURE AND ENERGY SWEEP 
THROUGH DURING THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY WITH ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR SNOW 
SHOWERS IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY AS WELL AS THE 
MOUNTAINS.  UPSLOPE SNOWS IN THE MOUNTAINS SHOULD LINGER AT LEAST 
INTO WEDNESDAY EVENING.

THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT LOOK DRY...THEN CLIPPER #2 SWEEPS IN 
FROM THE NORTHWEST ON FRIDAY.  THIS CLIPPER HAS VERY LIMITED 
MOISTURE...SO MAINLY GOING WITH POPS IN THE NORTHERN SECTIONS AND 
MOUNTAINS.  INITIAL EXPECTATIONS FOR SNOW TOTALS EVEN IN THE 
MOUNTAINS LOOK LIGHT DUE TO LIMITED MOISTURE.

KEEPING END OF FORECAST DRY FOR NOW.  GENERALLY WENT PRETTY CLOSE TO 
GUIDANCE ON TEMPERATURES OVERALL.

WITH THE TROUGH AND IS EVIDENT ON VISIBLE SATELLITE. DENSER CLOUD 
COVER EXPECTED FROM KNOXVILLE NORTH AND EAST...WITH THE BEST 
COVERAGE UP INTO NETN AND SWVA. ALSO...WITH THE APPROACH OF THE 
TROUGH AND AFOREMENTIONED MOISTURE...KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE AND CHANCE 
POPS ACROSS NETN...SWVA...AND SMOKY MTNS AS SOME LIGHT SPOTTY 
SHOWERS COULD REDEVELOP AS THE TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH. A TRANSITION 
TO A FEW LIGHT FLURRIES COULD BE POSSIBLE EARLY TOMORROW MORNING AS 
TEMPERATURES APPROACH FREEZING. HOWEVER...TEMPS DONT REACH FREEZING 
UNTIL MOISTURE IS ALMOST GONE...SO NO ACCUMULATION IS ANTICIPATED. 
CLOUDS CLEAR TOMORROW AS THE TROUGH LIFTS OFF TO OUR NORTHEAST ALONG 
WITH A BRIEF RETURN TO ZONAL FLOW. TEMPERATURES WILL ARE EXPECTED TO 
BE A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL TOMORROW WITH HIGHS ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN VALLEY IN THE LOW TO MID 50S...LOW 50S FOR THE CENTRAL 
VALLEY...UPPER 40S TO NEAR 50 FOR NETN AND MID TO UPPER 40S FOR SWVA.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A WEAKENING SHORT-WAVE 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY PRODUCING A BAND OF LIGHT RAIN. 
FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING IS FAIRLY WEAK...SO WILL GO ONLY LIKELY.

FOR TUESDAY...WEAK RIDGING BOTH SURFACE AND ALOFT AHEAD OF A 
STRONGER COLD FRONT LOCATED OVER THE MID-WEST. THIS FRONT WILL MOVE 
SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY MORNING AS A 
CLIPPER-TYPE SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS THE LOWER GREAT LAKES/UPPER OHIO 
VALLEY INTO THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES FOR WEDNESDAY. A JET MOVING 
SOUTH ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO/TENNESSEE VALLEYS WILL PROVIDE SOME 
LARGE SCALE LIFT FOR TUESDAY NIGHT. FOR WEDNESDAY...COLD AIR 
ADVECTION ALOFT (ENHANCING LOW-LEVEL INSTABILITY) AND OROGRAPHIC 
LIFT WILL CONTINUE SNOW SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY DURING THE MORNING.

ACCUMULATING SNOWS ARE LIKELY OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS... 
ESPECIALLY NORTHWEST FACING SLOPES WITH LIGHT SNOWFALLS POSSIBLE 
OVER THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY WEDNESDAY MORNING. THIS SYSTEM 
MOVES EAST OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH ONLY FLURRIES EXPECTED 
MOUNTAINS/NORTHEAST SECTIONS.

FOR THURSDAY...ANOTHER WEAK RIDGE WILL PRODUCE DRY CONDITIONS AND 
NEAR SEASONAL TEMPERATURES BEFORE ANOTHER COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH 
FRIDAY. A LARGE SCALE UPPER THROUGH WILL BE OVER THE NORTHERN GREAT 
LAKES...BUT MOISTURE WILL BE QUITE LIMITED. AT THIS TIME...ONLY 
FLURRIES EXPECTED FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND DRY 
ELSEWHERE.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...FOLLOWED GFS MOS CLOSELY...EXCEPT FOR THE 
MID-WEEK WHERE CLOUDS...PRECIPITATION AND COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL 
LIKELY KEEP HIGHS DOWN A COUPLE DEGREES FROM MOS VALUES.

427 AM EST SAT JAN 11 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SCATTERED SHOWERS OCCURRING IN 
ADVANCE OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT...AND ALSO SEEING A BIT MORE 
THUNDERSTORMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONVECTION ALONG THE COLD FRONT. 
MODELS AND SOUNDINGS INDICATE ELEVATED INSTABILITY OVER MUCH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...SO OPTED TO WORD THE TSRA POTENTIAL A 
BIT STRONGER THAN A SLIGHT CHANCE. 500 MB TEMPS ARE ON THE COOL SIDE 
WITH FREEZING LEVEL ALSO FALLING THIS MORNING...SO MIGHT SEE SMALL 
HAIL OCCUR WITH ANY TSRA THAT CAN DEVELOP A DECENT 50 DBZ CORE. ONE 
SUCH CELL BRIEFLY INTENSIFIED OVER POLK COUNTY TN EARLIER...BUT THEN 
WEAKENED. STRONGER STORMS ALONG THE FRONT ARE REACHING OUR SRN
PLATEAU COUNTIES ABOUT NOW.

OTHER ITEM OF CONCERN IS THE STRONG LOW LEVEL JET...AND BASED ON 
AVAILABLE SURFACE OBSERVATIONS...THINK THE WIND ADVISORY AND WARNING 
AREAS LOOK ON TRACK WITH NO CHANGES NEEDED.

MAX TEMP FORECAST FOR TODAY IS CHALLENGING GIVEN THE CURRENT RAIN 
COOLED SPOTS IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT...WITH TEMPS LIKELY TO BE 
STEADY OR FALL A BIT BEHIND PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT EARLY IN THE 
AFTERNOON. BLENDED OUT THE MOS DIFFERENCES AND STAYED IN LINE WITH 
ADJACENT NWS GRIDS. MOS MINS TONIGHT WERE CLOSE AND GENERALLY 
FOLLOWED...FAVORING THE SLIGHTLY HIGHER MINS WHERE CLOUDS HOLD IN 
THE LONGEST.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...COLD FRONT AND UPPER TROUGH
NOW EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN FOR
ONLY A 24 HOUR STAY. COOLER TEMPERATURES BUT MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND
STILL ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES. SUNDAY NIGHT SKIES STAY MOSTLY
CLEAR AND LOWS DROP TO THE UPPER 20S TO MID 30S. CLOUDS INCREASE
AHEAD OF NEXT DEVELOPING SYSTEM MONDAY. TEMPERATURES WARM INTO THE
50S WITH RAIN BY MONDAY NIGHT. THERE MAY BE A DRY PERIOD FOR PART
OF THE DAY TUESDAY AHEAD OF UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. COLD AIR ADVECTION
WITH THE TROUGH AND SHORTWAVE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY WITH
SECONDARY FRONT SHOULD PRODUCE SOME SNOW SHOWERS WITH ACCUMULATIONS
IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND POSSIBLY INTO THE VALLEY. HIGHS
WEDNESDAY MUCH COLDER IN THE 30S. WEDNESDAY NIGHT SKIES CLEAR WITH
LOWS DROPPING INTO THE TEENS AND 20S. SKIES BECOME SUNNY AGAIN
THURSDAY. WITH NW FLOW ALOFT ANOTHER WEATHER SYSTEM MOVING EAST
THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY WILL BRING A COLD
FRONT THROUGH FRIDAY. THIS COULD PRODUCE A LITTLE SNOW IN THE NE.
TEMPERATURES STAY A LITTLE BELOW NORMAL THURSDAY AND COLDER AGAIN
FRIDAY.

321 PM EST FRI JAN 10 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...LONG WAVE TROUGH 
APPROACHES OUR AREA TONIGHT AND SWINGS THROUGH TOMORROW. SHOWERS 
WILL QUICKLY DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT THIS 
EVENING WITH THE MAIN LINE OF SHOWERS ARRIVING AROUND 09 UTC. LATEST 
SOUNDINGS SHOW A SMALL AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY FROM KNOXVILLE 
SOUTH...SO WILL MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A THUNDERSTORM. DUE TO 
RISING HEIGHTS AHEAD OF THE FRONT...A BACKWARDS DIURNAL TEMPERATURE 
CURVE WILL BE IN PLACE OVERNIGHT. LOOK FOR THE MIN TEMP TO OCCUR 
AROUND 02 UTC AND TEMPS SLOWLY WARMING AFTER THAT THROUGH TOMORROW 
UNTIL THE FRONT PASSES. 

A STRONG LOW LEVEL JET ARRIVES BY 06 UTC AND PERSISTS THROUGH 17 
UTC. THE NAM IS SHOWING AROUND 70KTS AT 850MB WHILE THE GFS SHOWS 
60KTS. A HIGH WIND WARNING WILL BE IN EFFECT FROM 06 UTC THROUGH 17 
UTC FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHILE A WIND ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR 
THE FOOTHILLS OF THE EASTERN TN VALLEY...ALONG WITH WISE...RUSSELL 
AND WASHINGTON VA.

GENERALLY...AROUND 1 TO 1.5 INCHES OF RAIN CAN BE EXPECTED WITH THE 
FRONT PASSAGE. SHOWERS WILL END FROM WEST TO EAST TOMORROW AS THE 
FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA.   

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...A RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE BEGINS THE EXTENDED PERIOD WITH DRY CONDITIONS SUNDAY. A 
SHORT-WAVE AND ASSOCIATED UPPER JET MOVES ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY. 
THE DIRECT CIRCULATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE JET WILL ENHANCE THE 
FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING ALONG A FRONTAL BOUNDARY FOR MONDAY AND EARLY 
MONDAY NIGHT. 

THE GFS/ECMWF MODELS SHOW A COMPLICATED UPPER TROUGH MOVING ACROSS 
THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDENSDAY. A 
STRONGER COLD FRONT WILL ALSO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA. MODERATELY 
STRONG LARGE SCALE LIFT FOLLOWED BY OROGRAPHIC NORTHWEST FLOW INTO 
THE MOUNTAINS WILL PRODUCE RAIN/SNOW CHANGING TO ALL SNOW FOR 
WEDNESDAY...ESPECIALLY MOUNTAINS. ACCUMULATING SNOWS ARE 
POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WILL NEED TO WATCH 
THE EVOLUTION OF THIS SYSTEM CLOSELY. 

FOR THE END OF THE WEEK...A DEEP UPPER TROUGH SETS UP ACROSS THE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...SCATTERED AREAS OF LIGHT 
RAIN CONTINUE TO MOVE NE ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING...WITH BEST 
COVERAGE ACROSS THE ERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. NUDGED RAIN 
CHANCES UP A BIT IN THOSE AREAS...FOR THE PRE 12Z THROUGH NOON 
PERIODS. MODEL SOUNDINGS AND AREA TEMPS/DEW POINT TEMPS DON'T 
SUPPORT ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANCES FOR LIGHT FREEZING RAIN EARLY THIS 
MORNING...SO JUST WORDED AS A SLIGHT CHANCE.  

SHOWERS WILL QUICKLY DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT 
THIS EVENING...BUT LEFT OUT ANY MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS GIVEN THE 
LACK OF INSTABILITY. HOWEVER...THE PATTERN SUPPORTS A POSSIBLE 
MOUNTAIN WAVE OVERNIGHT...GIVEN THE STABLE LAYER ALOFT...PLACEMENT 
OF UPPER LEVEL JET AND THE STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL JET. OPTED TO 
ISSUE A HIGH WIND WATCH FOR THE TYPICAL ERN MTN AND FOOTHILLS 
COUNTIES. 

SHOWERS SHOULD END SLIGHTLY EARLIER FROM THE WEST ON SATURDAY...
BUT JUST MINOR CHANGES MADE FOR BOTH TONIGHT AND SATURDAY FROM 
PREVIOUS GRIDS. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...COLD FRONT MOVES
EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT WITH SOME WRAP AROUND
CLOUDINESS AND LIGHT SHOWERS MAINLY NE AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS AS
SHORTWAVE WITH UPPER TROUGH MOVES THROUGH. PRECIPITATION MOSTLY
RAIN BUT A LITTLE SNOW POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. HIGHER
PRESSURE BUILDS IN EARLY SUNDAY WITH SKIES CLEARING. TEMPERATURES
COOLER BUT STILL A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. THIS SURFACE HIGH
MOVES RAPIDLY EAST WITH NEXT FRONT MOVING INTO MS VALLEY MONDAY
MORNING. A SURFACE LOW IN SOUTHERN CANADA WITH COLD FRONT
EXTENDING SOUTH TO EASTERN TEXAS WILL INCREASE MOISTURE OVER THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH INCREASING CHANCE OF RAIN MONDAY. A LOW MAY
FORM ALONG THE FRONT AND SLOW IT DOWN SOME AS IT MOVES EAST ACROSS
TN. TEMPERATURES WILL BE MILD ENOUGH THAT THE PRECIPITATION SHOULD
BE ALL RAIN. A DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH MOVES IN BEHIND THE FRONT
TUESDAY AND THE RAIN WILL CHANGE TO SNOW TUESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY
WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES MUCH COOLER WEDNESDAY. HIGH PRESSURE THAN
BUILDS BACK IN LATE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED OVER THE NORTHEAST...WITH A WARMER AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA COMPARED TO LAST NIGHT. A WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN 
WILL CONTINUE OVER THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...WITH SOUTHWESTERLY 
WINDS BRINGING TEMPS WELL ABOVE FREEZING AT 850 MB. THE MAIN 
FORECAST CONCERN FOR TONIGHT WILL BE THE POSSIBILITY OF FREEZING 
RAIN OVER NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA...WHERE CURRENT DEWPOINTS 
REMAIN IN THE 20S. THIS DRY AIR WILL CREATE SOME EVAPORATIVE COOLING 
LATER TONIGHT WITH ANY RAIN THAT SPREADS OVER THE AREA. NAM MODEL 
INDICATES A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE AREA OF LIGHT RAIN SPREADING NORTHWARD 
ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AFTER MIDNIGHT...BUT THE GFS MODEL KEEPS THIS 
RAIN FARTHER EAST OVER THE CAROLINAS. BOTH MODELS REVEAL SURFACE WET 
BULB TEMPS RISING ABOVE FREEZING TOWARDS SUNRISE...SO IT APPEARS 
THAT ANY ACTUAL TEMPS AT OR BELOW FREEZING WILL BE BRIEF AND MAINLY 
IN THE PROTECTED VALLEYS THAT BLOCK OR DELAY ANY WARMING FROM 
SOUTHWEST WINDS. CONFIDENCE IN WIDESPREAD FREEZING RAIN PROBLEMS IS 
NOT HIGH ENOUGH FOR AN ADVISORY...SO WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A SPECIAL 
WEATHER STATEMENT INSTEAD TO ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE SPOTTY 
PROBLEMS ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA.

OTHERWISE...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK... 
BUT WILL UPDATE THIS EVENING TO REMOVE ANY EVENING PRECIP WORDING.

THAT FLIGHT WEATHER WILL BECOME MVFR AT TYS WITH A LITTLE BIT OF

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...A WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL 
CONTINUE TO APPROACH THE AREA FROM THE WEST AND BRING INCREASING 
CLOUD COVER. DENSE CLOUD COVER WILL HELP TO KEEP OVERNIGHT LOWS 
ROUGHLY 5 TO 7 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. AS THE SHORTWAVE MOVES 
CLOSER...LIGHT RAIN LOOKS TO MOVE IN AFTER 00Z WHERE A CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS IS IN PLACE AREA WIDE. WILL TAPER POPS BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE 
FROM SW TO NE THROUGH THE NIGHT AS THE WAVE QUICKLY LIFTS OFF TO THE 
NORTH. AS WITH THE PREVIOUS FORECAST...THE MAIN CONCERN WITH THIS 
SYSTEM WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR BRIEF PATCHY LIGHT FREEZING RAIN 
OVER PORTIONS OF NETN...SWVA AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE OVERNIGHT 
LOWS FALL TO OR BELOW FREEZING. RAINFALL COVERAGE IS EXPECTED TO BE 
MINIMAL AND AMOUNTS LIGHT BUT COULD SEE A FEW SLICK SPOTS DEVELOP 
WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF PATCHY BLACK ICE FORMING ON AREA ROADS. 


WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BE IN PLACE FRIDAY DUE TO WARM AIR 
ADVECTION AND WILL THEREFORE KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN 
PLACE THROUGH THE DAY. HEIGHTS INCREASE FRIDAY AFTERNOON AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING TROUGH...THIS WILL INCREASE TEMPS INTO THE LOW 50S 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY AND UPPER 40S TO NEAR 50 FOR 
NETN AND SWVA.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A SHORT-WAVE TROUGH 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES-TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH 110-120KT JET 
OVER THE OHIO VALLEY PLACING THE REGION UNDER DIVERGENCE ALOFT. THE 
DIRECT CIRCULATION AROUND THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION WILL HELP 
ENHANCE FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH A 
BAND OF RAIN ANTICIPATED FROM SATURDAY 06-18Z. WILL CALL FOR 
WIDESPREAD RAIN AREA-WIDE. A FEW SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE 
MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE SATURDAY 
NIGHT/SUNDAY MORNING.

THIS SYSTEM QUICKLY MOVES EAST WITH FLOW BECOMING WEST...THEN 
SOUTHWEST AGAIN BY LATE SUNDAY.  THE ECMWF AND GFS ARE IN BETTER 
AGREEMENT THIS RUN IN PULLING ANOTHER QUICK SHORT-WAVE TROUGH/FRONTO-
GENETIC FORCING THROUGH LATE MONDAY.  AN UPPER THROUGH MOVING INTO 
THE GREAT LAKES HELPS PULL A STRONGER COLD FRONT THROUGH LATE 
TUESDAY WITH RAIN POSSIBLY CHANGING TO SNOW SHOWERS FOR TUESDAY 
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. ACCUMULATING SNOWS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. ANOTHER FRONT POSSIBLY MOVES THROUGH AGAIN ON THURSSDAY 
NIGHT. 

GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS...EXCEPT FOR MID-WEEK NEXT WEEK. COLD AIR 
ADVECTION AND CLOUDS/PRECIPITATION WILL LIKELY KEEP TEMPERATURES 
COOLER THAN MEX MOS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN DECENT 
AGREEMENT EARLY IN THE PERIOD...ALTHOUGH GFS IS A BIT FASTER THAN 
MOST WITH THE FRONT THAT MOVES THROUGH.  WILL LEAN TOWARD A BLEND 
FOR FRONT TIMING.  RAIN WILL MOVE IN FRIDAY NIGHT AND LINGER INTO 
EARLY SATURDAY BEFORE TAPERING TO JUST A FEW SHOWERS OR SNOW SHOWERS 
SATURDAY NIGHT. FAIRLY STRONG LOW LEVEL JET WILL MOVE IN BRINGING 
QUITE A BIT OF MOISTURE...SO CAT POPS LOOK GOOD WITH THE MAIN BAND.  
MOUNTAIN WAVES STILL CANNOT BE RULED OUT FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT NOT 
LOOKING QUITE AS FAVORABLE AS EARLIER...AS MODELS DISAGREE ON HOW 
MUCH OF A WESTERLY COMPONENT THE LOW LEVEL JET WILL HAVE AND ALSO

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
OVER THE AREA WILL WEAKEN AND SHIFT EAST. TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN TO 
NEAR FREEZING AND WILL CONTINUE TO RISE SLIGHTLY THROUGH SUNSET. A 
WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVING EAST THROUGH THE OH AND N TN VALLEYS THIS 
AFTERNOON IS BRINGING A SWATCH OF CIRRUS CLOUDS ACROSS THE REGION. A 
SECOND STRONGER SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE INTO THE TN VALLEY ON THURSDAY. 
CLOUD COVER WILL INCREASE AND LOWER TO THE MID LEVELS BY THE 
AFTERNOON. LOW LEVEL THICKNESS VALLEYS HOLD STEADY OVERNIGHT AND 
BEGIN TO RISE ON THU. TEMPERATURES REMAIN BELOW NORMAL TONIGHT AND 
RISE TO NEAR NORMAL ON THU.  

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
A WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION LATE THURSDAY 
NIGHT...AND TAP INTO SOME MODEST MOISTURE TO RESULT IN SOME LIGHT 
SHOWERS/DRIZZLE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. WITH LOWS HOVERING AROUND 
OR JUST BELOW THE FREEZING MARK ACROSS FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...SOME LIGHT FREEZING DRIZZLE WILL BE 
POSSIBLE AROUND DAYBREAK...PERHAPS RESULTING IN SOME LOCALLY SLICK 
ROADWAYS AROUND RUSH HOUR FRIDAY MORNING. SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS WILL 
THEN PICK UP ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY EVENING AHEAD OF A DEEP 
UPPER-TROUGH MOVING FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. GIVEN A 
STRONG UPPER JET...ALONG WITH THE SOUTHEASTERLY COMPONENT OF THE 
WINDS...CONDITIONS WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR MOUNTAIN WAVES ALONG THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN AND FOOTHILLS OF THE MOUNTAINS. THIS MAY WARRANT THE 
NEED FOR A WIND ADVISORY/HIGH WIND WATCH FOR THE TERRAIN/FOOTHILLS 
ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY EVENING.

RAIN SHOWERS WILL THEN BEGIN TO OVERSPREAD THE AREA OVERNIGHT ON 
FRIDAY. MODELS HAVE BEEN TRENDING A LITTLE FASTER WITH THIS 
SYSTEM...SHOWING THE PRECIPITATION MOVING IN AFTER 06Z SATURDAY 
ALONG THE WESTERN ZONES...AND OVERSPREADING THE ENTIRE AREA BY 12Z. 
THEN AS DRY AIR SWEEPS IN FROM THE WEST...THE PRECIPITATION WILL 
BEGIN TO TAPER OFF FROM WEST TO EAST BY 18Z...BEFORE MOST OF IT 
CLEARS THE REGION 00Z. STILL HAVE SOME LOW-END MENTIONABLE POPS IN 
THE EASTERN HALF/MOUNTAINS PART OF THE CWA SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT 
CONFIDENCE IS INCREASING THAT MOST LOCATIONS WILL PROBABLY STAY DRY 
AS CLEARING OCCURS. HIGHS WILL BE AROUND SEASONABLE LEVELS FOR MUCH 
OF THE FIRST HALF OF THE NEW WEEK AS NO SURGE OF COOLER AIR WILL 
FOLLOW THE FRONT. THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR PRECIPITATION APPEARS TO 
BE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AS A WEAK TROUGH SWEEPS THROUGH THE 
AREA...GIVING A CHANCE FOR SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED LIGHT RAIN AND 
SNOW SHOWERS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE AREA 
THAT HAD MOVED INTO THE GREAT LAKES THE PAST FEW DAYS WAS RETREATING 
BACK NORTH OVER HUDSON BAY AND NE CANADA THIS AFTERNOON. THE COLD 
SURFACE HIGH BEHIND IT THAT USHERED IN THE RECORD BREAKING COLD LAST 
NIGHT AND TODAY WAS NOW CENTERED FROM THE MIDDLE APPALACHIANS 
SOUTHWEST INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY AND NORTHERN GULF COAST. WINDS 
HAVE BECOME LIGHT BUT STILL ABOUT 5 TO 10 MPH ACROSS SW VA. AS 
SURFACE HIGH SHIFTS TO THE SOUTHEAST STATES TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY 
AND UPPER TROUGH FLATTENS WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST 
BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE WILL INCREASE IN THE 
AFTERNOON BUT SHOULD NOT AFFECT WARMING.

SMALL SNOWPACK IN THE VALLEYS AND LARGER SNOWPACK IN THE MOUNTAINS 
MAY AFFECT HIGHS SLIGHTLY THURSDAY SO WENT ON THE COOL SIDE OF 
GUIDANCE...MOSTLY LOWER TO MID 30S NE TN AND SW VA AND UPPER 30S TO 
LOWER 40S FARTHER SOUTH. IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE MOUNTAINS 
HIGHS EXPECTED TO BE NEAR FREEZING. LOWS TONIGHT WARMER THAN LAST 
NIGHT BY ABOUT 5 TO 7 DEGREES MOSTLY 5 TO 10 DEGREES ABOVE ZERO BUT 
LOCALLY NEAR 0 WHERE THERE IS SNOWPACK IN THE HIGHER VALLEYS OF NE 
TN AND SW VA. SOUTHWEST WINDS ALOFT ON WEST SIDE OF ARCTIC HIGH 
TONIGHT WILL LIKELY AFFECT HIGHER SPOTS OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
AND MID SLOPE ELEVATIONS OF SW VA AND EASTERN TN MOUNTAINS...WHERE 
LOWS MAY NOT FALL MORE THAN A FEW DEGREES BELOW THIS AFTERNOONS 
HIGHS...THOUGH THIS MAY BE OFFSET WHERE THERE IS SOME SNOW COVER.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE NOW IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...AND REVEAL A WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN DEVELOPING 
WITH TWO SYSTEMS AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE FRIDAY 
NIGHT/SATURDAY AND SUNDAY/SUNDAY NIGHT TIME PERIODS. SOUTHERLY WINDS 
ON THE BACK SIDE OF A DEPARTING ARCTIC HIGH WILL CONTINUE TO BRING A 
WARMING TREND OVER THE FORECAST AREA INTO THE WEEKEND. IN FACT... 
TEMPS SHOULD RISE ABOVE NORMAL AS EARLY AS FRIDAY...WITH WARM TEMPS 
LINGERING INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. MODELS INDICATE SOME WEAK ISENTROPIC 
LIFT DEVELOPING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY BEGINNING ON THURSDAY 
NIGHT...DUE TO THE WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN. WITH TEMPS EXPECTED 
TO BE NEAR FREEZING OVER NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA ON FRIDAY 
MORNING...WILL MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME FREEZING RAIN...BUT 
RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS THAT ANY PRECIP AMOUNTS WILL BE VERY LIGHT AND 
SPOTTY. A WEAK COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH A NORTHERN JET STREAM 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY...BRINGING NUMEROUS SHOWERS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. ANOTHER SOUTHERN JET STREAM LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL 
THEN QUICKLY MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON SUNDAY 
AND SUNDAY NIGHT...BRINGING A GOOD CHANCE FOR ADDITIONAL SHOWERS. AS 
FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE GFS GUIDANCE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...AN ARCTIC AIR MASS WILL
CONTINUE TO PUSH INTO THE REGION TONIGHT. RECORD LOW TEMPERATURES
TONIGHT WILL BE IN THE LOW SINGLE DIGITS...WITH A FEW OF THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS BELOW ZERO. WINDS SHOULD REMAIN GUSTY THROUGH
EVENING...WITH CALM WINDS BY MORNING. DANGEROUS WIND CHILL VALUES
STILL A CONCERN BETWEEN -5 AND -15 IN MOST AREAS...WITH UP TO -25
IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WILL KEEP THE WIND CHILL ADVISORY AND
WARNING GOING THROUGH NOON TUESDAY. TUESDAY...REGION STILL UNDER
THE EFFECTS OF THE ARCTIC AIR MASS WITH RECORD LOW HIGH
TEMPERATURES. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO STRENGTHEN DURING
TUESDAY...WITH CLEARING SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH A WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN DEVELOPING FOR THE END
OF THE WEEK...BUT THEN BEGIN TO DIVERGE DURING THE WEEKEND WITH THE
PLACEMENT OF A STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE SOUTHEAST. A LARGE
DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIAN REGION TUESDAY NIGHT...WITH A WARM AIR ADVECTION
PATTERN DEVELOPING ON WEDNESDAY AS SOUTHERLY WINDS DEVELOP ON THE
BACK SIDE OF THIS EASTWARD-DRIFTING HIGH. GFS AND ECMWF MODELS ARE
IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT PATCHY LIGHT PRECIP WILL BE POSSIBLE DURING
THE THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT TIME PERIOD...AS SOME
ISENTROPIC LIFT DEVELOPS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY DUE TO THE WARM
AIR ADVECTION PATTERN. WITH TEMPS EXPECTED TO BE NEAR FREEZING OVER
NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA ON THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY
MORNING...WILL PLAN TO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF FREEZING
RAIN...BUT RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS THAT PRECIP AMOUNTS WILL BE VERY
LIGHT AND SPOTTY. BOTH THE ECMWF AND GFS MODELS AGREE THAT RAIN
CHANCES WILL INCREASE ON SATURDAY... AS A WEAK COLD FRONT MOVES
ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. HOWEVER...THE ECMWF MODEL REVEALS A
CONTINUED WET PATTERN FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY DUE TO THIS FRONTAL
BOUNDARY STALLING-OUT OVER THE CAROLINAS. WILL PLAN TO TREND
TOWARDS THE ECMWF SOLUTION IN THE LATTER PERIODS... SINCE THE GFS
MODEL APPEARS TO BE TRENDING THAT WAY WITH EACH SUCCESSIVE MODEL
RUN. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND COOLER THEN THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS
THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE
ENSEMBLE MEANS.

429 AM EST MON JAN 6 2014

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MAIN BAND OF PRECIP EXITING 
THE AREA...BUT EXPECT SOME SNOW SHOWERS AND FLURRIES TO LINGER IN 
THE COLD ADVECTION TODAY INTO TONIGHT.  WHILE ADDITIONAL 
ACCUMULATION IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM NOTHING 
TO LESS THAN AN INCH...WITH THE FLURRIES/SNOW SHOWERS AND 
POSSIBILITY OF BLACK ICE WILL GO AHEAD AND KEEP THE WINTER WEATHER 
ADVISORIES AS THEY ARE FOR NOW.  VERY HIGH RATIO SNOW WITH THE SNOW 
SHOWERS IN THE MOUNTAINS MAY LEAD TO MORE SUBSTANTIAL ACCUMULATIONS 
THERE...SO WILL KEEP WARNING IN PLACE.  BITTER COLD AIR MOVING IN 
COMBINED WITH THE WINDS WILL BRING DANGEROUS WIND CHILLS THIS 
AFTERNOON INTO TUESDAY MORNING. WILL KEEP WIND CHILL 
ADVISORIES/WARNINGS IN PLACE...BUT WILL MOVE UP START TIME TO NOON 
EST. OBS SHOW WINDS NOT MEETING WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA AND THIS 
TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE...SO WILL CANCEL THE WIND ADVISORY.  
TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TO SLOWLY FALL TODAY...AND RECORD LOWS 
EXPECTED TONIGHT.  STILL QUITE COLD TUESDAY BUT MORE SUNSHINE.  WILL 
MAKE A FEW TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS BUT OVERALL THEY LOOK REASONABLE.  

RECORD LOW TEMPS FOR TUESDAY MORNING...
CHA...9 IN 1970
TYS...6 IN 1970
TRI...5 IN 1970


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...DEEP EASTERN U.S. UPPER 
TROUGH WILL DEAMPLIFY AS IT MOVES OUT ACROSS THE CANADIAN MARITIMES. 
THIS WILL ALLOW THE AIR MASS SOURCE REGION TO SWITCH FROM THE POLAR 
REGION TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN. IT WILL TAKE A WHILE BUT THE RESULTING 
WARMING TREND WILL FEEL MUCH BETTER THAN THE ARCTIC CHILL. HIGH 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOUT TWENTY DEGREE WARMER ON WEDNESDAY WHICH 
COULD FEEL DOWNRIGHT BALMY COMPARED TO TUESDAY'S MAXES AND HIGHS 
SHOULD BE BACK ABOVE NORMAL FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND AS LOW LEVEL 
WIND FLOW RETURNS TO A MORE SOUTHERLY DIRECTION. STILL TUESDAY NIGHT 
LOW TEMPERATURES WILL BE FRIGID TO SAY THE LEAST...RANGING FROM THE 
SINGLE DIGITS NORTH TO THE LOWER TEENS SOUTH. THE RETURN TO WARMER 
AIR WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASING MOISTURE. 
UNFORTUNATELY...EXTENDED RANGE MODEL SOLUTIONS CONTINUE TO DIFFER 
THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY WITH DIFFERING DEPICTION OF SHORTER 
WAVELENGTH SYSTEM TIMING/STRENGTH. GENERALLY TRIED TO CUT POPS BACK 
A BIT DURING THE DAY THURSDAY AS A WEAK SHORT WAVE BUILDS ACROSS THE 
MIDWEST INTO THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. WITH THIS FEATURE MOVING AWAY TO 
THE EAST ON FRIDAY...LOWERED POPS BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE. IT STILL 
APPEARS THAT A MORE AMPLIFIED SYSTEM COULD MOVE INTO THE REGION ON 
SATURDAY SO KEPT HIGHER CHANCE POPS AT THIS TIME STEP AGAIN 
ADJUSTING A LITTLE LOWER ON SUNDAY WHILE AWAITING ANOTHER SYSTEM FOR 
LATER SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. HAD TO APPLY A CHANCE FOR LIGHT 
FREEZING RAIN FOR A BRIEF PERIOD THURSDAY MORNING ON THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU WITH A WARMER...MOIST AIR MASS MOVING IN ALOFT WITH 
SUB-FREEZING LOW TEMPERATURES THURSDAY MORNING. DID THE SAME FOR THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY 
MORNING WITH A CHANCE FOR THE SAME SCENARIO WITH WARMER AIR MOVING 
IN ALOFT. STILL A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS PERIOD OF THE 
FORECAST WITH MODELS INDICATING ONLY WEAK LIFT AND THUS ONLY BRIEF 
PERIODS OF LIGHT FREEZING PRECIPITATION POSSIBLE.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
250 PM EST SUN JAN 5 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
RAIN MOVING ACROSS MIDDLE TN IS ON PACE TO REACH OUR PLATEAU 
COUNTIES AROUND 00Z. PROJECTING THE CURRENT SPEED OF THE COLD 
FRONT...IT APPEARS TO BE ABOUT THREE HOURS BEHIND THAT...WHICH IS 
SUPPORTED BY THE NAM AND GFS. SO WE SHOULD BEGIN TO SEE A CHANGEOVER 
TO SNOW ARRIVING AROUND 03-04Z. THERE IS ABOUT A 3-4 HOUR WINDOW AS 
THE DEEP MOISTURE AND STRONG LIFT MOVES THROUGH BEHIND THE FRONT 
BEFORE DRYING ALOFT ENDS PRECIP AROUND 09Z. MOST SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
WILL OCCUR IN THIS TIME FRAME...WITH A DUSTING TO 2 INCHES IS 
EXPECTED FOR THE PLATEAU AND TN VALLEY...WITH UP TO 3 IN HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. PERHAPS THE GREATER IMPACT WILL BE THE RAPID FREEZE THAT 
WILL OCCUR WITH THE GROUND BEING WET. THIS COULD CAUSE ICING 
PROBLEMS ON ROADS AREA WIDE TONIGHT. WITH THE ICING CONCERNS LASTING 
THROUGH MONDAY MORNING...WILL EXTEND THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY TO 
NOON.

A WEST-NORTHWEST UPSLOPE FLOW AND STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES WILL 
KEEP SNOW SHOWERS GOING IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS MONDAY...WITH FLURRIES 
ELSEWHERE. THIS IS NOT AN IDEAL NW FLOW PATTERN...AS THE FLOW IS 
MAINLY WESTERLY WITHOUT A CONNECTION TO THE GREAT LAKES. SO SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE 
EXCESSIVE...BETWEEN 3 AND 5 INCHES...JUST ABOVE WARNING CRITERIA. 

ON MONDAY AFTERNOON THE MODELS BRING A SECOND SURGE OF ARCTIC 
AIR...WITH 850 MB TEMPS FALLING BELOW -20C. LOW TEMPS MONDAY NIGHT 
WILL BE BELOW ZERO IN THE MOUNTAINS...WITH LOW SINGLE DIGITS IN THE 
VALLEY...BREAKING RECORD LOWS. WINDS WILL BE 10-20 MPH IN MOST 
SPOTS...UP TO 25 MPH IN THE MOUNTAINS. THE CURRENT WIND CHILL WATCH 
WILL BE CHANGED TO A WARNING...AND A WIND CHILL ADVISORY WILL BE 
ISSUED FOR THE VALLEY FROM MONDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH NOON TUESDAY. 
LIGHT FLURRIES MAY CONTINUE INTO TUESDAY IN THE MOUNTAINS...BUT WITH 
LITTLE ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATION.

RECORD LOW TEMPS FOR TUESDAY MORNING...
CHA...9 IN 1970
TYS...6 IN 1970
TRI...5 IN 1970

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH
WEDNESDAY. LOW TEMPERATURES TUESDAY NIGHT WILL BE WELL BELOW
NORMAL...AS THIS ARCTIC AIRMASS PERSISTS THROUGH THE NIGHT. MOSTLY
CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS WILL BE PRESENT THOUGH WEDNESDAY. HIGH
PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY MOVE TO THE EAST...WITH FLOW FROM THE
SOUTHWEST SETTING UP OVER THE AREA. TEMPERATURES WILL SLOWLY WARM
WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BECOMING CLOSE TO NORMAL FOR THIS
TIME OF THE YEAR.

NEXT CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL MOVE IN ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING AS A 
SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY. WARMER MID LEVEL AIR IS 
PRESENT OVER FREEZING TEMPERATURES AT THE SURFACE THURSDAY EVENING
FREEZING RAIN COULD BE POSSIBLE ON THE PLATEAU...BUT TIMING OF 
MOISTURE IN SOME MODELS IS PLACED AFTER THE WARM AIR ADVECTION AT 
THE SURFACE...MAKING THIS THREAT NONEXISTENT.  MODELS DIFFER ON 
TIMING OF ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
WEEKEND. RAIN CHANCES WILL STAY ELEVATED THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
PERIOD. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOVE FREEZING THROUGH THIS TIME...WITH 
LIMITED LIFT...SO EXPECTING ONLY RAIN.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
955 AM EST SUN JAN 5 2014

.DISCUSSION...
NO CHANGES WILL BE NEEDED TO THE FORECAST THIS MORNING. MOSTLY
CLOUDY SKIES WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY...THEN RAIN WILL BEGIN
MOVING INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST IN THE LATE AFTERNOON.

COMPARING THE LATEST MODEL RUNS TO YESTERDAY...IT LOOKS LIKE THE
WINDOW FOR ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL LOOKS SMALLER. THE BEST LIFT AND
MOISTURE MOVES THROUGH BETWEEN 00Z AND 06Z...JUST ALONG OR AHEAD
OF THE COLD AIR SURGE...WHEREAS YESTERDAY THE LIFT/MOISTURE WAS A
BIT FURTHER BEHIND THE FRONT. THE TRANSITION TO SNOW REACHES OUR
PLATEAU COUNTIES AROUND 03Z IN THE NAM AND GFS...WHICH MAY ALLOW
FOR ONLY AN INCH OR LESS ACCUMULATION IN THE VALLEY AND POSSIBLY UP
TO 2 IN THE PLATEAU AND LOWER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA. HOWEVER...WITH
THE RAPID SURGE OF COLD AIR AND WET GROUND FROM THE RAIN...ROADS
MAY TURN ICY QUICKLY MONDAY NIGHT.

ALL ADVISORY AND WARNING PRODUCTS LOOK GOOD AND WILL NOT NEED TO BE
CHANGED.

512 AM EST SUN JAN 5 2014

.SHORT TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH 
TODAY AND WILL SWING THROUGH THIS EVEING. BITTER COLD AIR WILL PUSH 
IN BEHIND THE FRONT TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY.  RAIN WILL MOVE IN LATER 
TODAY INTO TONIGHT...AND WILL CHANGE TO SNOW BEFORE ENDING. SNOW 
AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE ON THE LIGHT SIDE FOR MOST VALLEY 
LOCATIONS...WITH HEAVIER AMOUNTS OVER SOME OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
AS SNOW SHOWERS LINGER IN THE NORTHEST FLOW AND COLD ADVECTION 
MONDAY.  WILL ISSUE A SNOW ADVISORY FOR THE VALLEY AND PLATEAU 
COUNTIES...AND WILL UPGRADE THE CURRENT WATCH TO A WARNING FOR SOME 
OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AS WELL AS WISE 
COUNTY VA.  THE WINDS AND COLD TEMPERATURES WILL LEAD TO VERY LOW 
WIND CHILL VALUES...AND APPEARS WE MAY BEGIN TO REACH WIND CHILL 
WARNING CRITERIA DURING THE AFTERNOON MONDAY OVER SOME OF THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS.  WILL ISSUE A WIND CHILL WATCH FOR THE 
PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST VA...SOUTHWEST NC...AND THE EAST TN MOUNTAINS 
THAT WILL CARRY OVER INTO TUE.  A WIND CHILL ADVISORY MAY BE NEEDED 
IN THE VALLEY AS EARLY AS MONDAY...BUT WILL HOLD OFF FOR NOW AS IT 
MAY BE BORDERLINE MONDAY.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...DEEP EASTERN U.S. UPPER 
TROUGH WILL SHIFT SLOWLY EAST THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE FORECAST 
PERIOD. BITTER COLD ARCTIC AIR WILL CONTINUE TO SPILL INTO THE 
REGION WELL INTO TUESDAY NIGHT PULLING TEMPERATURES DOWN TO LEVELS 
WHICH WILL BE 25 TO 30 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL WITH RECORD LOWS IN 
JEOPARDY TUESDAY MORNING AS THE COLDEST OF THE AIR BUILDS ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT PRODUCED BY THE 
DENSE COLD AIRMASS WILL KEEP A HEALTHY WESTERLY WIND BLOWING MONDAY 
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY LOWERING WIND CHILL VALUES TO AS LOW AS 10 TO 15 
BELOW ZERO IN THE VALLEY WITH VALUES AROUND 20 TO 30 BELOW IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN. THE WESTERLY FLOW WILL ALSO KEEP SNOW SHOWERS GOING 
ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND ALONG THE TENNESSEE 
AND NORTH CAROLINA BORDER WITH SNOW FLURRIES POSSIBLE ACROSS THE 
VALLEY IN NORTHEAST TENNESSEE THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. THE UPPER 
LEVEL FLOW TRANSITIONS TO SOUTHWESTERLY RELATIVELY QUICKLY WEDNESDAY 
INTO THURSDAY WITH THE ARRIVAL OF YET ANOTHER WEAK SHORT WAVE 
THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT AND THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR A WELCOME 
WARMING TREND WHICH CONTINUES INTO THE WEEKEND. THIS PERIOD OF THE 
FORECAST (THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY) HAS A LITTLE HIGHER LEVEL OF 
UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL WITH DIVERGENCE OF MODEL SOLUTIONS. ALTHOUGH 
IT APPEARS A LITTLE STRONGER...MORE AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH WITH 
DECENT MOISTURE ADVECTION OFF THE GULF OF MEXICO BUILDS INTO THE 
REGION FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY SO TRIED TO KEEP POPS FOR RAIN LOW WHILE 
INDICATING A TREND TOWARD HIGHER PROBABILITY. ONE FLY IN THE 
OINTMENT WILL BE IF LIGHT PRECIPITATION DEVELOPS OVERNIGHT WEDNESDAY 
INTO THURSDAY MORNING IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE DON'T WARM SUFFICIENTLY...SOME FREEZING RAIN OR SLEET MAY 
DEVELOP FOR A BRIEF PERIOD ACROSS THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AS 
WELL AS SOME OF THE COLDER VALLEYS IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EXTREME 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING. THIS WILL 
COME INTO BETTER FOCUS IN THE COMING DAYS.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
301 PM EST SAT JAN 4 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
CLOUDS WILL BE INCREASING TONIGHT AS A SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW 
ADVECTS MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES 
EXPECTED...WILL LEAN TOWARD THE WARM SIDE OF MOS FOR LOW TEMPS. THE 
MOISTURE LOOKS TOO SHALLOW TO PRODUCE ANY PRECIP IN OUR AREA. 

A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IN THE PLAINS TONIGHT WILL TRACK 
NORTHEAST TO THE GREAT LAKES BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. DEEP MOISTURE AND 
ISENTROPIC LIFT ARRIVE LATE IN THE AFTERNOON...WHICH IS LATER THAN 
PREVIOUSLY FORECAST. THE STRONGEST LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH 
FRONTOGENETIC FORCING ARRIVES AFTER 00Z. THE TRICKY PART IS THAT 
THIS IS THE SAME TIME AS THE ARRIVAL OF THE SUB-FREEZING 850 MB 
TEMPS. SO THE TRANSITION FROM RAIN TO SNOW APPEARS TO OCCUR WHEN 
PRECIP IS HEAVIEST. DRYING ALOFT FOLLOWS SOON AFTER. THUS WE COULD 
SEE ABOUT A 3-TO-6 HOUR WINDOW OF MODERATE SNOWFALL RATES WITH A 
QUICK 1-3 INCH ACCUMULATION POSSIBLE. BY 12Z MONDAY...WE TRANSITION 
TO A NW FLOW PATTERN WITH STEEP LAPSE RATES SUPPORTING SNOW SHOWERS. 
MOST ACCUMULATIONS ON MONDAY WILL BE IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS...WITH 
MAINLY FLURRIES IN THE VALLEY. 

A WINTER STORM WATCH WILL BE ISSUED FROM 10 PM SUNDAY TO 7 PM MONDAY 
FOR THE TN MOUNTAINS AND FOR WISE COUNTY VA...WHICH ARE THE AREAS 
THAT WILL RECEIVE GREATER AMOUNTS FROM THE NW FLOW PATTERN ON 
MONDAY. FOR THE REST OF THE AREA...SNOW AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO 
RANGE FROM A DUSTING TO 3 INCHES...BUT THERE IS MUCH UNCERTAINTY AT 
THIS POINT AS AMOUNTS WILL DEPEND ON HOW QUICKLY THE COLD AIR MOVES 
IN BEHIND THE EXITING LIFT/MOISTURE. AS THE CHANGE TO SNOW WILL 
BEGIN SUNDAY EVENING...ABOUT 30 HOURS FROM NOW...AND THERE IS STILL 
MUCH UNCERTAINTY...WILL CONTINUE WITH THE SPS RATHER THAN ISSUING AN 
EARLY ADVISORY. 

WIND CHILL VALUES ON MONDAY COULD DROP INTO THE ADVISORY 
RANGE...BELOW -5...IN THE VALLEY. HIGHER ELEVATIONS COULD SEE WIND 
CHILL WARNING CRITERIA OF -15 OR LOWER. WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION 
THIS THREAT IN THE SPS.

LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
THE COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO PROGRESS EAST OF THE AREA TUESDAY.
UPSLOPE FLOW WILL SET IN BEHIND THE FRONT...WITH LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS
CONTINUING INTO TUESDAY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE SMOKY
MOUNTAINS. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS HIGH THROUGH THE DAY SO AREAS
NORTH OF KNOXVILLE WILL BE SLOW TO CLEAR SKIES. DAILY RECORD
BREAKING LOW TEMPERATURES WILL ALSO BE PRESENT THROUGH THE AREA
TUESDAY MORNING. WIND CHILL VALUES WILL BE WELL INTO THE ADVISORY
RANGE AROUND -5 TO -10 DEGREES IN THE VALLEY...WITH VALUES LOWER
THAN -20 POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WILL CONTINUE TO
MONITOR THIS THREAT AND ISSUE AN ADVISORY AS WARRANTED CLOSER TO
TIME.

OTHERWISE...HIGH PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE REGION FOR TUESDAY 
EVENING AND WEDNESDAY. SKIES WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR AND A GRADUAL 
WARMING TREND WILL BE PRESENT EACH DAY. FLOW THEN SETS UP FROM THE 
GULF...WITH AMPLE MOISTURE ADVECTION. STRATIFORM PRECIP POSSIBLE 
EACH DAY THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. MODELS DIFFER ON COVERAGE OF 
RAIN OVER THE AREA BUT TIMING OF ARRIVAL SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY 
CONSISTENT. SOUNDINGS SHOW A DEEP WARM LAYER ABOVE THE FREEZING 
TEMPERATURES AT THE SURFACE THURSDAY NIGHT. COULD SEE FREEZING 
RAIN...MAINLY ON THE PLATEAU. WOULD NEED TO SEE MORE MODEL RUNS 
BEFORE ISSUING MUCH CONFIDENCE WITH THAT PRECIP TYPE. RAIN SHOWERS 
THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR EAST 
THAT IS EXTENDING INTO THE AREA WILL DRIFT OFF TO THE EAST AND 
NORTHEAST DURING THE PERIOD.  STRENGTHENING SOUTHWESTERLY LOW LEVEL 
FLOW WILL BRING SOME WARMING TODAY...WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
INCREASING OVER THE AREA TONIGHT.  EXPECT SOME LOW CLOUDS TO MOVE IN 
TONIGHT...BUT MOISTURE IS FORECAST TO BE QUITE SHALLOW...SO NO 
PRECIPITATION FORECAST THROUGH TONIGHT. WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV 
TEMPS OVERALL...BUT WILL BUMP SOME MAINLY SOUTH AND CENTRAL SITES UP 
SLIGHTLY ON MINS TONIGHT GIVEN EXPECTED CLOUD COVER.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODEL SOLUTIONS ARE RELATIVELY 
CLOSE FOR DEPICTION OF EARLY WEEK CONDITIONS WITH INCREASING 
UNCERTAINTY THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. THE ARCTIC OUTBREAK WITH RAIN 
CHANGING TO SNOW SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY STILL ON TRACK. THERE IS A 
DECENT CHANCE FOR AT LEAST LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATION ACROSS THE 
REGION SUNDAY NIGHT WITH EMPHASIS IN THE TERRAIN AROUND 2500 FEET 
AND HIGHER WHERE MODERATE SNOWFALL ACCUMULATION SHOULD DEVELOP. 
OROGRAPHIC SNOWFALL IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE MONDAY INTO TUESDAY WITH A 
STRONG NORTHWEST FLOW IN PLACE...AIDED BY 85H TEMPERATURES AROUND 15 
TO 25 DEGREES BELOW ZERO.

THE ARCTIC AIRMASS WILL NOT RELEASE ITS GRIP ON THE REGION UNTIL 
ABOUT WEDNESDAY WHEN THE EASTERN U.S. TROUGH FINALLY MOVES OFF THE 
CONTINENT. WEST TO SOUTHWEST FLOW SHOULD ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO RISE 
ABOVE FREEZING ON WEDNESDAY WITH UPPER 40 AND LOWER 50 DEGREE MAXES

400 PM EST FRI JAN 3 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...
SOME AIR MASS MODERATION WILL OCCUR THROUGH THIS PERIOD AS THE FLOW 
ALOFT BECOMES W-SW. CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT WITH CALM WINDS WILL DROP 
TEMPS INTO THE TEENS IN MOST SPOTS. CLEAR CONDITIONS SHOULD CONTINUE 
TOMORROW...WITH HIGHS IN THE 40S. SEE NO COMPELLING REASON TO 
DEVIATE FROM A BLEND OF MOS GUIDANCE TEMPS. 

A SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW STRENGTHENS SATURDAY NIGHT WITH HIGH 
PRESSURE OVER THE MID ATLANTIC REGION AND LOW PRESSURE MOVING INTO 
THE PLAINS. THE MODELS ADVECT SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FROM THE SOUTH 
OVERNIGHT. IT REMAINS SHALLOW...BELOW 850 MB...SO WILL ONLY SHOW 
INCREASING CLOUDS WITH NO PRECIP.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PERIOD THE NEXT SYSTEM IS STEAMING ITS WAY 
TOWARD THE AREA.  LOOKS LIKE SUNDAY MORNING WILL BE MOSTLY 
DRY...THEN THE FRONT WITH THE RAIN/WIND/SNOW WILL MOVE IN LATE IN 
THE DAY SUNDAY AND SWALLOW UP THE AREA IN COLD AIR FOR THE NEXT 
SEVERAL DAYS.  THE CHANGEOVER TO SNOW SHOULD BE PRETTY QUICK AS THE 
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT WILL BE TIGHT AND COLD AIR ADVECTION BEHIND THE 
FRONT WILL BE STRONG.

FOR MONDAY THE VERY COLD AIR MASS WILL SETTLE INTO THE AREA...WITH 
THE DENDRITIC GROWTH TEMPERATURES COMING VERY LOW IN THE TROPOSPHERE 
AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LOOKING TO BE ENOUGH TO GET SOME SNOW SHOWERS 
GENERATED.  LOOKS LIKE THE SLIGHTEST LIFT WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE 
SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS.  THIS ALSO WILL SET THE STAGE FOR A LONG 
DURATION UPSLOPE EVENT FOR THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS FROM SUNDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT--THE MOISTURE IS RELATIVELY 
SHALLOW...BUT WITH THE DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE SO LOW...IT SHOULD 
ACCUMULATE STEADILY OVER THIS PERIOD.  WILL KEEP POPS IN THE 
MOUNTAINS THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING.  FOR SNOW AMOUNTS...GENERALLY 
KEEPING VALLEY LOCATIONS IN TN 1-2 INCHES...AND 1-3 IN VALLEYS IN 
VA.  CAPPING MOUNTAIN AMOUNTS AT ABOUT 8 INCHES IN THE SMOKIES FOR 
NOW.

THE OTHER ISSUE WITH THIS SYSTEM IS THE EXTREMELY COLD NATURE OF THIS 
AIR MASS.  LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE BELOW FREEZING OVER MUCH OF THE AREA 
FROM SUNDAY NIGHT UNTIL WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON--60+ HOURS BELOW 
FREEZING.  

GOING WITH DRY CONDITIONS FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT.  THE CLIPPER SYSTEM THAT WILL BE RACING THROUGH THE AREA 
AROUND THURSDAY LOOKS WEAKER IN THE MODELS TODAY AS MORE ENERGY IS 
FOCUSING WEST IN THE NEXT SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS.  JUST 
GOING WITH CHANCE POPS FOR THIS SYSTEM FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY 
NIGHT.  WITH COLD SURFACE TEMPS THURSDAY MORNING...HAVING TO MENTION 
FREEZING RAIN...BUT AGAIN POPS WILL BE LIGHT.

KEEPING SOME LIGHT POPS IN FOR FRIDAY SINCE MOISTURE STILL 
HANGING AROUND.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SNOW SHOWERS AND FLURRIES STILL 
AFFECTING THE AREA...BUT THESE SHOULD END FAIRLY QUICKLY TODAY AS 
LOW LEVEL FLOW WEAKENS AND TURNS MORE NORTH AND NORTHEAST.  WILL 
KEEP ADVISORIES AND WARNINGS IN PLACE THROUGH 7 AM. ALSO THE COLD 
TEMPERATURES WILL COMBINE WITH THE WIND TO PRODUCE VERY LOW WIND 
CHILL VALUES INTO THIS MORNING...SO WIND CHILL ADVISORY WILL REMAIN 
AS IS OVER PORTIONS OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN THROUGH 15Z.  WILL SEE 
CLEARING TODAY...BUT IT WILL BE QUITE COLD.  CLEAR AND COLD 
TONIGHT.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE SO ONLY A FEW TWEAKS.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER FLOW BECOMES 
SOUTHWESTERLY AGAIN BY SATURDAY AS A DEEPENING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
BEGINS TO SWING EAST INTO THE PLAINS STATES. THIS WILL CAUSE LOW 
LEVEL WINDS TO SHIFT TO A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION. THE SOUTHERLY FLOW 
AND AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF INSOLATION SHOULD HELP TO PULL HIGH 
TEMPERATURES BACK INTO THE 40S ON SATURDAY. THE DEEPENING UPPER 
TROUGH WITH A CLOSED 500 MB...GREAT LAKES TRAVERSING LOW WILL GRIND 
ITS WAY INTO THE EASTERN U.S. AS THE DAY WEARS ON SUNDAY WITH SLOW 
EASTWARD PROGRESSION INTO MONDAY. IN THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE STORM 
SYSTEM A DEEPENING SURFACE LOW WILL DRIVE NORTHEAST FROM THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ACROSS THE NORTHERN OHIO VALLEY WHILE DRAGGING 
MUCH COLDER AIR INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. BY SUNDAY EVENING. RAIN 
WILL DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE FRONT ON SUNDAY BUT WILL BE CHANGING OVER 
TO SNOW OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA LATER INTO THE AFTERNOON AND 
EARLY EVENING AS THE ARCTIC AIR SPILLS INTO THE REGION. THIS WILL BE 
THE BEGINNING OF A VERY COLD PERIOD WHERE HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL NOT 
RISE ABOVE FREEZING OVER THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY. MODELS APPEAR TO BE IN AGREEMENT WITH MODERATE TO STRONG 
LIFT DEVELOPING JUST BEHIND THE ARCTIC SURGE SUNDAY NIGHT. WITH THE 
STRONG LIFTING OF DEEP MOISTURE IN THE DENDRITIC GROWTH 
ZONE...ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL LOOKS LIKE A GOOD BET ACROSS THE REGION 
SUNDAY NIGHT. LOOKS LIKE ACCUMULATING SNOW WILL CONTINUE FOR A 
PERIOD ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT VALLEY...LOWER ELEVATIONS THROUGH 
MONDAY MORNING BUT SHOULD WRAP UP ACROSS CENTRAL EAST AND SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AS THE MOIST COLUMN BECOMES MORE SHALLOW. HOWEVER HIGHER 
TERRAIN SNOWFALL APPEARS TO CONTINUE FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD ACROSS THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS INCLUDING THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...THE 
MOUNTAINS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND MOST OF THE TERRAIN ALONG 
THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER AS OROGRAPHIC LIFT CONTINUES IN THE 
SEEMINGLY NEVER ENDING NORTHWEST FLOW COMPLIMENTS OF THE DEEP 
EASTERN U.S. TROUGH. OF COURSE...SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL COULD 
ACCUMULATE IN THESE AREAS THROUGH THE 24 TO 36 HOUR PERIOD FOLLOWING 
THE ONSET OF THE "BIG CHILL". THE TROUGH GRADUALLY LIFTS OUT TUESDAY 
INTO WEDNESDAY ALLOWING THE RETURN OF SUNSHINE. HIGH TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD RISE ABOVE FREEZING FOR MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA ON 
WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH WILL BE APPROACHING THE EASTERN U.S. 
DURING THIS TIMEFRAME AND THIS SHOULD BRING A WARMING SOUTHERLY FLOW 
TO THE REGION. THE WARMUP MAY NOT BE QUICK ENOUGH TO KEEP A MIXTURE 
OF RAIN AND SNOW IN THE FORECAST...ESPECIALLY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS LOW 
TEMPERATURES DROP BELOW FREEZING. HOWEVER...THE PRECIP SHOULD CHANGE 
TO RAIN WITH HIGHS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE 40S ON 
THURSDAY.

TROUGH BEGINS TO LIFT OUT. ADDED MORGAN...ROANE...AND UNION TO THE
ADVISORY AFTER HAVING TALKED TO DISPATCH WHICH INFORMED US OF
ALREADY SNOW COVERED ROADS. THESE COUNTIES CAN EXPECT 1 TO 2 INCHES
OF SNOWFALL BY MORNING. ISSUED AN SPS FOR THE REST OF THE NON

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
341 PM EST THU JAN 2 2014

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...
THE COLD FRONT HAS MOVED INTO THE AREA...AND A CHANGE TO SNOW IS 
BEGINNING IN THE PLATEAU COUNTIES. RADAR SHOWS THAT THE PRECIP 
BEHIND THE FRONT IS VERY LIGHT...SO INITIAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL 
PROBABLY BE QUITE LOW. HOWEVER THE MODELS ARE SHOWING A RESURGENCE 
OF MOISTURE COMING ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE AREA LATER 
TONIGHT...BETWEEN ABOUT 03Z AND 09Z...WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE 500 MB 
TROUGH AXIS. IR SATELLITE APPEARS TO SUPPORT THIS AS COLDER CLOUD 
TOP TEMPS OVER IL/IN ARE HEADED IN OUR DIRECTION. ALTHOUGH MOISTURE 
IS SHALLOW...IT WILL EXTEND ABOVE THE -10 C LEVEL NEEDED FOR 
DENDRITE GROWTH. THERE WILL BE SOME INSTABILITY FOR SNOW SHOWERS 
BENEATH THE VERY COLD MIDLEVEL THERMAL TROUGH.  UPSLOPE WINDS OF 
25-30 KTS WILL ENHANCE AMOUNTS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 
ACCUMULATING SNOW SHOULD END AROUND SUNRISE...WITH ONLY FLURRIES 
LINGERING INTO FRIDAY MORNING.

SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE NUDGED DOWN SLIGHTLY...WITH 1-2 INCH 
AMOUNTS IN THE ADVISORY AREAS...AND 2-5 IN THE WARNING AREAS OF THE 
TN MOUNTAINS AND WISE VA. VERY COLD AIR COMBINED WITH WINDS 15-25 
MPH WILL PRODUCE WIND CHILLS IN THE -5 TO -15 RANGE...MAINLY IN 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WILL ISSUE A WIND CHILL ADVISORY FOR THE TN 
MOUNTAINS AND WISE VA FROM 06Z TO NOON FRIDAY. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PERIOD WE ARE SQUARELY BETWEEN TWO
SYSTEMS...THE WINTER STORM FROM THURSDAY NIGHT AND THE NEXT SYSTEM
DUE IN ON SUNDAY. AFTER THE ONE ON SUNDAY...WE GO INTO THE DEEP
FREEZE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS...THEN A QUICK CLIPPER TYPE SHORTWAVE
COMES RACING INTO THE AREA TOWARD THE END OF THE FORECAST.

THE FORECAST LOOKS DRY FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...THEN RAINS 
MOVE INTO THE AREA ON SUNDAY.  THE MOISTURE FOR THIS FRONTAL PASSAGE 
ON SUNDAY IS PRETTY PAWLTRY...SO NOT EXPECTING STORMS AHEAD OF THIS 
FRONT.  FOR THE RAIN/SNOW ON SUNDAY...IT IS THE PATTERN MUCH LIKE 
TODAY WITH COLDER AIR COMING INTO THE REGION AND CHANGING THE RAIN 
TO SNOW...WEST TO EAST.  THE ONE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THIS SNOW WILL 
LINGER AROUND LONGER--THE DENDRITIC GROWTH TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
COMING VERY LOW IN THE TROPOSPHERE WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LOOKING 
TO BE ENOUGH TO GET SOME SNOW SHOWERS GENERATED.  THIS ISN'T DEEP 
ENOUGH TO GET ANY SIGNIFICANT CAPE IN THE MODELS...BUT IT LOOKS LIKE 
THE SLIGHTEST LIFT WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE SOME LIGHT SNOW 
SHOWERS.  THIS ALSO WILL SET THE STAGE FOR A LONG DURATION UPSLOPE 
EVENT FOR THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS FROM SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY AND 
MONDAY NIGHT--NOT THE CLASSIC SETUP WITH THE MOISTURE RELATIVELY 
SHALLOW...BUT WITH THE DENTRITIC GROWTH ZONE SO LOW...IT SHOULD 
ACCUMULATE STEADILY OVER THIS PERIOD.  WILL WATCH FURTHER MODEL RUNS 
TO SEE IF THIS PATTERN HOLDS.

THEN THE CONCERN TURNS TO THE EXTRMELY COLD TEMPERATURES.  LOOKS 
LIKE IT WILL BE BELOW FREEZING OVER MUCH OF THE AREA FROM SUNDAY 
NIGHT UNTIL WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON--60+ HOURS BELOW FREEZING.  THE 
CLIPPER SYSTEM THAT IS DUE IN BY THE END OF THIS FORECAST WILL 
DEPEND HEAVILY ON ITS TIMING...IF IT IS FAST...THERE WILL BE A 
BETTER CHANCE OF WINTRY PRECIPITATION...SLOWER WILL MEAN RAIN OR 
POSSIBLY SOME FREEZING RAIN.  THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT LOOK OVERLY 
STRONG AT THIS POINT.

TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN SLOWLY WARMING IN NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE
AREA THIS MORNING...WITH THE THREAT OF ICING DIMINISHING. WILL
ALLOW THE FZRA ADVISORY TO EXPIRE AT 10 AM. 

THE REST OF THE ADVISORY/WARNING AREA FOR SNOW APPEARS TO BE ON
TRACK...WITH NO COMPELLING EVIDENCE TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT
CHANGES. SMALL TWEAKS WILL BE MADE TO TEMPERATURES TO ALIGN BETTER
WITH CURRENT OBS. TIMING OF THE TRANSITION TO SNOW LOOKS TO BE
AROUND 18Z FOR THE PLATEAU COUNTIES AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS...AND
AROUND 20Z FOR THE VALLEY AREAS FROM TRI-CITIES TO KNOXVILLE. THE
WINDOW FOR SYNOPTIC LIFT AND TEMPS COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW IS VERY
SMALL...BUST A FEW HOURS. THIS WILL LIMIT VALLEY ACCUMULATIONS.
STILL LOOKING AT 1-2 INCHES FOR THE TN COUNTIES ALONG THE KY/VA
BORDER...AND 1-3 IN LOWER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA. THE SYNOPTIC LIFT
MOVES OUT BY 00Z...AND WE TRANSITION TO A NW FLOW SNOW
EVENT...WHICH WILL ADD ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS IN HIGHER

408 AM EST THU JAN 2 2014

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVE WILL
MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TODAY.
PLENTY OF SUB-TROPICAL MOISTURE CONTINUES TO STREAM ACROSS THE
SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES. SOME OF THIS MOISTURE KMRXWSWMRXIS BEING PULLED
NORTH INTO THE WAVE AS THE TWO SYSTEM BEGIN TO PHASE TOGETHER. A
STRONG ARCTIC COLD FRONT...CURRENTLY NEXT THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER...WILL
MOVE QUICKLY EAST INTO THE AREA BY THIS AFTERNOON. TWO JETS...ONE
WITH THE UPPER TROUGH AND ANOTHER OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL PLACE
THE REGION UNDER MODERATELY STRONG UPPER DIVERGENCE. THE
AGEOSTROPHIC VERTICAL CIRCULATION AROUND THE JET WILL HELP ENHANCE
THE FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING TODAY. THIS FORCING ALONG WITH
ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE A BAND OF RAIN...CURRENTLY
OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE/PLATEAU...OVER THE AREA TODAY.

SOME OF THE RAIN MAY BEGIN AS A BRIEF PERIOD OF LIGHT FREEZING RAIN
OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. THE PERIOD OF FREEZING
RAIN WILL BE BRIEF GIVEN THE STRONG BOUNDARY LAYER WARMING...SO
WILL NOT ISSUE AN ADVISORY.

FOR THIS AFTERNOON...STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION DEVELOPS WITH
TEMPERATURES QUICKLY FALLING INTO THE LOWER 30S BY LATE IN THE DAY.
RAIN WILL CHANGE TO SNOW/SNOW SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON AND CONTINUE
INTO THE NIGHT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. HAVE
CONTINUED WARNING/ADVISORIES...HOWEVER...DID EXPAND ADVISORY INTO
THE TRI-CITIES FOR THIS EVENING AND NIGHT.

FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY...ENOUGH SNOW POSSIBLE TO PRODUCE BETWEEN
ONE-HALF OF AN INCH TO POSSIBLY 1 INCH (HIGHER RIDGES) THIS EVENING/EARLY
TONIGHT.

BESIDES THE SNOW...MUCH COLD TEMPERATURES WITH BRISK NORTHWEST
WINDS BETWEEN 15 AND 30 MPH WILL PRODUCE WIND CHILLS NEAR -5
DEGREES BELOW ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WITH SINGLE DIGITS IN
THE VALLEY.

FOR FRIDAY...CLOUDS DISSIPATE WITH RETURN OF SUNSHINE. HOWEVER...
TEMPERATURES WILL BE UNSEASONABLY COLD.
 
.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS REMAIN IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A VERY COLD PATTERN WITH A CHANCE FOR 
SNOW ON SUNDAY NIGHT. AFTER A COLD START ON FRIDAY NIGHT...A RAPID 
WARM-UP IS EXPECTED ON SATURDAY AS SOUTHERLY WINDS DEVELOP OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO AMPLIFY OVER 
THE CENTRAL PART OF THE NATION THIS WEEKEND...WHICH WILL HELP TO 
TRIGGER CYCLOGENESIS ALONG A FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE TN AND OHIO 
RIVER VALLEYS ON SUNDAY. THE RESULTING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL 
INITIALLY BRING RAIN OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON... 
BUT THIS RAIN WILL QUICKLY CHANGE TO SNOW SUNDAY NIGHT AS ANOTHER 
COLD ARCTIC AIR MASS PLUNGES INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY. RIGHT NOW... 
IT APPEARS THAT LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE SUNDAY 
NIGHT...MAINLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. A VERY COLD AIR MASS 
WILL THEN SETTLE OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH 
TEMPS EXPECTED TO BE AROUND 20 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF 
YEAR ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE 
ENSEMBLE MEANS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
SUBTROPICAL MOISTURE WILL FEED INTO THE SOUTHEAST REGION TONIGHT.
MEANWHILE A NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH DIGGING SOUTHEAST OVER THE
PLAINS WILL SUPPLY COLD AIR TO THE REGION BEGINNING THURSDAY
AFTERNOON. MODELS ARE SHOWING A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THESE TWO
FEATURES...WHICH SHOULD MEAN LIGHTER LIQUID PRECIP AT THE ONSET
THURSDAY MORNING...AND LIMIT SNOW AMOUNTS OUTSIDE OF HIGHER
ELEVATIONS. 

LOW LEVEL ISENTROPIC LIFT FROM THE SOUTH WILL BRING LIGHT RAIN
AROUND SUNRISE. WARM ADVECTION THROUGH THE DAY WILL KEEP THE PRECIP
AS RAIN. A CHANGE TO SNOW WILL COMMENCE IN THE 18-21Z TIME FRAME AS
A COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE PLATEAU. SYNOPTIC FORCING WILL BE
ASSOCIATED WITH 850-700 MB CONVERGENCE WITH THE FRONT/TROUGH
PASSAGE. HOWEVER THE DEEP SUBTROPICAL MOISTURE PLUME WILL BE
EXITING WHILE THE COLD AIR BUILDS IN...WHICH WILL BE A LIMITING
FACTOR FOR SNOW AMOUNTS IN THE VALLEY DURING THE PERIOD OF SYNOPTIC
LIFT. A DUSTING TO 2 INCHES OF SNOW ARE EXPECTED DURING THE
SYNOPTIC PORTION OF THE EVENT IN THE NORTHERN 2/3 OF THE AREA.

THURSDAY EVENING WILL BE A TRANSITION INTO A NW FLOW
PATTERN...WHICH CONTINUE THROUGH MOST OF THE NIGHT. THIS WILL
BRING ADDITIONAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VA
AND NE TN. THIS IS EXPECTED TO ADD 2-5 INCHES TO SNOW TOTALS ABOVE
2500 FT ELEVATION. WITH THESE AMOUNTS...WILL HAVE A WINTER STORM
WARNING FOR THE TN MOUNTAINS AND WISE COUNTY VA. A WINTER WEATHER
ADVISORY WILL BE IN EFFECT FOR THE REST OF SW VA...AND THE TN
COUNTIES THAT BORDER KY.

WIND CHILL VALUES WILL BE IN THE -5 TO -10 RANGE LATE THURSDAY
NIGHT AND FRIDAY MORNING...WITH WINDS NEARING ADVISORY CRITERIA.
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS MAY BE NEEDED LATER TO ADDRESS THIS...BUT FOR
NOW WILL MENTION AS PART OF THE WSW PRODUCT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
IMPROVED WEATHER GREETS US ON FRIDAY NOW THAT THE THURSDAY SYSTEM
HAS DEPARTED. BUT THE FAIR WEATHER ONLY LASTS THROUGH SATURDAY...AS
ANOTHER SYSTEM QUITE SIMILAR TO THE THURSDAY SYSTEM COMES INTO THE
AREA...PROBABLY SEEING PRECIP ONSET DURING SUNDAY MAINLY AS
LIQUID...PEAKING SUNDAY NIGHT AND ENDING DURING THE DAY
MONDAY...TRANSITIONING OVER TO A MARGINAL SNOW PROBABLY AFTER
MIDNIGHT SUNDAY NIGHT BEFORE ENDING MONDAY. WITH ITS DEPARTURE WE
WILL RESUME FAIR WEATHER FOR MOST OF THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK.
LOOKING WAY AHEAD...PRECIP MAY RETURN NEXT WEEKEND THE 11TH...IF
YOU LIKE OUR STRING OF DREARY WEEKENDS.

THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT WEATHER ASPECTS DURING THE EXTENDED FORECAST 
WILL BE VERY COLD TEMPERATURES THIS FRI MORN THROUGH SAT MORN WITH 
VALLEY LOWS IN THE MID TEENS...AND HIGHS FRI OF 30 OR SO. AFTER 
THIS WEEKEND/S WEATHER SYSTEM...ANOTHER SHOT OF VERY COLD AIR COMES 
IN FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH VALLEY HIGHS MON/TUES AGAIN
