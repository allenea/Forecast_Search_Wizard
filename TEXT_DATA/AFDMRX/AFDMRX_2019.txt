.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Monday)...A somewhat flat H5 high
pressure ridge will continue to produce unseasonably warm
temperatures for the next couple of days, with rain chances too 
low to mention. Because of the unusually dry conditions down by 
the Chattanooga area in recent weeks, temps Monday may jump into 
the mid 90s. Dewpoints across east TN will be creeping upward as 
the week begins, although the most humid conditions will hold off 
until Tuesday in the extended period.

.LONG TERM (Monday Night through Saturday)...Overall, the main 
weather concern through the extended will be the hot conditions. 
Tuesday should be the hottest day with temperatures approaching 
but for the most part expected to stay just below record levels. 
The weather pattern responsible for the heat will be a ridge of 
high pressure strengthening over the region Monday night and 
Tuesday. Southerly flow will continue to pull warm air into the 
region and this flow will also increase low level moisture. The 
result will be a hot Tuesday afternoon with highs generally in the
90s across most valley locations...heat indices could approach 
the 100 degree mark around the CHA area. The increased low level 
moisture will also aid the development of afternoon diurnal 
convection. Due to strong subsidence...thunderstorm activity 
should mainly be confined to higher elevations. 

On Wednesday...the strong ridge will remain the main weather feature 
but it will be slowly shifting east. Therefore...expect highs to be 
not quite as hot but still expect many to reach into the 90s.  With 
the strong daytime heating combined with a weak short wave moving 
through and a slight weakening of the substance...expect diurnal 
convection to develop across the area with the best chance...as 
usual...over higher terrain. Thursday and Friday more of the same as 
the ridge slowly shifts eastward. Temperatures will still be hot for 
this time of year but overall slightly lower than previous days. 
Strong diurnal heating will continue and added to that will be a 
short wave riding through the upper flow.  As a result...afternoon 
isolated to scattered convection is expected. Models indicate a 
frontal boundary will be approaching the area on Saturday.  This 
should continue the minor cooling trend and increase the chance of 
thunderstorm development across the entire area.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Partly to mostly cloudy skies early this morning ahead of a weak 
front that is moving across the forecast area at this time and 
should be through the region by or shortly after 12Z. No rain 
showers have shown up on radar although there could be a few as 
the front moves over the eastern mountains during the early 
morning hours. Temperatures are a few degrees warmer due to the 
cloud cover this morning as compared to yesterday, mostly mid 60s 
to lower 70s at 300 AM. As front exits this morning skies will 
begin to clear and winds will be from the north to northwest which
will bring drier air into the region and lower dew points to the 
mid 50s to lower 60s and keep relative humidity values down into 
the mid 30s south to the mid 40s north. Heat index values will 
again not be that high and close to the actual highs in the mid 
80s to lower 90s. High pressure builds southeast from the Ohio 
Valley to the Tennessee Valley today and tonight. Also upper level
ridging begins to rebuild over the Southeast states as upper 
troughing along east coast shifts east. Lows tonight will be 
comfortable again in the mid 50s to the mid 60s with the drier air
mass continuing.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...
The extended forecast period kicks off on Sunday morning amidst 
zonal H5 flow across the eastern CONUS as upper ridging builds 
across the Deep South, all while a series of weak northern stream 
H5 shortwaves pass through the central/northern plains states. At 
the surface, weak high pressure centered over the OH valley will 
favor a relatively dry PBL with light nly flow expected, 
eventually breaking down in favor of stronger anticyclonic flow 
beneath the building southeast upper ridge Monday night into 
Tuesday. The pattern through the remainder of the work week will 
remain highlighted by the closed H5 ridge centered nearly overhead
initially, before slowly elongating and shifting westward by 
week's end. As for precipitation, not expecting anything organized
as diurnal convection will dominate each day, especially over the
mountains. Coverage doesn't look all that great as deep layer 
subsidence will prevail for the most part, therefore will keep 
pops capped in the chance range at best. All said, the primary 
weather headline through the period will be the return to well 
above normal temperatures through the week. Currently, guidance 
favors the warmest days being Monday/Tuesday as the ridge 
strengthens overhead, with daily highs surging toward record 
levels and heat indices approaching the century mark on Tuesday 
as moisture slowly advects back into the region thanks to 
developing sly flow. Temperatures will slowly drop a few degrees 
by Thursday/Friday as the ridge migrates west.

.DISCUSSION...
Upper level and water vapor analysis this evening places northwest
flow across much of the Ohio valley extending into the Southern
Appalachians, with ridging centered over the southern plains. 00Z
observed sounding from OHX along with differential water vapor
imagery shows a very dry atmosphere. At the surface, a boundary 
is identified moving south through the Ohio valley. The update 
centers around that feature in respect to PoPs tonight. Given the 
dry atmosphere, and weak forcing, would suspect that precipitation
chances are minimal and this seems to be confirmed looking at 
regional radar imagery. However, cannot rule out isolated showers 
developing along this boundary through tonight. As a result did 
increase PoPs slightly across northeast portions of the forecast 
area. Outside of these changes, the forecast remains on track and 
made minor updates to hourly temperatures and dewpoints. Updated 
grids have been sent, with no additional updates planned.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...

Dew points have finally fallen into the mid/upper 50's this 
afternoon as the flow has been able to back to more northwesterly to 
advect in drier air. Mainly clear skies continuing this evening and 
winds dropping to light and variable beneath the surface high will 
work together with this drier airmass and lead to a quick drop in 
temperatures early tonight. However, most locations will cap off in 
the low/mid 60's due to increaing high level clouds from north to 
south tonight. These clouds are associated with a mid level short 
wave and weak surface cold front that will dive into the region in 
the NW flow aloft. Soundings indicate that this feature will be 
moisture starved, so will mention increasing clouds after Midnight 
but only a slight chance pop in northeast TN, southwest VA, the 
northern Plateau, and eastern mountains.

The weak cool front will move southeast through the region by mid 
morning scouring out any isolated showers. Kept slight chance pops 
through 15Z then dry the rest of the day. Skies will become mostly 
sunny again, and highs Saturday behind this front will actually be 
slightly warmer than today with generally mid/upper 80's in 
southwest VA and northeast TN and upper 80's/low 90's from the 
middle valley and points south.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...

Saturday night and Sunday...flow aloft becomes fairly zonal with 
high pressure at the surface. This should continue the warm and 
dry conditions through the rest of the weekend. On Monday...there 
will be a weak short wave riding along the upper flow. Moisture 
and lift limited and for the most part expect mainly an increase 
in clouds generally over northern locations though an isolated 
shower or thunderstorm can not be ruled out over higher terrain of
the northeast part of the CWA. 

Tuesday through the end of the extended...a strong of ridge of high 
pressure builds in over the eastern U.S.  This should keep 
temperatures a bit above normal through the period.  Circulation 
around the high will bring in warm...moist air and strong daytime 
heating could potentially aid the development of afternoon diurnal 
convection.  Additionally...a series of fairly weak short waves will 
push through Tuesday through Friday.  As a result...expect to see 
occasional isolated to scattered convection...especially over higher 
elevations.

.DISCUSSION...The forecast is on track for today as surface high
pressure continues to build in from the northwest and Dorian exits
the coast of NC. Lingering clouds over southwest VA and northeast
TN will dissipate by 16Z. Northwesterly flow at the surface and
aloft will advect lower dew points into the region through the
day, so despite highs in the mid to upper 80's, it will feel quite
nice. The only change was to input recently observed temps, dew
points, and winds in order to tweak the hourly curves.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Forecast area sees another warm late summer day after some patchy 
fog and some higher clouds along the edge of Dorian over the 
northern half of the area early this morning. Early morning 
temperatures are in the 60s to near 70 at 300 AM. Hurricane Dorian
east of Wilmington is moving faster to the northeast tonight with
the outer clouds just brushing the northeast part of the forecast
area. High pressure over the Mississippi Valley and western Ohio 
and Tennessee Valleys will move overhead today with lighter north 
to northwest winds than Thursday. Mostly sunny skies and dew 
points dropping into the mid to upper 50s late today will keep 
heat index values down. Highs today will be similar to Thursday 
but a couple degrees cooler, in the mid 80s north to around 90 in 
the southern valley. Tonight a weak front moves into the Ohio 
Valley then approaches the northwest part of the area by 12Z 
Saturday. Only affect will be some increase in clouds overnight 
and Saturday morning and a slight chance of showers northeast 
half. Lows tonight about 60 northeast to about 70 at Chattanooga.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...
The extended range forecast period kicks off on Saturday morning as 
TC Dorian gets swept up by a northern stream trough digging through 
Ontario, allowing for quasizonal nwly flow aloft across the Southern 
Appalachian region atop broad ridging centered over TX.  At the 
surface, high pressure looks to advect southeast across the Central 
Plains beneath confluent H5 flow.

Pattern evolution through the period will feature dry air advection 
amongst the aforementioned surface high and associated zonal H5 
flow, which should keep the region dry through the weekend with 
near/above normal temperatures featured.  Moving into the start of 
the work week, guidance favors the TX ridge sliding east and 
strengthening atop the Deep South with the surface high sliding 
east, effectively opening the region back up to sly waa on Monday 
into Tuesday.  While the northern stream remains active through the 
rest of the week featuring an upper wave and consequent surface 
cyclogenesis tracking across the Great Lakes region, the southern 
stream looks stagnant as the now subtropical anticyclone holds. This 
pattern would suggest increased chances for diurnal convection by 
mid/late week, with temperatures remaining above normal levels.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...

The southern Appalachian region remains between surface high 
pressure centered over the mid Mississippi Valley and Hurricane 
Dorian churning off of the coast of the Carolinas. The tighter 
pressure gradient between these two features has allowed for 15-20 
knot northerly to northeasterly surface winds this afternoon. These 
gusts will quickly subside after 00Z as boundary layer mixing begins 
to wane, but a light northerly flow of 5-10 knots will continue 
through the night as Dorian slowly moves toward the mid Atlantic 
coast. The rain shield with Dorian will stay well to our east, but a 
cirrus shield will continue to stream into southwest VA and far east 
TN through tonight. This will continue to keep a fairly sharp 
gradient in cloud cover from east-west across the county warning 
area. Kept lows tonight slightly above guidance over southwest VA 
and northeast TN due to these clouds and the wind staying up.

Friday will be a picture perfect day as Dorian accelerates to the 
northeast and the surface high slides southeastward over the TN 
Valley. A few lingering clouds in northeast areas will diminish by 
15Z yielding mostly sunny skies areawide. Broad upper troughing 
persisting over the eastern U.S. combined with this surface high 
will continue a light northwesterly flow pattern, and this will 
finally draw lower dew points down into the region. Highs will still 
be slightly above seasonal normals (mid/upper 80's), but the lower 
humidity will make it feel much more comfortable.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...

Not a whole lot of excitement going on during the long term. The 
biggest story will be the heat due to a building ridge of high 
pressure. 

To start the period, Dorian will be well off to our east with a cold 
front dropping down out of the Ohio River Valley. The airmass still 
looks pretty dry but there may be a few light showers around 
Saturday morning as the front moves through. The front should be to 
our south by Saturday afternoon with drier and cooler air moving in. 
Enjoy Saturday's weather because it will be the nicest day of the 
forecast period. Highs will be in the low to mid 80s for most with 
RH values ranging from the mid 40s to mid 50s. Saturday night will 
also be very nice with lows in the upper 50s to low 60s. 

The ridge slowly starts to build in on Sunday and continues through 
the Tuesday. Highs on Sunday will be in the upper 80s to low 90s. 
The hottest two days will be on Monday and Tuesday with highs 
ranging from the upper 80s to mid 90s. On Tuesday precip chances 
start to tick upwards as the high to our east starts to bring in 
moisture from the south but POPs are still only in the slight chance 
to low-end chance category. The ridge breaks down some for Wednesday 
and Thursday so it won't be as hot and POP chances and coverage will 
be a little higher across the area due to the lowering heights. 
Highs will be in the upper 80s to low 90s for both Wednesday and 
Thursday.

.DISCUSSION...Increased cloud cover a bit over southwest VA and
far east TN for the remainder of the morning through early
afternoon as the outer bands of Dorian have been causing thicker
cirrus in this area. The gradient in cloud cover will remain
rather steep from east-west as surface high pressure to the NW
will limit the westward progress of these clouds. Still cannot
rule out an isolated shower in eastern areas this afternoon, so
maintained slight chance pops. The rest of the forecast is on
track, so only tweaked hourly temps, dew points, and winds based
on current observations.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Dorian will be tracking along 
the Carolina coast during the short term period.  The main effects 
will be some additional cloud cover especially eastern/northeastern 
parts of our area, and a slight tightening of the pressure gradient 
leading to winds in the 5 to 15 mph from the north and northeast 
today. A shower will also be possible mainly central and northern 
mountains, so will include a slight chance PoP for this afternoon in 
those areas. Slightly cooler air will be filtering in, so today 
should not be quite as hot as recent days although max temperatures 
will still be a bit above normal in most locations.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...Warm temperatures that 
are near normal to above normal will prevail through the extended 
forecast period. Hurricane Dorian will be exiting to the northeast
affecting coastal North Carolina Friday with some lower clouds 
over the northeast sections early in the day. Otherwise weak high 
pressure behind todays front that will be centered to the west and
the surface low from Dorian will keep a north to northwest flow 
over the east Tennessee Valley Friday. Late Friday, Friday night 
and early Saturday low pressure and weak front moves across the 
region from the Ohio Valley. Air mass will be rather dry but a few
sprinkles or showers possible late Friday night and early 
Saturday. Expect temperatures Friday will be similar to todays 
lower to mid 80s northeast and central to upper 80s to around 90 
southeast. Early Saturday slightly cooler lows in the upper 50s to
mid 60s. Saturday possibly a degree warmer as upper ridge to the 
west begins to move east as Dorian moves farther northeast. 
Surface high pressure will be centered over the Great Lakes and 
Ohio Valley. Sunday the upper level ridge will be re- centered 
over the southeast and Tennessee Valley beginning a warming trend 
in temperatures up to the upper 80s to lower 90s and then mostly 
lower to mid 90s Monday through Wednesday lower elevations. Lows 
will stay slightly above normal in the 60s to near 70. Monday the 
surface high will have shifted far enough east for a return 
southerly flow to increase moisture and allow for isolated showers
and thunderstorms in higher elevations to the east. Tuesday into 
Wednesday increasing shower and thunderstorm chances and spreading
to all areas Wednesday. Heat index values will also reach the mid
to upper 90s central and southern valleys Monday through 
Wednesday with higher humidities.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Tomorrow)...
Another warm, sunny day today across the area as Dorian continues to 
spin to our southeast and a weak cool front approaches from the 
northwest. With the weak, and mostly dry, frontal boundary expected 
to move through the area today/tonight some of the high resolution 
models are trying to generate some very light showers along the 
Cumberland Plateau. Soundings show that there's a pretty decent cap 
over the area and not a lot of forcing along the front. Will keep 
about a 10% chance of rain for this afternoon into tonight. 

Front will knock back temperatures a few degrees, but still expect 
to see highs in the upper 80's to low 90's across the valley 
locations tomorrow. At the same time the outer band of Dorian could 
wrap around and bring some light precipitation into the Southern 
Appalachian Mountains tomorrow. QPf amounts should remain light and 
am not expecting any impacts west of the mountains from this storm.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
The main focus on the long term period will be unseasonably warm 
temperatures. Thursday night into Friday, Dorian will be lifting 
north along the coat of the Carolinas finally pulling away from 
Virginia by Friday evening. A shortwave dropping through the Great 
Lakes will help Dorian off to the northeast and will usher another 
front into the region late Friday and into Saturday. However, with 
limited moisture and a building upper ridge over the region rain 
chances will be negligible.

Speaking of an upper ridge, there is some disagreement by early next 
week with respect to  how strong or how high an amplitude upper 
ridge builds over the southeast Sunday into next week. Regardless, 
most model guidance shows afternoon highs rising from the upper 80s 
to low 90s on Friday to the low and mid 90s by Monday and Tuesday 
afternoons. This is some 7 to 10 degrees above normal for this time 
of year. 

Did keep some rain chances in the forecast for Monday and Tuesday 
afternoons, mainly over the higher terrain. If the ECMWF is correct 
in showing a stronger and higher amplitude upper ridge over the 
southeast United States, then rainfall chances will likely be over 
done. But there's enough uncertainty in that regard that keeping 
some rain in the forecast seems reasonable at this time.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...A weak and moisture starved cold 
front will sag southward through the area later today and tonight. 
There will be very little boundary layer convergence near the front 
and upper level forcing will be lacking. In addition, model 
soundings look capped, so right now no precipitation is expected 
with this front. With Dorian making northward progress near the 
South Carolina coast later tonight we may see some cloud increase at 
least eastern areas, but no precipitation overnight. High 
temperatures today should be close to yesterday's highs.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...Extended forecast 
remains quite dry across the Tennessee valley and southern 
appalachians with Dorian remaining well east of the area and 
northern stream also remaining well north. Due to the continued 
drying out of the soil and boundary layer, we will trend toward 
slightly above MOS maximum temperatures. Below are the specifics.

For Thursday, hurricane Dorian will move close to the Carolina 
coast. Some upslope showers possible into west North Carolina 
possibly spilling into northeast Tennessee/southwest Virginia. Also, 
an inverted trough sets up from the Smokys north toward Bristol, VA. 
MLCAPEs of 500-1000 J/Kg. A low chance PoP for showers/thunderstorms 
there, otherwise continued bone dry conditions. Breezy conditions 
expected over the far eastern Tennessee mountains due to the 
tightening of the pressure gradient with Dorian but well below 
advisory criteria.

For Friday, hurricane Dorian lifts northeast. A short-wave over the 
northern Great Lakes will pull another frontal boundary toward the 
central Appalachians. Limited moisture/instability and subsidence 
behind exiting Dorian will suppress any chance of convection. 

For Saturday and Sunday, upper ridge moves east and builds into the 
southern Appalachains and southeast United States suppressing 
convection and producing hot conditions. High temperatures in the 
lower and middle 90s will be common in the valley which is 7-10 
degrees above normal.

For Monday and Tuesday of next week, upper ridge remains the main 
feature over the area producing hot conditions, but enough moisture 
pulling back into the southern Appalachains to possibly produce some 
orographic convection in the afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...
Fog development in valleys may occur once again tonight; however
we are seeing some afternoon mixing resulting in lowering
dewpoints, unlikey yesterday, so it may be more isolated and less
dense. Patchy fog will be included in the Wx grids along area 
rivers and lakes. Tomorrow, a cold front will be moving SE across 
KY through the day. Moisture and instability will still be lacking
tomorrow with forecast soundings showing an inversion between 
850-700 mb. While the NAM appears overdone with QPF and coverage,
several hi-res models show a little QPF ahead of the front late 
in the day, so a slight chance PoP will be included for counties 
along the KY border from 21-00Z.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
The models are in relatively decent agreement through most of the
period, with a weak and moisture starved frontal passage 
Wednesday night into Thursday. Continuous northerly flow 
associated with Dorian doesn't allow enough advection of moisture 
for much of a mention of precip with this cool front. Did maintain
the concept of a slight chance for a sprinkle in the terrain 
across Southwest Virginia and along the highest terrain on the 
Tennessee and North Carolina border on Thursday as there may be 
just enough moisture for an isolated shower in spots. As the 
hurricane slips further north over the Coastal Atlantic waters, an
extended period of dry north to northwesterly flow doesn't 
provide a chance for rain; even with another weak cool frontal 
boundary passage Saturday night. The GFS shows a weak wave rides 
Southeast out of the Ohio Valley later Sunday night into Monday, 
possibly nudging the weak boundary back into eastern parts of the 
forecast area. Placed a slight chance of a shower over the far 
eastern terrain areas for this possibility. Model solutions 
increase low level moisture to some degree on the final day of the
extended and there will be enough buoyancy for a shower or 
thunderstorm, but no focusing mechanisms are apparent, so just 
used a slight chance pop in the major terrain areas for Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Surface high pressure will be 
over the region, and model soundings are drier today than yesterday 
so development of any convection looks unlikely.  Will have plenty 
of sunshine today and then tonight will be mostly clear. Winds will 
be light, and temperatures will be close to persistence.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...Extended forecast remains
quite dry across the Tennessee valley and southern appalachians 
with storm track remaining well north and east/southeast of the 
area (Dorian). Lets get to the specifics. Due to the drying out of
the soil and boundary layer, plan on going slightly above MOS 
maximum temperatures.

For Wednesday, a short-wave moving across southeast Canada/northeast 
United States will pull a weakening frontal boundary southeast into 
the central Appalachians. Upper ridging extending into the Tennessee 
valley along with limited moisture (PWs barely above 1 inch) will 
help suppress convection. Will call for a low chance of showers in 
the northern Plateau and southwest Virginia, otherwise dry and very 
warm.

For Thursday, hurricane Dorian will move into/near the Carolina 
coast. Some upslope showers possible into west North Carolina 
spilling into possibly northeast Tennessee/southwest Virginia. Only 
a low chance PoP, otherwise continued bone dry conditions. Breezy 
conditions expected over the far eastern Tennessee mountains due to 
the tightening of the pressure gradient with Dorian but below 
advisory criteria.

For Friday, hurricane Dorian lifts northeast. A short-wave over the 
northern Great Lakes will pull another frontal boundary toward the 
central Appalachians. Limited moisture and subsidence behind exiting 
Dorian will suppress any chance of convection. 

For Saturday and Sunday, upper ridge moves east and builds into the 
southern Appalachains and southeast United States suppressing 
convection and producing very warm conditions.

For Monday of next week, upper ridge remains but enough moisture 
pulling back into the southern Appalachains to possibly produce some 
orographic convection in the afternoon.

.DISCUSSION...Quick update to tweak hourly temps, dew points,
winds, and skycover from now through 06Z based on current 
observations. The isolated showers have diminished with the loss
of daytime heating. Lows tonight are still on track. Dew points 
remain in the mid/upper 60's at this hour, so with the surface 
high dropping down from the Ohio Valley to induce subsidence and 
mainly clear skies, patchy fog will form as temps get closer to 
dew points compared to the past few nights. Most of the patchy fog
still looks to occur after 08Z and will quickly dissipate by 13 
or 14Z.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
A weak surface trough/wind shift will cross the area through the
evening, but it will have very little impact on the sensible
weather. The very isolated showers that have developed today will
dissipate quickly with the loss of heating. There could be a 
little higher potential for fog development tonight as dewpoints 
this afternoon have held in the mid 60s, rather than dropping with
boundary layer mixing like the past few days. Because of this, 
and the indications from models, patchy fog will be included in 
the Wx grids tonight. Forecast soundings tomorrow show greater 
stability and drier air aloft compared to today, as well as a
northerly low level flow, so no PoPs will be mentioned tomorrow 
afternoon. There will probably be less cu development as well. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...
Warm temperatures are expected to continue on Wednesday as dry 
air remains over the area south of an approaching cold front, with
temperatures expected to be about 5-10 degrees above normal for 
this time of year. Front should move through the East Tennessee 
Valley on Wednesday evening/night and should help knock back 
temperatures to near normal values on Thursday. Some models are 
trying to wring out a small amount of QPF along the Cumberland 
Plateau with the front, so will mention low end precipitation 
chances on Wednesday, but if rain does occur it would be very 
light.

On Thursday Dorian will be along the Carolina's coasts, leaving us 
in the drier western/northwestern side. There's a small chance that 
the outer bands of Dorian could make it towards the Southern 
Appalachian Mountains, so will continue with low end precipitation 
chances along the mountains on Thursday. Dry air from the north is 
then expected through the rest of the work week and into the weekend 
leading to temps a little bit above normal, but with less humidity.

Model disagreement begins to increase as we move through the weekend 
into next week as the GFs keeps hinting at another weak and 
relatively dry frontal boundary to move towards the area, while the 
ECMWF maintains ridging over the area with sunnier and warmer 
conditions. So forecast confidence decreases towards the end of the 
weekend into next week, with a lot likely depending on the strength 
and location of Dorian.

vicinity of a terminal is too low to warrant a mention. Model
guidance is hitting fog hard at TRI tonight, and with dewpoints

A weak surface trough is located across eastern KY this morning,
but satellite shows very little cloud cover associated with it. It
may bring enough surface convergence to help spark some
convection in northern parts of the area this afternoon, but
regional 12Z soundings appear fairly stable with a dry midlayer.
Since an isolated shower can't be ruled out, will maintain the
current PoP/Wx forecast. Forecast highs in the upper 80s to lower
90s appear on track with obs and the latest guidance, so no
changes are needed.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...A rather persistent pattern 
continues, with an upper ridge to our west and a low amplitude 
trough in the eastern US. The atmosphere will remain on the dry 
side over our area. NAM soundings show more significant convective
energy today, but appear to be suffering from an overmoistening 
of the boundary layer as is often the case in these types of 
persistent patterns. However, it does appear that there may be 
enough instability for some isolated convection mainly across the 
north, so will include a slight chance of showers and perhaps even
some thunder across the northern Plateau, northeast TN and 
southwest VA. Tonight should be dry and mostly clear. High 
temperatures today should be similar to Sunday's highs.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...Overall...it should be a 
rather quiet extended period though there will be a couple of 
features to note.  On Tuesday...we will still be under the influence 
of surface high pressure and will therefore see another day of 
warm...dry conditions.  A weakening cool front will be pushing 
across the region on Wednesday/Wednesday night.  There is minimal 
lift and little moisture to work with.  Could see a pocket or two of 
sprinkles to a stray isolated shower...but confidence low there will 
be enough moisture available.  So...for now...will leave things dry 
on Wednesday but will add low PoPs over higher elevations Wednesday 
night due to the added upslope lift as the front pushes into the 
mountains.  By Thursday...the frontal boundary should be to our east 
and Dorian should be over the Carolinas. Models continue to keep 
Dorian east of the Appalachians and current thinking is that the 
main influence we will see will be an increase in cloud cover. 
However...an outer band of convection could affect the East TN 
Mountains and part of southwest VA and will continue low PoPs in 
these areas on Thursday. Weak ridging develops over the area into 
Friday for another dry day. Models in poor agreement by the weekend 
with the ECMWF maintaining the upper ridge and the GFS wanting to 
bring in weakening frontal boundary. This boundary current shows 
little energy or moisture...so for now...will keep things dry for 
the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...
A shortwave trough and cold front in the lower OH Valley region
will be moving across our area tonight and tomorrow. The
environment ahead of this trough/front is still quite dry,
although we will see a sliow rise in dewpoints and low level
moisture through the night. However, there won't be much moisture
for the system to work with as it moves through. A slight chance
PoP will be mentioned tomorrow afternoon as the frontal passage 
provides a little shallow lift and convergence that could spark
some convection. This is a bit lower than MOS guidance due to the
dry conditions we have seen lately. Will also have high temps 
tomorrow a bit above guidance, in the upper 80s to lower 90s. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
Quiet weather is expected to continue through the first part of 
September as we're under a relatively dry atmosphere and quasi-
zonal to weak troughing pattern in the mid-levels. A few weather 
systems of note for the long term portion of the forecast. First, 
is a frontal boundary expected to move in on Wednesday/Thursday 
from the northwest. This system will have almost no moisture to 
work with and most of the rain associated with it should end 
before it makes it into the Eastern Tennesee Valley. It should, 
however, knock temperatures down several degrees for the second 
half of the work week.

The eye of Hurricane Dorian is still forecasted to remain close to 
the East Coast of the U.S. leaving us in the drier air to the 
northwest/west of the storm. Depending on the exact track of the 
storms we have a slight chance for some light precipitation along 
the Southern Appalachian Mountains, but most likely the biggest 
impact in our area will be increased cloud coverage in Northeast 
Tennessee and Southwest Virginia. 

One more weak front will try and push through over the weekend, but 
this one also looks to have very little moisture to work with, so 
will continue with a sunny and dry forecast into the upcoming 
weekend for most places.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...It will be another quiet short
term with high pressure continuing to dominate area weather. The
surface high will be moving slightly to our east and as a result
winds will be shifting more southerly...increasing low level
moisture. Additionally an upper through will swing into the area
today which should increase cloud cover...especially over northern
locations. But overall...plan on another dry day with temperatures
once again climbing into the mid 80s to low 90s. With the higher
dew points and the warming trend of the air mass...lows will be a
degree to two warmer tonight compared previous nights. 

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...The main theme for the long 
term period will be that there will be little moisture to work with 
over our area.  Weak surface high pressure will be over the region 
Monday and Tuesday as the upper ridge to our west noses in. On 
Wednesday a cold front will be moving in from the northwest and it 
should be south of our area by Thursday, but again the lack of 
moisture is expected to inhibit any convection. Dorian is forecast 
to skirt the Carolina coast Thursday.  With the track that far east, 
it is appearing less and less likely that any precipitation 
associated with Dorian will affect even our eastern mountains. We 
will likely be in an area of subsidence to the west of the 
hurricane, so will remove what little precip we had in the forecast 
for our area. Drier and slightly cooler air will be moving in for 
Thursday and Friday behind the front. The GFS is hinting at another 
moisture starved front sagging toward the area on Saturday.  It has 
little support elsewhere, so for now will keep Saturday precip
free.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...
Very little change in the sensible weather is expected over the
next 24 hours. Widespread fog is unlikely tonight for most spots 
as afternoon dewpoints have remained in the upper 50s to lower 
60s. We will have a shortwave trough approaching our area 
tomorrow, and the main impact from this will be a little more 
cloud cover, mainly in the northern half, and a more southerly 
boundary layer flow that will slightly increase moisture. However,
stable conditions with dry air aloft will prevent vertical 
development for showers. High temps are again expected to be in 
the upper 80s to around 90, with lows Sunday night in the 60s for 
most spots. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...
By 00Z Monday, much of the eastern two-thirds of the country will
be underneath low amplitude troughing with a weak front draped 
across the Ohio valley. Ridging to the west will begin to build as
a weak shortwave moves through the Ohio valley. Isolated 
thunderstorms are possible across SW VA, and the mountains of East
Tennessee Monday but most locations should stay dry as winds out 
of the north promote advection of a drier airmass. High pressure 
at the surface quickly builds in from the west early to mid week 
bringing dry weather conditions and near to slightly above 
temperatures. 

Wednesday, a shortwave trough will move south out of Canada and 
weaken the ridge. At the surface, this shortwave will drag a rather 
potent cold front through much of the Ohio and Tennessee valley. At 
the same time, Dorian will be moving north near the coast. This 
track will mean limited if any effects on our surface weather with 
the exception of increased winds, and possibly increased cloud 
cover. Not expecting a great deal of precipitation with the incoming 
front as the subsidence on the western side of Dorian will be 
strong. Dorian moves off to the east late in the period, with a 
surface high beginning to move directly overhead the region with a 
much drier airmass. Subsidence due to high pressure will bring dry 
weather conditions. Temperatures during this time will be near 
average.

.DISCUSSION...
No changes are needed to the forecast this morning as the forecast
of a mostly sunny day with highs in the upper 80s to around 90 is
on track. A downslope easterly flow through the low levels will 
provide a stable and dry environment across the TN Valley. Temps 
and dewpoints will be a little higher today compared to yesterday,
which may give a little more CU development this afternoon.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Will see little change in the
overall weather pattern as surface high pressure continues to
dominate area weather through the short term. This will provide 
another day of abundant sunshine and warming temperatures. With 
the warming air mass and the slow increase in dew points... 
overnight lows will also be slightly warmer then previous nights. 
Therefore...expect another dry day with valley high temperatures 
in the mid 80s to low 90s and lows tonight generally in the 60s.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...The period will start with a 
rather broad and low amplitude upper trough over the eastern US. The 
atmosphere over our area will be rather dry, and precip associated 
with weak impulses moving through the flow should stay to our north 
allowing our area to stay precip free Sunday into the early part of 
the work week. By wednesday a weak cold front will be sagging toward 
our area, but moisture will remain limited and subsidence to the 
west and northwest of Dorian will likely keep us dry despite the 
weak frontal boundary moving in.  Dorian is still forecast to track 
by well to our east, but it's closest approach is forecast to be 
Thursday. Right now given the expected track, there should be little 
impact for our area, but will include a slight chance of showers 
Thursday into Thursday night over parts of the eastern mountains. By 
Friday cooler and drier air will be moving in with the front well to 
our south and east, and another precip free day is expected.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
Afternoon visible satellite imagery shows nearly clear skies
across much of the area as temperatures warm into the low to mid
80s. Aloft, high pressure dominates across much of the mid- 
Atlantic, and western Atlantic ocean with a shortwave trough 
exiting the central plains. At the surface high pressure remains 
across the southern Appalachians with a frontal boundary to the 
north across the Ohio valley. In response to high pressure 
dominating, tranquil weather will persist through the short term 
period. Temperatures will begin to warm up as winds turn toward 
the south and begin to advect a warmer airmass with increasing 
dewpoints. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
Overall a pretty quiet pattern in the long term to start September 
off. A broad but pretty weak trough over the eastern U.S. will have 
a few impulses within it, but the energy and associated 
precipitation should stay north and out of the area closer to the 
Great Lakes region. During most of next week this pattern will lead 
to mostly sunny skies each day, and with plenty of sunshine daytime 
temperatures will reach the upper 80's into the lower 90's across 
the valley locations, a few degrees above normal for this time of 
year. 

Towards the end of the week a frontal boundary will slowly try and 
work it's way southward across the Ohio Valley. Extended models are 
in disagreement with how far south this system will make it and how 
much moisture will be available to work with. Will keep low end 
precipitation chances in case the front is able to make it into the 
Eastern Tennessee Valley. Also worth keeping an eye on is the track 
of Hurricane Dorian as it is forecasted to move up the East Coast. 
Current models are all showing that it should stay along the coast 
keeping us in the western/northwestern portions of the storm. This 
would keep us mostly dry, and maybe only seeing some increased 
clouds west of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Again, will keep 
an eye on it, but at this time the impacts in our area from the 
hurricane are forecasted to be minimal.

forecast was the reasoning behind additional fog. Conditions

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...

Plenty of subsidence and dry air remain in place this afternoon with 
surface high pressure centered just to the northeast of the southern 
appalachians and northwesterly mid to upper level flow. This 
continues to bring cool Canadian air deep into the Tennessee 
Valley, so only isolated afternoon cumulus have developed. Winds 
will quickly go mainly calm after sunset as the high settles 
overhead, so excellent radiational cooling conditions will develop. 
Stayed close to the cooler MET guidance with widespread mid/upper 
50's expected. Forecast soundings at the TRI Cities show saturation 
below the low-level inversion in the 09-12Z timeframe as temps fall 
close to dew points, so patchy fog will again develop in protected 
valleys of northeast TN and southwest VA. 

Any fog will quickly burn off after 13Z Friday as the boundary layer 
warms. The upper level trough will lift northeast through the day 
allowing heights to rebound. At the same time, the surface high will 
slide a bit farther east. This will begin a WAA process, so high 
temps will be a solid 5 degrees warmer than today with skies 
remaining mostly sunny. Dew points will be slow to rise and will 
remain at comfortable levels to continue the beautiful stretch of 
late summer weather.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...

The extended range forecast period kicks off on Friday evening 
amidst ridging across much of the southeast CONUS thanks to a 
broad/flat subtropical high.  A series of weak upper impulses look 
to pass through the mean northern stream flow across the Midwest 
into the OH valley, but most if not all activity in association will 
pass by to the north through at least early Sunday.  By that point 
the extended period becomes more complicated and thus uncertain as 
TC Dorian's influence moves into the picture.  Before that though, 
am expecting dry weather with highs near or slightly above normal 
levels.

By Sunday morning, high pressure will have shifted eastward across 
New England, with flow around the approaching TC favoring slight ely 
veering across the Southern Appalachians.  With that, Atlantic 
moisture advection will commence, all while Dorian passes in the 
vicinity of the Bahamas and takes aim at Florida.  Meanwhile, a 
deeper shortwave will pass through the northern stream, eventually 
sweeping into the northeast CONUS effectively forcing the old 
surface high out to sea.  By this point forecast confidence is low 
as the eventual weather across east TN and southwest VA/NC will 
depend on Dorian's track.  Currently, operational guidance suggests 
the cyclone moving over the east coast of Florida through early 
week, riding along the southeast coastline before turning slightly 
inland to sweep through the Carolinas into mid/late week.  If the 
center of the circulation stays east of the Appalachians, impacts 
across the TN Valley will lower as increasing nly flow advects drier 
air into the region.  However, if the cyclone tracks nearly overhead 
of the spine of the Appalachians (or further west), increased 
impacts from moderate to heavy rainfall and wind will be on the 
table.  For now, the extended fcst will feature low rain chances 
westward through the week, with slightly higher chances eastward 
over the mtns in closer proximity to the current fcst track. 
Temperatures are expected to remain near normal levels.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Not a lot to talk about in the short term. High pressure is 
entrenched across the southeastern United States and will remain 
there through the short term period. Some patchy fog is present 
this morning, mainly in river valleys north of the I-40 corridor. 
However that will dissipate quickly after sunrise, yielding sunny 
skies for the remainder of today and tonight. Highs will be about 
five degrees below normal today, ranging from around 80 in the 
northern valley to the mid 80s in the south. Dewpoints will be in 
the 50s today though so it will be quite comfortable outside.

Tonight will essentially be a repeat of last night, with clear 
skies, lows in the 50s to near 60, and perhaps some patchy fog 
developing after midnight tonight mainly in the north.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...

Surface high pressure will continue to dominate area weather 
through the first part of the extended. This will create a quiet 
and dry period with seasonal temperatures Friday and Saturday. 
Precipitation chances will increase on Sunday as a result of 
increased low level moisture... strong diurnal heating and a weak 
impulse moving through the upper flow. The chance of convection 
will be low (20 to 30 PoP) and generally confined to the higher 
elevations. Monday will see more of the same with continued strong
diurnal heating and an approaching system. The area with the best
chance of convection will expand over southern locations and 
possible over the northeast. 

The main question for the extended continues to be the timing... 
track and strengthen of the remnants of Dorian.  Models continue to 
have poor agreement with the handling of Dorian.  The GFS is 
bringing the system into GA Monday night and Tuesday then lifting it 
northwestward across western NC and potentially into East TN mid to 
late week.  The ECMWF is slower and generally moves it into the gulf 
by midweek.  With all of this...confidence quite low so for now... 
will maintain fairly low PoPs Tuesday and Wednesday...expecting 
mainly diurnal convection with minimal influence from Dorian for now.

Besides some patchy fog development near area lakes and streams, a
quiet night across the region. Surface ridging will continue to
build into the southern Appalachians with a very dry airmass. PWs
will below 1 inch. Satellite shows cloud cover near the eastern
Mountains due to orographic upslope flow so have increased clouds
there for a couple hours overnight.

Temperatures forecast looks good. Have a good night.

.DISCUSSION...

A tranquil weather pattern has established itself over the
Southern Appalachians and will persist for several days into early
next week. Surface high pressure over Missouri will gradually
slide southeast into the local area through Thursday providing
light winds and near-average temperatures through the weekend. 
This set up could favor some patchy fog tonight although with 
dewpoints dropping into the 50s this should be fairly light and 
scattered in nature.

Rain chances will remain very low through the end of the week and
for much of the weekend. Will then need to keep an eye on Dorian's
eventual track as it could spread moisture in from the southeast
beginning as early as Sunday with a slight increase in
precipitation chances heading into Tuesday and Wednesday.
Obviously any potential heavy rain associated with this system 
will be highly dependent on the eventual track which won't be 
known this far north for several more days.

Rain has cleared all of the terminals this morning, but plenty of
low level moisture remains entrenched across the Tennessee Valley.
Will hold on to some MVFR level bases at KCHA and KTYS through
15-16z, while carrying actual ceilings at KTRI during that same
time. Expect VFR ceilings will continue at KTRI until midday
before low level dry air helps to dissipate low clouds. For
tonight, combination of dry air and slightly warmer temperatures
at KTYS and KCHA should prevent fog development. However KTRI
looks likely to fog in so brought some 4SM back to that site by
09z tonight.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

A pre-frontal line of showers and thunderstorms was moving into 
mountains as of 3 AM this morning, though the cold front was just
moving into the plateau region at that time. The front should move
into the mountains and east of our forecast area by mid morning. 
Expect mostly dry conditions behind that initial line of 
convection, though a few isolated showers will be possible along
the front as it moves through. 

Regional surface observations show some low clouds stretching west
of the plateau, behind the cold front. As such, clouds will likely
be prevalent in many areas as late as daybreak, but expect
clearing conditions as the day goes on such mostly sunny skies
should be the norm by midday or shortly thereafter. For tonight,
clear skies and an influx of dry air will mean widespread lows in
the low to mid 50s, with only the southern valley areas seeing
anything near 60 degrees. Could see some fog develop in these 
conditions, but how widespread it becomes is questionable. Went
ahead and included some patchy fog in the forecast for mainly the
northern river valley areas late tonight.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...

The extended begins in a rather quiet and dry weather pattern. 
Surface high pressure will be in control with northwest flow 
aloft. As a result...Thursday and Friday will be dry with slightly
cooler temperatures and reduced dew points/humidities. The high 
will begin to shift east on Saturday allowing surface flow to 
become southerly...increasing low level moisture. However...the 
high will continue to dominate area weather...so expect another 
dry day but with slightly warmer temperatures. Models begin to 
diverge through the rest of the extended. The overall weather 
pattern shows a weakening frontal boundary trying to drop south 
towards the area...a couple of minor impulses will be riding 
through the upper flow but the main question and concern will be 
the timing and track of the remnants of a tropical system. Current
trend wants to keep what's left of the system to our east. So 
overall...the later part of the extend looks somewhat unsettled 
with confidence quite low on details. Therefore...will 
occasionally have PoPs generally around 20 to 40 from Sunday 
through Tuesday.

early this morning. It has cleared KCHA already and should clear
the vicinity of KTYS by 07z or so. Expect SHRA/TSRA conditions at
KTRI between 08z and 10z. Behind this line of convection, some
MVFR cigs will linger at KTYS and KTRI for a few hours before
rising back to VFR levels. KCHA looks to avoid any MVFR 
conditions altogether. By midday, only scattered VFR bases are 
expected at all sites. Only concern for tomorrow will be the
possibility of some gusty north winds to around 15kt. Not

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Wednesday)...A few showers are expected 
to form tonight across the Southern Appalachian region in 
association with a weak frontal boundary. Initial scattered 
development of a shower or even an isolated thunderstorm could occur 
on the western edge of the forecast area as early as 00-03z. This 
action would form along a pre-frontal trough noted over Middle 
Tennessee at the current hour. Following behind this minor feature 
will be the actual cool front, which would keep some showers in the 
forecast through the overnight with the precip ending from west to 
east largely by daybreak Wednesday. Cape is minimal so just used 
a small or slight chance pop for convection with the frontal 
passage. A nice westerly component behind the front brings more 
dry air to the region with sunshine increasing across the region 
during the morning with nearly full insolation by early afternoon 
across most of the region. Cloud cover will keep temperatures a 
little elevated overnight with readings holding a couple degrees 
ahead of normal. Despite increasing sunshine on Wednesday, highs 
will top out two or three degrees below normal late August 
maximums in the light northerly flow regime behind the front. 

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...Northwest flow 
aloft and surface high pressure, which will strengthen to around 
1021 mb by Friday morning, will yield beautiful weather for mid 
and late week. High temps will be near or just below seasonal 
normals (low to mid 80's) with comfortably low dew points. Lows in
the mid 50's to mid 60's at night should give the air 
conditioners a break. 

Return southerly flow will begin Saturday as the surface high drifts 
into the Carolinas and 500 mb heights rise back above 592 dam in 
response to the next trough developing in the mid Mississippi 
Valley. Enough subsidence and dry air will remain in place for 
another dry and mostly sunny day, but upper 80's/low 90's will be 
returning for highs will slowly increasing dew points. The upper 
trough mentioned above will move toward the southern Appalachian 
region Sunday, so will have chance pops for showers/thunderstorms 
all day with the highest chances in the afternoon and first half of 
Sunday night. The cold front associated with the trough will push 
through Sunday night with northwest flow developing aloft and a 
surface high to the northwest attempting to build in by Labor Day. 
This will bring slightly cooler and less humid air to east TN, 
southwest VA, and southwest NC, but an inverted trough hanging 
around the eastern mountains with lingering moisture warrants slight 
chance to chance pops in that area Labor Day. 

Models differ with the handling of the remnants of Dorian Monday 
night and Tuesday in terms of how far north the moisture will get. 
Any impact would be very minimal and only would be an increase in 
clouds and scattered showers/storms. Will maintain chance pops 
Monday night through Tuesday. Stayed close to NBM guidance for temps 
early next week.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

A strong upper trough was present over the northern plains and up
into the central Canadian provinces this morning. Associated 
surface low pressure was situated over western Ontario, with a 
weaker surface low positioned over the Great Lakes as well. The 
much talked about cold front stretched south from the Great Lakes 
into Indiana and southwestward into Missouri and Oklahoma. 
Further southeast into eastern Tennessee, the remnant influence of
a warm front can be seen thanks to a weak CAD setup east of the 
Appalachians and northerly surface flow down the TN valley.

Radar imagery shows that shower activity from earlier tonight has
pretty much subsided. However a weak impulse will move east 
across the region as we approach daybreak. Increased lift across 
the remnant warm frontal boundary will likely cause another uptick
in shower activity, albeit with only light rain expected. Another
break in rainfall is expected from mid morning onward until 
convection along the front makes its way into the forecast area 
this evening and into the overnight hours. Tried to time in these 
breaks in the rainfall as best I could. I imagine that much of the
day today will be dry, and for most people. Did leave at least 
some chance PoPs lingering in the mountains throughout the day. 
Moist upslope flow is likely to generate some light rain from time
to time there. Elsewhere though, it should be mostly dry today.

Temperatures today should be notably warmer than yesterday. While
cloud cover will be plentiful this morning, some sun breaks could
occur this afternoon. Couple this with a lack of rain and we 
should see highs in the low 80s in many areas. As mentioned, 
convection along the cold front arrives over the plateau during 
the evening hours. By shortly after midnight the front should be 
moving into the mountains, which is where rainfall should be 
mostly confined to by that time. 

Despite a frontal passage tonight, the arrival of drier air and
complete end of rain chances hold off until we get into the long 
term period.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...

A few lingering showers/thunderstorms will be slowly exiting the 
area Wednesday morning as a cold front pulls away from the area. 
High pressure builds in behind the front...allowing a drier and 
cooler air mass to filter in. As a result...highs mid week will 
average in the low to mid 80s across most valley locations and 
lows should drop into the mid 50s to mid 60s. Temperatures will 
slowly warm towards the end of the work week but high pressure and
dry conditions should continue to dominate through weeks end. The
next chance of showers/thunderstorms will be around the Sunday 
and Monday time frame as an upper trough and a couple of weak 
short waves transition through the area.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...A weak short wave will
continue to press slowly northeast across the region tonight.
Tried to have higher pops on the major terrain features with a
lower probability of precip in the valley; especially Northeast
Tennessee where a downsloping and drying flow should continue
through much of the short term period. Model solutions not all on
the same page for Tuesday with indication of weak lift with an
impulse prior to the approach of the main upper trough and cool
front toward evening. Stayed close to guidance temperatures in the
mid to upper 60s tonight and lower to middle 80s on Tuesday. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Monday)...By 00Z Wednesday, a 
trough will be situated across Ontario and into the Midwest. 
Further west, ridging will extend across the four corners into the
Pacific northwest. This trough will bring a cold front through 
the Tennessee and Ohio valley Tuesday night into Wednesday. As a 
result, large scale forcing for ascent will overspread much of the
region with precipitation expected along and ahead of the frontal
boundary. However, the front will likely be in the process of 
washing out as the low pressure quickly evacuates northward. 
Expect precipitation to wane as the front moves through the area 
on Wednesday. Overall instability is meager at best, although a 
couple of hundred joules of MLCAPE should support chances of 
thunder across much of the forecast area. 

High pressure quickly moves in from the west Wednesday and Wednesday 
night with boundary layer winds quickly turning toward the northwest. 
This will result in a much drier airmass with dewpoints in the low 
to mid 50s area wide. The period of dry weather will persist through 
much of the rest of this week with quasi-zonal flow aloft, and high 
pressure at the surface. Temperatures should continue to be below 
average through this period with highs in the 80s and lows in the 
upper 50s to low 60s. The next chance of rainfall will occur late 
this weekend, as a shortwave trough begins to move into the 
Tennessee valley on Sunday. This will push the surface high 
northeast and begin to turn winds to the south and advect an 
increased theta-e airmass northward. Rain chances will begin to 
increase on Sunday with slight chance to chance PoPs. Flow aloft 
begins to transition to northwest flow by Monday as surface high 
pressure continues to move well to the east. Will maintain slight 
chance to chance PoPs Monday afternoon where diurnal convection will 
be possible. Otherwise, temperatures should begin to increase as the 
ridge of high pressure across the plains moves eastward increasing 
low to mid level thickness values.

.AVIATION...A slow moving upper trough will bring a bit of mvfr
flight weather to cha today due to a little lower ceiling with a
visibility reduction in light rain. Farther east at tys and tri,
the southerly flow across the mountains along the North Carolina
border should keep these terminals in vfr flight weather due to
downslope flow into the Great Valley. Later tonight, an upper
level impulse building northeast across the Southern Appalachian
region could bring slightly lower, but still vfr conditions in
some light rain at tys and tri. Flight operations could return to
mvfr at cha later tonight with this feature.

.DISCUSSION...The current forecast is in rather decent shape for
today with satellite and radar imagery revealing a deep, moist
river in place compliments of a southerly flow out of the Western
Gulf of Mexico. Atmospheric soundings are moist adiabatic in this
environment. Additionally, special enhancers or weak perturbations
within this flow regime are riding steadily north northeast out of
Dixie. One of these in building across the Plateau and another is
emerging through Central Alabama to provide more light rain for 
western parts of the forecast area through the afternoon. Because 
this feature will be moving in for the afternoon period with rain 
already in place across the Plateau and western sections of the 
Tennessee Valley, will tighten up the pop gradient to an even 
greater degree by tweaking a little higher out west. The 
temperature forecast looked very nice with the east to west 
gradient projecting a little warmer afternoon in the downslope and
drier look to northern parts of the Great Valley with the cloud 
and rain cooled western region. Will just do some very minor 
tweaking in the temperature department to adjust for very slight 
differences with reality at the current hour.

Scattered showers are expected over eastern TN today and the first
part of tonight. However some easterly downslope flow across the
TN mountains will likely act to erode showers as they approach
KTRI so only have prevailing -SHRA mentioned at KCHA and KTYS.
MVFR ceilings are likely to occur at those two sites as a result,
with lingering downslope flow acting to keep ceilings in the low-
end VFR range at KTRI. Winds will be light at all terminals, with
southerly or southeasterly winds expected at KCHA through the
period, while winds veer from a east or northeast direction to the
south through the day at KTYS. Easterly winds should persist at
KTRI.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Long wave troughing is in place across the central and northern
plains this morning, with a shortwave trough stretching from the
midwest down through the mid Mississippi Valley. This shortwave
will shift east across Tennessee through the day, lifting north
back into the Ohio River Valley by this evening. At the surface, a
stationary front is positioned well to our south across the
Florida panhandle, stretching northwestward towards the Memphis 
area and further west into the central plains.

Locally, isentropic ascent ahead of the shortwave trough will 
lead to plenty of cloud cover today, as well as generating 
scattered showers across the forecast area. The greatest chances 
will initially be west of I-75. Further east towards the NC 
border, models show easterly downslope flow developing ahead of 
the incoming trough. This should help stave off rainfall until 
later in the day for areas nearer the mountains, but expect those 
areas to eventually see rainfall as well. 

The shortwave trough shifts northeast of the region late this 
evening, but the northern plains trough will deepen tonight as the
next disturbance drops south out of Canada. Strengthening
southerly flow in response to low pressure north of the Great
Lakes will bring the aforementioned stationary front back to the
north as a warm front late tonight and into Tuesday morning. 
Models differ on how much of a chance there is for additional 
rainfall tonight and early Tuesday morning, but given the lack of 
notable upper or mid level ridging behind the lead shortwave 
moving through today, and weak ascent with moistening low levels, 
think it's reasonable to keep some slight to low-end chance PoPs 
in the forecast through the night. The best chances would be in 
the south, nearer the approaching warm front.

As for temperatures, the touch of downslope flow today should 
keep temperatures in areas near the foothills and north of I-40 
warmer, with highs likely near 80. Elsewhere 70s appear more
likely. Regardless, temperatures should be well below normal today
due to all the cloud cover and potential rainfall.


.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...

Main players during the first half of the long term portion of 
the forecast will be a upper trough that drags a frontal boundary 
through the area. On Tuesday the front will be knocking on the 
door, moving in from the northwest. In response we should see 
increasing shower and thunderstorm activity. With temperatures 
expected to only reach into the mid 80's and continuing cloud 
coverage am not expecting much destabilization of the atmosphere, 
so severe weather looks unlikely at this time. Front will make it 
into the Cumberland Plateau around Tuesday evening, and this will 
be the best chance for precipitation across the region. Front will
continue to move through the area during the overnight hours and 
rain chances will taper off during this time.

Behind the front cooler and drier air will be the main weather story 
through the rest of the work week. Weak flow, generally out of the 
north/northwest will keep skies mostly sunny and temperatures a few 
degrees below normal. It should be a very pleasant second half of 
the work week.

Towards the end of the weekend a weak front will try and move into 
the area and along with it southerly/southeasterly flow will allow 
moisture to increase. Shower and thunderstorm chances begin to 
increase with the presence of this additional moisture and the 
frontal boundary. Since the front looks to be pretty weak and 5+ 
days out the models are in some disagreement with strength and 
movement of this system. Will begin to increase precipitation 
chances, but should hopefully be able to trim them down to a 
narrower time frame with later model runs.

Thunderstorm probabilities were too low to include in the TAF at

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...
Mostly cloudy skies continue this afternoon with only isolated 
showers across the plateau and southern valley. Temperatures at mid 
afternoon are in the mid 70s to lower 80s with light north to 
northeast winds across the northern half of the area and southerly 
winds across the south increasing the low level moisture and keeping 
Chattanooga in the mid 70s. Surface high pressure continues across 
the Carolinas and is nosing far to the southwest into GA. The low 
level south to southeast upslope flow will keep a few showers around 
southeast Tennessee and southwest North Carolina through early 
evening. Tropical moisture moving northeast from surface low along 
the LA coast is expected to bring a good amount of moisture over the 
front now over AL and GA and cause showers to develop across the 
southeast half of the forecast area tonight and then the entire 
region Monday. Have slowed the increasing rain chances some thinking 
the models are bringing the rain in a little to soon with drier 
airmass still filtering in from the high pressure to the east. The 
mostly cloudy skies tonight will keep significant fog from forming 
and temperatures should be mostly mid to upper 60s...except near 60 
extreme northeast. Monday temperatures will be held down several 
degrees like today with highs again in the 70s. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
The forecast details for the extended part of the forecast remain
basically the same with an amplifying Eastern U.S. upper trough 
Tuesday into Wednesday. There will be good to likely chance pops 
for showers and thunderstorms in this timeframe as deep moisture 
and associated instability build in ahead of the upper level and 
surface features. The good news for outdoor activity planning is 
another dry period in the northwest to westerly flow behind this 
system extending from Thursday through Saturday. The lower level 
ridge in this drier regime eventually shifts east with the 
approach of another upper level trough and cool front later 
Saturday into Sunday. The southerly flow should bring enough 
moisture into the Southern Appalachian region for the development 
of a few showers and thunderstorms ahead of the front on Sunday. 
Therefore, used a small chance pop at the end of the extended 
period to account for this possibility. Temperatures will be 
seasonably pleasant during much of the long term behind the first 
front; holding near or even a couple degrees below normal. By the 
weekend, temperatures will edge up again while the region awaits 
the arrival of the early week cool front.

.DISCUSSION...
Mostly cloudy skies this morning with some rain showers across
southeast Tennessee and another area from the northern plateau
east to Greene County Tennessee. Higher pressure over the
northeast states had nosed southward east of the Appalachians
bringing in a cooler airmass with an east to northeast surface
flow overnight and this morning across the northern two thirds of
the forecast area. An upper trough had moved into the central 
states today. A weak inverted surface trough was located from 
western TN into eastern KY. Moisture was increasing from the west 
and southwest which was helping to trigger these showers.
 
Temperatures this morning were much cooler than the last several 
days only in the mid 60s to the lower 70s. For the rest of the day
the moisture will gradually increase from the southwest with 
considerable clouds and a chance of showers and isolated storms 
southwest. Farther northeast a few showers central areas due to 
inverted trough brought slight rain chances farther northeast for 
this area. Northeast section should stay dry but mostly cloudy. 
Rainfall amounts should be fairly small most of the region but as 
tropical moisture is moving up into southeast Tennessee and 
precipitable water values there are approaching 2.00 inches a 
quick half inch of rain may fall across the southern plateau 
counties this afternoon. Highs today should only reach the mid 70s
to lower 80s. Updated forecast sent.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Tomorrow)...
Just a few lingering showers in far Southeast Tennessee early this 
morning, expect them to continue to decrease in coverage. With the 
front to our south and winds blowing from the south over the front 
we should see continued cloudy conditions today. This will keep 
temperatures near or cooler than what we saw yesterday with high 
temperatures expected to be in the low 80's across much of the 
Eastern Tennessee Valley. 

Expect another round of afternoon showers and thunderstorms, with 
the highest chances being in southeast Tennessee closer to the 
front. PWAT values are still very high across much of the area, so 
there still remains the threat of heavy downpours with late day 
convection. Expect coverage to be pretty isolated which will 
hopefully mean that any flooding threat also remains isolated.

Cloudy weather will continue into the overnight hours leading to 
mild temperatures as we head into tomorrow.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...
Upper troughing will take hold across the north central and eastern 
United States during the long term, with a couple of notable 
disturbances affecting the southern Appalachian region during that 
time. The first will be a shortwave trough moving east through 
Tennessee on Monday, followed by another affecting our area Tuesday 
night into Wednesday. Showers and thunderstorms will accompany both 
disturbances, but the one on Wednesday will feature a stronger cold 
front that will bring some relief from the heat in the form of 
cooler temperatures and notably drier air.

Infrared satellite imagery shows an area of disturbed weather just 
off the east Texas and Louisiana coastline this morning. This is the 
far southern extent of the trough that will swing through eastern 
Tennessee on Monday. Expect fairly widespread showers on Monday as 
this gets pulled north out of the Gulf and across the southern 
Appalachian region. May be a bit of a break in the rain chances on 
Tuesday as the forecast area lies between the departing trough and 
the incoming front for late Tuesday night into Wednesday. Did leave 
some chance PoPs in the forecast but would not be surprised to see 
Tuesday be dry for most areas. The cold front arrives early 
Wednesday, with rain chances declining quickly during the afternoon 
hours. Behind the front, dry and cooler weather is expected to 
finish out the week and first part of the weekend.

Temperatures on Monday may wind up being the coolest of the week due 
to the widespread rain and cloud cover expected. Guidance suggests 
highs in the 70s most everywhere, with perhaps the northern valley 
breaking into the 80s before the rain arrives in earnest. Some 
models say low 70s in the south, which would be well below normal. 
Trended the forecast in this direction, but am still warmer than 
guidance especially in the southern valley locations. Temps rebound 
back into the 80s for the remainder of the week, but with the caveat 
that it will be notably drier and thus much more comfortable. 
Overnight lows in the 50s to low 60s are expected Wednesday night 
onward.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...Mostly cloudy skies this 
morning and early afternoon has held down temperatures several 
degrees. Skies became partly cloudy the last few hours with 
scattered showers and a few thunderstorms developed across mainly 
southern Tennessee and southwest North Carolina behind cold front 
which had moved south to northern AL and TN by this afternoon. The
northern two thirds of the area have had no convection through 
mid afternoon. North to northeast winds have brought in slightly 
drier and cooler air into the forecast area this afternoon. 
Temperatures at mid afternoon were in the 70s central and 
northeast and higher elevations to the 80s south and in the upper 
80s extreme south. Have lowered rain chances northern areas to 
just slight chance remainder of the afternoon and chance pops 
central and southern mountains and southern valley and plateau 
through about 25/00Z. Tonight moisture begins to increase from the
southwest and west as shortwave energy moves in from the west and
southwest. After initially decreasing showers and thunderstorms 
this evening shortwave energy moving around upper trough moving up
into the Mississippi Valley late tonight and then moving into the
Tennessee Valley Sunday should trigger some showers and a few 
thunderstorms in southeast Tennessee and the plateau late tonight 
and then mostly from the central valley, across the plateau and 
the southern valley areas Sunday. Considerable cloud cover Sunday
should also hold temperatures down to only the 70s to near 80, 
several degrees below normal.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...A large corridor of 
deep moisture and buoyant air will be advancing east out of the 
Lower Mississippi Valley and southeastern states ahead of an 
amplifying, North Central U.S. long wave trough to begin the work 
week. This feature is modeled to have at least a couple shorter 
wavelength impulses that will enhance the development of more 
showers and thunderstorms across the Southern Appalachian region on 
Monday and Tuesday. Cooler and drier air will be making its way 
south through the Upper Midwest into the Mid South on Wednesday in 
association with the relatively deep long wave trough. This will be 
the beginning of about a three day period of pleasant, uneventful 
weather with lower humidity and temperatures near, of not a degree 
or two below normal for late August. Placed a slight chance for a 
shower or thunderstorm back in the forecast for Saturday with model 
indication of the arrival of another upper level trough and cool 
front.

Considerable cloud cover this morning and cooler temperatures as
cold front has moved through the area overnight. A later start to
convection today with clouds and higher instability shifting
south. Highest rain chances will be over the eastern mountains and
extreme southern counties of Tennessee and in North Carolina.
Precipitable water values have dropped to 1.2 to 1.5 inches across
the north. Southern sections still as high as 1.8 inches. Expect
some locally heavy rain southern areas but less threat for
flooding overall since higher rainfall amounts fell over northern
Tennessee. Temperatures will be cooler today in the 70s northeast
and higher elevations and lower to middle 80s lower elevations.
extreme south may still reach near 90 if skies clear enough.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Frontal boundary is over the forecast area early this morning, 
helping to maintain shower activity through the night in Northeast
Tennessee and Southwest Virginia. Isolated activity may continue 
through the early morning hours, but should decrease in coverage 
by late morning. Could see some fog develop before sunrise, but so
far the lingering shower activity and associated cloud coverage 
has kept away widespread fog. Expect more shower and thunderstorms
development this afternoon and evening once again. Highest 
chances for activity will be in Southeast Tennessee and far 
Southwest North Carolina. Once again the biggest weather hazard 
today will be additional heavy rain leading to flooding. Northeast
Tennessee has seen the most rainfall over the past couple of 
days, so areas along the northern Cumberland Plateau towards the 
Tri-Cities area will be the most flood prone. 

Thunderstorm activity will once again decrease after the sun sets 
into the overnight hours. Temperatures should be several degrees 
lower today with highs expected to be in the upper 70's to upper 
80's across the Valley.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...
Upper level ridging over New England will begin to pull away to 
the northeast Sunday as a shortwave trough approaches from the 
west, eventually moving east of the Mississippi and across middle 
and eastern Tennessee on Monday. This shortwave will be the first 
in a couple of disturbances embedded in a larger, deepening trough
over the northern plains and upper midwest. The last of these 
short waves will swing through the Ohio River Valley late Tuesday 
night into Wednesday, ushering a strong cold front into the region
along with cooler and notably drier air.

On Sunday, surface high pressure will extend from New England into 
the southern Appalachians, helping to keep a cold front situated 
just to our south. Despite the front being south of the area, lift 
ahead of the approaching upper trough will begin to spread showers 
into the forecast area from the southwest beginning Sunday 
afternoon. Low level flow across the mountains will likely produce 
some downsloping conditions to counter the onset of rain for much of 
the area north of I-40 on Sunday, but rain will eventually spread 
across much of the area by Monday. Diurnal trends should lead to a 
lull in convective activity Monday night, but another round of 
showers is expected Tuesday into Tuesday night as a cold front 
sweeps through.

Drop rain chances quickly Wednesday afternoon and evening coincident 
with the cold front passage. Behind the front, temperatures will 
drop to slightly below normal values with highs ranging from the low 
80s up north to mid/upper 80s in the south. Dewpoints will also drop 
into the 50s to low 60s so it will feel pleasant outside on Thursday 
and Friday.

.DISCUSSION...
Current observations show a surface front located across northern
parts of the forecast area, and this area of boundary layer
convergence is responsible for the scattered showers and isolated
thunderstorms across the northern plateau and NE TN. With the loss
of daytime heating and decreasing instability, expect a decrease
in coverage during the next few hours with only a few isolated
showers late tonight along and south of this cold front. In areas
that received precipitation today and have a clearing sky, some fog
is likely, especially across the northern half of the forecast 
area. However, extent of fog is uncertain and will be dependent 
on the amount of clearing and magnitude of northerly dry air 
advection. Made some minor adjustments to PoPs and hourly grids to
reflect current observations.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
A weak and diffuse cold front was drifting south from Kentucky 
and Virginia into northern Tennessee this afternoon. Scattered
showers and thunderstorms were developing across the forecast
area. They were most concentrated in southeast Tennessee with
strong to severe storms moving across McMinn and Monroe Counties.
Intense heating and high moisture levels will keep a good chance
of showers and thunderstorms to continue across southeast
Tennessee and southwest North Carolina ahead of the front. The
storms are slow moving and there may be some localized flooding
with any training of cells especially this evening. There may be
some patchy fog but cloud cover will last awhile after tonight's
convection so expect only patchy areas. Lows tonight will be
cooler north behind front but still upper 60s to lower 70s central
and southern sections. Saturday slightly lower rain chances as
front settles along southern Tennessee. Rain chances should still
be 30 to 50 percent. Highs a couple degrees lower with more cloud
cover expected.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
Model forecasts are in decent agreement through most of the long 
term period. Initially, a frontal boundary that is currently 
drifting slowly south through the region will not move too far 
away by Sunday; stalling out across Northern sections of Alabama 
and Georgia. Model depiction indicates there will be assistance 
with lifting in the vicinity of this boundary from a weak short 
wave riding east northeast from the Mississippi Valley through the
Ohio Valley. This synoptic setup will allow for higher pops for 
convection across southern and western sections of the forecast 
area. A more amplified short wave builds into the Southern 
Appalachians on Monday, keeping relatively high pops in place for 
more cooling thunderstorms. Models generally agree on the eventual
formation of an amplified long wave trough moving into the 
eastern states around the Tuesday through Wednesday timeframe. 
Some uncertainty exists on timing for this feature so just 
gradually have pops dropping mid to late week as drier westerly 
flow fills in behind the associated late summer cool front.

temperatures were rising quickly and expect highs to reach mid 80s
to near 90 before storms lower temperatures. Precipitable water 
values rise from 1.6-1.7 inches to around 1.9 inches by tonight. 
Heavy rainfall in storms may also cause some localized flooding

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Front currently slowly making it's way southward across Kentucky 
early this morning and along it a shortwave will move across from 
west to east through the day today. Further up in the atmosphere 
we will see divergence aloft towards the right rear of a upper 
level jet leading to convergence near the surface. These will all 
combine to help showers and thunderstorms continue through most of
the day today. We could see some patchy fog this morning, but so 
far cloud coverage has been keeping fog at bay.

Expect coverage to remain relatively scattered early this morning 
into the afternoon, and eventually increasing storm coverage later 
in the day when the shortwave is over the area.

CAPE values around 1000-1500 J/kg and shear values around 10 knots 
mean that storms will struggle to become strong/severe, but it can't 
be entirely ruled out for a storm to cause brief strong winds. The 
bigger threat remains flooding with the storms expected today. Most 
of East TN/Southwest VA has seen rain over the past 24 hours with 
isolated locations seeing close to 2 inches of rain. The efficient 
rainfall producing storms will continue today with PWAT values over 
the area expected to be around 1.5-2.0 inches. The 90th percentile 
for PWAT value this time of year is around 1.85 inches meaning that 
we are in an abnormally moist atmosphere. 

With the additional rainfall and clouds in the area expect 
temperatures to several degrees cooler today compared to yesterday. 
But relative humidity values will remain elevated meaning that it 
will still be muggy out there.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...

The long term period will begin with the upper levels resembling 
somewhat of an omega block pattern, with broad troughing over the
northwestern parts of the CONUS and a sharper/deeper trough over 
the eastern Great Lakes and New England parts of the country. 
Meanwhile, high amplitude upper ridging will be in place across 
the upper midwest between the two areas of troughing. At the 
surface, the aforementioned front will be well to our south but 
the mid level reflection of that boundary will be pretty firmly 
entrenched in the vicinity or just south of the I-40 corridor 
across the eastern half of Tennessee and the southern Appalachian 
chain. With time the western trough will deepen over the plains
and mid Mississippi Valley as the quasi-omega block shifts east,
allowing for southerly flow in the mid levels to spread back over
the region by late Sunday afternoon and evening. This continues
through mid week before the trough finally kicks east of the Great
Lakes and pushes another front through the region by late week.

What does this mean locally? Rain chances will remain high 
through the weekend with the presence of the mid level front 
providing a focus for shower and thunderstorm development both 
Saturday and Sunday. For early next week more broad brushed chance
PoPs are in the forecast with the approach of upper level 
troughing and increase moisture levels in general. The forecast 
reflects higher chances to the south of the I-40 corridor this 
weekend however, as that is where the mid level front is most 
likely to reside. Kept at least some slight chances of showers and
thunderstorms in the north as well though, especially in the 
mountainous terrain where differential heating effects will yield 
typical summertime afternoon shower development. Temperature wise,
northerly flow and the likelihood of scattered to widespread 
showers and associated cloud cover should keep temperatures around
normal levels. Expect a return of above normal afternoon highs by
Tuesday though as southerly flow returns.

.DISCUSSION...
Scattered showers and thunderstorms continue this evening with
greatest coverage across the central valley and mountain
foothills. According to RAP forecast analysis, this is in a
location of low-level convergence and upper-level divergence. A
weak jet streak and diffluent flow aloft is resulting in upper 
divergence supporting deep lift with a converging 850mb flow of 
about 20 kt. This is expected to shift northeast overnight with 
near term guidance suggesting the 850mb flow increasing. This will
result in greater boundary layer convergence across NE TN and SW 
VA between 09z and 12z Friday. The severe weather threat appears 
very low, but a few thunderstorms could have gusty winds with 
850mb flow forecast to be near 30 kt. The main hazard will be 
heavy rainfall which may result in isolated flash flooding 
concerns late tonight and early Friday morning across NE TN and SW
VA. PW values will be high, near 1.9 inches which is near the max
of climatology for this area, and flow will be nearly parallel to
the southward moving frontal boundary approaching the region later
Friday. Numerous showers and thunderstorms are expected on Friday 
ahead of this frontal boundary with greatest coverage across the 
northern two-thirds of the forecast area.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
GOES 16 water vapor imagery depicts troughing across much of the
Ohio valley and into the central plains. A disturbance within 
that flow can also be seen which is helping to generate convection
further west across the midsouth. Across our area, radar remains 
active with scattered showers and thunderstorms mainly across 
northern areas. The atmosphere remains moist and unstable with 
MLCAPE values near 1500-2000 j/kg although lapse rates are nearly 
moist adiabatic. Lowering heights aloft combined with differential
heating should allow for additional showers and thunderstorms to 
develop across the area. Thermodynamics remain adequate for 
marginally severe storms with damaging winds the main threat. As 
low layer winds continue to turn toward the south this afternoon 
and evening, moisture will continue to advect into the region. 
This along with weak winds aloft will contribute to heavy rainfall
and localized flash flooding potential. WPC has shifted the Day 1
excessive rainfall outlook further south and now includes extreme
portions of northeast Tennessee. Both of these hazards are 
included in the HWO. 

The boundary to the north will sink south into the Ohio and
Tennesee valley overnight. Increased convergence along with PVA 
will contribute to increased deep layer lift for showers and 
embedded thunderstorms. The best chances of rainfall should remain
across northern portions of the forecast area (north of I-40) 
closer to the front.

On Friday the boundary will remain to the north. Aloft, several 
disturbance will traverse the region and combined with frontal 
forcing will produce chances of showers and thunderstorms through 
much of the day. Temperatures on Friday will likely be a degree or
two cooler than today with increased cloud cover and 
precipitation. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
By Friday night, the trough will move out of the Great Lakes while 
at the surface, the front should be to the east of the forecast 
area. While the better frontal forcing should be well to the east,
some small perturbations in upper flow will generate at least 
weak lift. With moisture still in place, would expect at least 
chances of showers and thunderstorms to remain across a good 
portion of the area. Saturday, the higher chances of precipitation
will shift further south as the low level moisture begins to pool
along the boundary. On Sunday, a shortwave will move into the 
midwest while at the surface high pressure across the Great Lakes 
moves east. The boundary to the south will gradually move 
northward. As a result chances of precipitation will begin to 
increase mainly south of I-40. 

The rest of the work week will continue to feature chances of 
showers and thunderstorms as the region remains under cyclonic 
flow aloft. Temperatures will likely remain near climatology 
through next week. Some model differences exist for the end of the
extended. Decided to keep low end PoPs by the end of the 
extended.

Low confidence aviation forecast through the next 24 hours.
Current radar depicts most SHRA/TSRA activity across northern
portions of the forecast area. Much of the activity that passed
through TRI reduced visibilities into IFR category for a brief 
period. For the afternoon, expect VCTS across most of the area 
with better chances after 21Z with TEMPO groups to highlight this.
Otherwise CIGS should gradually lower through the evening and 
overnight but should remain VFR. Cannot rule out MVFR or lower 
CIGS in and near thunderstorms. An upper level disturbance to the 
west will move closer tonight and should increase chances of SHRA 
across all TAF sites through morning. Guidance has been fairly 
persistent in bringing in lower CIGS on Friday at TYS and TRI. 
This seems plausible as moisture deepens on Friday. Winds should 
remain light through the period, but could become gusty in

boundary to the north. CAMS show a brief dry period late this
morning which should contribute to a destabilizing airmass. The
result will be isolated to scattered thunderstorm development this
afternoon. The approach of an upper level disturbance from the
north will back low layer winds to the south and advect deep 
layer moisture. PW values will be increasing this afternoon and 
into the evening which suggests a heavy rainfall and localized 
flash flood threat could exist. Moist adiabatic lapse rates should
limit overall severe potential but a few strong to marginally 
severe storms are possible this afternoon and evening. Otherwise, 
the forecast remains in great shape and only made minor 
adjustments to hourly temperatures, and PoPs this afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a 
closed low near Hudson Bay with several shortwave troughs rotating 
around the main low. The most pronounced of these shortwave troughs 
is currently located across the western Great Lakes. Closer to home, 
the upper level flow is rather zonal with a few weak shortwaves of 
note. Seeing a few showers/storms early this morning associated with 
a weak shortwave moving across the Midwest with precipitation 
across MO/IL/W KY. The ridge to the southwest has flattened as the
pattern begins to shift today. At the surface, a low is centered 
over Quebec with a front stretching to the southwest to near Lake 
Erie into the central Plains. Coverage of showers and storms was 
fairly limited yesterday but expect there could be a few areas of 
patchy fog especially near area lakes and rivers.

For today, the area of showers and storms to the west will drift 
further to the east later this morning. However, IR imagery 
indicates cloud tops are warming and expect the weakening trend 
will continue this morning. For now, have have around 20-30% 
chances late this morning for locations north of I-40 but not 
overly confident in this. Moisture will be increasing throughout 
the short-term forecast period with decent low-level moisture 
advection. PW values will increase into the 1.8-2.0 inch range by 
the end of the day. These values are near the 90th percentile for 
late August. Again, expect diurnally driven showers and storms 
across the area this afternoon and evening. With the high moisture
in place, lapse rates will be near moist adiabatic and expect 
lower values of SBCAPE. However, there could be the potential for 
an isolated wet microburst and will add the mention for a few 
strong to marginally severe storms to the HWO with gusty winds 
being the main threat. Highs today will range from upper 80s to 
low 90s.

The front will make a push southward later this evening into the 
overnight hours as the trough across the western Great Lakes dives 
southeastward into the Ohio River Valley. Concurrently, a weaker 
shortwave will move into the Tennessee River Valley. Due to this, 
have continued with elevated precipitation chances into the overnight 
period tonight. Model soundings are saturated overnight with PW 
values increasing to over 2 inches. With the loss of daytime heating 
and weak lapse rates, not seeing much instability overnight and have 
only included a slight chance for thunder. Overnight lows will range 
from mid 60s to low 70s. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...

Trough over the great lakes region will help to slowly move a 
frontal boundary southward into the area by Friday. Ripple of energy 
will zip across the front on Friday bringing another round of 
widespread showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. Around 1000-
1500 J/kg of CAPE and PWAT values of around 2 inches will mean that 
a good portion of the area should have thunderstorm activity in the 
vicinity. Expect storms to be moving generally parallel with the 
front so the threat for training storms exists, meaning the main 
hazard continues to be flooding. Biggest threat areas for flooding 
looks to be north of Interstate 40 where multiple days of widespread 
heavy rainfalls looks more likely Thursday/Friday.

On Saturday the higher chances of rain shift further south as 
moisture pools along the boundary. On Sunday the front begins to 
move back to the north, keeping higher chances of precipitation 
south of Interstate 40. Dew points and moisture in the area will 
remain somewhat elevated so will keep precipitation chances for more 
diurnally driven storms as we start the work week. Next system will 
be a frontal boundary moving in from the west riding along a trough 
moving across the North Central Plains of the US. Models are in a 
little better agreement, but still differ slightly on timing and 
orientation of the front.

.DISCUSSION...A stray shower/storm lingering over the area should 
shortly come to an end by midnight and overall expect a quiet and 
dry night with a few bands of clouds overhead and winds becoming 
light. Thursday will see clouds slowly increasing from north to 
south through the day as a weak impulse moves in in advance of an 
approaching frontal boundary.  The main band of convection is 
expected generally along the frontal boundary and should therefore 
remain to our north. However...the atmosphere will become weakly 
unstable.  DCAPE values should be around 500 to 800 J/Kg.  PWs 
should range from around an inch and a half to an inch and three 
quarters.  So overall...expect scattered convection to form as the 
impulse moves in.  Do not anticipate a significant weather 
day...though a stray strong storm can not be ruled out.  Will lower 
overnight PoPs but otherwise current forecast on track for the 
evening update.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Currently across the area, skies were mostly clear with
temperatures rising into the upper 80s to low 90s. Dewpoints
remain in the upper 60's to low 70's. KMRX radar is depicting
isolated showers developing near a weak upper level disturbance.
Water vapor imagery shows an area of dry air advecting into the
region underneath the descending branch of the trough. Aloft, weak
ridging behind the departing shortwave should bring quiet conditions
through the afternoon and evening. Can't rule out a couple of 
additional showers and thunderstorms through the evening and 
overnight but most areas will likely stay dry. A secondary 
shortwave trough will begin to move out of the midwest late 
tonight sending a front south through the Ohio valley. Showers and
thunderstorms are expected to increase on Thursday mainly 
after noon and into the evening ahead of the upper level 
disturbance. Weak lapse rates should limit overall severe weather 
threat although a strong storm or two cannot be ruled out. 
Temperatures should continue to be near to slightly above normal 
for the short term period. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
The pattern will be a rather active one for our area through much of 
the long term period, with at least chance PoPs in the forecast each 
day. 

A trough dropping SE across the Great Lakes will push a cold front 
into the OH Valley Thursday night. A small shortwave trough is 
expected to approach from the west and strengthen lift long the 
front on Friday. PW values rise to around 2 inches with MLCAPE in 
the neighborhood of 1500 J/kg. These factors will support likely 
PoPs for most of the area with categorical PoPs north closer to the 
front. The front begins to move into the area Friday night, shifting 
higher rain chances to the southern half. The surface front and a
midlevel deformation zone will be across the central portions of 
the area Saturday, dividing likely PoPs south of I-40 to chance 
PoPs north.

A low pressure system over the Plains will start to increase the 
southerly flow through the column that will push the front back to 
the north on Sunday. As this system tracks in to the Great Lakes 
region, moisture advection in the warm sector brings PoPs back up to 
the likely range for the entire area on Monday. There is poor 
agreement on the timing of a cold front approaching from the west, 
but they do show a broad trough across the eastern half of the 
country. As a result, chance PoPs will be kept in the forecast 
through Wednesday.

.DISCUSSION...
Made a couple of changes to the morning update. Decided to cut
back timing and amount of PoPs today and tonight. Also bumped up
high temperatures today by a degree or two. Current water vapor 
imagery indicates a shortwave trough moving across the Ohio valley
with a substantial amount of dry air associated with this 
feature. Area radars are clear and visible satellite depicts 
mostly clear skies across much of the area. Early this morning, 
hi-resolution guidance depicted areas of SHRA/TSRA moving through 
the area this morning. As indicated by recent radar, this is not 
anticipated. As of the past few runs, the HRRR has also trended 
much drier and aligns well with the NAM. Given the relatively dry
air aloft moving in, and any surface or boundary layer features 
well to the north, do not anticipate as much coverage of 
precipitation today as previously expected, although feel the need
to keep slight chance PoPs given the warm and unstable boundary 
layer. The terrain of the Cumberland Plateau, and the Smoky
Mountains would serve as the most likely location of thunderstorms
this afternoon. Should thunderstorms form, they could contain a 
damaging wind risk as the dry air aloft contributes to large DCAPE
values this afternoon. Furthermore, given the relatively clear 
skies in place, would think that high temperatures this afternoon 
may be a degree or two higher than the previous forecast and this 
is reflected in the updated forecast package.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate a 
trough located near Lake Erie stretching southward into the 
Tennessee River Valley. This trough is moving around the periphery 
of the ridge that is holding strong across central and southern 
Plains. Radar imagery across the region is quiet with most of the 
activity in the region to the east across the Carolinas. The trough 
axis should move through the area over the next few hours. Due to 
the lack of instability and best forcing being well to the north, 
expect conditions will remain mostly dry this morning. A few models 
are trying to show a few shower/storms with this trough passage this 
morning but just not seeing any development on IR satellite imagery. 
Mid to high clouds will continue this morning as the trough axis 
moves through the region. With the increased cloud cover, do not 
anticipate any fog formation this morning. 

The ridge to the southwest will begin to weaken some today as a 
trough moves across the central Plains. Upper level heights at 500mb 
will only be 1-2 dm lower than today but the cloud cover this 
morning will hinder the heating some. Highs today will still be in 
the upper 80s to low 90s for most locations Instability will build 
throughout the afternoon with heating. SBCAPE values will increase 
into the 1500-2000 J/Kg range. Deep layer 0-6 km bulk shear will be 
light around 10-15 kts as typical in the summer with weak flow 
aloft. Model soundings indicate some dry mid-level air, especially 
north of I-40. These soundings produce impressive DCAPE values above 
1200 J/Kg. Due to this, expect there could be some strong to 
marginally severe storms once again this afternoon with damaging 
winds being the main threat. A MCS will develop to the northwest 
later this afternoon/evening as the trough across the central Plains 
tracks into the Mid-Mississippi River Valley. This MCS will move 
into west TN/KY later this afternoon/evening and will weaken as it 
continues to the southeast. Therefore, have continued with at least 
some mention of precipitation into the overnight hours tonight. 
Although, expect the risk of strong to severe storms will be limited 
to this afternoon and evening convection. Lows tonight will be near 
normal for late August ranging from the mid 60s to low 70s.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...

As we move into Thursday there will still be a broad trough over the 
northern/eastern half of the US and a ridge over the southeastern 
portion of the country. Wedged between these features will be a 
relatively weak frontal boundary. Forecast models are indicating 
that the front will be slowly moving across Kentucky on Thursday. 
During this time moisture will continue to move in from the south 
and begin to pool along and south of the front. The highest chances 
for shower and thunderstorm activity will be along the front, but 
even south of the front we should see decent coverage of summer 
thunderstorms. Still looks like Thursday/Friday will have the most 
coverage of storms as the front drifts further south over the area. 
We could see some strong storms during this time frame, but the 
biggest threat continues to be possible flooding. PWAT values will 
be over 1.5 inches and approach 2 inches on Friday, and this will 
help lead to efficient rain producing storms. 

Front will weaken and begin to lift to the north over the weekend, 
leading to continued, but less widespread, chances for 
precipitation. While the front leaves the area there will be 
incoming shortwave trough moving in from the west at the end of the 
weekend. So will continue with precipitation chances, but will 
hopefully be able to trim the temporal duration of them when models 
are in better agreement of when the shortwave actually moves through.
During the long term portion of the forecast temperatures should 
remain around normal with daytime highs mostly in the upper 80's 
across the Eastern Tennessee Valley.

.DISCUSSION...There is a weakening MCS moving through the area late 
this evening.  It will continue to weaken and its remnants should 
push out during the overnight hours.  As a result...a few areas of 
convection will persist for much of the night. Have made some minor 
adjustments to PoPs to handle what's left of the system. On 
Wednesday...a short wave will move through the area during the 
morning...additionally...normal diurnal convection will once again 
develop across the region during the afternoon.  With all of 
this...expect a potential for scattered thunderstorm through the 
day.  For temperatures...lows tonight will be quite mild with 
reading ranging from the mid 60s to lower 70s across most valley 
locations.  On Wednesday...with the expected cloud cover...highs may 
be a degree or so lower that the past couple of day...but it will 
still be rather hot with valley temperatures topping out in the 
upper 80s to low 90s.  Current forecast on track...will update to

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)....Weak short wave energy over 
the Mississippi valley tracking southeast and will move across our 
area late tonight/early Wednesday. The MCS over the southern 
Illinois area is forecast to move southeast, but most models, 
including the CAMS, have it weakening significantly/and or dying 
completely before it makes it into our area which seems reasonable 
given the lower CAPE values here. However, we still may see some 
showers and/or thunderstorms overnight as the remains/outflow of the 
MCS arrives early and again later tonight as the weak short wave 
energy approaches, so will keep PoPs no lower than slight chance all 
night. Expect temperatures to be a bit lower on Wednesday with the 
increase in cloud cover, but will still have max temps a little 
above guidance.  Expect scattered convection again on Wednesday, but 
given the weak short wave energy traversing the area in the 
morning/early afternoon the convection may be less diurnally driven 
than recent days. A few storms may be strong to severe this 
afternoon/evening and again on Wednesday, with damaging winds the 
primary threat so will include this in the HWO. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)... By 00Z 
Thursday, broad troughing will be situated across much of the 
eastern United States with ridging to the south. At the surface, a
weakly defined boundary will move through the Ohio valley from an
area of low pressure moving through Quebec. As a result, surface 
flow will generally orient out of the south and west advecting 
moisture into the region ahead of the frontal boundary. Diurnal 
convection will likely be ongoing at the start of the extended 
with coverage continuing into Thursday as heights begin to fall 
with the approach of a diving shortwave moving out of the Canadian
provinces. As the front approaches, it will likely be in the 
process of washing out as evident in 2-D surface fields and cross 
sections as the boundary layer flow does not veer as sharply. 
Nonetheless, frontal convergence along with moisture pooling along
the boundary combined with favorable upper level ascent will 
promote an increase in coverage and chances of precipitation. As 
of this forecast package, the highest coverage of SHRA/TSRA seems 
to be in the Thursday afternoon/night and Friday time frame. 
Precipitable water values increase to near 2.0 inches Thursday and
Friday which indicates a heavy rainfall potential. Temperatures 
will likely align closer to climatological values given the 
increased cloud cover and precipitation expected.

The stalled boundary will begin to lift north as a warm front 
Saturday evening and should provide as a focus for additional 
chances of showers and thunderstorms. Aloft, a shortwave trough will 
traverse the Tennessee valley and provide large scale ascent to much 
of the area. This combined with a southerly flow will lead to 
increased precipitation Sunday through Tuesday with the higher 
chances during the afternoon hours. Precipitation will likely wane 
in the evening hours with the loss of daytime heating. Lapse rates 
become nearly moist adiabatic Sunday night and into Monday with PW 
values above 2.0 inches. Heavy rainfall again appears possible 
during this time. Temperatures should be near to slightly below 
normal this weekend and into early next week.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Current water vapor and RAP upper air analysis indicate a few 
upper level features of note. The first is the ridge that is 
centered across NE TX into OK. A weak shortwave trough is 
rotating around the periphery of the ridge to the north near 
IA. There is also another shortwave trough to the southeast 
across GA/SC. Closer to home, anticyclonic flow continues aloft 
with the ridge to the southwest. IR satellite imagery indicates 
mostly clear skies across the forecast area. Dewpoints are a 
bit higher than the past few morning and there could be some 
patchy fog, especially near area lakes and rivers.

The ridge will continue to be the main influence today. Upper
level heights will be similar to yesterday with 500mb heights in
the 590-592 dm range. Due to this, sided with the warmer side of
guidance again. Expect highs today will be in the mid to upper 90s
for most locations with heat indices near 100 in the southern
valley. PW values today will start out in the 1.4-1.6 inch range.
These values are around the 50th-75th percentile for late August.
Overall, expect a similar coverage to yesterday with not much
forcing. The shortwave trough currently over IA does move into the
Ohio River Valley later this evening. Models indicate a MCS
developing with this system and show a pronounced weakening trend
before it reaches the forecast area. A few models actually show it
dissipating all together. For now, expect a few strong to
marginally severe storms may be possible this afternoon similar to
yesterday. Gusty winds and small hail will be the main threats.
Any ongoing convection should come to an end near sunset with the
loss of daytime heating. Overnight lows will range from the mid
60s to low 70s for most locations. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...

Broad ridging over the Central/Western US, with mild troughing over 
the East Coast will be in place on Wednesday. The low driving the 
trough will slide eastward across Canada, and try to push a frontal 
boundary into the region. Precipitable Water values will increase as 
winds begin to turn more southerly as the frontal boundary 
approaches. While the frontal boundary looks to remain north of the 
area, temperatures should get warm enough on Wednesday to see 
another round of shower and thunderstorm activity.

Front continues to attempt a further push to the south, but with 
very little forcing it will move pretty slow as it gets into 
Kentucky/Tennessee. As usual in these scenarios the models differ 
with how far the front pushes south during the second half of the 
week. Should lead to continuing chances of more widespread showers 
and thunderstorms as we head towards the weekend. Biggest weather 
concerns during the long term portion of the forecast will be the 
potential for several days worth of storms leading to isolated 
flooding in locations that receive multiple rounds of heavy rain.

Over the weekend the trough over the eastern half of the US finally 
moves off to the east leading to a quasi-zonal flow over the area. 
Will still have the possibilty of diurnally driven storms over the 
weekend and into next week, but expect the coverage to be lower than 
Wed-Fri.

.DISCUSSION...

No changes for the evening update. Though isolated in nature,
afternoon convection did feature some fairly strong storms.
Downdraft CAPE was in the 1,000 to 1,300 J/kg range per the SPC
mesoanalysis website during the afternoon hours today. Thus the
stronger updrafts/storms today were able to produce some strong 
winds in a few places when they collapsed. As of 9:00 PM this
convection had completely died off, with only some high clouds 
from the last singular storm over Bledsoe and far western Rhea 
county remaining.. For the overnight hours, expect similar 
conditions to what was seen last night. Mostly clear skies, and 
temperatures in the 60s to low 70s for overnight lows. As noted by
the day shift at shift change today, dewpoints were higher in 
most places this afternoon than the same time yesterday. As a
result it is possible that some patchy fog will develop during 
the pre-dawn hours. If it occurs it would likely be in the places
that received rainfall today. Added some fog to the aviation 
forecast for the Chattanooga airport but did not add this into the
forecast elsewhere as it should remain very isolated in nature.

Otherwise, the forecast appears to be on track and no changes were
necessary.

Afternoon convection will continue to trend downward in coverage
and intensity, but will carry VCSH at KCHA and KTYS through 02z to
account for what is left. Similar conditions are expected
tomorrow, with CU field developing around/after 16z and isolated
to scattered storms in the afternoon. Coverage will again be too
low to warrant including in TAFs at this time. Otherwise,
dewpoints did not mix out as low today as yesterday. And given
rain at KCHA it seems reasonable that some fog will develop. Have
a TEMPO for 4SM to cover that. Elsewhere fog does not seem as
likely.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...Mid/upper level ridging 
to our west will continue to extend into our area for the short term 
period, with the air mass over our region undergoing little change. 
Ongoing convection is expected to wane quickly toward sunset, 
with a mostly clear sky over much of the area tonight. Model 
soundings for tomorrow look similar to today. Expect convection to
fire first in the higher terrain around noon, and outflow 
boundaries moving into the valley may trigger isolated convection 
there as well as the afternoon progresses. MAV temps look too low 
for max temperatures Tuesday as has been the case recently, so 
will go higher than guidance again. Heat index values should top 
out from the mid 90s to around 100 across most of the valley. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...We begin Tuesday 
night with a distinct shortwave moving from IL/IN into southern 
Ohio as the strong ridge in the southern Plains begins to slowly 
retreat. A few CAMS are showing an MCS moving ESE into parts of 
northeast TN and southwest VA between 03 and 05Z. Deep layer shear
is substantially weaker over our region compared to farther 
north, but there will be lingering instability well into the night
with MLCAPES progged at 1000-1500 J/Kg. If the convective complex
has a strong enough cold pool, think it's feasible that 
showers/storms will impact at least the northern valley and 
southwest VA between 03 and 06Z. The SPC has put the entire region
in a marginal risk Tuesday night, so have increased pops to 
higher chance category the first half of the night. The main 
threat would be damaging winds. 

The deep layer ridge over the south central U.S. will further 
retreat to the western U.S. Wednesday allowing a longwave trough to 
begin developing in the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. This will force 
a cold front slowly southward. Before this front gets here, 
southwesterly WAA and lingering ridging aloft will maintain very hot 
and humid weather Wednesday. Heat indices in the low 100's will 
continue across parts of the southern valley. Diurnal convection 
will be more widespread Wednesday afternoon with projected soundings 
showing increasing moisture and instability along with limited 
capping. PWATs will range from 1.60 to 1.90 inches with MLCAPE of 
1500-2000 J/Kg. At this time, will go with chance pops for scattered 
convection Wednesday since the forcing will still be well to the 
north. 

The mid level trough will continue deepening Wednesday night and 
Thursday pushing the cold front into KY, and perhaps into the TN 
valley by Thursday afternoon. The GFS remains faster with this front 
compared to the ECMWF. Due to the strong ridge and August 
climatology, am leaning toward the slower ECMWF. Nevertheless, the 
increasing large scale forcing for ascent, deep moisture, and 
instability will cause showers/storms to be on the increase. 
Maintained chance pops Wednesday night increasing to likely 
Thursday. The boundary still looks to struggle to completely push 
through our region Thursday night and Friday, so its exact placement 
remains uncertain. Since the boundary will be oriented E-W somewhere 
in our vicinity and the mid/upper flow will be WNW allowing weak 
disturbances to ripple through, we will continue to see fairly 
widespread coverage of thunderstorms during peak heat with lingering 
showers at night. Kept chance pops Thursday night with likely pops 
central/southern areas Friday. The high moisture environment and 
multiple rounds of convection could lead to localized flooding in a 
few spots, but recent dry weather should keep this isolated. Went a 
little below NBM numbers for temps Thursday and Friday due to 
increased clouds.

The upper trough will slowly pull away Saturday and Sunday with a 
weak overall flow regime returning to the TN valley and southern 
Appalachians as the northern stream jet returns more zonal. The old 
frontal boundary will either wash out or retreat back north, so have 
chance pops for mainly diurnal convection and temps near normal late 
August values. Further height rises Monday and deepening 
southwesterly flow will allow for temps warming above normal
again.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Current water vapor and RAP upper air analysis indicates an upper 
level shortwave to the north across the Great Lakes. There is a 
weaker shortwave trough that is currently moving into the Ohio and 
Tennessee River Valleys. IR satellite imagery indicates widespread 
cloud cover from the Great lakes southward into the Tennessee River 
Valley. There are a few showers/storms further to the north in 
OH/KY. Further to the southwest, there is an upper level ridge 
centered over Texas. PW values across the area are around 1.4-1.6 
inches. These values are near the 50th-75th percentiles for mid-
August. Some patchy fog will be possible early this morning, 
especially near area lakes and rivers but do not anticipate any 
widespread issues. 

For today, expect the shortwave trough will exit to the east of the 
area by this afternoon. With the trough axis moving through this 
morning, do not anticipate anything outside a couple of isolated 
showers/storms due to the lack of heating and instability. By this 
afternoon, the ridge to the southwest will expand to the northeast 
with 500mb heights in the 590-592 dm range. High temperatures 
yesterday were in the mid to upper 90s for most locations and do not 
see any reason why this would not be the case today. Due to 
forecasting higher temperatures, went with slightly lower dewpoints 
this afternoon generally in the mid 60s. This will result in heat 
indices being a couple of degrees warmer than the actual air 
temperature. Heat indices will be near 100 degrees across most of 
the southern valley this afternoon. There could be a few isolated to 
scattered showers/storms this afternoon with similar coverage to 
yesterday. Best chances will be in the higher elevations with 
chances in the valley around 10-20%. Any ongoing convection should 
come to an end around sunset with the lose of daytime heating. 
Overnight lows will range from the mid 60s to low 70s.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...

After several days of dry and hot weather, models are in 
agreement with a gradual pattern change that will feature a little
more active weather. An upper trough will press its way into the 
Eastern states through the week, squeezing the protective ridge 
out of the way. As the upper trough moves toward the Southern 
Appalachian region, the gradual increase in moisture and 
instability on slightly deeper southwesterly flow will be more 
conducive to the development of showers and thunderstorms. 
Convection will still be more regionally limited to the higher 
terrain features on Tuesday. However, a much more active period 
for showers and thunderstorms will be seen Wednesday through 
Friday as the moist and unstable air present over the region will 
be lifted ahead of a an associated slow moving cool frontal 
boundary. Perhaps the highest chance for storms will be Thursday 
through Friday when the front will be making southward progress 
through the forecast area. Probability of precipitation should 
decrease from north to south over the weekend, as synoptic lift 
follows the boundary into the Deep South. The good news is there 
will be some relief from the mini heat wave we have experienced 
during the last several days, as longer periods of cloud cover and
convective precipitation should cap off the above normal warmth. 
By next weekend, a weak northerly flow should help to maintain 
temperatures a little closer to normal for late August.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)......Current diurnally driven 
afternoon convection should dissipate quickly as sunset approaches. 
The mid/upper level short wave energy west of the Mississippi river 
will be running into a drier and more stable airmass as it 
approaches, and it should bring little more than an increase in high 
clouds to our area. Model soundings still look to be on the dry side 
for the short term period, and expect diurnal convection to be 
mostly limited to the higher terrain. Will carry slight chance to 
low chance PoPs in these areas for Monday afternoon.  Will go 
slightly lower for max temps Monday given likelihood of more clouds, 
but it still be hot with temperatures running above seasonal 
normals.  

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...Hot and humid 
weather will persist into mid week as a strong 595 dam mid level 
ridge centered in the southern Plains extends over the TN valley. 
Still expecting highs in the low/mid 90's through Wednesday across
most of the region with upper 90's in the southern valley. This 
will yield heat indices around 100 in parts of the central and 
southern valley. In terms of convective chances through mid week, 
only expect widely scattered activity in the higher terrain of the
plateau and east mountains. PWATs will range between 1.50 and 
1.90 inches across the region with afternoon MLCAPES of 1000-1500 
J/Kg, but soundings hint at mid level capping associated with the 
strong ridge. A mid level short wave in the northern stream will 
pass through the OH valley Monday night into Tuesday, but the weak
associated cool front will not be able to erode the ridge and 
will stay well to our north. For these reasons, only have slight 
chance to chance pops for mainly diurnal convection Tuesday and 
Wednesday with the highest chances on the plateau and eastern 
mountains. Any activity will quickly diminish after sunset.

The big ridge will shift westward into the desert Southwest 
Wednesday night into Thursday allowing a much more impressive mid to 
upper trough to dig down into the eastern U.S. The GFS is more 
aggressive in pushing a cold front all the way through our region by 
Thursday while the ECMWF continues to show a slightly less deep 
trough and frontal boundary stalling just north of our region for 
Thursday and Friday. Either way, with the base of the trough and 
cold front laying near or over the region, have at least chance pops 
for showers/storms in all areas Wednesday night through Friday with 
likely pops all areas Thursday and likely pops southern areas 
Friday. Highs will trend a few degrees cooler each day for the 
second half of the week due to the increased clouds and some cold 
air advection trying to take place, so stayed a little below NBM 
numbers. 

Guidance continues to differ on the placement of the old frontal 
boundary next weekend resulting in a fairly low confidence forecast, 
but a generally zonal upper flow pattern with a weak flow regime, 
tough-to-time disturbances rippling through, and the old front close 
by warrant keeping chance pops with temps near seasonable late 
August values.

the Great Valley through the forecast period, as pressure remains 
high. While there may be some cumulus build ups on the higher 
terrain along the North Carolina border and possibly some of the

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Pressure remains relatively high 
with limited moisture advection across the forecast area today. It 
appears there will be just enough orographic lift and cape over the 
terrain along the Tennessee and North Carolina border, Southwest 
Virginia, and Southwest North Carolina for the development of widely 
scattered thunderstorms this afternoon. Otherwise, most of the area 
should remain very warm and dry as has been the case during the past 
several days. High temperatures will again be about five to six 
degrees above normal, ranging from the upper 80s and lower 90s north 
to the middle 90s south. Another quiet night is in store tonight 
with mostly clear skies and near normal lows. 

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...The trend to start the work week continues to be drier with the 
higher chances for showers/storms holding off until mid to the end 
of the week. The upper level ridge to the west across the southern 
Plains will expand to the east with anticyclonic flow aloft leading 
to subsidence. Cannot rule out a few isolated to scattered afternoon 
showers/storms across the higher elevations on Monday but expect 
most areas will remain dry. With the decreased PoPs, increased high 
temperatures some from the previous forecast for Monday with highs 
in the low to mid 90s for most locations. Heat indices will be near 
100 degrees for portions of the southern valley. 

A shortwave mid-level trough will pass to the north of the area 
across the Great Lakes and Ohio River Valley on Tuesday. The area 
remains relatively dry with PW values in the 1.3-1.5 inches. These 
values are around the mean for mid-August. Upper level heights 
remain high and with the best forcing to the north, lowered PoPs on 
Tuesday but still have generally around 30% for the valley and 50% 
for the higher elevations along the TN/NC line. High temperatures 
will once again be in the low to mid 90s with heat indices of up 
to 100 degrees possible in the central and southern valley. 

Start to see the ridge begin to flatten some by the middle of the 
week as an impressive upper level trough moves into the Great Lakes 
region. At the surface, a cold front will slide across the Midwest 
into the Ohio River Valley Wednesday into Thursday. Moisture across 
the region will increase ahead of the upper level system and cold 
front. Best chances for widespread showers/storms appears to be on 
Thursday with the boundary still to the north. Increased PoPs based 
on the consistency of the latest models and lowered highs a bit with 
the forecast rainfall and cloud cover on Thursday. 

The GFS pushes the front just to the south of the forecast area late 
in the week with ECMWF keeping the boundary to the north until the 
weekend. Regardless of these solutions, the front should be located 
somewhere near the forecast area late in the extended portion of the 
forecast and have continued with elevated PoPs.

Overall the forecast is tracking along fairly well. Expect clear 
or mostly clear conditions overnight as high pressure is in place.
Convective debris from storms to our east and well to our 
northeast, do not appear like they will drift overhead so would 
expect skies to fall more on the clear side. Otherwise, no
significant changes to speak of really. Expect to see a few more
clouds tomorrow than perhaps were seen today, with even an outside
chance of a shower or two mainly in the Tennessee mountains.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...
High pressure will keep control over the area through Sunday,
keeping the storm path divided with a northern branch over the
Ohio Valley and a southern branch along the Carolina coast. There
could be a small increase in convective coverage over our higher 
terrain Sunday in comparison to today. Mountain convection could 
cross our state line as moisture increases on the NC side, and 
isolated convection could fire up into the higher terrain of SW 
VA. A couple of models suggest a little bit of activity over the 
Cumberland Plateau of TN as well Sunday, so I added low slgt-chc 
pops there for Sun afternoon. Meanwhile, the heat will increase a 
degree or two as temps will be in the low to mid 90s in the 
Valley, with heat indices from the mid to upper 90s. So while it 
will be a good weather day, be prepared to keep hydrated if 
outdoors.

.LONG TERM (Sunday Night through Saturday)... 
At the beginning of this period, Sunday evening, we will be in 
between a few weather features, with an upper ridge along the Gulf
Coast and a predominant zonal flow to our north, leaving us on 
the north edge of the ridge. At the surface there will a frontal 
system well to our west and northwest, stretching from Michigan to
Colorado, a strong surface ridge out in the Atlantic, although we
will have a weak surface ridge near us, that is slowing the 
return flow from the Gulf. This pattern slowly changes during the 
week with us getting into an upper NW Flow by Thursday, with an 
increasing southwesterly return flow, and the cold front sagging 
closer to the area. For Friday and Saturday, there is less 
agreement in the models, varying from an unsettled pattern with 
the moist axis hanging in the area to a weak ridge building with 
less lift and moisture. What is agreed upon is that we will 
generally be staying in a warmer airmass with the cooler Canadian 
air staying to the north through this period. As a matter of fact,
Heat Index values will likely be over 90 degrees at most valley 
locations through the duration of this extended forecast, with 
95-100 degrees in the southern valley through Wednesday, the 
lowering a few degrees as the moist axis and clouds and rains get 
closer by Thursday.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A protective ridge and relatively 
dry air mass should continue to keep dry conditions in place across 
most of the forecast area. Meager cape and some orographic lift may 
be just enough to allow an isolated shower or thunderstorm to 
develop over the higher terrain along the Tennessee and North 
Carolina border this afternoon. Mid August insolation and dewpoint 
temperatures in the 60s will result in another very warm afternoon 
with highs topping out in the upper 80s and lower 90s north to the 
lower and middle 90s south. 

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...Most of the area will remain
dry on Sunday with an upper ridge to the west across the southern
Plains and another to the east over the Atlantic. Closer to home,
relatively lower heights will occur between these two highs with 
500mb heights still around 590 dm. Not seeing much forcing on 
Sunday and PW values will be near the mean value for mid-August. 
The mountains will provide some orographic lift and expect best 
chances for any showers/storms will be over the higher elevations 
along the TN/NC line with most areas remaining dry. Not seeing a 
much change synoptically moving into Monday and cut back on PoPs 
some with best chances still in the higher elevations along the 
TN/NC line. Highs both days will be in the upper 80s to mid 90s 
for most locations with heat indices of near to slightly above 100
degrees for portions of the southern valley. 

Better chances for showers/storms areawide will be during the middle 
of the work week as the ridge to the west expands eastward and 
northwesterly flow develops aloft. Moisture will increase as several 
weak shortwaves move through the southern Appalachians. The GFS and 
ECMWF both indicate an impressive trough moving into the Great Lakes 
region Wednesday into Thursday. A cold front associated with this 
trough will sweep across the Midwest into the Ohio River Valley. The 
latest models are more impressive with the upper trough and southern 
progression of the trough. As of now, it looks like this front may 
push through the forecast area before losing upper level support and 
stalling out Friday. Due to this, lowered PoPs on Friday to account 
for the southern progression of the front. There is still a good 
amount of uncertainty with this still being towards the end of the 
long-term forecast period.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...It will be a rather quiet 
period for the short term, with a relatively dry and stable airmass 
over the region and weak surface high pressure lingering. It will be 
mostly clear tonight, with plenty of sunshine on Saturday. 
Temperatures will be near normal overnight and and a bit above for 
Saturday.  Despite the hot afternoon Saturday, afternoon dew points 
will generally dip into the lower to mid 60s in the valley keeping 
heat index values from straying much from the actual temperature. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...Dry conditions are
expected to persist through Saturday night due to lack of forcing
and limited low level moisture. By Sunday in advance of a 
shortwave trough translating through the mid-Mississippi River 
Valley moisture will begin its return to the region. Widely 
scattered showers and thunderstorms mainly along the higher 
terrain will be possible on Sunday afternoon and evening. 

With very subtle changes anticipated Monday - showers and 
thunderstorms will become more widespread. A building ridge over the 
southern Plains will provide northwest steering flow into our 
forecast area. Therefore, remnants of MCSs that develop on the 
northeastern fringes of the high will gradually make their way into 
the region. Chances of showers and thunderstorms will continue 
through at least Friday. Look for a pattern change into the
weekend.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...This period of the forecast should 
be another quiet one in terms of active weather. Drier and more 
stable air continues to build into the Southern Appalachian region. 
A study of forecast soundings supports this quiet scenario with 
precipitable water less than an inch, some capping and negligible 
cape in the beautiful northerly flow regime. Insolation in this 
environment will be in abundant supply but max temperatures should 
still be a degree or two below Thursday's highs due to that 
northerly component. Additionally, dewpoints should drop to the 
lower 60s again this afternoon, keeping the upper 80 to lower 90 
degree heat slightly more tolerable than earlier in the week. 
Another mostly clear night tonight and lower dewpoints should allow 
temperatures to drop to the lower and middle 60s over much of the 
region, with a few spots in the upper 60s to near 70 degrees.


.LONG TERM (Saturday through Friday)...The period of dry weather 
will extend into the beginning of the long- term period with 
rather zonal flow aloft. PW values on Saturday will be around 
1.2-1.3 inches, which are slightly below the median for mid- 
August. Sunday will be a transition day as moisture begins to 
increase across the southern Appalachians. In the low levels, the 
Bermuda high will expand to the west with light southerly flow in 
the low levels. Best chances for afternoon showers and storms will
be over the higher elevations of east Tennessee. Highs 
temperatures on both Saturday and Sunday will be in the upper 80s 
to mid 90s for most locations. 

By Monday, a ridge to the east and west will amplify with slightly 
lower heights over the Southeastern U.S. A ridge to the west will 
amplify over Texas and to the east over the Atlantic. Moisture will 
be elevated by this time with dewpoints returning into the upper 60s 
to low 70s for most of the area. With a typical summer pattern, 
diurnally driven showers/storms are expected each afternoon next 
week. Temperatures will be near climatological normals for mid-
August with highs in the mid 80s to low 90s for most locations. Heat 
indices will be near 100 degrees for the central and southern valley 
Monday-Wednesday. 

The GFS and ECMWF both indicate a front that will slide southward 
out of the Midwest into the Ohio River Valley late in the week. 
Latest runs seem to slow and stall this boundary just to the north 
or stall it out across northern portions of the forecast area. Given 
the time of the year, it makes sense that the boundary would stay to 
the north of the area keeping PoPs elevated into the extended 
portion of the long-term forecast period.

to the low to mid level flow. Because there is more efficient

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...

Dry west-to-northwest flow aloft will make for a pleasant night 
across the area with dewpoints in the low to mid 60s. Overnight 
lows will dip down into the lower to mid 60s as well. These temps 
are a few degrees below normal for this time of year. Even with 
the lower dewpoints, the combination of clear skies and cooler 
temps will allow for some patchy fog to develop overnight. Areas 
that saw rain yesterday are the most likely to see fog tonight, 
along with some of the area waterways.

As high pressure to our west pushes further east tomorrow the 
flow becomes more zonal. A weak wave of energy will move across 
the Ohio River Valley tomorrow afternoon but shouldn't affect our
weather. Expect mostly sunny skies with highs ranging from the 
mid 80s to near 90. Dewpoints will again be in the low to mid 60s.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...

The extended begins with a continuation of the dry weather already 
in place. A broad and flat H5 ridge will keep the storm path to our 
north over the Ohio Valley this weekend, although a resumption of SE 
low level flow over the Carolinas will push moisture to the spine of 
the Appalachians on Sunday and trigger afternoon convection there. 
However, the H5 ridge will strengthen in two centers, over the 
desert SW and over the Atlantic, leaving our region in a weak low 
pressure trough that will draw up tropical Gulf moisture and promote 
mostly diurnal scattered showers and tstms for much of the work 
week. A vigorous shortwave will sweep across the Great Lakes 
Wednesday and help shove our weak trough to the east, dropping down 
an associated cold front...but the models disagree on the timing. 
GFS is earliest with fropa late Wednesday, while Canadian and ECMWF 
have a Thursday timing. Thus we may see drier weather late in the 
period.

GFS and ECMWF are suggesting a Bay of Campeche tropical system will 
work its way into south TX around day 9...we will see.

248 AM EDT Thu Aug 15 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Morning fog will be a concern in parts of the area this morning.
As of 230 AM, it seems fairly isolated but it should expand in the
next few hours. Will monitor conditions to see if a Dense Fog
Advisory or SPS is needed, mainly in the eastern half where rain
showers were more numerous yesterday.

Today, a weak surface low will be tracking east across the upper
OH Valley to the central Appalachians. Forecast soundings show a 
capping inversion at CHA and TYS that should suppress any 
development in the central and southern portions. At TRI, this cap
is weaker, and the hi-res models hint at some afternoon 
development in NE TN/SW VA. So a slight chance PoP will be 
included for that area. Through the day as the low moves east,
high pressure over the MO Valley region will be building in, and
the dry NW flow aloft will continue. This should give high temps
similar to yesterday, mainly upper 80s to around 90, but with
comfortable humidity levels as dewpoints will be in the low to 
mid 60s this afternoon.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)... 
The Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians will still reside 
at the base of a broad mid to upper level trough to the north 
Friday with a surface high overhead. This subsidence and WNW flow 
aloft will allow for a beautiful end to the week with highs near 
or just below seasonal averages and tolerable humidity levels. 
Higher heat and moisture will begin to return Saturday as the 
surface high slides a bit farther east and heights rise aloft. 
Soundings will still be quite dry, so will stick with a dry 
forecast all areas and temps rising back into the low 90's in most
of the region. Sunday will bring the first chance for isolated 
diurnal convection as a weak mid level shortwave approaches from 
the west helping to strengthen the WAA. Have slight chance pops 
Sunday afternoon and evening in the higher terrain of the Plateau 
and eastern mountains where differential heating will trigger a 
few storms. Expect quick dissipation after sunset. Hot and humid 
conditions will continue with highs in the low 90's in most areas 
and a few mid 90's in the southern valley. Low temps this weekend 
will become increasingly uncomfortable struggling to fall below 
the 70's.

Uncertainty increases Monday through Wednesday. The Tennessee Valley 
and deep South will get stuck in a weakness between strengthening 
mid level ridges over the desert southwest and near Bermuda. This 
will yield weak flow aloft with an elongated mid level trough 
overhead. These patterns are favorable for tropical moisture to 
stream northward with widespread diurnal convection and locally 
heavy downpours, and all model guidance suggests this trend, 
however, the latest ECMWF shows a distinct tropical low drifting 
north through the Carolinas and southern Appalachians early next 
week, while the GFS and Canadian have no such low. At this time, 
will keep consistent with high end chance pops during the daytime 
hours Monday through Wednesday and slight chance to chance at night. 
This tropical airmass will be very humid, but clouds and precip will 
keep highs mainly in the 80's, so will undercut NBM guidance by a 
few degrees.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...

Showers and a few storms are ongoing along a weak front that is 
slowly drifting across the area. The front is stretched from 
southwest to northeast generally along and east of the I-75/I-81 
corridor. Showers and any storms dissipate with loss of daytime 
heating and as the front pushes further east out of our area. For 
the rest of this afternoon, a few storms could approach SPS 
criteria as there is still some weak instability and shear across 
the area. With only 500 to 1000 J/kg of MLCAPE though, don't 
expect any strong updrafts which is why there is little lightning 
activity with the current storms. Nonetheless, will keep an eye on
things just in case anything briefly pulses up. Overnight lows 
will be in the mid to upper 60s for most. 

Overnight, drier air slowly tries to work in from the northwest but 
low-level moisture will have a hard time eroding as it gets pooled 
up against the eastern terrain. This will promote cloud cover 
hanging around tonight. Fog is probable for some areas but not too 
confident in coverage. The uncertainty in amount of cloud cover, 
winds, and drier air make for a difficult fog forecast. Conditions 
further improve tomorrow as the drier air makes a bigger push into 
the area. Expect sunshine and highs in the mid to upper 80s with 
dewpoints in the low to mid 60s.

 


.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...

he long term will being with broad upper troughing over the eastern 
United States, mainly over/north of Tennessee, but will attempt to 
transition to a more zonal flow across the northern tier states by 
late in the weekend as upper ridging strengthens over the desert 
southwest, and also to our east towards Bermuda. Dry conditions are 
forecast across the forecast area for Thursday night through 
Saturday with weak WNW flow in place overhead and drier air 
filtering into the region. Some clouds may be build up over the 
mountains but that would be about the extent of it.

Moisture levels will be on the increase by Sunday as surface high 
pressure moves to our east and at least some degree of warm 
southerly flow returns to the region, even if just above the 
surface. Expect to see some afternoon showers and thunderstorms make 
an appearance once again on Sunday as a result. The best chances 
will be in the mountains mainly, but will carry some chance PoPs 
into the lower elevations as well.

For Sunday onward, the forecast is a bit uncertain. Did not make any 
significant or wholesale changes to the forecast, and kept with the 
trend of higher rain chances for Monday onward. Models show upper 
ridging over the southwest CONUS, and also a typical summertime 
Bermuda high. This leaves the southern Appalachian region in a 
weakness between the two ridges, with subtle/weak height falls noted 
in the H5 fields and increased chances for convection Sunday night 
through Tuesday. The uncertainty lies in how widespread rainfall 
will be and whether there will be any kind of system move north from 
the eastern GOMEX during the first half of next week. Models hint at 
some development, though not necessarily tropical, off the Florida 
panhandle late Sunday into Monday before pulling it back north 
across the region. This seems plausible given the pattern, so 
continued with PoPs close to what the previous shift had.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast mostly on track this morning with just a
few minor adjustments. Weak frontal boundary can be seen on VIS
sat imagery with a row of agitated CU stretching from southwest 
(southern plateau) to northeast (northern plateau/southwest KY). 
This coincides with the area that a few showers are popping up on 
radar. Front still looks like it slowly pushes through the area 
throughout the day as a mid-level shortwave helps to nudge it 
along. Along this front will be the focus for showers and a few 
storms, moreso this afternoon as we gain some heating. 

Adjustments to the forecast were mainly to tweak POPs to match up
with frontal passage timing. SKY grids were also tweaked downward
through early afternoon as there are a few pockets of clearing out
there now. Will send out new zones for the aforementioned 
changes.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Most showers have pushed well to the east and south of our area in
association with a shortwave trough, but a diffuse front remains
to our north across KY. The mid and upper levels have dried
considerably behind the initial trough, but abundant low level
moisture remains for low clouds and fog to form this morning.
Another shortwave trough will be approaching today, and will help
push the surface front through the area. This will keep a chance
of showers and thunderstorms going today, mainly in northern
sections. Overcast cloud cover this morning will become broken
this afternoon, which should hold temperatures back in the 80s for
most spots today. The passage of the 850-700 mb shortwave trough
and the weak surface front should bring an end to any precip 
chances by midnight.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)... 
Not much change in the long-term as the Tennessee Valley and 
southern Appalachians region will reside at the base of broad 
troughing Thursday and Friday. This will result in a WNW flow 
pattern bringing relief from the recent heat and humidity. High 
temps will actually be slightly below the mid August averages with
most areas seeing 84-87 Thursday and 85-90 Friday along with 
refreshing lows in the low/mid 60's. The southern valley will run 
a couple of degrees warmer for both highs and lows. Dew points 
will fall into the low/mid 60's during this period, so it will 
feel a little bit more comfortable outside. Cannot rule out an 
isolated shower or thunderstorm in the higher terrain of the east 
TN mountains and southwest VA Thursday afternoon/evening, but this
will only be a slight chance pop since soundings project rapid 
drying aloft. Friday will stay dry in all areas as surface high 
pressure in the central Appalachians takes firm control. 

Temps and dew points will slowly trend back upward this weekend as 
the surface high slowly moves farther east and mid to upper level 
ridging tries to redevelop across the Southeast U.S. Soundings still 
look pretty dry Saturday, and there are no real forcing mechanisms, 
but increasing heat and humidity combined with differential heating 
boundaries over the higher terrain warrant slight chance pops for 
afternoon/evening thunderstorms over far east TN and southwest VA. 
Any activity will quickly dissipate after sunset. Afternoon 
convection will become a little more widespread Sunday as warm and 
moist southwest flow deepens ahead of a shortwave trough moving into 
the West TN valley and Delta, so have slight chance to chance pops 
across most of the area.

The above mentioned shortwave will move into our region Sunday night 
then separate from the northern stream. This will result in a very 
slow moving, broad mid level low over much of the South and 
Southeast U.S. Monday and Tuesday. Cloud cover and precip should 
cool highs to slightly below normal values during this period, but 
continued southwest flow will keep the airmass very muggy. The 
greatest coverage of showers/thunderstorms will occur during peak 
heating, but with a moist profile in place (PWATs of 1.60-2.00 
inches, warm cloud depth, and WBZ heights close to 14,000 ft), 
scattered showers could also occur at night. Have high chance pops 
during the day Monday and Tuesday and lower end chance during the 
overnight periods.

Fog and low cigs are already starting to develop at TRI. IFR
conditions are expected there through most of the night, with LIFR
possible at times. CHA and TYS are more likely to remain VFR as
high and midlevel clouds are thicker at those sites and they
should maintain some light wind. TRI should return to VFR in the
late morning as the cig lifts. Scattered afternoon showers may in
in the vicinity of TRI today.

.DISCUSSION...

The severe weather event is pretty much coming to an end. The 
line of strong/severe storms is now to the south and east into 
Georgia and North Carolina. At the surface, the low is centered 
over West Virginia with a cold front stretching back to the west 
across Kentucky into west-middle Tennessee. In the upper levels, 
the ridge has flattened across the region as a series of shortwave
troughs rotate along the frontal boundary. With the front still 
to the north, there could still be a few lingering showers into 
the overnight hours but any chance for severe weather has come to 
an end. The watch has been cancelled for the area.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday night)...
Latest surface analysis and HREF ensemble show an outflow boundary
across the Plateau and southeast Tennessee. Air mass along and
south of the boundary is quite unstable with MLCAPEs of 2500-3500
J/Kg. Pressure falls across Kentucky will help maintain
southwesterly flow into this boundary through this evening. 

A complex of storms have developed over middle Tennessee latest
CAMS show these thunderstorms moving across the Plateu and east
Tennessee. Like this morning, the following are the concerns:

1) Wind Damage...Soundings show a vertical profile with dry air 
aloft producing DCAPE of 1200-1400 J/Kg with Delta theta-e 
difference of over 35. Wind Damage index of over 1. Overall,
damaging winds will be the main concern.

2) Hail...Even though MLCAPEs are sizeable and Hail CAPES will be
500-700 J/Kg, WBZ heights are fairly high, generally at or above
12kft. There is a potential of marginal severe hail with the
strongest storms.

3) Tornadoes...The 0-6km shear is marginal at best with values of
25-30kts and 0-1km between 5-15kts. Supercell Composite 
Parameters of 2-4 so some isolated supercell characteristics 
possible. Significant Tornado Parameter will be less than 0.5. 
Overall, the threat is very low.

4) Flash Flood...PWs along and south of the boundary is between
1.9 and 2.1 inches. Any training along the boundary could produce
localized flash flooding.

5) Confidence...High for potential of severe storms and moderate 
to high on timing.

For Tonight, convection will diminish by late evening but 
scattered showers will remain possible. Patchy fog possible.

For Thursday and Thursday night, an inverted trough will be across
the far eastern sections of the area with scattered showers and
afternoon storm possible. Drier air will advect into the region
limiting instability. Convection dissipates soon after sunset.
Patchy fog again possible.

.Long Term (Friday through Tuesday night)...By 12Z Friday the region 
will be under cyclonic flow aloft while at the surface high pressure 
remains anchored. The surface high pressure will bring mainly dry 
weather through much of the weekend. Aloft, several perturbations 
will travel through the region likely leading to an increase in 
cloud cover. Overall moisture in the column should remain limited to 
keep PoPs fairly low with slight chance PoPs in the higher terrain. 
A more significant wave will approach the area Sunday night and 
stall out Monday and Monday night turning low to mid level flow 
towards the south and west advective moisture and instability. At 
the surface, a weak boundary will sink into the Ohio valley but 
should remain far enough north to remain a insignificant source of 
focus for convection. This means that with weak focus for 
convection, better PoPs will likely reside across the higher terrain 
where differential heating could aid in development of convection. 
The upper level low over the Tennessee valley will begin to open up 
into more of a shear axis. As a result, will keep chance PoPs going 
through the rest of the extended period. Temperatures through the 
extended should remain near average with possibly a degree or two 
below average for early next week.

.DISCUSSION...
Wanted to give everyone an update on the timing of the storms
today. Latest surface analysis shows an outflow boundary moving
into the northern Plateau. This boundary will catch up with the
developing lie of storms over the Plateau into far western
Virginia. This line of storms will be the main strong to severe
storms for southwest Virgina and east Tennessee along and north of
interstate 40 (timing between now and 2-3 pm).

Areas south of interstate 40, we expect another storm complex to
develop over middle Tennessee then move southeast into the area
from 2 pm ET to 6-7 pm ET.

The main threat remains the same being damaging winds, marginal
hail up to quarter size, frequent lightning and heavy rains that
may cause isolated flash flooding.

.DISCUSSION...
Plenty of sunshine this morning is allowing temperatures to climb
quickly into the middle 80s by mid-morning. Combined with
dewpoints in the lower and middle 70s heat indices are already in
the lower and middle 90s across much of the valley. Will keep heat
advisory area in place with no changes planned.

Satellite shows a short-wave moving across the western Ohio
valley. This wave will move east southeast toward the region this
afternoon and evening along with a trailing boundary. Air mass
ahead of this system is becoming quite unstable with MLCAPEs of
2500 J/Kg over the Plateau and near 3000 J/Kg across middle
Tennessee. This instability will spread over the rest of the area
this afternoon. 

The main concerns from these storms will be the following:

1) Wind Damage...Soundings show a vertical profile with dry air 
aloft producing DCAPE of 1200-1400 J/Kg with Delta theta-e 
difference of over 35. Wind Damage index of over 1. Overall,
damaging winds will be the main concern.

2) Hail...Even though MLCAPEs are sizeable and Hail CAPES will be
500-700 J/Kg, WBZ heights are fairly high, generally at or above
12kft. There is a potential of marginal severe hail with the
strongest storms.

3) Tornadoes...The 0-6km shear is marginal at best with values of
30kts and 0-1km between 10-15kts. Supercell Composite Parameters
of 2-4 so some isolated supercell characteristics possible with
afternoon storms. Significant Tornado Parameter will be less than
0.5. Overall, the threat is very low, but can not be totally ruled
out.

4) Timing...Scattered showers and storms this morning/early
afternoon, generally along and north of interstate 40. HREF
ensembles show main line moving through beginning mid/late
afternoon through mid-evening.

5) Confidence...High for potential of severe storms and moderate
to high on timing.

Otherwise, made some minor changes to forecast temperatures
(raised) and PoPs. We will be monitoring the development closely
this afternoon and evening.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Ongoing convection across the OH Valley into central KY is showing a 
weakening trend as it approaches, which is in line with the 
depictions from the hi-res models. A slight chance PoP will be kept 
in the grids in northern sections in case this activity is able to 
persist as it crosses KY. 

The current Heat Advisory for the central and southern TN Valley 
continues to appear on track, with high temps in the mid to upper 
90s and dewpoints in the lower 70s will give heat index values in 
the 100-105 range. One slight adjustment will be to add Sevier, 
Jefferson, and Cocke counties into the Advisory. 

Convection is expected to ignite this afternoon along a E-W boundary 
across KY, and track SE across our area during the late afternoon 
and evening hours. Given the high CAPE environment that these storms 
will be encountering (MLCAPE > 3000 J/kg), there will be a risk of 
severe storms with damaging winds being the primary threat. There 
remains some timing uncertainties as the hi-res models are not in 
complete agreeement, but based on the HREF mean, the most likely 
window for strong to severe storms is 21-03Z. Will use this timing 
as a basis for the PoP/Wx grids, which is a little faster than what 
the NAM is showing. Cold pool propagation usually results in faster 
timing being correct. QPF amounts are expected to average around a 
half inch across the area. 

.Long Term (Wednesday through Monday)...
An upper level trough will have made enough progress into the 
Eastern U.S. by 12z Wednesday to push a cool frontal boundary into
the eastern and southern reaches of the forecast area. 
Additionally, models hint at a trailing weak upper wave riding 
east through the Upper Ohio Valley which may spark a shower or 
thunderstorm across parts of Southwest Virginia and Northeast 
Tennessee. Therefore, keep some slight and smaller chance pops for
some convection going in these areas on Wednesday with decreasing
pops from west to east later in the day with almost no pop across
the forecast area by Wednesday evening. 

A most pleasant, and drier mean west to northwest flow brings 
relief to the mini heat wave experienced over the last few days as
well as a noticeable lack of convection for the last half of the 
week. Surface high pressure and the dry air should keep 
thunderstorm development to a minimum until about Sunday and 
Monday when a return southerly flow behind the departed low level 
ridge brings a little bit more moist and unstable air back to the 
Southern Appalachian Region. Despite the slightly more improved 
air mass for convection, there doesn't appear to be any major 
focus present other than aid from orographic lifting. Therefore, 
tried to place the slightly higher chance pops on the major 
terrain features for this late portion of the forecast. The good 
news in this extended forecast is the relief from the brief heat 
wave which should end up with about two to three days of 
temperatures back to a few degrees below the typical 85 to 90 
degree warmth. Temperatures will gradually return to about two to 
three degrees ahead of mid August norms over the weekend.

.DISCUSSION...

The ongoing forecast is in pretty good shape. For the update, made
some minor tweaks to the hourly temperature and dewpoint grids to
account for the current trends. Seeing a few passing mid-high
clouds across the area with northwesterly flow aloft and a weak
trough moving through the region. With mostly clear skies light
winds and dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s, added a bit of
patchy fog, mainly around the area lakes and rivers. Otherwise,
the impactful weather will happen during the day tomorrow with
moisture surging ahead of a surface front. The ridge will flatten
but temperatures will warm quickly and the combination of
temperature and dewpoints will lead to heat indices over 105 for
the central and southern valley and a heat advisory has been
issued for tomorrow. As a trough races across the area and the
front moves southeastward, severe storms will be possible tomorrow
afternoon/evening with damaging winds being the main threat.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday night)...
Heat and strong/severe storms are the main topics for the short 
term period. In the upper levels, a ridge of high pressure was 
located across much of the southern plains and southeast United 
States. Further north a wave was located across the midwest and 
is moving towards the east. At the surface, high pressure 
continues to move east while low pressure develops across the 
plains. Water vapor imagery this afternoon shows a large plume of 
moisture associated with a weakening MCS traveling through the 
Ohio valley. Some of this moisture and cloud cover has been able 
to move into portions of the forecast area and has kept
temperatures a degree or two below forecast. Most of the area 
should remain dry today and tonight with the exception of the 
mountains where differential heating would allow isolated to 
scattered thunderstorms to develop. Otherwise it should be a hot 
and humid afternoon with highs in the low to mid 90s. Not 
anticipating needed any heat advisories today. Tonight into 
Tuesday morning, a shortwave trough will move into the Ohio valley
flattening the ridge out further south. The result on the lower 
troposphere will be to turn 850mb winds to the south. This will 
promote the advection of moisture tonight and on Tuesday with very
warm temperatures expected. 925mb temperatures are progged to 
warm to 28-30C by Tuesday afternoon and guidance suggests highs to
reach the low to mid 90s with the highest temperatures in the 
southern valley. As previously mentioned, moisture will increase 
and as a result, dewpoints will increase to the low to mid 70s. 
This will produce heat index values in the 105-110F range across 
portions of the southern valley, and central valley. Decided to 
issue a heat advisory from 16Z to 00Z Tuesday given the forecast 
heat index values. 

The other topic is the chances for strong to severe thunderstorms.
Convection is expected to increase along and ahead of a cold front
dropping out of the Ohio valley. The environment ahead of this
front will be characterized by surface based CAPEs near 2000-3000
j/kg and lifted index values near -5 to -8 C. However, lapse 
rates should be fairly weak only near 5.5 to 6.0 c/km. Given the 
relatively modest flow aloft, would expect a multicellular 
convective mode with the chance of strong/gusty winds being the
main threat. Not anticipating much in the way of hail as freezing
level heights will be fairly high. Boundary level flow oriented 
parallel to the boundary does promote the chance of isolated flash
flooding although the quick nature of the boundary should keep 
the chances limited. Both the heat advisory, and the strong/severe
storm potential will be highlighted in the HWO. Otherwise, 
frontal forcing and DCVA should be sufficient for chance PoPs 
continuing through the night with likely PoPs across the higher 
terrain. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)... At the beginning of 
this period--Wednesday morning--the cold front and upper short 
wave will be exiting the area during the morning NW-SE, with 
precip chances ending in the valley and lingering in the eastern 
mountains. Previous Blend runs have lingered POPs all day for most
of the forecast area, but with surface focus and upper lift 
leaving and moisture lowering, it's looking more and more like 
Wednesday will be drying NW-SE more quickly, and the thick, steamy
air will be exiting as well. 

High Pressure builds into the area through Friday, then a surface 
return flow starts Saturday that will start to bring low level 
moisture back into the area.  By Sunday models diverge between 
solutions of keeping us in the warm moist air versus pushing a weak 
cold front through the area with better chances of showers and 
storms. For now, will just go with marginal Blend POPs and will look 
for convergence of a solution as it gets closer for Sunday and 
Monday.

329 AM EDT Mon Aug 12 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The surface high pressure area that brought lower dewpoints to 
the area yesterday will be shifting east to the Atlantic coast 
today. This will give a prevailing southerly flow from the surface
through 850 mb, advecting low level moisture into the area. A NW 
flow will remain in the mid and upper levels, which will limit 
convective coverage today to just the mountains along the TN/NC 
border. The prevailing NW flow aloft should prevent any storms 
that develop from entering the Valley. With the rising dewpoints 
and high temps expected to be similar to yesterday, we will have 
heat index values near 100 in Chattanooga this afternoon, with mid
90s in Knoxville.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...
Tuesday is expected to be our most complex and impactful weather 
day during the next week with the potential for dangerous heat 
prior to evening thunderstorms which may produce severe weather.

At the beginning of the extended, a large ridge will continue to be 
centered over the Southern Great Plains and extend across much of 
the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys. A small shortwave 
trough across the Ohio Valley will be moving eastward with an 
associated weak surface low. A weak cold front will extend 
southwestward from this surface low across central KY, West TN, and 
through Red River Valley of Texas. As this front moves slowly 
southeast on Tuesday afternoon, convection is expected to initiate 
along this boundary in a highly unstable environment. We'll go into 
some more detail regarding thunderstorm impacts in a moment, but 
first, we'll take a closer look at the heat.

With the area still on the eastern edge of the upper ridge, 
temperatures will continue to be about 7 to 10 degrees above 
average. As moisture increases ahead of the approaching front on 
Tuesday afternoon, dew points will rise into the low, and possibly 
mid, 70s. Based on the current forecast, this would lead to 
widespread heat index values in excess of 105 degrees, Heat Advisory 
criteria, across the southern valley south of Knoxville and near 
Chattanooga. There are some factors that increase uncertainty for 
Tuesday. First, will cloud cover ahead of the front limit max 
temperatures or will subsidence be strong enough to maintain a 
mostly clear sky with the exception of afternoon sct cu? Second, 
what will be the exact timing of afternoon convection that could 
limit overall max temperatures? Third, how much moisture return will 
be realized in the boundary layer and what will be exact dew point 
values? Only a small difference of a degree or two could mean the 
difference in realizing advisory heat index values. Because of the 
inherent uncertainty 36 hours in advance of the potential heat 
impacts, will not issue an advisory this forecast package, but will 
continue to highlight the heat hazard in the HWO. If confidence 
increases, future shifts may need to explore coordinating an 
advisory for portions of the area.

Next, we'll take a look at the severe thunderstorm risk. As the 
shortwave trough and surface low track east across the Ohio Valley 
toward the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday afternoon, the surface cold front 
will move southeast toward the forecast area. MLCAPE across the 
forecast area will range from 1500 to 2500 J/Kg and effective bulk 
shear will range from 15 to 25 kt. DCAPE is forecast by the NAM to 
be between 900 and 1200 J/Kg. Forecast soundings indicate a weak 
isothermal layer near 800mb, especially across southern portions of 
the forecast area, that may limit convective coverage ahead of the 
front. Because of this, expect a line of thunderstorms to develop 
along the cold front or prefrontal trough in SE KY late Tuesday 
afternoon and move southeastward into the forecast area between 6PM 
and Midnight Tuesday night; however, still have low confidence on 
exact timing 36-48 hours from the potential convective event. With 
the thermodynamic and kinematic environment in place across the 
forecast area, a multicell line of thunderstorms is most likely with 
damaging winds the primary hazard. In addition, with PW values 
increasing to between 2.0 and 2.2 inches ahead of the front, heavy 
rain rates are likely with thunderstorms resulting in the potential 
for isolated flash flooding. For any additional details, please see 
the SPC Day 2 CWO and WPC Day 2 ERO.

As this front moves east, surface high pressure builds in mid to 
late week with slightly cooler temperatures and drier air with dew 
points in the 60s. However, by the weekend, the GFS and ECMWF show 
upper ridging building back across the Southeast CONUS and an 850-
700mb ridge centered over the Lower Mississippi Valley. This would 
result in max temperatures climbing above normal and generally dry 
conditions.

.DISCUSSION...Weak surface high pressure will continue to dominate 
area weather into Monday.  As a result...expect a quiet night with 
only a few high clouds...light winds and mild temperatures.  Lows 
should range from the mid 60s to low 70s across most valley 
locations.  There is a slight chance patchy fog will develop late 
tonight and the TRI area would be the most likely location for this. 
However...with current dewpoints around 60 at TRI and the lack of 
rain this afternoon...believe the potential for fog is minimal. On 
Monday...there is a slight chance of diurnal convection over higher 
elevations during the afternoon.  The main concern will be the heat. 
Temperatures across the valley should generally be in the 90s. Heat 
indices could reach to around 100 degrees from TYS southward. All 
handled well in the current forecast...no update anticipated.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Tomorrow)...
High pressure and warm temperature/heat index is the main story for 
the next 24 hours. With the frontal boundary across GA/AL more 
northerly flow is present across the area leading to drier 
conditions. Slim chance for some shower/thunderstorm activity across 
the far southern Appalachian Mountains this afternoon, but most 
people will remain dry. This dry air is helping to limit the heat 
index values as dew points are hovering in the upper 50's to mid 
60's this afternoon. 

Another chance for patchy fog tonight, but these lower dew points 
will help keep away any widespread fog. Warm conditions are expected 
to continue tomorrow with higher with temperatures remaining near 
what we see today, but with winds beginning to switch to a more 
southerly direction we should see heat index higher than today. heat 
index values will approach 100 degrees from Chattanooga up towards 
Knoxville.

.Long Term (Monday night through Sunday)...
At the start of this forecast period the upper ridge will be 
weakened by two shortwaves - one translating through the Great 
Lakes region and the other through the mid-Mississippi River 
Valley. Little in the way of forcing for rainfall Monday night. 

By Tuesday, pre-frontal warming will commence and drive heat index 
values from 100 to 105 degrees. Hottest feeling temperatures will 
occur over the southern TN Valley near Chattanooga/Cleveland. In the 
afternoon thunderstorms that develop in KY will drift into southwest 
VA/NE TN late afternoon. Cloud cover or earlier storm development 
could inhibit the heat index values from reaching their potential. 
Current SPC Day 3 outlook highlights SW VA/NE TN in the slight risk 
associated with the shortwave from the mid-MS River Valley. At this 
time, looks like the strongest storms will occur Tuesday night. 

Models seem to be having a difficult time handling the precipitation 
chances for Wednesday. Does the trough/surface front hang up near 
the mountains or does it sweep the low level moisture through. 
Needless to say confidence is low in regards to those chances of 
rain for Wednesday.  

With the upper trough lingering near the forecast area through the 
remainder of the week into the weekend, slight chances to chance 
showers or thunderstorms will persist mainly in the higher terrain 
of E TN, SW VA and SW NC.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Surface high pressure will continue to build into the area today
with northerly surface flow bringing drier air to the region. With
the weak frontal boundary across far southeastern portions of the
forecast area, expect an isolated rain shower will be possible 
across the mountain peaks of SE TN and portions of SW NC, but 
overall, most everyone should enjoy a mostly sunny and warm Sunday
with dry conditions. Upper ridging across the South-Central CONUS
will continue to slowly expand eastward with strong subsidence 
aloft. With the increased ridging, drier boundary layer air, and 
max temperatures already in the low to mid 90s, expect 
temperatures to be 0 to 3 degrees warmer on Sunday across the 
forecast area, about 5 to 8 degrees above normal. With dry air at 
the surface, this will limit max heat index values to the upper 
90s near 100 across the southern valley in the vicinity of 
Chattanooga.

Dry conditions forecast tonight with high pressure across the 
region. May have some patchy fog in river valleys, but dry 
conditions should mitigate widespread issues. With the dry air 
resulting in lower dew points, expect temperatures to be near 
normal.


.Long Term (Monday through Saturday)...
A large mid/upper ridge over the southern Plains will maintain a dry 
NW flow aloft across our area on Monday. Forecast soundings show a 
weak cap that should suppress convection for most of the area, with 
the possible exception being the mountains along the NC border. 
Tuesday looks much the same but with a slightly stronger 
southwesterly low level flow that will strengthen warm/moist 
advection. The result of this will be high temps in the mid 90s and 
dewpoints in the lower/mid 70s for the central and southern TN 
Valley, giving a heat index in the 100-105 range. With confidence 
rising regarding Tuesday's heat, it will be added to the HWO. 

On Tuesday a cold front and a shortwave midlevel trough will be 
moving SE across the OH Valley. Some scattered to isolated 
convective development will be possible Tuesday afternoon ahead of 
this system, but stronger forcing to overcome the capping inversion 
will likely not arrive until Tuesday night. Despite the overnight 
timing, there will still be adequate instability when the 
stronger forcing arrives to give a potential for some strong 
thunderstorms. PoPs will be decreasing through the day on 
Wednesday as the front crosses the area. 

The rest of the week will feature the resurgence of a high pressure 
ridge over the Plains, which will keep our area mostly dry for 
Thursday through Saturday. However, there is some general model 
agreement that a tropical low pressure system will develop near the 
Gulf Coast and drift NE across the Southeast states next weekend. 
Details on the position of this low are too uncertain at this time 
to carry high PoPs in the forecast, but it will bear watching.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...
Front is continuing to slowly sag southward across the region this
afternoon. In response shower and a little bit of thunderstorm
activity is expected to continue through the afternoon and into
the evening. Weak shear and moderate CAPE will allow storms to
moderately strengthen, but no upper level support will inhibit 
any long lasting storms. Can't rule out a stray storm pulsing up 
and bringing strong winds, but widespread severe weather looks 
very unlikely. Will need to keep an eye out for possible brief 
isolated flooding if a few storms move over the same area... But 
most locations will likely stay dry through the remainder of the 
day.

Another chance for patchy fog overnight similar to what we've seen
in previous nights, especially in areas that have received
rainfall this afternoon/evening. Warm and dry conditions are
expected during the daytime tomorrow.

.LONG TERM (Sunday Night through Saturday)...
The main story will be the heat...building on Monday and topping 
out on Tuesday before rainfall provides relief. 

The upper high will be situated near the Ark-La-Tex at the start of 
the period creating northwest flow over the area.  Overnight Sunday 
will remain dry...and warm. By Monday afternoon some afternoon 
showers and thunderstorms could develop mainly in the higher terrain 
of Tennessee and in southwest North Carolina. Other areas will 
remain dry and hot. 
  
By Tuesday, the upper high shifts farther east and slightly south. 
Muggy conditions with afternoon heat index values approaching 105 
degrees for many areas across East Tennessee and perhaps, as far 
north as southwest Virginia. There is a chance of late afternoon 
thunderstorms bringing some relief in the form of rain cooled air 
and cloud cover to mitigate the dangerous heat. Residual storms will 
likely proceed into Tuesday evening in association with a shortwave 
trough. 

The trough will remain across the eastern U.S. through Wednesday 
night. Until then a chance of showers will persist. Another high 
builds across the Southern Plains for much of the remainder of the 
week. This means there will be low chances of showers and 
thunderstorms developing mainly over the higher terrain during this 
time through the end of the forecast period.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Fog in river valleys this morning will dissipate after sunrise
with a mostly sunny to partly cloudy sky through the afternoon. Upper
troughing continues along the East Coast with a strong ridge 
across the South-Central CONUS. A weak cold front across southern 
KY will slowly drift south on Saturday afternoon and be a focus 
for chance PoPs along and south of this front. Instability will be
limited, less than 1000 J/Kg of MLCAPE, so expect only a very 
small chance of thunderstorms across SE TN and SW NC ahead of the 
front.

Convection decreases tonight with a clearing sky. With calm wind
and subsidence in the wake of the front, expect additional patchy
fog, especially in areas that receive rainfall Saturday 
afternoon.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...
With a large ridge over the TX/AR/LA region and a trough along the 
Atlantic coast, we will have a NW flow pattern over our area that 
will favor dry conditions for most of the area Sunday and Monday. 
There may be a little more moisture available for at least some 
isolated convection to develop in the higher terrain Monday 
afternoon, but the Valley will likely remain precip-free with high 
temperatures in the lower to mid 90s both days. Dewpoints both days 
are not especially high, so the heat index should remain under 100. 

The ridge begins to flatten on Tuesday as a broad upper trough and 
surface low move into the Great Lakes region. The low level 
southerly flow will increase and advect more moisture into the TN 
Valley, which will raise dewpoints into the lower 70s and push the 
heat index into the 100-105 range for the central and southern 
Valley. The convective potential rises as well with scattered 
showers and thunderstorms expected Tuesday afternoon, then PoPs rise 
to likely Tuesday night as a shortwave trough axis crosses the area. 
The associated cold front passes through on Wednesday, with drier 
and slightly cooler air (highs 85 to 90) building into the area on 
Thursday and continuing into Friday.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Tomorrow)...
Storms currently forming across Middle Tennesse, and should continue 
to move eastward through the afternoon and into the evening. Another 
set of storms is also active further to the north across WV/KY along 
a mostly stationary frontal boundary. Storms moving out of Middle 
Tennessee have the greater chances of impacting the forecast area 
this afternoon. Expect coverage of storms to remain relatively 
isolated. Mesoanalysis indicates about 1000-2000 J/Kg of CAPE with 
higher amounts in Southeast Tennessee. Very little shear for storms 
in this area to work with, so am not expecting long lasting storms. 
Can't rule out an isolated storm or two to pulse up causing gusty 
winds and brief heavy rainfall, but severe weather threat looks low 
for today. As the sun sets we should see storm activity decrease as 
well.

Expect another round of patchy fog early tomorrow morning as 
overnight temperatures and dew points should be relatively similar 
to what we saw early this morning.

Rain and thunderstorm chances remain tomorrow as the frontal 
boundary continues to slowly move southward. A weak trough will move 
over the area on Sunday, but more limited moisture and mid level dry 
air moving in means shower and thunderstorm chances will remain 
pretty sparse.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...
At the beginning of this period, we will be under an upper level 
northwest flow, with an upper High over TX/OK, and an upper Trough
over New England. At the surface stable high pressure will be 
building into the area behind a weak cold front.

Looks like the surface High will be over us for Sunday, then a 
surface return flow of moisture will begin on Monday as the High 
moves east and a cold front will be to our west (pretty far west on 
Monday).  As moisture increases Heat Index will be rising for Monday 
and Tuesday--looking like values of 100+ possible for some valley 
locations, especially on Tuesday.  For these two days, "Blend" dew 
points looked too high considering usual afternoon mixing, so 
lowered dew points both afternoons by a couple of degrees, and even 
shaved off dew points on Wednesday, even though heat won't be as 
high with lift, clouds, and precip around. 

Approximate timing on the front--looks to be moving from NW to SE 
across Ohio Valley around Tuesday, and through our area around 
Wednesday. Highest precip chances in the extended look to be 
Tuesday, Tuesday night, and/or Wednesday. Exact timing of front 
will likely focus POPs into just 1 or 2 periods. By Thursday and 
into Friday it should be turning hotter again as the TX/OK upper 
ridge swells over the area, but not looking as steamy as Mon/Tue.

.DISCUSSION...
Still a little bit of lingering fog visible in some of the
northern valley areas this morning. Have updated the forecast to
maintain mention of patchy fog for an extra hour in these
locations. Otherwise the overall forecast is still on track. Will
paste the early morning discussion below...

Upper troughing pattern continues across the Eastern third of the
CONUS with a closed upper low and surface low across Quebec. A
surface cold front extends SW across the Midwest as it slowly 
moves southward across the Ohio Valley. A large upper ridge is 
centered across the Southern Plains with surface ridging across 
the Lower Mississippi Valley and northern Gulf Coast. This is 
placing our forecast area under NW flow. While boundary layer 
moisture in plentiful across the region, drier air aloft will 
limit precipitation chances today. Model guidance continues to 
trend drier as well, so have limited to slight chance or chance 
PoPs area-wide. With PW values across the southern plateau and 
southern valley near 1.9 to 2.1 inches, there will be a localized
risk of some heavy rainfall rates with isolated showers or 
thunderstorms that develop. However, the overall risk of 
excessive rainfall is low with dry air aloft and CAMs not showing 
any significant QPF totals.

The slowly southward moving cold front is expected to be across
central KY by 12z Saturday. This will keep slight chance PoPs 
across the area overnight with a few isolated rain showers 
possible across the forecast area. Coverage should be limited with
dry air advection aloft.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...
On Saturday morning a front will be pushing southward across the 
area as high pressure builds into the OH Valley. Aloft, a weak 
midlevel trough will be crossing the area, with drier air advecting 
in behind it later in the day. Thus the morning and southern 
sections will be favored for PoPs on Saturday but still in the 
chance range as forcing is weak. With drier air building in, PoPs 
will decrease in the afternoon. 

The surface high will shift to the central Appalachians on Saturday 
night, then to the Mid Atlantic region on Sunday. A large mid/upper 
level ridge will be over TX/AR//LA, keeping a dry NW flow across our 
area. This should result in a dry day with mostly sunny skies and 
highs mainly in the lower to mid 90s. 

The mid/upper ridge to our west gets suppressed next week, resulting 
in a more zonal flow across the region. Some disturbances in the 
flow will bring a few rounds of rain chances on Monday through 
Wednesday. With such low amplitude features, uncertainty is high so 
PoPs will be kept in the chance range for this period.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...A stray late afternoon storm
will be possible over far southern locations...but this should be
quite limited and coverage isolated. By 00Z...convection should be
out of the area. Dry northwesterly flow aloft and weak surface
high pressure should keep conditions dry across the region thorugh
the night. There will be a weather system approaching the area and
we should see high and possible some mid clouds begin to push in
from the west late tonight. Low temperatures should be pretty
close to climatological norms. On Friday...clouds will continue to
invade from the west...slowing increasing and lowering through the
day. The main storm track should remain to our south and west but
do expect afternoon convection to develop to our west and push
into the MRX CWA area mid to late afternoon. The air mass will
become weakly unstable with DCAPE values generally between 500 and
1000 J/Kg. Low level moisture will increase...especially over the
CHA vicinity. PWs should climb to near 1.8 inches at CHA with
locations north remaining closer to 1.25 inches. As a result of
all of this...coverage should remain scattered with a stray strong
storm possible. Heavy rainfall will be possible with the storms...
especially across the Southern Cumberland Plateau into the CHA
area. With the increased clouds...highs should be a degree or two
cooler than today...generally in the 80s over most valley
locations. 

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Thursday)...Frontal boundary 
from the north will have pushed near the TN/KY border by Friday 
night. Associated showers and thunderstorms will likely be 
continuing from activity earlier in the day, but expect coverage 
and intensity of storms to diminish as the sun sets Friday night. 
As the evening continues we could still see a few strong storms 
over the area, with the primary threats continuing to be strong 
downburst winds and brief heavy rainfall possibly leading to 
isolated flooding. Highest threat area will continue to be around 
the Chattanooga area where there is a better chance for stronger 
storms in Middle Tennessee to move over them later in the evening.

Front will have trouble moving further to the south over the 
weekend, hanging up somewhere in the southeastern U.S. and likely 
closer to the southern portions of the forecast area. Not a lot of 
moisture, and subsidence in the mid/upper levels means storms will 
have a difficult time forming Saturday night into early next week.

As mid-level ridging moves further eastwards across the U.S. the 
biggest weather impacts will likely be very warm temperatures Sunday 
through Tuesday. 500mb heights continue to climb through early next 
week and daytime highs will rise about 5-10 above normal for this 
time of year. Dew point values will hover in the upper 60's to mid 
70's through Tuesday. These will combine to give very warm heat 
index values during the day. Heat Index values around Chattanooga 
will climb near triple digits starting Sunday and continue to climb 
through Tuesday. Warmest day is expected to be on Tuesday as the dew 
point values continue to climb along with the temperatures ahead of 
our next system. If forecast models verify we could see heat index 
values of around 100 at Knoxville and areas further south, with 
Chattanooga climbing above 105. 

Temperatures will finally cool down on Wednesday as a frontal 
boundary should push into the area from the north. Extended range 
models are in good agreement that a front will push through in the 
middle of next week, but are at odds with each other with respect to 
how much rainfall we may see out of this system. Will continue with 
low end precipitation chances and wait for better model agreement to 
adjust PoP values.

.DISCUSSION...The overall weather pattern for today shows weak 
northwesterly flow aloft with a quite diffuse...old frontal boundary 
lying across southern TN.  This boundary may act as a focus for 
afternoon convection.  Any convection should remain confined to far 
southern areas and coverage should be rather limited and isolated. 
However...if storms do form over the area...the air mass is 
sufficiently unstable to support a stray strong storm with strong 
winds being the main threat.  Any convection should end early in the 
evening for a dry night across the Southern Appalachian Region.  As 
for temperatures...highs today should be slightly above normal with

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The upper pattern this morning is highlighted by longwave troughing 
across the east coast of the CONUS while broad ridging prevails out 
west, all setting up deep wly/nwly flow across the OH/TN Valley.  At 
the surface, a weak/diffuse surface cold front remains draped across 
the TN Valley and Southern Appalachians, while drier high pressure 
noses in from the north.  Currently across the region, partly/mostly 
cloudy skies prevail, with the most dense sky cover along/south of 
I40 in association with frontal moisture and debris clouds that have 
advect in from upstream.  Am starting to see patchy fog in the river 
valleys across northeast TN and southwest VA, which should continue 
(perhaps expand) given modest radiational cooling.  

Moving on, the aforementioned weak front doesn't look to migrate all 
that much, therefore keeping at least portions of the lower 
valley/plateau in the modestly unstable warm sector therefore 
favoring slight chance pops.  While coverage in these areas should 
remain limited, there looks to be enough instability for deep 
convection, thus won't rule out a strong storm/two with damaging 
winds and hail being the primary threats.  Elsewhere, drier air 
should prevail keeping the remainder of the area precipitation free 
with no pops mentioned.  Temperatures today will once again top out 
a few degrees above normal.  Late in the period guidance suggests 
ridge riding MCS development across lower MO and west TN/KY, 
eventually moving into middle/east TN late in the morning given it's 
survival.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...
There is overall good guidance agreement through the extended. 
Longwave troughing remains across the Eastern CONUS on Friday with a 
strong shortwave moving eastward from the Great Lakes to the 
Northeast with a surface low across Quebec. This will bring a 
surface cold front slowly southward across the Ohio Valley and 
approach the Tennessee Valley by Friday night. There is considerable 
disagreement in the mesoscale details on Friday afternoon as the NAM 
has 1000 to 2000 J/Kg of MLCAPE across the forecast area and the GFS 
has limited 100 to 500 J/Kg MLCAPE. Effective bulk shear is forecast 
to be between 20 and 30 kt, so if instability is closer to output 
from the NAM, could have a few stronger organized thunderstorms in 
the afternoon with downburst winds being the primary hazard. 
However, there is a mitigating factor of low-level ridging across 
the Gulf Coast that will limit boundary layer moisture advection 
into the area ahead of the cold front, and this will act to limit 
some convection and excessive rainfall potential. Still, PWs will be 
high, near 1.9 to 2.0 inches, across the southern valley and 
southern plateau near Chattanooga, so localized heavy downpours and 
flooding issues could occur in favored urban and flood prone 
locations.

As the surface low across Quebec becomes further occluded and the 
forward motion of the surface front slows, it will remain across 
southern portions of the forecast area on Saturday. Drier air and 
subsidence aloft should limit precipitation chances, but may still 
have an isolated rain shower or thunderstorm across SE TN and SW NC. 
We should remain dry Sunday with surface high pressure and upper 
ridging.

Early next week, SW flow returns on Monday afternoon and ridging 
begins to build eastward from the Southern Plains to the Lower 
Mississippi Valley. This will bring upper 500mb heights close to 594 
dam by Tuesday near Chattanooga, and this would result in anomalous 
warmth across the Tennessee Valley. Current forecast brings max 
temperatures on Tuesday into the mid 90s around Chattanooga which is 
near blends and a couple degrees higher than MEX guidance. This 
would result in a heat index of around 105 degrees at Chattanooga on 
Tuesday. There is still some uncertainty of convective coverage 
Tuesday afternoon which would limit overall max temperatures, but 
the trend is for above normal temperatures early next week.

Global models are in good agreement for Day 7 with another shortwave 
moving southeast from the Northern Plains to the Great Lakes next 
Wednesday with an associated surface cold front moving southeastward 
toward the Tennessee Valley. This would bring additional scattered 
convection and cooler temperatures by late next week.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Scattered showers and thunderstorms have developed this afternoon 
over parts of southwest Virginia and farther south towards southern 
Middle Tennessee. These are in response to two shortwaves that 
appear to be picked up well by the 12z NAM. The northern stream is 
slightly weaker, while the southern stream shortwave is leading a 
stronger wave producing the thunderstorms over northwest Tennessee.

The western storm system aligns itself near the Marion County line
and Georgia/Alabama for the first part of this forecast period.
Rainfall could linger over Marion County later than most areas
that see diurnal showers develop that dissipate around sunset. The
only exception may be a few areas in the higher terrain as storms
will tend to move east/southeast. 

Rainfall is expected to wane by midnight followed by patchy fog
development through sunrise before quickly dissipating. Most areas
will remain dry through tomorrow however, that northwest flow
region across West/Middle TN may muster a few showers that could
bring a couple thunderstorms over Marion, Sequatchie and Hamilton
Counties.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
Models in general agreement that much of the period will be 
dominated by a ridge axis to our west and northwest flow aloft 
over our area. Short wave energy is forecast to move across and a 
weak cold front will push through at the surface Friday/Friday 
night. This will bring scattered showers and thunderstorms to the 
area. Some convection may linger especially south closer to the 
front on Saturday, then drier air will be moving in and Sunday 
should be precip free. Another short wave and front is forecast to
affect the area early in the week, with the front stalling 
somewhere in the vicinity, most likely near the Plateau. Models 
disagree with the timing of this, with the ECMWF/Canadian slower 
than the GFS. Expect scattered showers and thunderstorms at times 
Monday through Wednesday, although uncertainty is higher for 
Monday. Temperatures are generally expected to be not far from 
normal for the period.

.DISCUSSION...
The morning convection has diminished over the forecast area for 
the time being. Current forecast temperature trends and other 
weather elements look on track - or will be in the next hour or so
once the thicker cloud cover decreases. 

The focus shifts to this afternoon where additional showers and
thunderstorms will develop. Short-term models still all over
the place on where initiation will take place however, am leaning
towards the southern portions of the forecast area...mainly south
of I-40 and closer to Chattanooga where a few stronger storms will
occur. This is where more abundant sunshine and better instability
will occur. The best time appears to be between 3 and 5 pm ET 
with the threat of damaging winds and large hail lasting a few 
hours before moving southeast into Georgia.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The pattern this morning is highlighted by an amplified H5 longwave 
trough across the eastern CONUS with an embedded shortwave moving 
through the mean flow across the OH Valley, all while broad ridging 
prevails out west setting up nwly flow across the MS Valley. 
Otherwise, the remnants of an earlier MCS continue to diminish 
across east TN this morning (aided by upper divergence tied to the 
left exit region of an H3 jetmax) while a weak/diffuse surface cold 
front sags southward out of KY into middle/east TN. Pattern 
evolution through the day will feature the passage of the weak H5 
impulse across the region promoting at least some minimal synoptic 
scale lift atop the TN Valley and Southern Appalachians.  With that, 
there seems to be two distinct convective features of note moving 
forward in the short term.

The first convective complex to note would be the broken line of 
showers and thunderstorms ahead of the front across KY.  CAM 
guidance tends to not handle this very well, as least regarding a 
consensus.  The HRRR takes this convection east into WV with no 
southern expansion into TN.  However, the HiRes ARW/NMMB and the 
NamNest build convection along the southern flank into northeast TN 
and southwest VA.  Looking at the latest SPC Mesoanalysis MUCAPE 
fields, there isn't all that much to work with across southeast KY. 
Therefore, will lean toward the HRRR, however given some credence to 
the other aforementioned mentioned CAMS by way of featuring mid/high 
chance pops toward daybreak for portions of northeast TN and 
southwest VA.  Nevertheless, not expecting deep convection with any 
of this potential activity, just general thunder (perhaps just 
showers).

Moving on, the second convective potential of the day will lie 
across portions of southeast TN and southwest NC where instability 
will maximize amongst the prefrontal warm sector.  As usual, the NAM 
seems to be the outlier in this regard as it favors nearly 4k j/kg 
MUCAPE generally along/south of I40 this afternoon given deep dry 
air aloft in its fcst profiles.  Tend to think this is a little 
overdone given the NAMs fcst dewpoints being a little high, thus 
opted to rely moreso on HREF ensemble output which suggest mean CAPE 
exceeding 2-2.5k j/kg.  Regardless, those same NAM profiles do favor 
WBZ heights around 10kft or less, which could present an elevated 
hail threat for taller/deeper convection.  All said, the fcst will 
feature chance pops regionwide this afternoon, lowest across the 
northern plateau, elevated to mid/high chance levels southward as 
well as across the high terrain.  As for threats, primarily would 
expect any deeper convection south of I40 being capable of large 
hail, damaging winds, and frequent lightning. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...
Persistent upper pattern through the extended period with 
troughing over the east coast of the nation and ridging across the
central and southern Plains. This will produce northwest upper 
flow with a series of short- waves ejecting across the mid-west 
southeast into the Ohio valley/central Appalachians. These waves 
will pull frontal boundaries into the region.

For Thursday, drier air over the region with a 800-700mb capping 
inversion and surface ridging will produce a mostly dry day.

For Thursday night and Friday, a short-wave will move across the 
Ohio/Tennessee valleys producing high chance/likely chances of 
convection. Marginal CAPE values of 1500-2000 J/kg and slight above 
normal PWAT will produce locally heavy rains.

For Friday night through Sunday, wave will move east of the area 
with drier air and surface ridging moving back into the southern 
Appalachians. A mostly dry forecast anticipated.

For Monday and Tuesday, another wave will move across the 
Ohio/Tennessee valleys with increasing moisture and instability. 
Increasing chances of showers and thunderstorms expected.

.DISCUSSION...Will accomplish a little earlier timing for the
convective line advancing south into Northern Middle Tennessee
with emphasis over the western part of the forecast area including
the Cumberland Plateau. The satellite and radar trends for the
past five hours, and model depiction of cape supports only limited
instability later tonight across a lot of the eastern half of the
forecast area. However, as the line continues pushing more south 
than east into Tennessee, it could bring some convection to 
Southeast Tennessee earlier that previously thought so will adjust
a little sooner here. There could be a couple storms that may 
produce some strong gusts, but 15-20 kts of model progged shear 
isn't too impressive with this pre-frontal line. Temperatures are 
dropping slowly with a lot of re-radiation occurring post sunset, 
however, believe some cooling with showers later tonight will 
bring readings into line with current forecast mins.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...

Seeing a couple of isolated showers early this afternoon across 
portions of northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia. Current 
water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a weak 
shortwave trough that stretches from southwest Ohio into northern 
middle Tennessee. This approaching trough is leading to a few of 
these isolated showers but the atmosphere is fairly dry with PW 
values in the 1.2-1.4 inch range. These values are near the 25th-
50th percentile for early August. Mid and upper level flow is from 
the northwest and could also see a few showers/storms in the 
mountain as well this afternoon and evening. Highs this afternoon 
will be near climatological normals with temperatures in the mid 80s 
to low 90s for most locations. 

The best chance for showers/storms will come during the overnight 
period into early Wednesday morning. A surface boundary currently 
stretches from near Michigan to the southwest into Kansas. In the 
upper levels, there is a trough currently located across 
Iowa/Missouri/Illinois. IR satellite imagery indicates some 
convection already blossoming in eastern Missouri near St. Louis. Hi-
res models indicate that this convection will continue to develop 
and form an MCS that will track to the southeast with the mean flow. 
Models are struggling with the timing but highest chances for 
precipitation appear to be somewhere in the 09-15z timeframe. Due to 
the overnight nature of the convection, instability will be limited 
and do not expect any strong or severe storms. The best chance for 
any stronger storms will be on Wednesday afternoon for locations 
generally east of I-75 and south of I-40. There is some uncertainty 
about how far south and east the front will make it and how much 
lingering cloud cover continues into the afternoon from 
precipitation early in the day. A decent shortwave trough will move 
through the southern Appalachians during the afternoon and should 
lead to another round of convection if there are some breaks in the 
cloud cover and the front remains to the northwest. If the morning 
round of showers/storms pushes through quickly and the front remains 
to the northwest would expect a higher chance for a few strong to 
potentially severe storms but still too much uncertainty to 
mention more than strong storms in the HWO. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...

Longwave upper troughing continues through the extended with NW flow 
across the forecast area. By Wednesday night, 500mb shortwave will 
be to the east of the mountains with shortwave ridging providing 
some subsidence and drying conditions across the area. This may lead 
to some areas of fog if clouds clear across areas that received 
rainfall. Thursday should remain mostly dry with subsidence and a 
capping inversion near 700-800mb.

A strong shortwave will move southeastward on Friday across the 
Great Lakes into the Northeast states with an associated occluding 
surface low across Quebec. This will bring a cold front 
southeastward across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley with a slowing 
forward motion as it approaches the Tennessee Valley. As this front 
moves across the forecast area on Friday afternoon, expect scattered 
showers and thunderstorms. Severe weather risk is still uncertain on 
Friday, but NAM guidance is showing the potential of MLCAPE between 
1000 and 2000 J/kg. Most dynamics should remain well northeast of 
our forecast area, so expect any severe risk to be small, dependent 
on available instability, and localized at this time. Low-level 
ridging across the Gulf Coast should prevent good moisture return 
across the area limiting the overall coverage of precipitation.

The big question this weekend is where this cold front stalls. The 
ECMWF brings the front through our forecast area and takes it south 
into AL and GA. The 12z GFS is trending further south which would 
favor a drier pattern this weekend. By early next week, ridging 
shifts east with southerly flow and additional moisture returning to 
the region. This will lead to an increase in diurnal thunderstorm 
development mainly across the higher elevations. Temperature should 
remain within 5 degrees of normal through the extended.

Not much change to the previous forecast, northwesterly flow aloft
continues today. PW values are in the 1.0-1.2 inch range. These
values are near the 25th percentile and expect the forecast area

showers/storms across the higher elevations along the TN/NC line
with the northwesterly flow providing some orographic lift. There
is a weak upper level trough near western Kentucky that will move
through the Tennessee Valley later today but with the lack of
moisture, do not anticipate any precipitation. A secondary
shortwave trough will rotate through the area later tonight into
Wednesday morning bringing in a better chance for precipitation.

across portions of SC/GA/AL, while weak high pressure builds across 
the TN Valley.  Conditions early this morning remain rather 
uneventful as only a few low remnant cu persist beneath sct high 
clouds.  Am starting to see a little valley fog developing at this 
time, however given slightly lower dewpoints than previous nights, 
think widespread fog is unlikely and thus should remain confined to 
said valleys.  Nevertheless, patchy fog was mentioned for those 
valley locations.

Moving on, looks like a rather nice Tuesday ahead as partly cloudy 
skies prevail for most areas amidst modest heating favoring highs 
slightly above normal.  Guidance does continue to favor iso/sct 
showers and thunderstorms across the mtns, which was featured by way 
of slight/chance pops maximized during peak heating.  At that point 
the focus of the fcst period shifts northward over the Midwest as a 
weak upper impulse moves southeast along the mean H5 flow atop a 
region of modest instability.  HighRes guidance along with the 
operational NAM continue to suggest MCS development by mid afternoon 
across central IL/IN, which will then move southeast into the OH 
Valley by late day.  Guidance favors said MCS tracking further 
southeast into the evening/overnight hours, most likely weakening as 
it encounters a more stable environment across eastern KY, eastern 
TN, and southwest VA.  As for the fcst, did highlight increasing 
pops through the evening/overnight generally along/north of I40 
where low likely to high end chances reside, with slight to low 
chance levels featured south of I40.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...
The main weather feature through the extended period will remain 
northwest flow aloft with a series of short-waves riding 
southeast. These waves will bring frontal boundaries enhancing 
convection.

First short-wave will move across the Ohio/Tennessee valleys 
Wednesday. Models are in general agreement with convection moving 
into the area during the morning with additional scattered storms in 
the afternoon. HREF ensemble mean CAPE is between 2000-2500 J/Kg. 
Plenty of dry air aloft and mid-level lapse rates near 6.5 degree C 
may produce some strong and gusty winds. Main limiting factor for 
convection will be best short-wave forcing will be east of the 
Appalachians and too much dry air. Believe coverage will be 30-40 
percent at best in the afternoon and generally along and east of 
interstate 75.

For Wednesday night and most of Thursday, dry air, mid-level capping 
inversion, and surface ridging will produce dry conditions.

For late Thursday night and Friday, increasing moisture will pull 
back into the region. A frontal boundary will move toward the area 
with scattered showers and thunderstorms anticipated. 

For Friday night through Sunday, frontal boundary will be south and 
west of the area with surface ridging producing mostly dry 
conditions.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates 
that the upper level trough axis is now just to the east of the 
mountains. Model soundings coupled with water vapor imagery depict 
dry air in the mid and upper levels across the southern Appalachians. 
PW values reflect this with values in the 1.1-1.3 inch range. These 
values are in the 25th-40th percentile for early August. Despite the 
dry air, there area a few showers/storms on radar mainly over the 
higher elevations. Seeing some additional orographic lift with 
northwesterly winds behind the trough axis. OVerall, expect the 
valley will stay dry with partly cloudy skies this afternoon and 
evening. Highs will be near climatological normals for early August 
in the mid to upper 80s. 

Skies will be mostly clear overnight with light winds. Dewpoints 
will be in the low to mid 60s and expect there could be some patchy 
fog late tonight into Tuesday morning. With the sparse coverage of 
precipitation today, do not anticipate any widespread fog issues. The 
best locations for fog formation will be along area rivers and 
lakes. Lows overnight will be near average with temperatures 
dropping into the mid 60s to low 70s.

A shortwave ridge will traverse the southern Appalachians late 
tonight into early Tuesday. Another shortwave trough will quickly 
move in behind the ridge late in the day On Tuesday. For now, it 
appears the atmosphere will be to dry for precipitation as this 
trough races across the region late in the day and have only a 
slight chance mentioned for the higher elevations. Highs will be a 
couple of degrees warmer than today with the higher heights across 
the region ranging from the mid 80s to low 80s.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...

Overall, the northwest flow pattern continues through the long term 
with a series of disturbances dropping down into our area. 
Temperatures will remain near normal.

There are some changes for the Tuesday night/Wednesday period in 
regards to timing. Shortwave and front drop down out of the Ohio 
River Valley Tuesday night. The latest NAM shows a healthy line of 
showers and storms moving into KY before midnight. These showers and 
storms continue to dive southeast toward our area through the night 
but decrease in coverage as the night goes on. The NAM shows this 
now broken line of showers and storms moving through our area 
Wednesday morning. Synoptic forcing will be enough to keep some of 
these showers and storms going but not confident on how much 
coverage. NAM soundings still show some moderate instability of 
roughly 2500 J/kg MLCAPE and weak, unidirectional, speed shear of 
roughly 20 to 30 kts at 0-3km. Isolated damaging wind gusts are 
possible and is the main threat as of now. Conditions clear out 
through the afternoon noon as the front drops down into the area. 
However, there is another difference between models with the 
potential late afternoon/evening activity. The GFS doesn't show much 
happening but the NAM drops in a potent little shortwave out of the 
Missouri River Valley. As a result, convection fires up across west 
TN and moves southeast across the southern TN Valley Wednesday 
evening/night. So confidence for this time period is low as of now. 

Thursday looks mostly dry but slight chance and low-end chance POPs 
in place as the NAM is trying to bring in precip from out of Middle 
TN Thursday afternoon. The GFS doesn't show this and holds it off 
until late Thursday night/Friday morning. More showers and storms in 
store for Friday and Saturday as another front drops down into the 
area. GFS is trending more toward the ECMWF solution and drops the 
front south through our area by Saturday afternoon where it has 
previously been hanging it up across the area. So as of now, things 
are looking drier for the second half of Saturday. The theme 
continues for Sunday and Monday as yet two more disturbances drop 
down though the continued northwest flow and bring more chances for 
showers and storms.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The pattern this morning is rather reminiscent of past days given H5 
western Atlantic and Four Corners ridging while an H5 trough 
prevails across the eastern CONUS (generally oriented along the 
Appalachians).  However, the axis of the trough continues to slowly 
shift east, and should setup across the Carolinas by day's end. 
Currently, mid/high clouds (with a few lower debris clouds) 
highlight the skies across the TN Valley and Southern Appalachian 
region, while drier air advects across Middle TN per latest WV loop. 
With that, given clearing skies and a moist/decoupled PBL, already 
starting to see some patchy fog across the Plateau.  Would expect 
this fog to slowly extend eastward as skies clear in the valley 
toward daybreak, thus did include patchy fog in the fcst. Otherwise, 
am expecting a rather uneventful and partly cloudy Monday morning. 

Moving on into the remainder of the day, the deeper moisture axis 
will remain tied to the aforementioned trough axis as it advects 
east.  Therefore did included chance/likely pops across the higher 
terrain this afternoon, tapering down sharply into the evening as 
moisture advects out.  Also included slight/chance pops along the 
US64 corridor closer to the GA state line where there will be at 
least some minimal instability for weak convection.  By late 
evening, conditions should be dry with skies clearing out into 
Tuesday morning, which may yield another round of patchy fog. 
Temperatures on Monday will be a few degrees warmer than recent 
days, generally right around normal. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)... 
For most of the extended, northwest flow aloft will be the 
dominant feature. A series of short-waves moving southeast across 
the Ohio Valley and Great lakes will pull frontal boundaries south
into/across the Tennessee valley and southern Appalachians.

For Tuesday, surface ridging with drier air will produce a most dry 
day across the region.

For Wednesday, a short-wave will move across the Ohio valley into 
the central/southern Appalachians. Models show a fairly strong 300mb 
jet (70-80kts) moving toward the area. Strongest forcing with this 
jet seems to be over southwest Virginia into northern/central 
sections of the Tennessee valley. Decent MLCAPEs of 2000-2500 J/Kg 
with increased 850mb jet to 25kts providing some weak shear 
producing some organization to the storms. Biggest concern will be 
the dry air aloft providing enough thermodynamics for wet microburst 
potential. Also, fairly decent mid-level lapse rates of 6.5 degree C 
enhancing Hail CAPES. Hail CAPES along with favorable WBZ heights 
will allow for the stronger storms to produce marginal severe hail.

Will highlight this potential in the HWO. There is some question of 
timing of the storms. NAM has more storms late Tuesday night/early 
Wednesday, while the GFS and ECMWF are later.

For Thursday, drier air pulls into the area behind the wave with 
most locations remaining dry.

For Thursday night and Friday, another frontal boundary pulls south 
into the area. The GFS tends to hang up the front over the area 
while the ECMWF is more progressive and pulls frontal boundary south 
of the area.

For next weekend, depends on which model is correct. Confidence is 
low for Saturday and Sunday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

The focus for convection currently is along the E-W stalled frontal 
boundary. Not seeing much of a temperature change along the boundary 
but there is a decent dewpoint gradient with dewpoints in the low 
60s to the north and upper 60s to low 70s to the south. SBCAPE 
values are around 1500-2000 J/Kg and have seen a few storms pulse up 
with some small hail being reported. Expect this will be the case 
over the next few hours. Localized flood will also be possible with 
these storms slowly drifting southeastward along the surface 
boundary. In the upper levels, there is a trough that stretches from 
the Great Lakes southward into the northern Gulf of Mexico with the 
trough axis overhead. In the mid-levels, there is a shortwave trough 
rotating through the area providing some weak synoptic lift. Updated 
the PoPs for this afternoon and evening to include the highest 
chances along the frontal boundary near to just north of I-40 
corridor. Expect most of the convection will come to an end shortly 
after sunset with the loss of daytime heating. Fog formation is 
forecast again tonight with scattered to numerous showers this 
afternoon and evening. For now, do not expect any widespread dense 
fog and the fog should lift shortly after sunrise. Overnight lows 
will be near climatological normals for early August in the 60s.

The trough axis will shift slightly to the east tomorrow and maybe 
even east of mountains with more northwesterly flow aloft. The 
atmosphere will have less moisture to work with tomorrow with PW 
values in the 1.0-1.2 inch range. These values are near the 25th 
percentile for early August. For now, have the highest PoPs across 
the higher elevations of east Tennessee along the NC line. The 
mountains will provide orographic lift with the northwesterly flow 
aloft. Overall, have low PoPs in the valley around 20% and expect 
most locations will remain dry. High temperatures will be near 
climatological normals for early August in the mid to upper 80s on 
Monday.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...

Things are drying out Monday night as our shortwave rotates further 
eastward into the Carolinas. A few isolated showers and storms may 
linger to start the period across the eastern mountains but should 
fade before midnight. Brief drying occurs Monday night into Tuesday 
as we are in between systems. Most locations will be dry Tuesday but 
still advertising a slight chance POP across the high terrain of 
the eastern mountains and portions of SWVA for any isolated diurnal 
showers and storms. Overall, Tuesday should be a nice day with clear 
skies and near normal highs. 

Tuesday night into Wednesday our next shortwave and weak front drop 
down into the forecast area, which give us increasing POPs from late 
Tuesday night through Wednesday afternoon. Some of these showers and 
storms may produce locally heavy rainfall as PW values are 
moderately high for this time of year. Soundings also show moderate 
instabilty and some weak, unidirectional, speed shear through the 
depth of the atmosphere. This will allow for a little more organized 
storm structure compared to the pulse activity. Severe threat 
looks low though due to the weak shear. This wave exits Wednesday 
evening with another bout of brief drying. Thursday looks 
dry for the most part but will still feature a slight chance 
POP across the forecast area.

Friday into Saturday we have our next front approaching. The GFS 
still shows a shallower trough and slows the front as it enters our 
area and possibly stalls it. The ECMWF pattern is still more 
amplified and passes the front to our south Saturday night. POPs 
will directly be affected by the frontal location so keep up with 
the forecast as the weather for next weekend is still in question.

.DISCUSSION...

Seeing showers/storms this morning across southeast Tennessee
around the Chattanooga area over the last few hours. In the upper
levels, there are a few shortwave troughs that will move across
the southern Appalachians today. At the surface, seeing a
stationary boundary that stretches E-W across extreme northeast
Tennessee. To the south of this boundary dewpoints are in the
upper 60s and lows 70s with low to mid 60s to the north. For the
update, increased PoPs in the near-term in southeast Tennessee to
account for the ongoing activity and also lowered highs in these
areas slightly due to the persistent cloud cover and
precipitation. Also, decreased the northern extent of the PoPs.
Model soundings and PW values indicate a strong gradient in
moisture just to the north of I-40 along the surface boundary. PW
values in southwest Virginia and extreme northeast Tennessee will
range from 0.9-1.2 inches this afternoon with 1.5-1.7 inch values
across southeast Tennessee. SBCAPE values to the south of the 
boundary will range from 1500-2000 J/Kg and could see a strong 
storm or two with gusty winds and small hail. Additionally, 
localized flooding will be possible due to the slow motion of the 
storms.

and relatively warm waterways will allow for patchy dense fog. 
Greatest coverage near area lakes and streams. Coverage will not be 
as widespread as yesterday morning due to limited convection 
Saturday.

An upper trough will be over Tennessee valley today with the main 
forcing again associated with area terrain features. Models show 
greatest moisture/instability generally south of interstate 40. Will 
have high chance/likely PoPs around CHA, chance TYS, slight 
chance/chance near TRI. Mainly diurnal convection anticipated due to 
lack of upper support.

HREF ensemble shows CAPEs of 1500-2000 J/Kg across Tennessee with 
the highest near CHA/TYS. Enough dry air aloft to help produce 
strong/gusty winds with the stronger storms. Steering winds for 
storm motion will be weak allowing thunderstorms (PWs of 1.6-1.8 
inches around CHA/TYS) to producing heavy rains to remain over the 
same location. Localized flash flooding concerns are possible.

Another round of patchy fog anticipated early Tuesday morning. Some 
of the fog may be dense near area waterways.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...
The extended fcst period kicks off on Monday morning amidst 
continued western Atlantic and western CONUS ridging, while low 
amplitude troughing prevails across the east CONUS (essentially 
along the spine of the Appalachians). At the surface, weak high 
pressure centered near Kansas City will look to advect further 
southeast into the TN Valley region to start the period, effectively 
nudging an old stationary frontal axis (which should be laid along 
the I40 corridor) southward. Behind this front, am expecting at 
least some weak drier air advection into the region from the north. 
Thus, the fcst on Monday will feature a general north/south pop 
gradient with slight chances northward increasing to mid/high 
chances southward closer to the NC/GA stateline. Regarding threats, 
pwats look to be substantially lower during this timeframe (even 
furthest south) which should inhibit heavy rainfall, thus think the 
primary concern would be general thunderstorms.

Moving on, Tuesday looks to be the day with the lowest precipitation 
chances given nearly flat/zonal flow at the base of the upper 
longwave trough combined with general drier wly/nwly flow. That 
said, wouldn't be suprised to see a few showers and thunderstorms 
across the higher terrain, therefore only slight chance pops are 
mentioned across the mtns. Meanwhile, a potent shortwave will pass 
through the mean H5 cyclone over southern Canada which will 
effectively amplify the trough across the eastern CONUS to some 
degree for Wednesday, not to mention send a weak frontal boundary 
southward as well. Therefore, the fcst will feature higher pops on 
Wednesday for sct showers and thunderstorms as the front intrudes 
mid/late day. As was the case with last night's fcst, precipitation 
chances take a slight dip on Thursday in the wake of the weak fropa. 
Pops will ramp back up into Friday as an even more potent H5 wave 
moves through southern Canada once again surging a cold front 
southward across the Great Lakes and into the OH/TN Valley region by 
Friday afternoon/evening.  At this range, uncertainty is fairly high 
regarding the progression of this late week front with some guidance 
pushing it through the area into north GA, while some sources look 
to stall it out nearly overhead. Obviously these discontinuities 
will disrupt the fcst for Saturday into Sunday, therefore pops will 
remain fairly conservative at this point.  

As for temperatures, not much change from previous fcst cycles as 
near or slightly below normal levels are expected Monday, with a 
gradual warming trend favored promoting levels slightly above normal 
for the remainder of the week.

Main concerns through the forecast period are potential of MVFR/IFR 
conditions at TRI between 09-13Z due to fog development. Scattered 
convection will likely redevelop at/near CHA between 18-23Z and 
possibly at TYS. Drier and more stable conditions will limit 
convection at TRI.

An upper trough remains over the Tennessee valley/southern 
Appalachians with the main forcing being terrain features. Airmass 
will be more unstable at CHA/TYS and will place best chance of 
storms there. Otherwise, VFR conditions. Surface ridging will keep 
winds light except near storms.

.DISCUSSION...
Not much change is needed to the forecast this evening. Showers
have dissipated over most of the area, with a few isolated showers
hanging on in the NE TN/SW VA area. Storms just west of Marion
County are tracking slowly east and may last long enough to cross
our border. Outside of those two areas, no redevelopment is
expected and PoPs will be lowered. A few small adjustments will be
made to hourly temp/dewpoints but forecast lows are still on
track. With less rain occurring this afternoon evening compared to
yesterday, dense fog is less likely to form, and the Wx grids will
just have patchy fog late tonight.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

Seeing a few isolated showers early this afternoon on radar imagery, 
mainly over the higher elevations. Current water vapor imagery 
indicates an expansive area of mid to upper level dry air across the 
southern Appalachians. At the surface, there is an E-W oriented 
stationary boundary along the Gulf Coast states. PW values are near 
the 50th percentile for early August. In the upper levels, there is 
a broad trough across the Great Lakes stretching southward into the 
northern Gulf of Mexico. Overall, expect isolated to scattered 
showers and storms will continue this afternoon with best chances 
(40-50%)in the higher elevations and lower (20-30%) chances in the 
valley. Overall, instability values are lower today as well with 
SBCAPE values in the 750-1500 J/Kg range and removed the mention of 
strong/severe storms from the HWO. So far, have not seen any 
lightning with any of the ongoing activity. Convection will decrease 
in coverage and intensity near sunset with the loss of daytime 
heating. Fog formation will be possible again tonight and have 
patchy fog in the forecast. Do not expect fog to be as widespread as 
last night with the limited coverage of precipitation anticipated 
this afternoon and evening. Overnight lows will be near 
climatological normals in the mid 60s to low 70s.

The upper level trough deepens some on Sunday as a shortwave trough 
dives southeastward out of the Midwest into the Tennessee River 
Valley. PW values will recover into the 1.5-1.7 inch range. These 
values are closer to the 75th percentile for early August. 
Additionally, there will be an E-W stationary boundary to the south 
across the Gulf Coast states. Better moisture and slightly better 
lift should lead to a wider coverage of shower/storms Sunday 
afternoon. For now, have highest chances around 60-70 percent across 
southern portions of the forecast area and lowest chances around 20-
30 percent across southwest Virginia where moisture values will be 
lower. Slow storm motion and heavy rainfall will lead to the 
possibility of localized flooding. Best chances for flooding will be 
south of I-40 where the best chances of precipitation will be. Went 
a bit lower with highs on Sunday, due to the increased moisture and 
cloud cover with most locations climbing into the upper 70s to mid 
80s. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

Overall, the period is characterized by a troughing pattern with 
several waves of energy diving down through the trough.

A few showers and storms will likely be ongoing to start the period 
as a weak frontal boundary is moving south and east through the 
area. These showers and storms should decrease in coverage as we 
lose heating. However, most areas will keep slight chance POPs 
through the night as the front should provide enough forcing to keep 
a few showers going. 

The dominate high to our west helps to force the front to our east 
on Monday but it's so weak it's hard to pick out. It looks like it 
should be centered along the spine of the Appalachians early on then 
progresses eastward into the Carolinas as the day goes on. The 
highest POPs on Monday will therefore be along and east of the I-75/I-
81 corridor, which is closest the frontal location. No POPs in place 
by Monday night as the front is further east. Clearing will occur 
overnight as some, brief, drier air works its way into the area in 
between systems. 

Tuesday looks mostly dry as we are behind the front. Did include 
some slight chance POPs across the elevated areas to account for the 
typical diurnal activity. Tuesday night into Wednesday another weak 
front drops down into the flow and brings another chance for showers 
and storms. The front moves out Wednesday night into Thursday and 
more, brief, drying occurs. 

A stronger front approaches in the Fri/Sat timeframe but models 
disagree on the timing and evolution. The GFS brings the front in 
during the day Friday and hangs it up across our area into the day 
on Saturday which would keep showers and storms around. The trough 
in the ECMWF is much deeper and takes the front well to our south by 
Saturday afternoon which would give us a blast of cool and dry air. 
This far out it's hard to say which model is correct. Temperatures 
will remain near normal through the period.

.DISCUSSION...

The fog has lifted across the area and have allowed the advisory
to expire. Visibilities at Knoxville and Tri-Cities have improved
and not seeing any fog looking at the traffic cameras across the
area. Still seeing some low cloud cover persist where there was
fog earlier but seeing this quickly erode on visible satellite 
imagery giving way to mostly sunny skies. 

For the update, delayed the onset of PoPs by a couple of hours.
Visible satellite imagery is pretty clear right now expect for 
the patchy low stratus. Water vapor imagery indicates a broad area
of dry air in the mid to upper levels and PW values will be lower
today. There is still some weak troughing aloft and at the 
surface. Expect best coverage again will be over the higher 
elevations due to the orographic lift. Models have trended towards
less coverage today with the dry air aloft and have decreased 
PoPs slightly from the previous forecast. Expect locations in the 
valley will have the lowest chances around 20% or so. Temperatures
will be near climatology for early August in the mid to upper 80s
for highs.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Satellite imagery this 
morning shows mostly clear skies with a few areas of upper lvl
clouds still passing through. Area observations along with GOES 
Night Fog product is beginning to show areas of patchy fog 
developing. Surface analysis places a weak inverted surface trough
through western Tennessee/Kentucky with weak pressure troughing 
across the southern Appalachians. High pressure is located to the 
north across the Great Lakes. In the upper levels, a 594dam 
anticyclone was located across the desert southwest, while 
troughing sits across much of the eastern US. Water vapor imagery 
this morning depicts a weak shortwave trough moving out of the 
northern plains, while southern stream energy has been 
intensifying across the northern GoM. GOES 6.95 and differential 
water vapor imagery shows an area of dry air just to the north of 
the forecast area which will likely play a large role in 
convective coverage today. The rest of the night is expected to be
quiet with mostly clear skies, and light winds producing ideal 
radiational cooling conditions for fog development.

The trend has been for lowering PoPs on Saturday and this seems 
to be the case with this forecast package. Northerly winds will 
help to advect drier air into parts of the area which will likely 
limit areal coverage of convection. This can be seen in time 
heights at TRI where the column should be dry from ~800mb and up.
However, further south across CHA, the column remains moist and as
a result would expect the highest coverage across southern 
portions of the forecast area. A strong or severe storm is 
possible during the afternoon as CAPE values increase to 1500-2500
j/kg, with damaging winds being the main threat. Heavy 
rainfall/localized flash flooding is also possible given the 
convective nature of the precipitation expected as forecast 
soundings depict a very moist column with PW values near 1.80 
inches across southern portions of the forecast area. Also, cloud 
bearing winds will remain weak, thus storm motions will likely be 
slow. Otherwise, convection will begin to wane Saturday evening 
with the loss of daytime heating. Saturday night should remain 
quiet with mostly clear skies and light winds. Fog is possible in 
areas that receive rainfall. Temperatures Saturday will be near 
climatology. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...

The extended forecast period kicks off Sunday morning amidst H5 
ridging over the western Atlantic as well as across the Four 
Corners, while a low amplitude trough (with an embedded shortwave) 
extends southward across the OH/TN and MS valleys from a parent 
cyclone over eastern Canada. At the surface, high pressure will 
advect southeast across the Corn Belt as a weak frontal axis 
(preceding said high pressure) slides into the OH valley early on 
Sunday, eventually pushing further south into the TN valley and 
Southern Appalachians late in the day as the aforementioned H5 
shortwave advects through. With that, pops will maximize along/south 
of I40 where the most instability will reside ahead of the front. As 
for any threats, think the primary concern would be the potential 
for heavy rainfall and isolated flash flooding given pwats in the 
1.8-2.0 inch range, not to mention slow storm motions oriented 
parallel to the front which could promote training. 

Further pattern evolution on Monday will feature a slight eastward 
shift of the overall synoptic longwave with the axis setting up east 
of the Appalachians and the surface front sliding southward into the 
I20 corridor.  This change will promote slightly drier conditions 
given NVA aloft and dry advection in the low levels, thus pops 
will lower across the board with slight chances westward 
increasing to high chances over the mtns, all mainly on a diurnal 
trend. Tuesday looks relatively dry as flow remains fairly 
flattened at the base of the trough while weak waa prevails, thus 
below climo pops are featured. Beyond that, the pattern will 
continue to feature broad troughing across the eastern CONUS 
through the remainder of the week. During this timeframe guidance 
favors a series of amplifications consequent of a deep H5 cyclone 
over central Ontario, first on Wednesday then again Thursday night
into Friday. Each of these waves could feature weak surface 
frontal intrusions into a relatively moist and conditionally 
unstable airmass (depending on eventual fropa timing). Therefore, 
pops will comply with high chances featured on Wednesday, lower on
Thursday, slightly elevated again on Friday.

Temperatures through the period will kick off nearly a category 
below normal levels on Sunday, before a gradual warming trend 
prevails through the remainder of the week.  Temperatures should 
return to near/above normal levels by midweek.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...

Current radar imagery indicates isolated to scattered showers/storms 
across the forecast area. Best coverage, as predicted, has been 
across the higher elevations along the TN/NC line. With daytime 
heating, SBCAPE values are up into the 1500-2000 J/Kg range. Upper 
level flow is around 10-15 kts making deep layer shear values 
extremely low. Moisture remains plentiful with PW values around the 
75th percentile for early August. In the upper levels, there is a 
trough axis that stretches across the forecast area. At the surface, 
still seeing a hint of an inverted trough near the Cumberland 
Plateau. Overall, not much forcing with a typical summer pattern. 
There could be a few stronger storms with heavy rainfall, gusty 
winds, and small hail being the main threats. Flash flood guidance 
values are lowest near the Tri-Cities area into southwest Virginia 
with 3-hr values around 1.5 inches. Therefore, will have to pay 
extra close attention to the potential for localized flooding in 
these locations. Expect convection will come to an end near sunset 
with the loss of daytime heating. Patchy fog will develop overnight 
and the coverage will depend on how widespread the showers/storms 
are this afternoon and evening. For now, have introduced fog to the 
forecast mainly near area rivers and lakes. Overnight lows will be 
near climatology across the area in the mid 60s to low 70s.

The trough axis will slowly drift to the southeast throughout the 
short-term forecast period. Current water vapor imagery indicates 
dry air in the mid to upper levels across middle and west Tennessee. 
PW values will drop as the drier air aloft moves in from the west 
into the 1.2-1.5 inch range. These values are closer to or just 
below the 50th percentile for early August. Model soundings, 
especially from the NAM, indicate a decent dry layer aloft on 
Saturday afternoon. Due to this, have cut back on PoPs some and 
expect coverage of showers and storms will be less than today. 
Overall, looking at PoPs in the 20-30% range from most locations 
tomorrow afternoon. Highs will once again be near climatology in the 
mid to upper 80s for most locations. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...

Not a lot of change in the extended forecast. Overall, we remain in 
troughing pattern with high pressure to our west over the Four 
Corners states and a high to our east over Bermuda. Temperatures 
will be near normal with chances of rain on most days due to the 
lowered heights in place.

Saturday night into Sunday we have a weak cold front approaching 
from the north out of the Ohio River Valley. Highest POPs of the 
period (likely and high-end chance) occur on Sunday as the front 
settles across the area and provides a forcing mechanism for showers 
and storms. The frontal location on Monday should be centered along 
the spine of the Appalachians. The front, or what's left of it, 
slowly pushes eastward through the day and into Monday night. This 
gives us no POPs by Monday night as the front is far enough east to 
be of no influence.

Tuesday should be mostly dry as we are behind the front, expect for 
some diurnal showers and storms across the high terrain. Wednesday 
into Thursday the trough deepens as a shortwave dives down into the 
flow. This brings back chance POPs across the area. The main 
shortwave exits to our east Thursday night into Friday but a weak 
secondary wave will dive down into the trough base for Friday 
keeping slight chance POPs in for the forecast area.

.AVIATION...

VFR conditions currently across the terminals with a few isolated
showers/storms across the area. For now, went ahead and kept VCTS
in the terminals throughout the afternoon and evening. Confidence
is not overly high in the coverage of precipitation and think
lowest probabilities for VCTS would be at CHA. Convection should
come to an end after sunset with dry conditions overnight. The
coverage of fog will depend on the coverage of showers/storms this
afternoon. For now, have introduced MVFR fog at TRI near sunrise.
Otherwise, expect conditions will remain VFR.

.DISCUSSION...

Water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate a trough
that stretches from the Great Lakes southward into the Tennessee
Valley into the northern Gulf of Mexico. At the surface, there is
an inverted trough located just to the west of the Cumberland 
Plateau. PW values across the area are around the 75th percentile 
or so for early August. Overall, looking at weak synoptic forcing 
and expect convective initiation will take place first over the 
higher elevations of the southern Appalachians over the next 
couple of hours with scattered coverage in the valley later this 
afternoon. With a typical summer-time atmosphere, shear values are
very low with SBCAPE values around 1500 J/Kg later this 
afternoon. Therefore, expect a few strong storms with gusty winds 
and small hail will be possible. Localized flash flooding will be 
an issue with any heavy downpour. Flash Flood Guidance is lowest 
near the Tri-Cities into SW VA. Highs will be near climatology for
early August with most locations climbing into the mid to upper 
80s.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Water vapor analysis depicts a large anticyclone across the 
desert southwest, while troughing is stalled out across much of 
the eastern US. Further west, ridging was noted across much of the
western Atlantic. At the surface, a weak boundary that allowed 
convection to initiate this afternoon will move very little 
through the night and continue to wash out. The rest of the night 
will feature a decreasing trend in areal coverage of showers and 
thunderstorms. Areas that received rainfall will likely see some 
fog by morning.

Today, an inverted surface trough will be located across the 
Tennessee river valley into the Ohio valley. Aloft, the trough 
axis will continue to be directly overhead the MRX forecast area. 
Coverage of showers and thunderstorms will gradually increase by 
late morning/early afternoon in an environment characterized by 
increasing CAPE and moisture. The RAP and Consshort both paint a 
similar picture in regards to convective coverage and will lean 
heavily towards a blend of these two. Point forecast soundings 
depict MLCAPE values near 1500-2000 j/kg with limited CINH. DCAPE 
will also increase upwards of 750-1000 j/kg in the afternoon which
will likely contribute to strong/gusty winds in any strong 
storms. Heavy rain and localized flash flooding will also be a 
threat with PW values near 1.5 inches, a deep warm cloud layer, 
and weak cloud bearing winds. Both threats will be included into 
the HWO.

Coverage of SHRA/TSRA will gradually decrease into Friday evening
with areas of fog possible in those locations that receive rain
this afternoon. Overnight lows should be mild in the upper 60s to
low 70s. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...

The extended range fcst kicks off on Saturday morning amidst low 
amplitude troughing across the eastern CONUS while subtropical 
ridging prevails over the western Atlantic and a broad H5 
anticyclone dominates across the Four Corners.  Meanwhile at the 
surface, weak troughing if favored over the Southern Appalachians 
while a progressive surface ridge and leading cold front dive 
through the OH valley approaching the TN valley.  Pattern evolution 
through the period features little change overall aloft as the large 
anticyclone and subtropical ridges hold, while the eastern CONUS 
longwave trough amplifies slightly.  The primary weather focus 
through the period will be the slow intrusion of the aforementioned 
cold front on Saturday into Sunday, possibly stalling nearby or 
overhead. Either way, the parent surface ridge looks to anchor over 
the Corn Belt region through the weekend and into the start of the 
new work week before slowly shifting east and weakening into 
midweek.  By mid/late week another cold front looks to slide 
southeast across the Upper Midwest and into the OH/TN valley region 
Wednesday into Thursday.  All in all, this rather stagnant upper 
pattern and minimal surface features will result in mostly diurnally 
favored convection each afternoon, with chances looking highest on 
Sunday given the introduction of the front.  Temperatures will kick 
off near or slightly below normal levels through the weekend, with a 
gradual warming trend favored through the remainder of the period to 
slightly above normal levels.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
Longwave upper-level troughing will continue tonight and Friday 
across the region with a similar pattern in place. As showers and 
thunderstorms decrease in coverage this evening with the loss of 
daytime heating, we will have a clearing sky. Areas that received 
rain this evening and river valleys are likely to experience some
fog by Friday morning. Overnight lows should be near seasonal 
normals.

Morning fog will dissipate midmorning with increasing convective 
mixing and cumulus development along the higher elevations by 
midday. Once again, highest PoPs will be along the higher
elevations of the mountains and the Cumberland Plateau. MLCAPE
should be near 1000 J/kg and effective bulk shear will be
approximately 10 to 20 kt. This will again favor mostly pulse
convection with a few localized downbursts possible. Moisture will
be increasing with PW values near 1.7 inch, so a few heavy
downpours will be possible. Temperatures are expected to be within
a few degrees of normal.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
A blocking pattern with strong ridges over the desert SW and the 
western Atlantic will maintain a broad trough over the eastern 
Conus through the weekend. The pattern that we have seen for the 
past few days of scattered afternoon showers and t'storms mainly 
initiating in the Plateau and mountains will continue into 
Saturday. 

A slight change to the pattern is expected to arrive Saturday night 
when a shortwave trough drops southeast from the MO Valley to AR. A 
midlevel deformation zone develops over the TN Valley/Srn 
Appalachians that will enhance lift as a southerly low-to-midlevel 
flow strengthens. PW values rise to near 2 inches by Sunday morning, 
so heavy rainfall may be possible at times. The slow movement of the 
trough suggests this heavy rain potential may continue all day on 
Sunday. However, there is still uncertainty with this system as 
models are not all in agreement. The NAM and GFS agree on the wet 
scenario, while the ECMWF and SREF are much drier, showing a less 
amplified trough that keeps deep moisture to our south. For this 
package, will raise PoPs to likely for most of the area, except SW 
VA, and will add a mention of heavy rain/localized flooding 
potential to the HWO. 

The broad trough begins to make some eastward progress on Monday, 
which will begin a start of lowering rain chances through the rest 
of the forecast. PoPs will remain in the chance range on Monday with 
the trough axis overhead, but lower to a slight chance Tuesday as it 
moves east of the Appalachians. Through Wednesday and Thursday, we 
will have a NW flow aloft that should result in little if any rain 
chances both days and near normal temperatures.

.DISCUSSION...
Upper trough axis remains across the Tennessee Valley today with
some weak boundary layer convergence east of the trough axis
near the Cumberland Plateau. Afternoon convection is expected 
again today with greatest coverage across the higher elevations 
and also the southern valley where low-level moisture and 
instability is highest around 2000 J/Kg. Effective bulk shear 
remains weak, generally 10 to 20 kt, so pulse convection should be
the primary convective mode. Main hazard with these thunderstorms
is expected to be isolated downburst winds. Some thunderstorms 
may have some localized damaging downburst winds with DCAPE of 900
to 1200 J/Kg this afternoon. Excessive rainfall risk remains low 
with PW values near normal for this time of year, but may still 
have some localized flooding in poor drainage and urban areas with
the heaviest downpours. Patchy fog is expected again tonight, 
especially in those locations that receive rainfall this evening.

Forecast is progressing as expected, so made minor adjustments to
hourly parameters to reflect current observations and trends.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...The upper level trough over the 
region will move little during the short term period. Model 
soundings indicate CAPE values will reach 1500 to 2000 J/Kg across 
much of the area this afternoon, and expect another round of showers 
and thunderstorms which will likely initiate over the higher terrain 
first before spreading into valley areas. While shear will be weak, 
DCAPE values in the 750 to 1000+ range are favorable for some strong 
storms once again with strong gusty winds, and will keep mention of 
this in the HWO along with the potential for localized flooding. 
Expect the convection to wane this evening as we lose solar heating, 
with the latter part of the night forecast to be precip free. 
Temperatures will be near normal for this time of year.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...Not many changes from 
the previous forecast in the longterm. The area will be dominated 
by large scale troughing as ridging sits across the southwest and 
the western Atlantic. This blocking pattern will hold through the 
extended period before the eastern US trough finally moves 
eastward in response to rising heights from the west. Diurnal 
convection can be expected this weekend with the best chances 
across far east Tennessee, SW NC, and SW VA. While organized 
severe weather is not expected, any strong storms could transfer 
enough mass to cause strong/gusty winds. Also, efficient warm rain
process with deep warm cloud layers, and weak 850-300mb winds 
means that heavy rain and localized flash flooding could occur 
with any storm that moves slowly over areas that have received 
recent rains.

On Sunday, southern stream energy in the base of the longwave trough 
will move northward into the southern Appalachians increasing 
forcing for ascent. This will ultimately mean an increase in coverage 
of precipitation can be expected mainly in the afternoon and evening 
hours. Temperatures on Sunday may be a few degrees cooler given the 
increased cloud cover and precipitation and as a result did decrease 
max T's a couple of degrees which was still above MEX guidance.

Next week, the trough will still be situated across the southern 
Appalachians, and Tennessee valley. High pressure to the northwest 
will slowly nudge south as lower pressure remains well to the east. 
Afternoon convection will again be possible Monday through Wednesday 
with the better chances in far eastern TN, SW NC, and SW NC. Chances 
will be less further north and west due to subsidence from high 
pressure. Closer to the end of the extended, the upper level pattern 
becomes less amplified as the ridge flattens out, and shortwave 
energy moves out of Canada into the Great Lakes. This will push the 
eastern US trough east which should lead to decreased chances of 
precipitation. Temperatures should be near normal.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Upper and mid-level trough axis remains across the area tonight 
and Thursday with some ridging and subsidence building in on the 
west side of this axis. Expect convective activity to decrease 
quickly after sunset with the loss of daytime heating. Areas that 
receive rainfall this evening and have a clearing sky will likely 
see some areas of fog late tonight and Thursday morning. This 
seems most likely across western portions of the forecast area and
the Sequatchie Valley where mid-level subsidence and drying will 
be most pronounced. Further east, questions exist about the extent
of a mid-level cloud deck late tonight and early Thursday which 
could inhibit fog like the past few mornings.

Longwave troughing remains across the forecast area on Thursday. 
The GFS, NAM, and ECMWF all show a small shortwave dropping 
southeastward through the upper-level NW flow toward the region 
Thursday afternoon. This should allow for an increase in afternoon
thunderstorms along and east of the trough axis across much of 
the area. Lower PoPs are expected across the far NW portions of 
the forecast area where subsidence will be stronger; however, will
keep chance PoPs for these areas due to the uncertainty of exact 
placement of the trough axis and because of higher elevations 
aiding thunderstorms coverage along the northern Cumberland 
Plateau. HREF places MLCAPE between 1500 and 2000 J/Kg across the 
valley and eastern mountains with lower values near 1000 J/Kg 
across the northern Cumberland Plateau. Deep layer shear remains 
weak near 10 to 20 kt which will favor primarily ordinary pulse 
convection. Localized severe downburst winds appear probable with 
DCAPE of 1100 to 1300 J/Kg across much of the forecast area. PW 
values of 1.3 to 1.6 inches are not anomalous for this time of 
year, so any excessive rain threat appears low. Any localized 
flash flood risk would be primarily across regions with low FFG 
near urban areas and would be aided by slow movement of 
thunderstorms. Thunderstorm activity should quickly diminish after
sunset as instability decreases with the loss of daytime heating 
and weak subsidence in the wake of the departing shortwave trough.


.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
There will be little change in the large scale pattern across the
country through the long term period as a large high pressure 
ridge over the Southwest and another ridge over the western 
Atlantic will result in a blocking pattern and a broad trough over
the eastern US. The clockwise flow around the Atlantic ridge will
supply deep moisture to the Carolinas and Southern Appalachians, 
with our area on the western edge. With this pattern we can expect
to see mainly scattered diurnal showers and thunderstorms each 
day, with the highest chances in the mountains along the NC border
and the lowest chances along the Plateau. One period of enhanced 
rain chances appears to be on Sunday afternoon as a shortwave 
trough moves through the larger trough, providing a little better 
synoptic lift and drawing the deep moisture farther north and 
west. Some slight eastward progression of the longwave trough may 
occur on Tuesday and Wednesday, and with the models showing the 
trough axis to our east, PoPs will be lowered to slight chances 
those days.

.AVIATION...
VCTS expected this afternoon at each TAF site with VFR predominant
flight conditions. May have some brief MVFR or IFR vis with 
heaviest localized downpours this afternoon. Chances of
thunderstorms quickly decrease after 0z this evening with fog
possible at sites that receive rainfall late this afternoon. Only
included fog at TRI, and did not include vis as low as guidance 
suggests, since guidance has been including significantly lower
vis than has been observed with this pattern during the past
couple nights. However, believe that if TYS or CHA does experience
rainfall later this evening, chances of at least MVFR fog will 
increase at these sites with a clearing sky tonight.

.DISCUSSION...
12z RAOBs and WV imagery places an upper trough axis across the 
region this morning with a weak front across the Ohio Valley. With
colder air aloft and a clearing sky this morning, expect
instability to increase through the afternoon with the HREF 
showing approximately 2000 J/Kg across most locations. With dry 
air aloft and a deeply mixed layer below the LCL, the environment 
will be favorable for some locally strong downburst winds with the
strongest thunderstorms. With PW values closer to normal for this
time of year, between 1.4 and 1.7 inch, do not expect an elevated
flash flood risk. Weak deep layer shear, approximately 10 kt or 
less, will limit thunderstorm organization and favor ordinary 
pulse convection.

With weak low-level forcing across the forecast area, believe 
that mesoscale forcing along the higher terrain and any outflow 
boundaries will be the predominant location for scattered afternoon
convection.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...The upper level trough over the 
region will gradually de-amplify, but will move little during the 
short term period. The slowly approaching weak cold front will 
stall near the Cumberland Plateau. Expect another round of showers
and thunderstorms especially this afternoon. While shear will be 
quite weak, enough instability and DCAPE are indicated for a few 
strong storms, so will keep this mention in the HWO. The main 
threats will be strong gusty winds and the possibility of 
localized flooding. The convection will wane during the evening 
hours with the latter part of the night expected to be rain free. 
A MAV/MET blend generally looks reasonable for temperatures.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...The extended period will be characterized by persistence with 
a large anticyclone over the southwest, troughing across much of the 
east coast, and subtropical ridging across the western Atlantic. By 
12Z Thursday, a frontal boundary will have shifted well to the east 
of the Appalachians with high pressure anchored across the Great 
Lakes. This will result in subsidence to the north, and better 
moisture and ascent further south and east. Diurnal convection will 
be possible each day late this week and into this weekend with 
highest PoPs in the afternoon before coverage wanes in the evening 
and overnight. Subsidence to the north could keep some areas dry 
especially across northern and western portions of the forecast 
area. The forecast results in highest PoPs across far E TN/SW VA/SW 
NC where higher moisture resides, and differential heating will 
become maximized. While organized severe weather looks very low, a 
couple of strong thunderstorms cannot be ruled out. Temperatures 
during this period should remain near climatological values. 

Early next week, northern stream energy will move out of southern 
Canada and into the Great Lakes. This should result in shifting the 
eastern trough further east resulting in northwest flow aloft across 
the area. Chance PoPs will be advertised each day early next week 
with afternoon diurnal convection a possibility. Again, better 
chances will still be across eastern portions of the forecast area. 
Temperatures during this time period will be near average.

.DISCUSSION...
For the most part, convection continues to slowly wind down 
across the region with a few cells still traversing into/through
extreme southwest VA producing moderate/heavy rainfall and
possibly some isolated flooding. Earlier rainfall that prompted
the Flash Flood Warning across Washington County VA has exited,
leaving nearly 3-4 inches of rainfall behind.  All in all, 
guidance favors further degradation of coverage with loss of 
heating into the late evening and overnight hours. That said, 
given the position of the upper trough, mid level lapse rates will
provide at least some MUCAPE over the next 4-6 hours. Thus, 
slowed the previous lowering trend of pops, however still dry by 
1-2AM. Otherwise, am expecting most low debris clouds to sct with 
time as well, leaving only mid/upper clouds through the night. 
With that, dewpoints didn't mix out all that well today, which 
combined with earlier rainfall and a decoupling PBL could lead to 
patchy fog across the region. Also wouldn't be suprised to see 
isolate areas of dense fog, mainly closer to large water bodies 
and in the river valleys. Beyond that, no sig changes needed/made.

A mixture of VFR/MVFR and possibly IFR during this taf cycle at
all sites, however chances are best at CHA/TRI. Convection
continues to slowly wind down across the region thus opted to
initialize all sites dry. Given weak mixing of dewpoints today as
well as sct/num showers, guidance tends to favor fog restrictions
at CHA/TRI, therefore IFR restrictions were mentioned in both 
tafs, with guidance being less favorable at TYS thus only a MVFR tempo
was included. Otherwise, expect another day similar to that of 
today on Wednesday with VCTS and TSRA prob30s to prevail late in 
the period during the afternoon hours amidst light swly winds, 
unless adjacent to any strong storms where gusting is possible.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...
The afternoon saw partly to mostly cloudy skies across the
forecast area. Only a few showers had developed in the morning but
scattered showers and storms developed early in the afternoon
especially across extreme southern Tennessee Valley and southwest
North Carolina with high winds in the Chattanooga area at 2 pm.
The storms developed ahead of a weak cold front now located 
across extreme west Tennessee and western Kentucky. This front 
will move slowly east southeast tonight in association with an 
upper trough and by late Wednesday possibly make it into the 
eastern Tennessee Valley. The showers and storms late today and 
tonight could still become strong and produce locally gusty winds 
and isolated flooding due to high precipitable water values and 
slow movements. Expect skies to clear during the evening with 
patchy fog forming that might become dense in places where heavy 
rain fell. Wednesday conditions will be similar to today with a 
few strong to severe storms in the afternoon and locally heavy 
rainfall causing local flooding problems. Highs Wednesday should 
be similar to today, although slightly cooler in northeast 
sections where there should be more storm coverage earlier in the 
day.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
The extended will be characterized by a persistent upper trough 
across the Eastern CONUS with the trough axis located near or across 
our region. Near the base of this trough, an area of low pressure 
may attempt to develop along the northern Gulf Coast near LA/MS/AL. 
A surface front will be near the TN/NC border with drier air and 
subsidence to the W/NW of this front.

There is considerable disagreement in numerical guidance for this 
weekend and into early next week with regard to the position of this 
front and the development and track of the low pressure across the 
Gulf Coast. For these reasons, forecast uncertainty is higher than 
normal for the weekend through early next week. Precipitation 
chances will greatly depend on the exact placement of the surface 
front and trough axis. While the GFS and ECMWF place the trough axis 
near or west of our forecast area, the Canadian places it across 
western NC. The common agreement is that highest moisture, 
instability, and PoPs are expected to be across far E TN/SW VA/SW NC 
with lower PoPs to the W/NW where subsidence is stronger. Some 
patchy fog will be possible in the normal spots that received 
precipitation the previous day or are near river valleys each night. 
Temperatures are expected to be within a few degrees of normal for 
this time of year as the weak trough remains across the area.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...The upper level trough axis 
to our west will shift east over our area during the short term 
period. The weak cold front will draw closer but will likely stall
near our western border. Expect mainly scattered convection to 
develop across the area today with the peak activity this 
afternoon/early evening before waning. Do expect more coverage 
than the past couple of days, but given the weak flow, minimal 
shear, and modest CAPE the storms should mainly be pulse in 
nature. Will generally go close to a MAV/MET blend for 
temperatures.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...By 12Z Wednesday, the 
synoptic configuration will consist of ridging across the 
southwest, troughing from Quebec southward into the Tennessee 
valley, and subtropical ridging across the western Atlantic. At 
the surface, a boundary will be aligned just to the east of the 
spine of the Appalachians with surface ridging across the Great 
Lakes. This pattern will persist through much of the extended. 
Diurnally driven convection can be expected each day in the 
extended period with the best chances along the higher terrain 
where differential heating becomes maximized. Flow will be weak so
do not expect much in the way of organized storms but damaging 
winds are possible with any stronger thunderstorms. Some minor 
differences become apparent in NWP after the weekend in regards to
how amplified the pattern becomes as well as the movement of the 
southern stream component in the eastern US trough. The GFS brings
this southern stream component northward into the southern 
Appalachians while the ECMWF keeps a weaker regime with its 
southern component further south across the GoM. Would expect to 
see an increase in coverage of precipitation early next week as 
low to mid layer moisture begins to increase and the forecast 
reflects this. Temperatures should stay near to slightly below 
average through the extended period.

Convection continues to wind down across the TN Valley and
Southern Appalachian region tonight, all while a cold front
approaches the OH/MS valley and a prefrontal trough moves across 
middle TN/KY. Per latest guidance, the front and trough axis are 
still progged to slide east on Tuesday, possibly slowing/stalling 
across the Plateau Tuesday night. Out ahead, falling heights aloft
combined with ample heating will favor sct/num showers and 
thunderstorms on Tuesday. As for the immediate near term, the fcst
looked pretty good as pops trend down and winds weaken with loss 
of mixing. Did tweak t/td slightly to align with recent obs, with 
no other changes needed/made. Regarding any overnight fog, think 
it should be fairly isolated and confined to areas that received 
earlier rainfall, as well as adjacent to any river valleys.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
Showers (and a few thunderstorms) have begun to form along the 
higher terrain across the area. Expect storms to continue through 
the rest of the afternoon and into the evening hours before 
diminishing with the setting sun. Storm motions are very slow, so 
there's the possibilty of isolated flooding if a storm remains 
stationary over a poorly draining location. Could see some isolated 
fog in the morning over areas that get rain this afternoon, but 
temperatures should be a few degrees warmer tomorrow morning, 
compared to yesterday morning so not expecting widespread fog.

Tomorrow the front that is currently across western TN/KY will 
continue to move toward the Eastern Tennessee Valley. Front will 
keep losing momentum as it travels southeastward as the upper level 
support continues to move off to the northeast. Expect the front to 
hold up somewhere near Middle TN, and for showers to increase in 
coverage late tomorrow morning into the afternoon. With front to aid 
in convection expect more widespread coverage of storms tomorrow. 
Forecast soundings indicate that there will be little shear and CAPE 
to work with so expect more typical summer convection, with just 
more widespread coverage.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...
A weak cold front moving into the Western Tennessee and Ohio Valleys 
Tuesday night into Wednesday will help to increase showers and 
thunderstorms across the forecast area during the afternoon and 
early evening hours through Thursday. The best chance of 
precipitation will be Wednesday with high chance to likely rain 
chances in the afternoon and early evening. Upper trough moves into 
the eastern Tennessee Valley by Wednesday too. The front should move 
just to the crest of the Appalachians or east of the mountains by 
Thursday. Less chances for storms Thursday and Friday except along 
the TN/NC borders. High pressure ridge to the west and the Bermuda 
high to the east and southeast will keep the trough in place and the 
front in the vicinity of the southern Appalachians. The front should 
weaken and be hard to pick out by Friday. The overall pattern will 
remain unchanged over the weekend and Monday with the weak upper 
trough overhead and so keeping diurnal chance pops each day. A few 
storms may become strong but overall severe threat is small through 
the extended forecast. Temperatures will remain near normal.

.AVIATION...
Thunderstorms expected in the area this afternoon, with best
chances of it impacting an airport at KCHA. Could impact,
KTYS/KTRI but chances look much lower. Could see fog once again
early tomorrow morning, but a lot of it will depend on if a storm
is able to produce rain at an airport, so will likely need to wait
till later TAF issuances to add in fog if necessary.

.AVIATION...Main aviation concern will be convection development
this afternoon into early evening. Right now isolated to perhaps 
scattered afternoon/early evening convection looks most likely 
around CHA and TYS, so will include VCTS both sites. Fog
development cannot be ruled out late in the period especially at 
TRI, but probability of occurrence looks to low to include for
now.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Weak surface high pressure over 
the region will drift east, and the low amplitude upper ridge will 
begin breaking down as an upper trough approaches.  Expect 
convective development to be similar to yesterday, with perhaps a 
bit more coverage.  Given weak flow and minimal shear, the 
convection is expected to be mainly pulse in nature. The convection 
will wane this evening, but we may see some additional convection 
moving into western portions of the area late as the upper trough 
approaches.  High temperatures today should be similar to 
yesterday's highs in most locations.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...After High pressure has 
dominated over the past several days, an unsettled long term 
period lies ahead as a weak cold front approaches and stalls over 
the area as we have high pressure to our west and east creating a 
weak blocking pattern.

Tuesday morning, models show the front back across West TN. Models 
in decent agreement that the front doesn't move into our area until 
sometime in the afternoon/evening hours. Ahead of the front, 
scattered showers and storms expected but higher POPs (high-end 
chance and likelys) in place as the front moves in. The atmospheric 
flow accompanying the trough is pretty weak so don't expect any 
organized storms. Storms will be more of the pulse variety. Can't 
rule out an isolated damaging wind gust with any of these storms if 
they become strong enough. Higher POPs fade through the night on 
Tuesday as we lose our heating but will keep at least slight chance 
in through the night.

As mentioned, high pressure to our west and east creates a weak 
blocking pattern and doesn't allow the trough and front to advance 
very far eastward on Wednesday. With the front still draped across 
the area, another day of high-end and likely POPs will be in store 
with pulse convection during the afternoon and evening with 
a possible isolated damaging wind gust.

Thursday the trough is able to nudge the Bermuda high east which 
allows the front to move over into the Carolinas. This will reduce 
POPs across our area compared to Tuesday/Wednesday. The front washes 
out Thursday night/Friday but we remain in a broad troughing pattern 
with the high still to our west and east. We remain in this pattern 
through the rest of the extended. With lowered heights and a few 
waves of energy diving down through the trough, chance POPs will be 
in place each afternoon from Thursday through Sunday with POPs 
lowering during the overnight hours. Flow remains weak during this 
time so storms will continue to be of the pulse variety. A few 
isolated damaging wind gusts possible each afternoon with any 
stronger storms. Temperatures will be near normal through the
period.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

Isolated diurnal convection has been developing this afternoon along 
the higher terrain of the plateau and eastern mountains. This 
activity will peak in the 20-23Z timeframe. The surface high remains 
just east of the Appalachians with flat riding aloft. This is 
resulting in a very weak flow regime where the convective cells are 
nearly stationary. Brief downpours will occur under any 
thunderstorms this afternoon due to the increasingly moist profile, 
but there will not be any severe weather since there is no shear.
 
Any remaining showers will dissipate by 03Z with loss of heating, 
and expect another clear night as high pressure surface and aloft 
stays in control. Similar to the past few nights, patchy fog will 
develop in protected river valleys. Soundings suggest that this will 
most likely begin after 06Z when temp and dew point spreads begin to 
decrease below the low-level inversion. Patchy fog is also possible 
in areas that saw rain Sunday evening. Once again used the slightly 
cooler MET guidance for lows which will bring low/mid 60's from the 
central and northern valley through northeast TN and southwest VA 
and mid to upper 60's along the plateau and southern valley.

The surface high finally moves off the mid Atlantic coast Monday 
with mid level shortwave ridging steepening over the Tennessee 
Valley in response to a mid level shortwave trough and weak cold 
front moving through the Mississippi Valley. This will yield deeper 
southerly flow with dew points finally increasing to 65-70 in many 
areas. Plenty of sunshine continuing along with this stronger warm 
air advection will cause an uncomfortably hot and humid day with low 
90's more widespread. A moderately unstable atmosphere characterized 
by MUCAPE of 1500-2200 J/Kg, surface based LI's of -4 to -6, and a 
lack of capping will allow for decent coverage of diurnal convection 
in the afternoon and evening. Have chance to slight chance pops from 
late morning through the evening with the highest pops on the 
plateau and eastern mountains. PWATs will be increasing to close to 
1.50 inches, so locally heavy downpours will occur. Once again, 
there will be very little shear, so severe weather is not expected. 
However, cannot rule out an isolated strong wind gust since DCAPES 
will be 600-1000 J/Kg.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...

Another round of isolated afternoon convection is expected on 
Tuesday as the upper level trough and cold front continues to 
approach the area. Highest chances for rain this forecast will come 
on Tuesday/Wednesday as the front moves into the area before 
eventually stalling out. Forecast models are currently indicating 
that the from will stall out somewhere near the TN/KY borders. 
Forecast soundings show that there will be limited instability and 
shear to work with, so at this time severe weather threat looks 
pretty low. Can't rule out a brief storm pulsing up to be strong, 
and causing gusty winds and brief heavy rainfall, but widespread 
severe weather is not expected at this time.

The front will slowly wash out over the area leading to more spotty 
coverage of afternoon showers and thunderstorms. Will continue to 
have relatively moist air over us as Gulf moisture is brought up on 
the West side of the ridge. Models begin to diverge as we head 
through the weekend with the ECMWF wanting to dive a upper level low 
out of the Mid west towards the forecast area while the GFS 
maintains a weaker and broader trough. Will keep an eye on this 
system as it looks to be the next best chance of rain outside of 
Tuesday/Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

If you paid attention to yesterday's weather, you can pretty much 
expect a repeat for today. High pressure remains in control and is 
still centered over the southern Appalachians/southeastern U.S. 
Highs for today will again top out in the mid to upper 80s, which is 
near normal for this time of year. A few afternoon showers along 
with a storm or two possible across the high terrain of the 
Cumberland Plateau and eastern mountains but most areas will remain 
dry.

Any shower or storm quickly falls apart during the evening as we 
lose heating. Clouds will clear and overnight lows will dip down 
into the low to mid 60s, which is still a degree or two below 
normal. Some patchy river fog across our northern areas is expected 
once again.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...

Models are in decent agreement with the overall pattern, although
there are some differences in the details. Forecast confidence 
level is about average for this time of year. Surface high 
pressure will be over the region to start but the low amplitude 
upper level ridge will be weakening. Model soundings look rather 
dry for much of the valley, but some mainly isolated convection 
will likely form, mainly over the higher terrain and south. By 
Tuesday an upper level tough will be moving into the region, and a
weak cold front will be approaching from the north/northwest. 
This upper trough will linger over the eastern US for the 
remainder of the period, but will be weakening. The cold front 
will stall over or near our northern border, and it will then 
weaken as well. 

Best chances for convection are expected to be Tuesday and Wednesday 
as this trough and front approach and move into the the region, and 
then will keep chances of convection going for the remainder of the 
period as no significant drying is expected and what remains of the 
frontal boundary will be nearby.  As always with thunderstorms, some 
may produce at least brief torrential rainfall. However, at this 
time the risk of significant flooding looks low. In addition, the 
flow is expected to be weak with weak shear and convective energy 
generally looks moderate at best, so the risk of severe storms looks 
relatively low as well for the period.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

A few diurnal showers have developed this afternoon on the higher 
terrain of the Cumberland Plateau in response to slowly increasing 
dew points and weak upslope flow since the surface high has moved a 
little east of the Appalachians. Soundings are still fairly dry 
which is helping to keep the activity isolated, and not currently 
detecting any lightning in these showers. These will quickly fade 
away this evening as daytime heating decreases, so expect all areas 
to be dry by 01Z.

The surface high will remain just east of the southern Appalachian 
region tonight allowing for clear skies and another decent 
radiational cooling night as winds go mostly calm. The slightly 
higher dew points will keep temps a few degrees warmer than last 
night, but still went with the cooler MET guidance for lows. This 
yields low/mid 60's from the plateau and central valley through 
northeast TN and southwest VA with mid/upper 60's in the southern 
valley. Projected soundings once again show low level saturation 
below the inversion in the pre dawn hours as temps fall close to dew 
points, mainly from the central and northern valley through 
northeast TN and southwest VA, so added patchy fog in these areas 
between 06 and 13Z.

Expect a rapid rise in temps Sunday under mainly sunny skies and 
somewhat deeper southerly flow as the surface high moves toward the 
mid Atlantic coast and heights rise aloft. This will continue the 
trend of slowly rising dew points, so afternoon showers/storms will 
be a little more numerous in the higher elevations of the plateau 
and eastern mountains. Soundings certainly suggest this as a better 
moisture profile looks to be in place with PWAT values increasing to 
1.30-1.35 inches and afternoon MUCAPE of 1500-2500 J/Kg. Have chance 
to slight chance pops in the higher terrain areas starting at 17Z. 
Highs will be near the seasonal averages for late July of upper 
80's/low 90's.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

Weak or flat ridge that extends west into the desert southwest 
strengthens even more Sunday night and Monday which induces a NW 
flow to develop over the region late Monday. Surface high pressure 
still in control over the southeast states Sunday night into Monday 
night will keep the area in a mostly sunny to partly cloudy pattern 
with only isolated to widely scattered showers and thunderstorms 
across the eastern part of the forecast area. Monday with the NW 
flow pattern developing a new upper trough will move into the 
Mississippi Valley Monday and drag a cold front towards the eastern 
Tennessee Valley Tuesday. Rain chances increase from NW to SE 
Tuesday ahead of this front. The cold front gets hung up over or 
just north of the southern Appalachians Wednesday through Friday as 
the western ridge and a strengthening Bermuda high to the east keep 
it in place. The highest rain chances will be Tuesday western 
sections and Wednesday and Thursday eastern sections. Friday and 
Saturday it will be hard to pick out the front but the weak upper 
trough will still lie over the forecast area with daily mainly 
diurnal chances for afternoon and early evening showers and 
thunderstorms. Temperatures will be near normal for this time of 
year. No significant rainfall expected until Tuesday afternoon. Late 
Tuesday through Wednesday there may be brief periods of heavy 
rainfall but not expected to cause any flooding problems at this 
time.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Little change during this short term period. Some light river fog
showing up at the current hour in a few isolated areas north of 
I-40 but most areas are clear. Fog will quickly burn off as the 
sun rises.
 
Remnants of the trough finally exiting to the northeast today as an 
upper trough swinging through Ontario helps to move it along. 
Surface high up through 700mb still present and is centered right 
over the southern Appalachians this afternoon. Due to the expected 
location of the high, we will see some weak upslope flow on our side 
of the mountains from the surface up through 850mb. This may be 
enough to set off a shower or two along with an isolated storm this 
afternoon. However, confidence is on the low side again as we just 
don't have quite enough moisture yet.

Highs will be a degree or two warmer, giving us near normal 
temperatures across most areas. Expect similar sky conditions this 
afternoon compared to yesterday with fewer clouds across the valley 
with a weak CU field developing across the terrain of the Cumberland 
Plateau and eastern mountains by early afternoon. Skies clear this 
evening as we lose our heating and overnight lows will fall into the 
lower to mid 60s, which is still a few degrees below normal. Some 
light river fog possible again overnight across our northern areas 
(northern TN valley, northeast TN, southwest VA).

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...

H5 Ridge of high pressure stays fairly flat Sunday across the 
southern half of the nation, allowing only diurnal higher terrain 
isolated convection across our forecast area. By Monday, that ridge 
will be strengthening over the Four Corners area, inducing a NW flow 
over the MS and OH Valleys. This flow will push a cool front into 
our area Tuesday, with increases in convection and some locally 
heavy precip. By midweek, the strength of the Four Corners high 
pressure, and the presence of the Bermuda High offshore, will force 
weak troughing over our area to persist, which will be in tandem 
with our cool front stalling out in the vicinity of the Appalachians.
Therefore, isolated to scattered diurnal convection will resume 
Wed-Fri.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...

Remnants of the Northeast U.S. upper trough continue to keep the 
southern Appalachians in NW flow with surface high pressure holding 
steady just to our northeast. This will continue to allow for mainly 
clear skies and light winds tonight and Saturday. This is a good 
radiational cooling pattern, so sided with the slightly cooler MET 
guidance for lows tonight bringing widespread low/mid 60's. The only 
low confidence part of tonight's forecast is patchy fog potential. 
Temp and dew point cross overs do not suggest much fog, but 
soundings project some saturation in the lowest levels late tonight 
under the subsidence inversion as temps fall close to dew points. 
This combined with a persistent pattern the past couple of nights 
points toward patchy fog developing once again in the most protected 
river valleys, so included this in the forecast between 07 and 14Z. 

Any fog will quickly burn off Saturday morning with highs a few 
degrees warmer than today (85-90) as mid level heights rise to 
around 590 dam. The surface high shifting a bit farther eastward 
will allow for more of a southerly component to the surface flow, 
but dew points will only reach the low 60's, so conditions will 
remain tolerable. High resolution models suggest isolated 
showers/storms in the higher terrain during the afternoon and 
evening. Soundings are still pretty dry, so kept this limited to 
slight chance to chance pops with any activity quickly dissipating 
after 00Z.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...

Ridge of high pressure stays fairly flat Sunday and Monday across 
southeast Tennessee with surface high along the east coast. Isolated 
to widely scattered showers and storms will continue until another 
trough will move into the Ohio Valley Tuesday. This will increase 
the instability and moisture with a chance of showers and storms. A 
cold front will move into the forecast area Tuesday night into 
Wednesday. The large upper ridge will stay to the west of the 
Mississippi River Valley. Thursday and Friday the front moves to 
just southeast of the forecast area. The upper trough associated 
with the front will stay across the eastern states. There will still 
be a chance of showers and storms each afternoon mainly across the 
higher elevations along the eastern border with North Carolina. 
Temperatures will have warmed to near normal. Highs in the 80s to 
near 90 and lows in the 60s Sunday and Monday and mid 60s to around 
70 Tuesday through Friday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Weak remnants of the longwave trough sill showing up in the upper 
levels of the atmosphere from GA up through New England centered 
along the spine of the Appalachians. This is due to the blocking 
high across Bermuda. High pressure is in place from the surface up 
through roughly 700 mb. Very weak upslope flow at 850 mb, from the 
Carolina side, will develop a weak CU field over the eastern 
mountains today, similar to yesterday. With the surface high 
shifting a little further NE, we should see a return to a weak 
southerly flow by this afternoon instead of the northerly flow we've 
seen the past few days. This southerly flow will bring in slightly 
higher dewpoints and may be enough to support a shower or isolated 
storm across the high terrain. Confidence still on the low slide so 
only slight chance and low-end chance POPs in place during the 
afternoon hours across the eastern mountains. 

It will be slightly warmer today with highs in the mid to upper 80s. 
Tonight will be a little warmer as well but still pleasant for this 
time of year with lows ranging from near 60 to the mid 60s. Some 
river fog possible again late tonight but not as much due to the 
warmer overnight lows expected.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...

Flat H5 ridging across the southern U.S. will mark the weekend. 
Fairly warm temps and mostly isolated highland diurnal convection is 
expected. 

A shortwave trough will move east along the Canadian border from 
Vancouver Sat morning to near Winnipeg Mon morning. This trough will 
then deepen in tandem with the H5 ridge strengthening over the Four 
Corners, and as NW flow develops, this will push another cool front 
through our area during Tuesday. Dewpoints will be creeping upward 
Sunday through Tuesday, and so the front will be associated with 
scattered to numerous showers or tstms, and PWATs could support 
locally heavy rainfall. 

The front may get hung up near the Appalachians during midweek, and 
may help keep mostly diurnal convection in play for the remainder of 
the forecast.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
A mostly sunny day again today with even lower dew points across
the northern and central sections as a light north to northeast
wind brings in the drier airmass from the north. At mid afternoon
temperatures were a couple degrees warmer than Wednesday, in the
lower to mid 80s. Afternoon RH values were in the 30 to 40 percent
range which is very low for mid summer!. Cumulus clouds were a
little more numerous over the higher elevations but no convection.
Tonight will be another mostly clear night will some patchy fog
late. Expect less coverage than this morning. High pressure over
the Ohio Valley and extending south to the eastern Tennessee
Valley will shift to the mid Atlantic by tomorrow. With light
winds tonight temperatures will drop down into the mid 50s to
lower 60s, a degree or two warmer than todays lows. Friday with a
slight southerly flow developing across southern and western
sections temperatures warm a degree or two. The slight increase in
moisture and dew points will help to trigger a little more
instability and develop a few showers and storms in the higher
elevations along the border with North Carolina. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
A warming trend will be taking place this weekend as 500 mb 
heights rise to around 590 dam over the southern appalachians, but
the core of the significant mid level ridging (heat dome) will 
remain over the four corners region of the desert Southwest. This 
will keep our region in WNW flow aloft, so the warmer temps will 
be at seasonable levels with only a slow rise in dew points. 
Consensus of model guidance suggests spotty afternoon showers 
Saturday in the far east TN mountains and southwest VA. Soundings 
continue to look quite dry due to the surface high still nearby, 
so limited pops to slight chance with most areas staying mostly 
sunny. A slightly better opportunity to see a shower or 
thunderstorm will come Sunday afternoon as a very weak shortwave 
drops through the WNW mid to upper level flow. Soundings show a 
slight increase in mid level moisture associated with this 
feature, and stronger southerly surface flow will be developing as
the surface high moves off of the East coast leading to better 
low level moisture return and instability. Have slight chance to 
chance pops for the afternoon and evening, but any activity will 
quickly dissipate after sunset.

Southerly flow and warm air advection will really ramp up Monday 
ahead of a deepening upper trough and cold front to the NW, and this 
is when the upper 60's to low 70's surface dew points will finally 
return to the southern Appalachian region. Have chance pops for 
diurnally driven afternoon/evening convection, but the coverage will 
be much higher compared to the weekend. Scattered showers and 
thunderstorms will continue Monday night as the cold front slowly 
approaches from the west bringing increased forcing for ascent. This 
front will be very slow to cross east TN, southwest VA, and 
southwest NC Tuesday, so the greatest coverage of clouds, showers, 
and thunderstorms will occur at this time. It will remain very humid 
Tuesday, but high temps will be cooler than Monday due to the clouds 
and precipitation. Increased pops to high chance and likely for 
Tuesday. Early estimates project 1500-2000 J/Kg MUCAPE, decently 
high freezing levels, and PWAT values around 1.70 inches, so locally 
heavy rain could occur Tuesday under any heavier thunderstorms. 

The cold front will be essentially washing out and stalling near or 
just east of the region Tuesday night and Wednesday, so maintained 
chance pops with temps staying seasonable. The upper trough to the 
north should deepen just enough by Thursday to allow for some drier 
air, so reduced pops to slight chance Thursday afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Some fog is once again noted across the region this morning,
mainly confined to area lakes and river valleys. This will
dissipate shortly after daybreak, with dry and sunny conditions
prevailing through the day thanks to surface high pressure
being anchored to our north over Ohio.

Temperatures will be a tad warmer today, with highs in the mid 
80s stretching back north into the Tri Cities and southwest 
Virginia counties, and southern valley locales likely reaching 
into the mid and upper 80s. However, with a dry northerly flow
regime emanating from the surface high to our north, it will be a
rather comfortable summer day with low afternoon humidity.

Tonight will be another clear night. Expect another round of
patchy fog, but it should be limited in scope and mainly to
northern areas near the TN/VA border.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...

Little change with the long-term forecast. Quiet weather to start 
the period with returning precip chances toward the end of the 
period as a trough and front move through.  

Remnants of the upper trough still lingering over the area for Friday 
and Saturday at 500 to 300 mb but high pressure in place from the 
surface up through 850mb. Models still hinting at isolated terrain 
convection Friday and Saturday afternoon. Sounding profiles continue 
to look too dry but went ahead and left the Superblend output in the 
grids which yielded a slight chance POP for the high terrain 
Friday and Saturday afternoon. Temps in the low to upper 80s can 
be expected with lows in the low to upper 60s. 

On Sunday a weak vort max associated with a very weak shortwave at 
the 500 mb level moves from West TN down into AL/GA. This may 
produce a stray shower or isolated storm across the higher terrain 
areas but expect most areas to stay dry. On Monday the trough is 
approaching which gives us another slight chance POP for mainly the
terrain areas as southerly flow is increasing and brining in 
moisture. Most areas will stay dry though. The highest POPs still
come on Tuesday and Wednesday as the trough and weak front move 
in and through the area. Conditions more summer-like Tuesday and 
Wednesday as southerly flow brings dewpoints back up into the mid
to upper 60s with highs remaining in the mid to upper 80s.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
A pleasant late July day today with scattered cumulus clouds and
mid afternoon temperatures in the upper 70s to lower 80s and dew 
points in the 50s with upper 40s in southwest Virginia. High
pressure was still centered to the NW in MO/IL with low pressure
along the east coast. Upper trough axis along the Appalachians and
east Tennessee begins to shift slightly east of the mountains 
tonight with surface high pressure moving over the Ohio Valley. 
Strong northeast winds with pressure gradient over southeast 
Tennessee should decrease in the evening. Overall winds will be 
light overnight and be much lighter Thursday. Patchy fog should 
develop tonight again although expecting less dense than this 
morning. Lows tonight again several degrees below normal, in the 
mid 50s to lower 60s. Thursday should be similar to today, near 80
southwest Virginia to as warm as upper 80s southeast Tennessee 
Valley.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
The long-term forecast period will be rather quiet with a slow 
return to a more typical summer pattern by early next week.

An upper and mid-level trough axis will stretch across the 
Appalachians to end the work week with a ridge across the Western 
CONUS and out over the Western Atlantic. The trough will weaken and 
there will be some slight height rises over the weekend. However, PW 
values will remain around the 25th percentile for late July and have 
featured a dry forecast throughout the weekend. Some of the models 
want to indicate a few afternoon showers/storms across the higher 
elevations but the profiles appear to be too dry for any 
precipitation. Temperatures will slowly creep up over the weekend 
but will still be slightly below normal. 

A more typical summer time pattern will return by early next week. 
Low level high pressure will become established across the Carolinas 
with a cold front well to the north of the area. This will lead to 
light low-level southerly flow across the area. Due to this, 
dewpoints will slowly increase with the atmosphere becoming more 
saturated. Introduced PoPs to the forecast on Monday afternoon 
increasing each afternoon throughout the forecast period. High 
temperatures will also return to near normal with mid to upper 80s 
for most locations.

.DISCUSSION...
A cool July morning so far as high pressure over Missouri and a
northerly flow on the eastern side of it was bringing in a much 
drier airmass from the past week. Upper level trough over the
eastern states extending into the eastern Tennessee Valley will 
shift a little farther east by this evening as surface high
pressure to the NW shifts to the Ohio Valley. 

Lows this morning were 10 degrees below normal in the 50s to 
lower 60s, and tied a record at Knoxville to 40s at the higher 
elevations. Temperatures this morning were rising a little faster 
in the western areas so adjusted up a few degrees. Also adjusted 
dewpoints. Temperatures at late morning were in the 70s about 10 
degrees below expected highs in the lower to mid 80s. Skies were 
clear early this morning with cumulus forming in the past hour. 
Expect scattered cumulus this afternoon but decreasing later as 
airmass dries out more from the wet conditions the last 2 days. 
Winds will stay from the north to northeast at around 10 mph. No 
changes to current forecast.

LIFR fog is affecting the KTRI terminal, but that is expected to
dissipate in the 13z-14z time frame. Once that occurs, VFR
conditions are expected at all terminals through late tonight.
There is some indication that fog will once again be an issue at
KTRI, but there are some uncertainties. As a result, held off on
including anything like that fore the time being.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Surface high pressure was anchored over northern Missouri this 
morning, with northerly surface flow around the eastern periphery of 
this high extending into the Tennessee valley. Water vapor satellite 
imagery shows a high amplitude upper pattern in place this morning, 
with deep and unseasonably strong upper troughing across the eastern 
half of the lower 48 this morning, and strong ridging out west. This 
pattern will continue through the short term period, with the 
surface high progressing east into the central Great Lakes and Ohio 
River Valley regions late tonight.

The increasing influence of surface high pressure combined with 
clear skies through the night, has lead to some patchy fog 
development across the forecast area. Fog product and nighttime 
microphysics imagery from GOES 16 shows this fog very well. It is 
mainly confined to river valleys at the moment and that should be 
the trend through daybreak and shortly thereafter. Any fog should 
dissipate by an hour or two after sunrise though, so it will be a 
short-lived issue. From a forecast perspective, thus far models seem 
to have been largely too aggressive in how low they took 
temperatures and dewpoints during the overnight period. Thus it 
seems reasonable that this could allow highs to be a degree or two 
higher than previously forecast, and overnight guidance lends 
credence to this. Adjusted afternoon temperatures up a tad as a 
result. 

Another largely cloud free night is forecast for tonight, with 
temperatures in the 50s to low 60s forecast for most low elevation 
locales. Once again, patchy fog to some extent seems a given due to 
wet soil and prime radiational conditions. Have this primarily 
limited to low elevation spots north of I-40 where temperatures will 
be the coolest.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...

The extended period remains quiet overall, with increasing POP 
chances toward the end of the period as our next front rolls 
through.

Thursday through Friday the upper trough at 500 to 300 mb, though 
very weak, is still lingering across the spine of the Appalachians as 
it is sandwiched between high pressure across the desert southwest 
and high pressure over Bermuda. High pressure is in place in the 
lower and mid levels. This pattern keeps us dry with slightly below 
normal highs and lows. Highs on Thursday will range from the low to 
mid 80s with overnight lows around 60. Friday will be slightly 
warmer with highs in the lower to upper 80s and lows in the low to 
mid 60s. 

Saturday and Sunday look to remain mostly dry with a weak 
unorganized flow in place. On Saturday there will be a slight chance 
POP in for some of the elevated terrain. Slight chance POPs in for 
Sunday afternoon as well, but expect most areas to be dry on both 
days. Highs will generally be in the mid to upper 80s with lows in 
the mid to upper 60s. 

Weak southwesterly flow sets up for Monday out ahead of Tuesday's 
weak upper trough. The southwest flow increases moisture and 
therefore allows for expanded slight chance POP coverage across the 
area with low-end chance POPs in the high terrain. Tuesday will 
feature the highest POPs with chance POPs in for most areas as the 
trough and associated front pass through. The trough looks to be 
pretty weak and shallow so don't expect any real push of cooler and 
drier air behind it beyond the extended period.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...
The upper pattern today is highlighted by deep H5 troughing across 
the eastern CONUS, while anticyclonic flow prevails out west.  At 
the surface, high pressure continues to advect southeast across the 
Plains into the OH/TN Valleys in the wake of a cold front which is 
now moving east of the Appalachians.  As for the weather closer to 
home, drier air will consume the region as the upper trough axis 
slides east and the aforementioned high pressure settles in.  Thus, 
the fcst features lowering pops (generally dry by 00z) with skies 
scattering from the west.  Tonight, given clearing skies and optimal 
radiational cooling, temperatures will fall to levels nearly 8-10 
degrees below normal.  With that, residual BL moisture across 
portions of northeast TN and southwest VA will allow for patchy fog 
development toward daybreak Wednesday (mainly in the river valleys). 
Speaking of Wednesday, high temperatures a cat/two below normal 
combined with lower dewpoints and sunny skies well setup a beautiful 
mid summer day!

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
The extended period is starting dry and sunny with below average 
temperatures through he rest of the week with a slow warming trend. 
An upper trough will be shifting to the east coast at the beginning 
of the period with surface high pressure over the mid Mississippi 
Valley and western Great Lakes. Lows Thursday will still be rather 
cool in the 50s to around 60 about 10 degrees below normal and highs 
in the upper 70s to mid 80s. The surface high will move to the mid 
Atlantic and eastern Ohio Valley by late Thursday. A slow warming 
trend will continue Friday into the weekend as the surface high 
shifts farther to the northeast. Dewpoints will also begin to rise 
Thursday and Friday moving back to the lower to mid 60s Friday and 
Saturday. A high pressure ridge aloft across the southwest states 
also will move into the southeast on the weekend. Southerly flow and 
increasing moisture will allow the atmosphere to become more 
unstable with isolated afternoon and evening thunderstorms in the 
eastern Tennessee mountains and southwest North Carolina. Convection 
will be more widely scattered and along the Tennessee/North Carolina 
border area Sunday. Monday increased moisture with widely scattered 
to scattered plateau and eastern mountain convection continues. On 
Monday a weak front and upper trough moves into the Mississippi 
Valley and then slowly into the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys Tuesday. 
Scattered showers and thunderstorms expected to develop with this 
system Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

VAD wind profile data from the KMRX radar as well as some surface
observations from the TN valley over the last few hours show that
the surface front has now cleared the forecast area and likely 
rests just east of the Appalachians early this morning. Scattered 
to numerous showers continue across the CWA however, and will
likely do so through daybreak or shortly thereafter as the mid
level front will not clear the area until the mid morning time
frame. There was some concern that development along a low level
jet overnight would fuel fairly high rainfall rates, especially in
the mountainous terrain, and yield additional flash flooding
concerns. Radar trends have not bore this out for the most part,
with only some occasional small areas of rainfall rates
approaching or exceeding 1" per hour. Much of this activity has
either shifted east of the forecast area (moderate along the
Georgia and North Carolina lines), or has died down in intensity
(an area of moderate rainfall shifting from the Clinch Mountains 
area towards the Tri Cities). Thus I believe the threat for any
additional flash flooding is beginning the wind down
substantially. Have dropped the flash flood watch for areas west
of the I-81 and I-75 corridors to that end. Will keep the rest of
it going for now, mainly to cover the aforementioned areas of 
moderate rainfall completely clearing the CWA, and monitor whether
an update will be necessary to pull the rest of the watch by the
12z expiration time.

Otherwise, the short term will be relatively calm. Clouds will be
slow to clear today, but will gradually do so through this evening
as the front continues to push east of the area. Substantially
cooler and drier air will move into the region behind the front
tonight and into the long term period. It will be a wonderful
evening and overnight period tonight, with lows dropping into the
50s tonight. Hard to beat that in July.


.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...

The extended can mostly be characterized by dry and quiet 
weather, sunny skies, with slight chance POPs returning toward the
end of the period.

The period starts off with dry and cool weather on Wednesday as high 
pressure is building in from the west and the upper trough is 
exiting to the northeast. Highs will be in the upper 70s to low 80s 
with dewpoints in the mid to upper 50s. Overnight lows will be in 
the mid 50s to near 60 for most. These values are roughly 8 to 10 
degrees below normal for this time of year. Elevations above 
4000/5000 feet will dip down into the mid and upper 40s! High 
pressure in control Thursday through Friday will allow for dry 
weather and sunny skies. Temperatures will slowly climb but will 
still be a few degrees below normal.

Saturday through the Monday the high shifts eastward which brings 
the return of southerly flow to the area. Saturday should be mostly 
dry but Sunday and Monday will feature some slight chance and low-
end chance POPs as moisture and temps climb due to the increasing 
southerly flow. We can also expect temperatures to be back to normal 
during the time. Overall, a quiet period in store.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
The pattern today is highlighted by deep H5 troughing across the 
eastern CONUS, with a series of shortwave impulses passing through 
the mean flow aloft.  At the surface, weakening high pressure 
continues to retreat as a cold front approaches out of the OH 
Valley.  The headline of the day continues to be deep/moist swly 
flow running nearly parallel to the approaching front amidst 
marginal instability and upper divergence associated the rear 
entrance region of an upper jetmax over the Great Lakes.  All these 
factors combine with pwats near 2 inches to favor numerous showers 
and thunderstorms regionwide today ahead of the front, as well as a 
second round associated with the fropa overnight.  The primary 
threat continues to be heavy rainfall given the above noted moisture 
, slow storm motions, and training which will all favor increased 
potential for Flash Flooding, especially for areas along/north of 
I40 where FFGs are lowest.  Latest CAMQPF suggests a few rounds of 
heavier precipitation to fall slightly southward of the original 
Flash Flood Watch, thus did opt to expand it slightly southward as 
well as extending through 12z tomorrow morning, although some 
western zones could be cancelled earlier than that.  All in all the 
fcst for tonight and through the overnight will feature likely/cat 
pops with nearly 1-2 inches of QPF (locally higher amounts possible) 
expected. While general thunderstorms will dominate, cannot rule out 
a few strong storms, especially later along the front when deep 
shear is maximized in the 35-45kts range.

Otherwise, the front should sweep through the region by around 
daybreak Tuesday with light precipitation to accompany the boundary 
by that point, thus pops will be tapering down with likely levels 
over the high terrain and chances westward.  Beyond that, pops lower 
further as drier air advects into the area from the west with nearly 
a dry fcst favored by periods end.  Temperatures on Tuesday will be 
nearly a category below normal levels. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...
The main story of the extended will be the cooler and drier air 
across the region midweek. For Tuesday night and Wednesday, longwave 
trough will be across the Eastern CONUS with surface high pressure 
building in from our west across the mid-Mississippi Valley. Surface 
cold front will be to the east of the Appalachian chain with N/NE 
flow advecting boundary layer cold air across the forecast area. PW 
values will be very dry for this time of year between 0.5 and 0.8 
inch, and dew points will be in the 50s. This dry air is near the 
minimum for this time of year according to NAEFS forecast data. 
Additional shortwaves moving south through the upper flow will act 
to amplify the longwave trough through Wednesday afternoon, but dry 
boundary layer air and surface high pressure should limit any 
precipitation chances. With 850mb temperatures between 10C and 13C 
across the forecast area, this will be near the 1st percentile of 
climatology. This is a strong signal for below normal temperatures 
and an early fall-like feel. For this reason, temperatures midweek 
are expected to be 10 to 15 degrees below normal for this time of 
year with a mostly clear sky.

The cool and dry airmass is expected to continue into the weekend 
with temperatures approaching seasonal normals by Friday and 
Saturday as the airmass moderates and ridging begins to increase. 
Surface high pressure shifts east on Saturday with a return of low-
level southerly flow and an increase in boundary layer moisture. The 
increasing temperatures and moisture will result in some slight 
chance isolated convection across mainly the higher elevations of 
southeast Tennessee this weekend and into early next week.

.DISCUSSION...
Scattered to numerous showers with a few thunderstorms continue to
highlight the pattern across the region this morning. A frontal
axis is still progged to sag southward across KY through the day
and into the evening, with low/mid lvl flow running nearly 
parallel to the front. Out ahead, modest instability amidst weak 
upper divergence beneath the right entrance region of an upper jet
will favor continued convection across the TN Valley and Southern
Appalachians through the afternoon/evening, as well as along the 
front overnight. Thus, tweaked pops to account for latest CAM 
solutions which favor likely/cat levels across much of the area 
today, focusing more eastward overnight ahead of and along the 
fropa. The primary threat continues to be heavy rainfall and thus 
flash flooding given high pwats, lowered FFGs from recent rains, 
and training given boundary orientation. Therefore opted for no 
changes to the Flash Flood Watch at this time. Otherwise, tweaked 
t/td and sky in the immediate near term and left the remainder of 
the forecast as it was.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

A frontal boundary was situated well to our northwest this
morning, lying from roughly central Ohio, southwestward through
Paducah and into the Ozarks of southern Missouri. This will
eventually shift through the Tennessee Valley later tonight. Ahead
of this front, widespread showers and thunderstorms will affect
the region.

Some of this activity was ongoing early this morning. Areas of 
showers and thunderstorms developed over many areas along/north 
of the I-40 corridor early this morning. Some overnight runs of 
the HRRR and also the RAP did catch this, and have trended the 
forecast through mid morning largely in that direction. These show
the ongoing convection shifting north of the forecast area and 
dissipating by shortly after daybreak. This lull in convective 
activity would be short lived as widespread showers and 
thunderstorms are advertised to blossom across most of the CWA by 
midday. In that regard, didn't make any notable changes to what 
previous shifts had in the forecast for midday through tonight. 
Categorical PoPs seem warranted by just about every piece of 
guidance at my disposal, which is reflected in the forecast.
Convective parameters do not support much of a chance of severe
storms really. Some meager instability will be present, but CAPE
profiles through the column do not favor a threat of any
significant hail. Perhaps some gusty winds could occur from precip
laden downdrafts, but think the more pressing issue really is
going to be the possibility of heavy rains and flash flooding.

As mentioned several times over the last few days, precipitable 
water values are very high. Forecast PWAT values will be right 
around the 2" mark for most of today, which is well above the 90th
percentile mark. Combine this with widespread convection and slow
storm movements, and the possibility of some flash flooding will 
certainly exist as the day wears on. To account for this, a flash
flood watch has been hoisted for areas near/north of the I-40
corridor beginning at 8am and lasting through late tonight. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...

Cooler and drier air will bring relief to the forecast area 
during this period. However, Tuesday the cold front progged to be 
moving across forecast area will have showers along and ahead of 
it. The good news is that it will be moving fairly quickly 
east/southeast taking the precipitation with it by Tuesday evening
things will begin drying out. 

The upper trough will dig deep across the eastern U.S. for this time 
of year providing some relief to the recent heat and humidity for 
most of this week. Some temperatures by Wednesday morning will dip 
into the lower 50s! Dry conditions will persist until the surface 
high shifts from the Midwest to the northeast by Thursday evening. 
The upper flow becomes rather weak and dare I say sort of ridges 
over us again for the weekend. Low level south/southeasterly flow 
will bring back the moisture and associated showers back to the area 
Saturday and Sunday.

For this period temperatures will start off well below seasonal 
normals and gradually warm up through the week back to near
normal.

up the dip to slight chance PoPs all areas. MCS to the northwest
is sagging southeast, and the CAM solutions still hint that this

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...
The synoptic pattern today is highlighted by broad H5 troughing 
across the northern CONUS, while weak southern stream H5 ridging 
prevails across both the Four Corners region and the Western 
Atlantic.  At the surface, weak high pressure holds atop the 
southeast CONUS, while a surface trough/front extends southward 
across the Mid MS Valley from it's parent surface wave centered over 
northern IL.  With that, a conditionally unstable airmass dominates 
across the TN Valley and Southern Appalachian region favoring 
diurnal convection, which is already underway across the higher 
terrain.  Given weak flow, would expect gradual northern movement 
throughout the afternoon, possibly with a few cells in the valley. 
Therefore the fcst will feature chance pops in the valley with high 
chances to likely levels across the mtns/plateau.  Given abundant 
sky cover, think max temps will be a few degrees cooler than 
yesterday. Although sky cover will be increasing through late 
morning, did favor patchy fog as well (which could be dense at 
times) given the abundance of moisture in the BL. 

Moving on, convection should diminish gradually into the late 
evening hours as much thermo forcing is lost.  At that point, the 
fcst focus will shift to the aforementioned surface trough/front 
beneath a weak H5 wave, and it's eventual surge southeastward.  CAM 
solutions suggest a late evening (nocturnal) MCS firing across the 
OH Valley tonight, eventually sliding east into Middle TN as it 
decays toward Monday morning.  Guidance also suggests re-initiation 
by mid/late morning across the TN Valley amidst falling heights 
aloft, the intruding sfc trough, and perhaps along a remnant 
outflow. Meanwhile the surface front itself looks to lag behind, 
likely moving into the region beyond this fcst cycle.  As for pops 
on Monday, given moist profiles (pwats in excess of 2.1 inches, 
which is above the 90th percentile according to sounding climo) and 
the aforementioned boundary/forcing, opted to carry 
likely/categorical pops into the afternoon hours. As for threats, 
the better jet dynamics (and thus shear) will be well north of the 
region, however guidance does suggest 20-30kts deep shear amidst 2K 
j/kg CAPE, therefore cannot rule out a few strong/severe storms on 
Monday afternoon with the primary hazards being damaging winds. High 
temperatures on Monday will once again be below normal.  

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
A big pattern change is in the forecast for Tuesday as a cold front 
brings a fall-like feel to the region. At 0z Tuesday, a shortwave 
trough will be moving through the Tennessee Valley with height falls 
and a prefrontal surface trough across the region. Expect widespread 
scattered convection with this feature and the potential for some 
heavy rainfall rates. GFS, NAM, ECMWF, and Canadian guidance are all 
in good agreement with PW values being between 2.0 and 2.2 inches 
ahead of the cold front, and this would be near the 97th percentile. 
This is a good signal for heavy rainfall and some isolated flash 
flooding potential. In the wake of this first shortwave, another 
stronger shortwave will be moving southeastward toward the Southern 
Appalachians amplifying the upper trough. The associated cold front 
ahead of this trough will approach and begin to move through the 
forecast area between 06z and 12z Tuesday. The heavy rainfall rates 
will be possible ahead of this cold front.

The GFS, ECMWF, and Canadian quickly bring the cold front through 
the area with the trough axis shifting east of our area by 21z 
Tuesday with subsidence and drying aloft. The NAM is slower with the 
trough and develops a stronger meso-low at the surface which 
continues more widespread precipitation coverage through Tuesday 
afternoon. However, the NAM is currently the outlier solution and 
GFS ensembles support the global model consensus, thus, will 
continue to align the forecast with the GFS and ECMWF solutions 
which bring drying conditions to the area Tuesday afternoon.

Surface high pressure continues to build in on Tuesday night and 
Wednesday with weak shortwaves maintaining the trough across the 
Eastern CONUS. This very cold air, 850mb temperatures of 11C to 13C 
on Wednesday, will be in the 0.5 to 1st percentile for this time of 
year, and this is a strong signal for below normal temperatures. 
Overall, expect temperatures to be 10 to 15 degrees below normal. In 
addition, PW values will decrease to 0.5 to 0.7 inch on Wednesday, 
near the 1st percentile for this time of year, which illustrates the 
anomalous nature of this cold and dry airmass for July. Because of 
this dry airmass, northerly flow, and high pressure, dry weather and 
an early fall-like feel is expected mid to late week.

As high pressure shifts east, southerly flow begins to return next 
weekend with slight chance diurnal PoPs across the southern portions 
of the CWA and the higher elevations. Temperatures will return to 
normal by the weekend as ridging increases across the region.

Overall a fairly quiet morning across the region, with the

advecting atop of eroding morning low stratus, only to be replaced
with diurnal cu. All in all the forecast looked pretty good,
however did bump up pops slightly in the immediate near term given
sct showers across portions of the Great Valley. Otherwise, still

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Another warm, muggy night reflected in the temperatures across the
area early this morning. Most locations are in the lower to mid
70s and dewpoints are nearly identical. Patchy fog has developed
possibly with a few areas with locally dense fog reducing
visibilities, however, the fog is not widespread.

Some early morning convection is likely with current regional
radar showing a lone storm developing just south of Roanoke, VA
and a few light reflectivities showing up across the southern TN
Valley. Expect this to flare up a little over the next several
hours and persist into the morning and gradually increase in
coverage through the afternoon. Cloud cover from the showers will
cause daytime temperatures to be slightly cooler than previous
days. As such, don't expect heat index values to be nearly as hot.

Storms that develop today will have the capability of producing
locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds. Steering flow is weak so
storms will move slowly with lots of low level moisture to work
with. 

Tonight, shower activity should slowly diminish by late evening
with another surge of developing showers possible towards sunrise. 


.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...
The bottom line of the extended period will continue to be the big 
pattern change early week with much below normal temperatures for 
mid to late week. Weak mid to upper level trough axis (what is 
currently assisting in thunderstorm development this afternoon) is 
expected to be oriented SW/NE across the region Sunday night into 
Monday morning which may enhance a few showers and thunderstorms. As 
a stronger shortwave dives southeast across the upper Mississippi 
Valley, this will result in height falls across the Ohio Valley and 
Southern Appalachians. A seasonably anomalous surface cold front 
will move southeast with this trough and enhance boundary layer 
forcing and precipitation coverage. Guidance is in good agreement in 
indicating a prefrontal trough moving west to east across the region 
on Monday afternoon with widespread scattered convection likely. 
Instability will be marginal at 500 to 1500 J/Kg of MLCAPE late 
Monday and early Tuesday evening with effective deep layer shear 
approaching 20 kt. A few thunderstorms could be strong with gusty 
winds if instability is on the higher end of guidance, but the main 
risk of severe weather will remain to our north where shear and 
instability is expected to be maximized.

The surface cold front is expected to be across western Kentucky 
near the Ohio River by 0z Tuesday and this will move into our area 
by late Monday night or early Tuesday morning with additional 
periods of rain and thunderstorms along and ahead of this front. PW 
values will be between 1.9 and 2.2 inches late Monday and Monday 
night, so heavy rain rates will be a possibility with the stronger 
thunderstorms and result in localized flash flooding.

The front moves east of the area on Tuesday with decreasing PoPs 
from west to east. A few rain showers may linger across the 
mountains on Tuesday afternoon with some weak orographic enhancement 
and shallow post frontal moisture. Drier air and high pressure moves 
in Tuesday night and Wednesday with dry weather dominating through 
the end of the week. NAEFS forecast anomalies show 850mb 
temperatures being around the 1st percentile of climatology on 
Wednesday which is a strong signal for below normal temperatures. 
For this reason, expect temperatures to be near 10 to 15 degrees 
below normal on Wednesday. Overnight temperatures will also be about 
10 to 15 degrees below normal with the dry airmass in place. 
Temperatures rebound closer to normal by the end of the week as the 
airmass begins to moderate and upper ridging increases across the 
south/central parts of the country.

.DISCUSSION...
Just updated forecast; mainly focusing on POPs for the rest of
tonight and for Sunday. For tonight, diminished POPs this 
evening, but then have POPs growing late tonight over the Plateau 
and tapering off farther east. Will probably be some patchy fog, 
but with increasing cloud cover, only getting down to patchy 3-5 
miles, so not planning to include in the grids and published 
forecast, since this would not be that noticeable nor impactful. 
And areas that had the most rain today will likely have the 
thickest cloud cover tonight as well as developing rain showers 
toward daybreak. For Sunday continue to increase areal coverage of
showers and/or storms, and spreading to the northeast. Kept Min 
Temps the same overnight.

.AVIATION...
Most of the afternoon convection has moved off to the west, in 
this east to west upper flow between the strong ridge to the north
and the trough in the Gulf of Mexico. Overnight this flow 
continues, but a kind-of disturbed flow with weak lift embedded in
it. Several models suggest there will be light elevated 
convection blossoming prior to sunrise, with best agreement for 
precip on and near the plateau. SREF hitting this precip with 
pretty high confidence, but other individual models and my inability
to distinguish any obvious disturbances in the flow upstream, 
motivate me to keep the precip chances at PROB30 for now. Backed 
off slightly on the thickness of the fog at KTRI, thinking that 
increasing thickness of cloud cover overnight will limit the 
radiational cooling and thereby fog production.

This wave of showers and storms has gotten past the TAF sites,
moving to the west. Looking quiet in the wake of these storms and
now that evening cooling is beginning, doubt there is much of a 
chance of redevelopment this evening. Late tonight still looks 
like precip could start again as lift moves into the area, so will
keep the latter periods as-is.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...
Latest radar imagery depicts areas of showers and thunderstorms 
across the southern and central valley and along the Smoky mountains. 
Earlier visible satellite imagery showed a gravity wave, likely 
induced from MCS activity last night, moving southward out of the 
Ohio valley. This likely helped to act as a trigger for convection
along with differential heating. The atmosphere is unstable as 
temperatures rise into the upper 80s/low 90s atop dewpoints in the
lower/mid 70s. LAPS analysis indicates high positive buoyancy 
with CAPEs approaching the 3000-4000j/kg using a surface based 
parcel. As a result, expect showers and thunderstorms to persist 
through the rest of this afternoon and into the evening hours. 
Given the highly unstable airmass, strong/gusty winds will be 
possible in the stronger storms. This has already been evident on 
radar with weak divergent signatures on previous storms today. 
Heavy rainfall is also a threat this afternoon as PW values 
approach 2.0 inches, and slow storm motions. 

The other topic of interest is the heat. Latest observations at 3
PM EDT showed heat index values as high as 100-103. This dangerous
heat will persist into the afternoon. Temperatures will gradually
cool after sunset but lows will continue to be mild with lows 
expected in the low to mid 70s. A low to mid tropospheric wave 
will slowly move through the Tennessee valley overnight and into 
Sunday. Showers and thunderstorms are expected along this wave. 
Given the increase in cloud cover and precipitation expected, 
believe this will keep high temperatures and heat index values 
cooler than today. Sunday highs may be closer to climatological 
values. Point forecast soundings depict another environment that 
is moist and unstable. DCAPE values approaching 1000 j/kg could 
promote strong/gusty winds in any of the stronger storms. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...
The bottom line of the extended period will continue to be the big 
pattern change early week with much below normal temperatures for 
mid to late week. Weak mid to upper level trough axis (what is 
currently assisting in thunderstorm development this afternoon) is 
expected to be oriented SW/NE across the region Sunday night into 
Monday morning which may enhance a few showers and thunderstorms. As 
a stronger shortwave dives southeast across the upper Mississippi 
Valley, this will result in height falls across the Ohio Valley and 
Southern Appalachians. A seasonably anomalous surface cold front 
will move southeast with this trough and enhance boundary layer 
forcing and precipitation coverage. Guidance is in good agreement in 
indicating a prefrontal trough moving west to east across the region 
on Monday afternoon with widespread scattered convection likely. 
Instability will be marginal at 500 to 1500 J/Kg of MLCAPE late 
Monday and early Tuesday evening with effective deep layer shear 
approaching 20 kt. A few thunderstorms could be strong with gusty 
winds if instability is on the higher end of guidance, but the main 
risk of severe weather will remain to our north where shear and 
instability is expected to be maximized.

The surface cold front is expected to be across western Kentucky 
near the Ohio River by 0z Tuesday and this will move into our area 
by late Monday night or early Tuesday morning with additional 
periods of rain and thunderstorms along and ahead of this front. PW 
values will be between 1.9 and 2.2 inches late Monday and Monday 
night, so heavy rain rates will be a possibility with the stronger 
thunderstorms and result in localized flash flooding.

The front moves east of the area on Tuesday with decreasing PoPs 
from west to east. A few rain showers may linger across the 
mountains on Tuesday afternoon with some weak orographic enhancement 
and shallow post frontal moisture. Drier air and high pressure moves 
in Tuesday night and Wednesday with dry weather dominating through 
the end of the week. NAEFS forecast anomalies show 850mb 
temperatures being around the 1st percentile of climatology on 
Wednesday which is a strong signal for below normal temperatures. 
For this reason, expect temperatures to be near 10 to 15 degrees 
below normal on Wednesday. Overnight temperatures will also be about 
10 to 15 degrees below normal with the dry airmass in place. 
Temperatures rebound closer to normal by the end of the week as the 
airmass begins to moderate and upper ridging increases across the 
south/central parts of the country.

.DISCUSSION...Overall the forecast is in good shape this morning.
Have updated hourly temperatures and dewpoints to fit latest
trends. Still expecting a warm and humid day with afternoon
temperatures in the upper 80s to low 90s. This combined with
dewpoints in the low to mid 70s will produce heat index values in
the upper 90s to low 100s. Not anticipating needed a heat advisory
today. A mid tropospheric wave will help to condition the 
atmosphere this afternoon as the atmosphere destabilizes. Ensemble
data such as the HREF indicate CAPE values in the 2,000 to 3,000 
j/kg range. Xsect and point soundings indicate the best ascent 
located across southern portions of the area this afternoon and 
the forecast reflects this with highest PoPs expected across the 
southern and central valley with activity expected across the 
higher terrain as well. Locally strong storms cannot be ruled out 
given elevated DCAPEs with some strong/gusty winds possible. A 
heavy rain threat will also exist with any of these stronger 
storms as PW values approach 2.0 inches and mean (850-300mb) winds
remains weak leading to slow storm motions. Updated grids have 
been published and no other updates are planned for this morning.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
It is partly to mostly cloudy across the forecast area early this 
morning. Temperatures were generally in the lower to mid 70s and 
it's quite muggy with nearly saturated air. Regional radar indicates 
weakening showers and thunderstorms southwest of Asheville and other 
weakening showers over northwest Georgia.

The main story today will be the heat and heat index. Much higher 
than normal dewpoint temperatures will make it feel much more 
uncomfortable and hotter. Heat index values will be around 100 
degrees. Be sure to follow heat safety protocols. The secondary 
story will be the potential for storms that develop to produce heavy 
rainfall.

The wind flow through the forecast soundings show weak - less than 
10kt winds - southwest to east from the surface to 30kft 
respectively. PW values are still close to 2 inches today, too. This 
will mean slow movement to showers and thunderstorms that develop 
over the area later today along with heavy rainfall and possibly, 
strong wind gusts. The wave of weakening storms over NC/SC will 
drift east during the morning and looks to be a focus mechanism 
for development later today which could start as early as 9 am ET.
Look for showers and thunderstorms to expand through the 
afternoon before weakening closer to sunset. 

This evening lingering showers should diminish before, perhaps some 
redevelopment occurs after midnight. Low confidence on that due to a 
defined trigger mechanism and weak flow. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...
Main theme for the extended period is a significant pattern change 
from weakening ridge to unseasonably deep upper trough over the 
eastern third of the nation. The GFS and ECMWF remain in good 
agreement.

For Sunday, upper ridge is weakening over the Tennessee valley and 
southern Appalachians as a significant short-wave trough moves 
across the northern Plains toward the Great Lakes/Ohio valley. 
Increasing coverage of convection is expected. CAPEs of 1500-2000 
J/Kg with fairly high PWs of 1.7 to 2 inches will produce heavy 
rains and strong/gusty winds.

For Monday, upper trough will continue to dive toward the southern 
Appalachians with associated cool front moving toward the Tennessee 
valley in the afternoon and evening. Widespread convection will move 
into the area ahead of the frontal boundary and continue into Monday 
night. CAPEs of 1000-2000 J/Kg and high PWs along with some synoptic 
forcing from including upper trough/frontal boundary will set the 
stage for isolated strong to possibly severe storms. Main concern 
being strong/gusty winds and heavy rains.

For Tuesday, frontal boundary will be moving south across the 
southern half of the area in the morning with drier air advecting 
in. Will transition to lower PoPs as the day progress.

For Wednesday through Friday, surface ridging and trough axis east 
of the area will produce much more pleasant humidity levels with 
cooler temperatures. Generally dry conditions anticipated.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
Main weather story for the short term period will be the hot and humid 
conditions through Saturday. Currently across the area, skies 
were partly to mostly cloudy with temperatures in the mid to upper
80s atop dewpoints in the low to mid 70s. Latest radar imagery 
depicts an area of showers and thunderstorms mainly west of I-75 
and south of I-40. Water vapor imagery is indicating drier air 
aloft advecting from the north that has likely kept most areas 
dry today. The upper levels feature ridging aloft through much of 
the region which is helping to keep conditions warm. With highs 
expected in the upper 80s to low 90s and dewpoints near the low 
70s, this will create very humid conditions with heat indices in 
the upper 90s to near 100. Not anticipating needing any heat 
advisories for this afternoon as most locations should stay below 
advisory criteria. 

The current convection should dissipate after sunset as the boundary 
layer begins to stabilize. Warm and humid conditions will persist
into tonight as the ridge holds over the area. Lows tonight 
should bottom out into the low to mid 70s. Saturday should 
continue to be warm and humid as temperatures quickly increase 
under ridging aloft. Guidance suggests most locations will reach 
or surpass the 90 degree mark, especially across the valley. This
seems plausible as 925mb temperatures increase upwards of 28-30 
degree C.This combined with a moist airmass with dewpoints near 
70-75 degrees will produce heat index values into the upper 90s 
to low 100s. Decided to hold off on issuing any heat advisories 
for Saturday as confidence on how much of the area reaches 
advisory criteria remains low. Nonetheless, the dangerous heat 
index values will persist and should continue to be monitored. 
Instability will increase on Saturday with CAPE values in the 
2,000-3,000 j/kg range. As a result, convection is expected 
mainly during the afternoon hours. Coverage is expected to be 
greater than today as there are some indications that the ridge 
begins to break down. DCAPEs of 800-1200 j/kg means that any of 
the stronger storms could produce strong/gusty winds. PW values 
near 2.0 inches suggest that locally heavy rainfall will also be 
possible. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
Guidance continues to be in good agreement through the extended with 
the main story being a significant pattern change across the region 
early this upcoming week.

The extended begins with a shortwave trough diving southeastward 
across the northern Great Plains and upper Mississippi Valley late 
Sunday into Sunday night. This will bring height falls across the 
region with increasing PoPs for scattered convection on Sunday and 
Monday. MLCAPE each afternoon will be in the 1000 to 2000 J/Kg range 
across the area with effective deep layer shear generally between 10 
to 20 kt and increasing to 20 to 25 kt late Monday as stronger 
dynamics associated with the upper trough approaches the region. 
While widespread severe weather is not forecast with this system, 
the setup favors the potential for a few strong to possibly severe 
thunderstorms, especially later Monday as the front approaches and 
mid-level lapse rates increase with PVA across the area.

The shortwave will amplify longwave troughing across the Eastern 
CONUS Monday night with an associated surface cold front moving 
through the region. Likely widespread convection will be associated 
with this front, and with strong boundary layer forcing and PW 
between 1.8 and 2.0 inches, expect some heavy rainfall at times.

The cold front shifts east on Tuesday with a few lingering showers 
or isolated thunderstorms across the far eastern mountains closer to 
the front and where some weak orographic lift may enhance showery 
coverage. However, expect orographic lift to be minimal with winds 
from the N/NNE behind the front which is not normal to the average 
terrain axis. Surface high pressure builds in with much lower 
dewpoint in the mid 50s to lower 60s by Wednesday morning. In fact, 
both NAEFS and ECMWF output show 850mb temperatures being between 
the 3rd and 10th percentile compared to climatology. In addition, 
CIPS analog data shows high probabilities of below normal 
temperatures with surface temperatures being about 10 degrees below 
normal. This anomalous cold and dry airmass will result in much 
cooler temperatures with an almost fall-like feel mid to late week 
with very low to no chances of precipitation in the forecast.

.DISCUSSION...Made a couple of updates this morning mainly to 
hourly and max temperatures, and hourly PoPs. Currently, skies are 
partly to mostly cloudy with temperatures warming into the upper 70s 
to low 80s. Area observations show dewpoints are already pretty high 
this morning with mid 70s common. The big question mark today will 
be temperatures, which will be dependent on cloud cover, and 
convective activity. Best chances of convection will likely be 
across southern counties mainly south of I-40 but slight chance PoPs 
do extend to the north across the higher terrain. How much 
convective coverage is still uncertain and will greatly influence 
how warm some locations can get today. As a result, this will 
influence how warm apparent temperatures will get. Currently the 
forecast calls for apparent temperatures into the upper 90s to near 
100. The current maximum temperatures forecast is within the mean of 
guidance but some guidance such as the EURO MOS is advertising highs 
in the mid 90s. If we warm only a few degrees higher than currently 
forecast then we could be within heat advisory criteria. This will 
be monitored closely the rest of this morning. Updated grids have 
been published.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Early this morning temperatures 
were generally in the 70s and steamy feeling. Dewpoint temperatures 
were in the upper 60s to lower 70s. Lower clouds were evident on 
satellite over northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia while 
higher clouds were scattered over the remainder of the southern 
Tennessee Valley and southwest North Carolina. Some patchy fog was 
noted as well in the usual places near bodies of water/southern 
portions of I-75. 

Rain-free conditions will persist through at least 11 am. 
However, temperatures will be climbing as will the heat index. 
Drier mid- level air should make its way across southwest Virginia
and perhaps as far south as Knoxville. This should limit 
shower/thunderstorm potential this afternoon. 

Farther south enough moisture will be present to produce showers and 
thunderstorms between 11 am and 7 pm ET. PW values will be over 2 
inches therefore the thunderstorms will be capable of producing very 
heavy rainfall in a short period of time. Additionally, some storms 
could produce strong wind gusts but the heavy rainfall will likely
be the most impactful weather aspect. Showers and thunderstorms 
will diminish close to sunset.

Tonight look for gradually clearing skies/thinning clouds along with 
another warm, muggy night. Patchy fog will also likely develop 
shortly after midnight. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...
Models remain in good agreement through the extend period with a 
pattern change from ridging over the Ohio and Tennessee valleys to a 
unseasonably strong upper trough over the eastern third of the 
nation for Monday through Wednesday.

For Saturday, upper ridge remains with very warm and muggy 
conditions. Heat indices in the upper 90s to 103 degrees can be 
anticipated in the afternoon over much of the valley. A few areas 
may reach near 105 degrees which is at Heat Advisory criteria. A 
moist and unstable air with HREF showing ensemble mean CAPEs of 2500-
3000 J/Kg. DCAPEs of 800-1200 J/Kg which will produce strong/gusty 
winds with the stronger storms. PWs of 1.7 to near 2 inches will 
produce heavy rains with steering flow weak, so localized flash 
flooding a concern. 

For Sunday, upper ridge begins to weaken with still very warm and 
muggy conditions but heat indices mainly in the 90s across the 
valley. Greater coverage of convection with isolated strong storms 
continuing with strong/gusty winds and heavy rains.

For Monday, upper trough deepens with a frontal boundary approaching 
the area. Widespread convection and not as hot conditions. Heavy 
rains will be the main concern along with localized flash flooding 
possible.

For Monday night and Tuesday morning, frontal boundary moves through 
with showers and storms. Coverage of storms moves south with drier 
air slowly advecting into the northern areas during the afternoon.

For Tuesday night and Wednesday, upper trough is established over
the region with frontal boundary south. May see some convection 
along the Tennessee/North Carolina Mountains, otherwise dry, less 
humid, and more pleasant temperatures.

thunder around the Tri-Cities Regional airport for about an hour
before this fades away to the southeast. A brief period of mvfr
category fog is possible around tri toward daybreak but the
remainder of the aviation forecast trends toward vfr in a moist

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...An upper short wave trough 
moving across the Southern Appalachian Region combined with strong
diurnal heating has allowed scattered convection to develop over 
the area this afternoon. The atmosphere is only weakly unstable 
with DCAPE around 500 J/Kg. However...low level moisture remains 
quite high with PWs near the 2 inch mark. Therefore...the main 
concern for the rest of the day continues to be heavy rainfall and
the potential for localized flooding/flash flooding. The 
afternoon convection will decrease in intensity and coverage 
during the evening...then for the most part end by midnight. This 
will be aided by ridging aloft overnight. By Friday...a ridge of 
high pressure will be in place over the region. Remnants of the 
short wave will settle to our south and east. This along with 
strong diurnal heating will allow scattered thunderstorm 
development Friday afternoon. Convection should be generally pulse
type storm. DCAPES should range from 500 to around 1000 J/Kg and 
though a stray strong storm is possible...the severe threat will 
be fairly low. However...PWs will still be rather high...mainly 
between 1.50 to 2 inches which should translate to heavy rains 
once again. As for temperatures...it will be another hot and humid
day with highs across the valley generally in the upper 80s to 
low 90s and heat indices should reach well into the 90s. 

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Thursday)...Models continue to be 
in general agreement with the overall pattern for the long term 
period and continue to show upper ridging for Saturday, with the 
ridge weakening on Sunday followed by an upper trough becoming 
established over the eastern US for Monday through Thursday.  

While the upper ridge will be over the area on Saturday, 
considerable moisture will linger with scattered showers and 
thunderstorms expected. It will be hot on Saturday, but right now 
heat index values look likely to stay below advisory criteria.  The 
coverage of showers and storms is expected to increase on Sunday as 
the ridge breaks down, and then numerous showers and storms are 
expected on Monday with the trough digging in and a cold front 
pushing into the region.  Some of these storms may become strong 
each day Saturday through Monday, with strong gusty winds and 
torrential downpours which may lead to localized flooding being the 
primary threats. Will keep this mentioned in the HWO.  

Drier air will move in behind the front on Tuesday.  There may be 
some lingering convection around on Tuesday, but then Wednesday and 
Thursday look dry with temperatures slightly below normal for this 
time of year.

high dewpoints in the lower and middle 70s, so torrential downpours 
likely as well with isolated flash flooding possible. 

Heat indices will climb for Friday and especially Saturday. Heat 
index of upper 90s to near 103 degrees are expected across much of 
the valley. Will continue to highlight in the HWO.

For Sunday, upper ridge begins to weakens so coverage of storms will 
increase. As with Friday/Saturday, isolated strong thunderstorms are

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Ripple of energy is expected to continue to move through the area
early this morning and through the day. This is helping to 
prolong shower and thunderstorm activity. Stronger forcing 
associated with it will be south of the area, but we should still 
see some scattered showers and thunderstorms in the Eastern 
Tennessee Valley. Currently have painted the highest precipitation
chances in NE Tennessee/SW Virginia where storms are moving in 
from SE Kentucky. This is also the areas that have seen some of 
the higher precipitation totals over the past 24 hours... So the 
threat of isolated flooding continues, especially in NE 
Tennessee/SW Virginia. 

Expect storms to remain in the region through most of the morning 
hours and will likely increase in coverage later in the day as we 
continue to warm up. Expect coverage to isolated/scattered, with the 
highest chances being along the higher terrain or along any outflows 
left by this mornings storms. 

For the weather outside of convection... We will likely see some 
patchy fog early this morning as we get a few breaks in the clouds. 
Am currently not expecting widespread fog, but anywhere that's able 
to clear out and that got decent rainfall yesterday will have a good 
shot at patchy fog in the typical low lying areas. Temperatures are 
expected to be a few degrees warmer today as a bit more sun shines 
through, and should be right around normal for this time of year.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
The GFS and ECMWF are in decent agreement again this morning with 
upper ridging for Friday and Saturday, weakening ridge for Sunday, 
and upper trough becoming established for the eastern third of the 
nation for Monday through Wednesday.

For Friday and Saturday, even though upper ridge strengthens, still

.SHORT TERM(Tonight and Thursday)...Remnants of Barry continues to
push across the Southern Appalachian Region this evening. A stray
rumble of thunder is possible this evening but the threat of a
strong or severe storm is quite minimal. The main threat continues
to be heavy rainfall and the potential for localized
flooding/flash flooding. Showers are moving at a reasonable rate
so areas of concern will be locations that receive multiple rounds
of rain. Recent relatively dry conditions have kept river level
low. The widespread rains are expected to increase river levels
but do not foresee significant problems with river flooding.
However...a few low lying areas could see brief minor flooding.
Another round of convection is expected to move in tonight into
Thursday. This is in response to a upper trough axis sliding in.
The air mass will be weakly unstable....DCAPE values should range
form 500-1000 J/Kg. This combined with diurnal heating could
produce a stray strong storm. However...the main threat will
continue to be heavy rains and the potential for isolated flash
flooding. PWs will remain high...generally between 1.50 and 2
inches and with a wet ground from today's showers...additional
rainfall will maintain the threat of local flooding/flash
flooding. With increased sunshine on Thursday...highs will climb
back into the mid 80s to low 90s over most valley locations. Heat
indices could reach to near 100 degrees over southern
area...generally around CHA.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...Models are in 
decent agreement overall for the long term period. A broad 
mid/upper level ridge will be over the region for Friday into 
Saturday, but models indicate quite a bit of moisture will linger 
over the area so expect isolated to scattered showers and 
thunderstorms around especially during the afternoon/early evening
hours. A few storms may be strong with gusty winds and very heavy
rainfall both days. Dew points will be high and it will be hot 
both days, but right now it looks like heat index values will stay
below advisory criteria.

By Sunday the ridge will start breaking down with a bit better 
coverage of showers and storms, then by Monday a mid/upper level 
trough will be replacing the ridge and a cold front will be moving 
in. Will carry the highest PoPs of the period on Monday, and again a 
few storms may be strong. The front is forecast to move south and 
east of our area Tuesday, with drier and somewhat cooler air moving 
in behind the front for Wednesday.

.AVIATION...It will be an active TAF period as the remnants of Barry 
push across the Southern Appalachian Region.  As a result...expect 
occasional bands of moderate to heavy rainfall to move across TAF 
sites through the upcoming 24 hours.  As a shower or thunderstorm 
moves through...be prepared of heavy rain causing reduced VIS and 
lowering CIGs for MVFR to IFR conditions.  Some improvement in 
conditions is expected late in the TAF period as what's left of 
Barry moves out of the area.

.DISCUSSION...It will be a rather active day weather wise today as 
the remnants of Barry push into the area.  Though a strong...even 
severe storm can not be ruled out...the main concern today will be 
heavy rainfall.  PWs are around 2 inches today and expect rainfall 
amounts to range from 1 to 2 inches over the Cumberland Plateau to a 
half inch to around one inch over the rest of the area. However... 
some of the stronger storms could generate higher amounts. The 
convection as a whole is expected to move fairly steady across the 
area...limiting the amount of time any particular storm is over a 
location.  However...if an area sees multiple bands of heavy 
rain...local flooding/flash flooding will be possible.  It has been 
relatively dry over the past couple of days and so generally 
speaking...local rivers should be able to handle the rain...though 
expect the river levels to rise and could briefly cause some minor 
low land flooding.  The scattered showers/thunderstorms will 
continue across the area into the evening with another round of 
convection expected tonight as what's left of Barry moves out and a 
trough axis swings in. Current forecast in good shape...will update 
to remove morning wording.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Tomorrow)...
The remnants of Barry will finally begin to move through the area 
today, bringing widespread showers and thunderstorms. Currently 
precipitation is occurring over AL/Middle Tennessee and is expected 
to continue moving eastward. It A few scattered showers may form 
ahead of the main bulk of precipitation, but the more widespread 
rain will move into the Cumberland Plateau in the late morning 
hours, and is expected to last into the evening hours. Another weak 
mid/low level trough will move through Wednesday night behind the 
main round of rain during the day. Will continue precipitation 
chances Wednesday night and into Thursday as this secondary, but 
weaker, system moves through.

Biggest concern with the upcoming storms will be the threat of 
flooding. Precipitable water values around 2 inches with a tall 
saturated column will help warm rain processes. Expect some of the 
stronger storms to be able to produce quick heavy rainfall, but they 
will also be moving eastward at a decent clip as well. So while the 
storms will be capable of creating heavy rain, they (hopefully) 
won't be over any one location for very long. SREF models are 
relatively consistent with each other of most places seeing about 
0.5 - 1.0 inches of rain today and tonight and almost all of the 
members showing storm total QPE of less than 1.5 inches. Luckily 
we've been relatively dry across the area for the past few days, so 
hopefully the rivers and low lying areas are able to handle much of 
this rain. With the quick moving storms the threat for widespread 
flooding looks relatively low at this time so at this time have no 
plans to issue any flood related watches... HOWEVER, it is still 
VERY possible that some isolated locations get a few heavier storms 
over them and experience flash flooding. So the main message of the 
day is turn around, don't drown. 

High resolution models are indicating that there may be an area of 
heavier precipitation somewhere in Middle Tennessee towards the 
Cumberland Plateau (with QPF amounts closer to 2 inches). Areas 
along and near higher terrain are more likely to see heavier 
rainfall as these storms move through. 

With the secondary trough moving in later tonight expect there to be 
some additional storms capable of producing brief heavy rain, but 
coverage of storms should be much lower compared to earlier today. 

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Tuesday)...
Overall, GFS and ECMWF are in good agreement with the extended 
forecast. An upper ridge will develop over the Ohio Valley and 
central/southern Appalachians for Thursday night through Saturday. 
For Sunday, ridging weakens with upper trough becoming established 
for Monday and Tuesday over the eastern third of the nation. A 
frontal boundary moves into the Tennessee valley and southern 
Appalachians early next week. Now for the particulars.

For Friday and Saturday, upper ridge across the region, but moisture 
and instability remains and expect mainly diurnal convection each 
day. Greatest coverage over the higher elevations. Typical summer-
time air-mass with MLCAPEs 1500-2000 J/Kg, PWs of 1.6-1.9 inches 
(highest south), and DCAPEs of 700-1000 J/Kg. These values will 
produce isolated strong storms producing strong/gusty winds, heavy 
rains, and frequent lightning.

For Sunday, upper ridge breaks down allowing for greater coverage of 
convection over the region. Same as Friday/Saturday, isolates strong 
storms likely.

For Monday and Tuesday, upper trough develops over the eastern third 
of the nation pulling a frontal boundary southward into the 
Tennessee valley and southern Appalachians Monday night and Tuesday. 
Again, some strong storms are anticipated for Monday afternoon and 
evening. High pressure will build into the are Tuesday with slowly 
drier air advecting into the northern sections during the day.

Updated zones to account for convection moving into SW corner of

a few hours this evening. No other changes at this time, although
with an outflow boundary along with the northern AL convection,
activity may prove to be pesky. Isolated cell over NW GA and the

302 PM EDT Tue Jul 16 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday night)...
Through the rest of the afternoon and evening, shower coverage 
should remain isolated to the Plateau and mountains due to a lack of 
forcing and midlevel entrainment of dry air. Tonight, deep moisture 
and synoptic forcing will increase ahead of a shortwave trough that 
merged with the remains of Barry. The convective line in West TN is 
projected to mostly dissipate before reaching our area, but a few 
remnant showers may reach our Plateau counties before 12Z. 

The main period of showers/storms for the area will come during the 
late morning through the mid afternoon hours, associated with the 
main trough axis and associated QG forcing. PW values during this 
time will be around 2 inches, and efficient warm cloud processes 
(large LCL to freezing level thickness) will produce storms capable 
of producing locally heavy rainfall. Localized flooding will be 
possible, although area-wide averge QPF amounts of just a half to 
3/4 inch are expected as the system will be progressive. Overall,
the potential for widespread flooding problems appears low. The 
bulk of this precip will be exiting to the east from 21-00Z. A 
secondary trough at the 700-500 mb level with a weak surface 
trough will approach from the north Wednesday night, so chance 
PoPs will be maintained through that period.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...
An exiting upper trough and any lingering remnants of Barry will 
be the main focus for convection on Thursday. Low level moisture 
will remain fairy high with PWs near 2 inches and DCAPE generally 
between 500 and 1000 J/Kg. This should lead to scattered 
thunderstorm development. Though a stray strong storm will be 
possible...the remain concern will continue to be heavy rainfall 
and the potential for flooding/flash flooding. The upper trough 
and what's left of Barry should pull out of the area Thursday 
night with a broad ridge of high pressure building in for Friday. 
Therefore...the focus for Friday will be diurnally driven 
convection centered over higher elevations. Flow aloft become 
rather weak and somewhat zonal for Saturday and diurnal convection
will again be the main concern with coverage slightly increased. 
Sunday...an upper trough will begin to move towards the area. Low 
level moisture will increase with a more southerly flow and the 
air mass becomes a bit more destabilized creating a slightly 
increased chance of showers and thunderstorms. By Monday...a 
weakening frontal boundary will move in for a further increased 
and more organized band of convection. High pressure builds in for
Tuesday which should decrease thunderstorm activity.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Mid level ridge and the remnants of Barry will continue to be the 
main players of the weather for the next several days. Early this 
morning some patchy fog is expected once again in the typical 
locations in valley's and near rivers. Once the sun rises we should 
see another day similar to what we experienced yesterday. 
Temperatures are expected to rise a few degrees above normal and 
diurnally driven showers and thunderstorms are expected to form once 
again. Have continued with the highest precipitation chances along 
the areas of higher terrain in the afternoon, but can't rule out 
storms forming along left over boundaries from storms in the area 
yesterday. But will keep only low end precipitation chances in the 
forecast. Winds will be slightly breezier today, mostly along the 
Cumberland Plateau down towards Chattanooga as the remnants of 
Barry move a bit closer to the area helping to tighten up the 
pressure gradient. 

Shower and thunderstorm chances will begin to increase tomorrow 
shortly after sunrise as the remnants of Barry finally begin to move 
eastward and over the forecast area.

.Long Term (Wednesday through Monday)...
Remnants of Barry has merged with an upper trough. For Wednesday and 
Thursday, this trough will move into the southern Appalachians. Main 
low level forcing will be terrain and outflow boundaries. Scattered 
to numerous showers and storms will accompany this wave with the 
greatest coverage over the terrain features. CAPE values will be 
marginal between 1000-1500 J/Kg, but high moisture content with PWs 
of 2.1 inches. Heavy rains will be the main concern. Storm motion 
will be progressive northeast at 25kts. However, any training will 
be a problem for isolated flash flood issues.

For Friday, drier air will move into the southern Appalachians as an 
upper ridge builds into the area, but still expect scattered storms 
to develop along the terrain features.

For Saturday and Sunday, upper ridge begins to weaken with PWs and 
instability increasing. Main forcing will remain the terrain 
features with scattered mainly diurnal storms developing each day. 
Instability and PWs of 1.7 to 1.9 inches will produce typical heavy 
rains and strong/gusty wind.

For Monday, a developing upper trough over the northeast/mid-
Atlantic states with a frontal boundary approaching late. End 
result, increasing coverage of showers and thunderstorms 
anticipated.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
The center of Barry's remnants are moving north through AR this
afternoon with a large area of rain and thunderstorms from
southeast Texas, east through southern Louisiana, Mississippi and
into Alabama. The higher clouds and some middle clouds extend far
to the east over the forecast area. Filtered sunshine has allowed
temperatures to rise to the upper 80s to around 90 across the 
eastern Tennessee Valley with heat index values in the lower to 
mid 90s. High pressure aloft and at the surface extends to the
east and southeast into the Carolinas. The boundary that was over
the forecast area Sunday had shifted north into eastern KY and was
the focus for scattered showers and storms. Only isolated
convection had developed so far mainly over the Smokies and
southeastern Tennessee mountains and into southwest North 
Carolina. Expect the showers and storms to decrease early this
evening, possibly before sunset. Based on fog coverage this
morning and isolated area of convection this afternoon will not
have fog mentioned in forecast tonight. Patchy fog may develop
though in the usual fog prone areas. Skies tonight will also have
considerable high cloudiness from Barry which will limit fog
formation. Tuesday the remnants of Barry will get picked up by an
upper level trough moving into the mid Mississippi and lower Ohio
Valleys and stay over western and middle Tennessee so only 
limited convection during the afternoon and early evening like
today. Highs will be a couple degrees warmer mostly lower 90s.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...
The merger of Barry's remains with a mid-latitude trough over the
MS Valley on Tuesday will result in likely PoPs for our area on 
Wednesday as the system moves east. The main concern that we have 
been watching for the past few days is the heavy rain/flooding 
potential, but the trend over the past few model runs has been 
toward lower QPF. While PW values will be anomalously high, around
2 inches, the trough appears to be progressive enough that any 
flash flooding threat should be isolated to locally heavy rainfall
rates or training cells. Model agreement is good that the timing 
of the highest rain chances will be Wednesday afternoon. PoPs will
be trending down Wednesday night as the trough axis move to our 
east. 

A large high pressure ridge drifting east from the lower OH Valley 
to the central Appalachian region will be the dominant feature 
through the remainder of the forecast period. Above normal 
temperatures can be expected under this ridge through the weekend. 
Moisture and instabilty should be adequate each day to support 
isolated afternoon storms in the TN Valley, with scattered coverage 
in the mountains.

.DISCUSSION...
High and mid level clouds are increasing over the plateau and
southern valley late this morning. However, temperatures are 
still warming quickly from mild lows in the lower 70s. Already in 
the lower 80s at 10 AM Knoxville and Chattanooga. Have raised 
central and southern valley a degree for high temperatures. Also 
most of the precipitation in the flow around Barry is across 
western Tennessee and part of middle Tennessee late this morning. 
Upper level ridging over eastern Tennessee and the southeast US 
coast and surface high pressure and the absence of a surface 
boundary will keep shower and storm coverage lower today than the 
past few days. Short range model guidance showing much less 
coverage today. HRR showing convection developing around 18-22Z 
and mostly from the Smoky Mountains northward into the northern 
valley and mountains. Greater cloud cover on the plateau and 
southern valley may also hinder convection in these areas.
Lowered rain chances for end of the morning and early afternoon
but kept coverage similar for mid afternoon about 20 percent 
lower elevations and 30 to 40 percent higher elevations during 
the mid afternoon to early evening. This might even be too high.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Currently still some mid/high level clouds over the area with the
uptick in moisture being caused by Barry. Expect some of these
clouds to help keep fog away, but in some of the valley locations
we could see some patchy fog as RH values are creeping above 90%
very early this morning. Bulk of the rain associated with Barry is
still located in Western to Middle Tennessee. Expect it to remain
that way through most of the day today as the system continues to
run up against the ridge and begins to wash out. Better chances
for rain in our area will come from diurnally driven storms later
this afternoon. But at this time the CAMs are indicating only
isolated to scattered coverage of storms east of Barry. Expect
temperatures to remain around normal for this time of year unless
a stray shower cools a specific place off this afternoon.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...
The extended period will begin with the remnants of Barry across the 
Western Ohio Valley as it becomes an open trough and begins to 
interact with midlatitude Westerlies. This will place our region 
under deep southwest flow. With ridging across the region and little 
synoptic forcing, instability will be limited and mesoscale forcing 
for any afternoon convection will be across the higher elevations on 
Tuesday.

Our best chance of widespread convection will be on Wednesday and 
Wednesday night. Formerly Barry, but now an eastward propagating 
shortwave trough, will transit eastward toward our area with height 
falls across the region. Deep moisture associated with the former 
tropical cyclone will also increase across the area with PW values 
between 2.0 and 2.2 inches. This will be near maximum climatological 
values and provide ample moisture for heavy convective rainfall. In 
addition, instability is forecast to be on the lower side on 
Wednesday afternoon and evening with the GFS being on the high side 
of guidance with near 1000 J/Kg of MLCAPE. The NAM is much lower 
with generally 500 J/Kg or less of MLCAPE for much of Wednesday and 
Wednesday night. Regardless of exact values, this results in a very 
moist, skinny CAPE sounding with a deep warm cloud layer. For these 
reasons, periods of heavy rainfall and localized flash flooding will 
be possible on Wednesday afternoon through Wednesday night, 
especially where strongest low-level confluence exists across 
northwest portions of the forecast area. At this time, best timing 
for heavy rainfall appears to be between 21z Wednesday and 06z 
Thursday as the 850mb wind axis and max low level convergence will 
be present during this time period.

Shortwave trough axis shifts east on Thursday with deceasing PoPs 
and increasing forecast uncertainty into the weekend. The GFS and 
ECMWF both indicate an area of vorticity becoming displaced from the 
southern edge of the shortwave trough, but the location and track of 
this feature is very different in global model solutions. The GFS is 
much wetter into the weekend primarily because it keeps this vort 
max near our area with widespread scattered convection during the 
afternoons. Because of the uncertainty with this vort max location 
and track, have limited PoPs and expect most convection to be 
diurnal across the higher terrain. Global model consensus does 
continue to expand the ridge across the Central and Eastern CONUS, 
so expect this to help tamper much widespread convection in the 
absence of some mesoscale feature like the previously mentioned 
vorticity maximum. With an increasing ridge, much of the extended 
period should have above normal temperatures.

High uncertainty continues late weekend into early next week. Global 
models have a stronger shortwave across the Upper Mississippi Valley 
moving southeastward, but there are large differences in timing. The 
GFS is 24-48 hours quicker with the ECMWF and Canadian not weakening 
the ridge until the middle of next week. For this reason, introduced 
higher chance PoPs on Sunday into Monday due to potential height 
falls, but still limited highest PoPs to mainly the higher 
elevations.

.DISCUSSION...
Forecast is in great shape tonight so only very minor changes are
needed. Current KMRX radar shows a few showers near Sullivan and 
Washington county that should continue to dissipate over the next 
hour. Skies were mostly cloudy tonight as the mid to upper levels 
continue to moisten as shown on differential water vapor imagery. 
Cyclonic circulation associated with Barry continues to slowly 
move north through the lower Mississippi valley. Well to the east 
of that, moisture is slowly pivoting through much of the Tennessee
valley. With the loss of diurnal heating, expect a general 
decrease in coverage of SHRA/TSRA to the south of the forecast 
area. Cannot rule out a stray shower or two but would expect much 
of the forecast area to remain dry overnight. Areas of fog are 
possible in portions of the forecast area as well and this has 
been included into the forecast. Lows overnight should drop into 
the upper 60s to low 70s. Updated grids have been published.

where MVFR CIGS and MVFR/IFR fog develop late tonight. Scattered
convection near TRI should clear out shortly after TAF issuance
leaving mostly upper level clouds across the area. Winds should
remain light through the night. Additional SHRA/TSRA is forecast
to develop on Monday afternoon and impact the TAF sites with

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...A few scattered showers 
and storms are currently ongoing across the central TN Valley down 
through southwest NC. 1 to 1.25 inches of rain have already fallen 
in a few localized areas across Anderson, Blount, and Monroe 
Counties as these showers and storms are in a very moist environment 
with PW values ranging from 1.6 to 1.8 inches. 

Additional showers and storms may develop across northeast TN and 
possibly southwest VA here in the next hour or two. However, 
dewpoints still remain in the lower to mid 60s across those areas so 
there are some questions on whether development will occur. If 
storms do develop the heavy rain threat should be much lower 
compared to areas south as PWs range from 1 to 1.4 inches. The 
southern TN valley continues to see quite a few clouds so not too 
confident in storm chances down that way unless they can break out 
of the clouds soon. 

Some of these storms may have small hail with them and isolated 
damaging wind gusts, the main threat will continue to be flooding 
though.

Shower and storm activity should dissipate faster tonight as forcing 
is weaker. Expect overnight conditions to be mild and muggy once 
again with some fog possible after midnight. Tropical Storm Barry 
will continue to move northward into West TN through the day 
tomorrow but we stay mostly dry until the afternoon hours when more 
scattered showers and storms are expected. POPs are lower though for 
tomorrow with only slight and low-end chances in place as the 
deformation zone moves further north. Heavy rain again possible with 
showers and storms tomorrow as the high PWs remain in place.



.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...Still looking at the 
influence of the remains of Barry and its influence in the long 
term forecast. Monday night Barry is slowly moving north into 
Missouri with the outer bands moving across north MS and west TN. 
Upper level ridging will be over the southeast and forecast area 
with just isolated to widely scattered showers and thunderstorms 
overnight. Tuesday the moisture will very slowly spread east but 
still mostly widely scattered showers and storms lower elevations 
and scattered showers and storms higher elevations. Tuesday night 
and Wednesday the system opens up into a trough and moisture will 
increase slowly from west to east as the system gets caught up in 
southwest flow with the trough. High precipitable water values 
will allow for some brief higher rainfall amounts Wednesday. But 
as system weakens more Wednesday night and Thursday rainfall 
amounts will be lower. Highs Tuesday will be quite warm ahead of 
Barry, expecting near 90 to lower 90s with slightly less cloud 
cover. Wednesday only mid to upper 80s with more clouds and 
precipitation. Rain chances likely west and chance east Wednesday.
Slightly lower rain chances Thursday but slightly warmer and 
lower rainfall amounts as upper level ridge begins to build back 
over area in wake of Barry. From Friday through the weekend looks 
like the upper ridge to the west takes over and will help to dry 
atmosphere out. Temperatures will be near normal in the upper 80s 
to lower 90s with slight chance to chance showers and thunderstorms
with the highest chances generally in the mountains.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast generally on track this morning. The main
point to discuss in regards to the previous forecast is the 
uncertainty in coverage of showers and storms for today. I agree
that it is the most challenging aspect of the forecast. There is 
quite a bit of difference between the CAMs and the NAM on coverage
through the day and most of the CAMs show a lot less coverage 
compared to the NAM. I Am leaning toward the CAM solutions as they
did a pretty good job yesterday. 

Though there are questions in coverage, still believe some areas
could see some heavy rain with the showers and storms today. 
Areas that receive the most sun and can generate some greater 
instability will be the areas to watch for the heavier showers. 
Currently, based on visible sat imagery, it looks like the central
TN Valley, northern Cumberland Plateau, and up through SWVA will 
be the areas to watch as they have some holes in the cloud cover 
this morning.


As far as the grids, did some lowering of POPs through the day 
based on the discussion above. Lowered the POPs across the 
southern TN Valley through the rest of the morning due to the high
amount of cloud cover currently in place but didn't adjust 
afternoon POPs. Took most of the central TN Valley down from low- 
end Likely to high-end chance POPs due to the uncertainty. Will
send out new zones to get rid of morning fog wording and for POP
adjustment.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The remnants of Barry continue to produce moisture rich southerly
flow across the Tennessee Valley. The stationary front that has
been located across the area for the past couple days is no longer
clearly defined in surface observations. Dew points are in the 
low to mid 70s across much of the area with some remaining upper 
60s across far NE TN and SW VA. WV imagery shows the deformation 
axis and axis of shortwave ridging and associated subsidence has 
shifted northward with relatively deep moisture through the 
atmosphere across the entire area. As instability increases mid- 
morning through the afternoon, expect scattered rain and 
thunderstorms to once again develop. The main development area, 
and likeliest PoPs today, is expected to be along a low-level wind
shift/deformation zone stretching NW-SE from near 
Scott/Anderson/Knox/Blount counties. RAP forecast soundings 
continue to show sufficient instability for convection with 1000 
to 2000 J/Kg of MLCAPE forecast across the area. PW values will 
also remain high, near 1.9 to 2.0 inches, across the central and 
southern valley. This deep, rich moisture may enhance heavy 
rainfall and localized flooding potential, especially in areas
that have already received heavy rain during the past 24 hours and
have lower FFG values. Additionally, with increased moisture 
across NE TN and SW VA and the deformation zone shifted north, 
expect higher chance PoPs across these areas today. However, 
forcing is weaker than Saturday, and some ridging is attempting to
build to our southeast. These factors may limit overall coverage 
of convection compared to Saturday. With scattered convection and 
cloud cover, expect temperatures to be near or slightly below 
normals.

Overnight, weak forcing will limit any widespread precipitation
potential, but may still have a few isolated rain showers. Where
there are cloud breaks, especially across SW VA and NE TN, fog and
low clouds would be expected to develop with weak boundary layer 
winds.


.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...
Main focus on the long term portion of the forecast will be how 
Barry and the mid/upper level ridge interact and influence the 
weather over the forecast area. On Monday the center of Barry will
likely be over Arkansas with broad ridging over much of the 
United States. Closer to home we will see higher dew points 
continue to be drawn up on the east side of the storm keeping 
moisture in the atmosphere high. Model forecast soundings indicate
that we should see precipitable water values of around 1.6 - 2.0 
inches throughout the upcoming work week, abnormally high for this
time of year. Isolated showers and thunderstorms are possible on 
Monday with temperatures rising a few degrees warmer than Sunday. 
On Tuesday Barry starts to lose it's punch and as it weakens it 
should begin to get caught up in the main steering flow of the 
atmosphere around it. This means that the remaining moisture and 
energy associated with the storm begin to move eastward towards 
us, leading to increased shower and thunderstorm chances as we 
move into the middle of th work week. 

Remnants remain in the general area through the second half of the 
work week before they eventually get shoved to the southeast by an 
approaching front over the weekend. Forecast confidence is somewhat 
low around Wednesday and beyond, mainly due to uncertainty in how 
strong Barry will remain and how quickly it starts to dissipate. All 
models are in good agreement that remnants will eventually impact 
our area, but the strength of the storms and amount of rain they 
will bring is still a bit difficult to pin down at this point. 
Biggest threats with storms for the next week will be mainly heavy 
rainfall, especially if rain occurs over specific areas over the 
course of a few days. Temperatures will remain right around normal 
for the upcoming work week and into next weekend.

.DISCUSSION...
Main updates tonight were to increase near term 
PoPs based on trends as well as to get hourly temperatures and 
dewpoints in line better with current observations. GOES16 water 
vapor imagery shows a plume of moisture moving northward 
associated with Tropical Storm Barry. This airmass is very moist 
with PWAT values near or exceeding 2 inches. The numerous showers 
and thunderstorms that developed this afternoon were in response 
to increasing low level moisture flux convergence along a boundary
lifting north. The convective nature and very efficient warm rain
processes lead to heavy rainfall and flash flooding in some 
locations. The forecast for the rest of tonight calls for a 
decreasing trend in coverage of showers and thunderstorms as the 
above mentioned boundary continues to lift north and the airmass 
becomes less unstable. This is already becoming apparent as GOES 
CH-13 imagery shows a cloud top warming trend. Given the moist 
airmass in place and 5-10 knots of 850-300mb flow, cannot rule 
out additional heavy rainfall and possible flash flooding. 
Otherwise expect partly to mostly cloud skies through the rest of 
tonight with patchy fog possible in some locations. Temperatures 
should fall into the upper 60s to low 70s.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...Very similar forecast 
compared to yesterday through the rest of this afternoon and 
evening as the pattern hasn't really changed. The only difference 
is the stationary boundary from yesterday is further north today 
thanks to the influence of Hurricane Barry. The boundary has moved
a little further north since this morning's update and now 
generally lies along a semi northwest-to-southeast gradient 
between the northern Cumberland Plateau and down through 
Morristown. Along and south of the boundary, the airmass is quite 
moist with PWs ranging from 1.6 to 1.9 inches. The airmass is also
unstable with 2000 to 2500 J/kg MLCAPE. With very little flow 
aloft though, these storms will continue to be of the pulse 
variety and therefore short- lived. However, any area that sees 
repeated cells has the potential to see localized flooding, even 
flash flooding. This activity will continue through the rest of 
the afternoon and into the evening hours before dissipating. A few
light showers may remain overnight. Areas of fog/patchy dense fog
possible again overnight, especially across areas that receive 
rainfall today.

Our stationary boundary lifts northward tomorrow as Hurricane Barry 
moves further inland. Even though the boundary is north of the area, 
we still have a chance to see some showers and storms across the 
area due to the influence of Barry's outermost bands. The airmass 
remains saturated tomorrow so localized heavy rainfall is once again 
possible.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...At the beginning 
of the period Tropical Storm Barry or just a tropical depression 
will be in Southern Arkansas and to the east across the forecast 
area there will be an upper ridge aloft. Expecting only a few 
showers and a thunderstorm early in the evening. Monday the ridge 
holds as Barry's remnants approach the Arkansas/Missouri border. 
West Tennessee will have heavy rain while the eastern part of the 
state still be under the influence of the ridge. Highs will be 
near 90 with widely scattered to scattered showers and 
thunderstorms. Tuesday the surface low may begin to fill or 
dissipate and the upper level part begins to move east into the 
Ohio Valley. Expecting similar weather Tuesday as Monday except 
less coverage in the valley widely scattered storms and about 30 
percent coverage plateau and mountains. Tuesday night the remnants
of Barry move into middle Tennessee and approach the Forecast 
area early Wednesday. ECMWF model as compared to GFS now moving 
system across the eastern Tennessee Valley and Southern 
Appalachians faster so may be east of the mountains by Thursday 
morning. ECMWF model Thursday shows upper ridge beginning to build
in from the west. GFS slower with Barry remnants progression and 
weaker. Decided to keep showers and storms in chance range. The 
ECMWF has upper ridge building overhead Friday and Saturday. GFS 
much different with front dropping down from the NW. Prefer ECMWF

.AVIATION...Stalled frontal boundary will allow for showers and
storms across CHA and TYS where VCTS is in place through late
evening. VFR expected during this time but tempo MVFR in TAFs in case
a storm passes over a terminal. Any convection should remain south
of TRI. Fog forecast is difficult tonight because it depends on 
whether precip moves directly over a terminal. So for now, have 
some light fog in TAFs but still VFR at CHA and TYS, with a MVFR 
cig at TRI early tomorrow morning. More showers and storms 
expected tomorrow afternoon, mainly centered around TYS.

1040 AM EDT Sat Jul 13 2019

.DISCUSSION...Current forecast is on track with a few minor 
changes to POPs, dewpoints, and sky cover and QPF. The biggest 
change from the previous forecast is that areas along the front 
could see some higher rainfall totals as well, not just the 
southern TN Valley. The stationary front can clearly be seen by 
looking at an obs plot map. The front currently resides somewhere 
around the I-40 corridor, between Knoxville and Morristown, and is
laid out in an west-to-east fashion. Based on CAM consensus, 
still expecting showers and storms to fire along and south of the 
front at anytime, and continue to increase in coverage through the
afternoon. Still believe the heaviest rains will fall south of 
the front but some heavy rain potential is also possible along 
the front. This would put areas in and around Knoxville at risk to
see some higher totals as well. This thinking aligns very well 
with WPC's current excessive day 1 rainfall outlook which puts 
areas from I-40 and south in a slight risk to see excessive rain 
with areas just north of the front only in a marginal risk. The
change to include Knoxville in the heavy rain potential was due to
moisture surging a little further north than previously anticipated.

Will send out new zones to get rid of morning wording and to
reflect changes mentioned above.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Morning observations show localized fog and low clouds in river 
valleys. Fog will decrease in coverage this morning as boundary 
layer mixing increases after sunrise. The stationary front which 
has been aiding diurnal convection for the past couple days is 
also evident in surface observations with an 8 degree dewpoint 
gradient between TRI and MOR. South of the front, dew points are 
in the low to mid 70s; whereas, north of the front, dew points are
in the mid 60s. Recent RAOBS and WV imagery show shortwave 
ridging extending across the Ohio Valley and Central Appalachians 
including northern parts of our forecast area. This is resulting 
in subsidence and an inversion near 700mb across parts of far NE 
TN and SW VA. With drier boundary layer air also present across 
SW VA and far NE TN limiting any potential instability, expect 
very low PoPs today with convection unable to develop and reach 
the LFC. Southward, near and south of the low-level front, expect
widespread scattered convection. Boundary layer convergence along
the low-level deformation zone and RAP forecast soundings 
indicating the potential for MLCAPE of approximately 1500 to 2500
J/Kg will allow for likely scattered convection developing mid- 
morning and continuing through the afternoon. For this reason,
will forecast likely convection across the southern half of the 
forecast area, and in general, expect a majority of convection to 
be near or south of the Interstate 40 corridor. PW values will 
continue to be high near the maximum for this time of year with 
high confidence in 1.9 to 2.1 inch values in the vicinity of 
Knoxville and southward. While the high PW can aid localized heavy
rainfall, believe the overall heavy rain and flash flooding 
potential will be limited across the far southern portions of the 
forecast area near Chattanooga, Cleveland, the southern Cumberland
Plateau, and SW NC. The far southern areas are the only locations
that will have a deep warm cloud depth and sufficient mid-level 
moisture for warm rain processes to aid heavy rainfall. The 
central valley will see likely scattered convection but the 
affects of weak mid-level subsidence will be felt with drier mid-
levels limiting the overall flooding rain threat. However, this 
drier air aloft could aid some strong downburst winds with any 
thunderstorms. Max temperatures today will be dependent on 
coverage and location of showers and thunderstorms during the 
afternoon, but expect temperatures to be near seasonal normals.
Because of the drier boundary layer airmass and limited 
convection, temperatures will be slightly higher than seasonal 
normals across far NE TN and SW VA.

Convection is expected to decrease tonight after the loss of
daytime heating, but a few scattered rain showers will remain
possible near the stationary front. With a clearing sky and calm
wind, expect fog development once again in locations that received
rainfall during the day and in river valleys. Minimum temperatures
will be near normal across NE TN and SW VA and above normal across
the southern half of the forecast area where higher boundary layer
moisture is present and high clouds are more likely.


.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...
At the beginning of this period Tropical Storm Barry will be 
moving northward through Louisiana, while we are located under a 
weak upper ridge between Barry and an shortwave in eastern Canada 
and NE US. Looks like we will still have a very weak WNW-ESE low 
level boundary draped across the area Sunday, that will offer very
little in the way of focus, but the deeper moisture tapers off 
quickly northeast of this boundary, and will taper off POPs in our
NE areas as well on Sunday.

The basic scenario of Barry remains consistent, with Barry moving 
northward through Monday, then the remnants of Barry turning east 
and heading our way in general, passing through generally between 
Wednesday and Thursday. The movement of Barry in the models is 
slightly slower to approach the area than model runs 24 hours ago. 
Also, models have Barry weaker and precipitable water values lower 
as Barry moves through, so precip amounts will be lower with this 
forecast.  Still with this being a tropical system, precip rates in 
the heaviest downpours will be higher than our normal summer shower 
or storm.  We should still have some flooding potential mid week. 
Trimmed back higher QPF that was showing up in Monroe TN and 
Cherokee County, NC area--looked like some kind of convective 
feedback bullseye stuck over that area for about 24 hours.

For temps, trimmed back Max Temps across the northern 1/2 to 1/3 of 
the area Wednesday and Thursday as lift, moisture, clouds, filter 
and disperse surface heating.

Some fog is already developing across the region tonight and more
fog and low cigs are expected to develop near area water bodies
and locations that received rainfall yesterday. Rain did occur 
near or at CHA and TYS, so do expect some fog and low cigs near
the terminals to develop late tonight and near sunrise Saturday.
While TRI did not have precipitation near the terminal yesterday,
dewpoint depression are already very low and it is a
climatologically favored night for some fog development at the
terminal along the Holston River. Expect mostly MVFR fog, but some
tempo IFR/LIFR cigs and vis is probable between 10z and 12z this
morning before improvement occurs during the morning hours.

Scattered rain and thunderstorms are expected again at TYS and CHA
on Saturday afternoon with mostly dry conditions favored near TRI.

.DISCUSSION...A corridor of deep rich tropical moisture remains in
place extending in an east through west band from the Western
Atlantic through the Mid South this evening. It is a product of
moisture that was swept south ahead of the Eastern U.S. cool front
and moisture already returning ahead of Barry. Believe that in
this zone of convergent tropical air along this frontal boundary,
a few showers could be lifted into place during the early morning
hours across Southeast Tennessee, as the front is forced 
northward in response to a strengthening Barry. Deep moist 
convection would increase along this boundary into Saturday. These
elements of the forecast are handled well, along with the 
expected formation of fog in an increasingly saturated surface 
environment later tonight. Low temperatures appear to be on track 
bottoming out in the middle and upper 60s north and higher terrain
areas with lower and middle 70s elsewhere.

The northern part of the Great Valley around tri could see
visibility and ceilings drop low enough for an ifr and even lifr
flight category as the still relatively moist low level air mass

shower at cha during the early morning hours as well where models
indicate a ribbon of deep moisture and convergence near the
stalled frontal boundary. That corridor of deep moisture and
convergence will remain in place perhaps impacting both cha and
tys as convection is likely to form around interstate 40 and
points south to the Northern Georgia border. Stayed with ceilings
in convection that remain vfr or mvfr, although there is always a
chance than either ceiling or visibility drop into the ifr

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...Scattered showers and 
storms will continue through the rest of the afternoon and into the 
evening hours along and south of I-40. Weak convergence along the lingering
stationary front is our lifting source. The high PW values across
the southern TN Valley are allowing for high rain rates with some
of these storms, 1 to 2 inches per hour aren't out of the 
question. Localized flash flooding remains possible through the
evening.

The heaviest showers settle down by 00z as we lose our heating. 
Overnight, we see the first impacts from Tropical Storm Barry as an 
outer band moves into the southern and central TN Valley and brings 
light showers. Areas of fog and patchy dense fog possible through 
the night as well.

The weak stationary front that is across the south today lifts 
northward tomorrow as Barry pushes further north. The southerly flow 
from TS Barry causes convergence along the front and provides a 
lifting source through the day tomorrow. The high PWs will again 
allow for more heavy downpours. The highest POPs and heaviest rain
for tomorrow will be centered across the central TN Valley. 
Localized flash flooding will again be a concern. Lighter showers
expected across northeast TN and into SWVA as the deeper moisture
remains south of these locations. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...Weak upper level 
ridge NE of Tropical Storm Barry and old boundary that should be 
lifting north or along the northern edge of the forecast area will
be a focus for at least evening showers and thunderstorms 
Saturday night and then Sunday the southeast half of the area 
should have mostly scattered afternoon and early evening showers 
and thunderstorms. As moisture deepens Sunday and Monday storms 
that develop will be capable of producing brief heavy rainfall. 
Considerable clouds in the moist airmass will keep temperatures in
the mid to upper 80s for highs and mainly lower 70s for lows. By 
Tuesday the weakening circulation of Barry moves north into the 
mid Mississippi Valley with increasing rain chances across western
sections. The system will then move east across the Ohio Valley 
Wednesday and into the northeast states by Thursday night and 
Friday. Models are forecasting the system to open up and form an 
upper trough over the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys at mid week which
will enhance rainfall over the forecast area starting Tuesday 
night or Wednesday and continue into Thursday. A few inches of 
rain will likely fall with localized flooding possible. On Friday 
an upper level ridge to the west rebuilds over the southeast and 
Tennessee Valley. This will dry out the region and begin to warm 
temperatures back into the upper 80s to lower 90s. Rain chances 
will still be in the 30 to 40 percent range for mainly late 
afternoon and early evening thunderstorms Friday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A few showers and isolated thunderstorms have developed early 
this morning along the frontal boundary as a weak vort max advects
southeast. Generally expect this convection to decrease in 
coverage toward sunrise as shortwave ridging arrives and the
jet streak to our northeast exits the area, but may still have 
some isolated/slight chance PoPs near and south of the surface 
front where low-level convergence is strongest. Current 
observations and satellite imagery show areas of fog, some dense, 
north of the front along the Cumberland Plateau, far northeast 
Tennessee, and southwest Virginia. As daytime mixing increases 
after sunrise, this fog should dissipate with a clearing sky.

The big story today will be likely convection along and south of
the stalled stationary front. The 500mb trough axis will be 
shifting eastward with weak subsidence and drier air aloft across 
the region which is already evident in WV imagery this morning. 
This will lead to weaker mid-level lapse rates and limit overall 
instability. Surface analysis data and short-term models are in 
agreement with the low-level deformation zone extending east to 
west through Tennessee generally along or just south of Interstate
40 enhancing surface convergence and lift. South of this front 
across southeast Tennessee and southwest North Carolina, the 
airmass is very moist with dewpoints in the low to mid 70s and PW 
values near 2.0 inches. This is near the max of climatology, so 
tropical downpours with localized flash flooding potential will be
possible in these areas. However, the extent of flash flooding 
risk is uncertain with the dry air aloft. Highest probabilities of
these heavy downpours will be further south near Chattanooga and 
the Georgia state line where the warm cloud layer is deepest and
upper-level subsidence is weakest. North of the front, the 
airmass is much drier with dewpoints in the mid to upper 60s and 
PW values between 1.0 and 1.3 inches. With the very moist airmass 
south of the front, the atmosphere is still expected to be 
moderately unstable generally along and south of Interstate 40.
RAP forecast soundings indicate MLCAPE between 1500 and 2500 J/Kg for
TYS and CHA. With the dry air aloft, the RAP is showing the 
potential for DCAPE of about 1100 J/Kg near TYS which may result 
in a few thunderstorms having some strong downburst winds. Further
north in the drier airmass, instability will be greatly reduced 
with MLCAPE approximately 400 to 800 J/Kg near TRI with the 
atmosphere becoming much more stable further north of the front. 
For this reason, PoPs will be highest generally along and south of
Interstate 40 today. Temperatures will be highly dependent on 
convective coverage this afternoon, but generally should be near 
seasonal normals.

Convective activity will decrease after sunset, but isolated
showers or a thunderstorm will be possible near the surface front
which will remain stationary across our forecast area. Fog will be
likely again north of the front and across those areas that see
rainfall today. Overnight temperatures will be coolest across the
Cumberland Plateau, northeast Tennessee, and southwest Virginia 
in the drier airmass north of the front.


.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...
At the beginning of this period, we will be under a weak upper 
ridge with the tropical system Barry close to the Louisiana coast,
moving northward. There may be a very weak east to west surface 
boundary on Saturday that would help be a weak focus for 
convection, and there may be some weak lift moving northward on 
the outer fringes of Barry that pass through the area. By Sunday, 
the boundary should be north of the area, and moisture will be 
deepening from Sunday into the work week, with precipitable water 
values over 1.5 inches on Sunday, increasing to over 2 inches by 
Wednesday over most of the area. There is pretty good agreement 
that Barry will turn eastward early in the week, with some part of
it pass through the area around Wednesday. We can expect tropical
downpours as Barry passes through, then rain rates tapering off 
later in the week after Barry moves away to the east. Right now, 
heaviest rains are focused from Tuesday night through Wednesday 
night, with wettest area on the northern plateau, where forecast 
amounts are 1.5 to 2 inches. Other parts of the area during this 
period are closer to 1 inch. For temps, went close to guidance, 
although bumped down Max temps generally by 1-2 degrees south and 
2-4 degrees north as soupy airmass, cloud cover, and lift should 
slow surface heating.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
Showers and thunderstorms are occurring across the area this 
afternoon with the biggest impacts felt so far being heavy rain. 
There are Precpitable Water values near or even slightly above 2 
inches are present across the area (which is very high). This is 
allowing for enhanced rainfall amounts from these storms. Rainfall
reports of around 1 inch an hour (with some storms producing up 
to 2 inches an hour) have been reported with some of the heavier 
storms. This threat will continue as the storms slowly move to the
East through the rest of the afternoon and into the evening 
hours. The other threat (although not as prevalent as the 
flooding) will be gusty winds with these storms as they strengthen
and collapse. Expect most storms to stay below severe levels, but
with how saturated the grounds have gotten recently it won't take
nearly as strong winds to cause damage to trees or power outages.

Another round of storms is expected to flare up over the area as
the actual front moves into the area later tonight. Can currently
be seen on satellite/radar across Central/Northern Kentucky. This
front and the associated storms will continue to dive towards the
southeast and move into the Cumberland Plateau tonight. Currently
not expecting these storms to be as wide spread as what we are 
seeing on radar this afternoon, but if storms are able to go over 
the areas that got heavy rain already then it won't take much 
additional rain to quickly cause flooding problems.

Overnight expect fog to form in many locations, especially ones
that got rain during the day today, so it would be a good idea to
allow extra time to get to work tomorrow morning. Rain chances
won't completely go away after the front moves through. Higher
rain chances will continue tomorrow closer to the front and closer
to the moisture being brought in from Tropical Storm Barry. Once
again the main threats with any of these storms will be the
continued chances for flooding.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
By 00Z Saturday, upper level troughing will encompass much of the 
eastern seaboard with upper level ridging located across the western 
US and western Atlantic. Much of the uncertainty in the extended 
results from what will become of the current Tropical Storm Barry. 
Guidance has trended closer together and the official advisory 5 
from NHC has this system moving through Louisiana and into the 
Midsouth by early next week. A frontal boundary will be situated 
across the Tennessee valley on Saturday and low to mid layer 
moisture will increase leading to slight chance to chance PoPs. 
Temperatures during this time will likely be near normal values 
during this time.

By Sunday we should start to see a slow increase in coverage of 
showers and thunderstorms as the tropical system continues to move 
into the Mississippi valley. Southerly flow will increase on the 
eastern side of this storm and will continue to transport moisture 
northward. Better chances will occur in southwestern portions of the 
area where better low level convergence will be situated. 

Not much has changed from the previous forecast as the tropical 
system makes its transition to an open wave as it progresses 
northward into the Ohio valley. As with any tropical system, 
uncertainty exists with the track and speed so expect some changes 
to the forecast next week. The degree of moisture spreading 
northward does lead to some concerns of heavy rainfall and localized 
flash flooding. Precipitable water values increase to 1.50 to 2.00 
inches by early to middle next week. Will introduce the possibility 
of heavy rainfall and localized flash flooding for next week into 
the HWO. Temperatures will likely stay a couple of degrees below 
normal given the cloud cover and rainfall.

Low confidence forecast with storms expected to continue to
through the afternoon. Once the western edge of these storms moves
through we should take a break, but then storms should re-develop
as the front moves through in the evening. If a terminal gets
under a storm it will quickly reduce flight categories into the
LIFR range, or possibly lower. Tonight we should see some fog
where heavy rain occurs this afternoon. Have mention of fog in at

.DISCUSSION...
Storms are continuing to increase in strength and coverage this
morning. Main threat to focus on today will be flooding, as these
storms are producing heavy rainfall. Precipitable water values
over the area are over 1.8 inches, and currently locations in the
closer to the Cumberland Plateau down towards Chattanooga are 
around 2 inches. This is well over the 90th percentile and closer 
to the daily max values... Basically this means that these storms 
have a lot of moisture to work with and, even though they are 
moving, they will be able to produce heavy rains over some areas.

Expect these storms to remain over the area through the rest of
the morning and into the afternoon/evening hours. At that time 
there may be enough instability for some of the storms to pulse up
enough to cause strong winds, but the main threat through the day
is still going to be flooding.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A very moist air mass with PW values upwards of 2 inches will be 
over the area today. Early this morning, convection is already 
developing over the Plateau. This appears to be associated with a 
pre-frontal trough, while the main cold front is located across 
IN/srn IL. The hi-res models agree on convection increasing this 
morning along the trough, spreading east and south through the 
afternoon. Given the high moisture content and tall, skinny CAPE 
profiles in forecast soundings, any storms will have the potential 
to dump copious amounts of rain in a short time, and will mention 
locally heavy rain with a potential for flash flooding in the HWO. 
Severe storms appear unlikely due to the lack of shear and the 
aforementioned skinny CAPE profiles. With mostly cloudy skies 
expected and morning precip, high temps should be cooler than the 
past few days, mainly in the mid/upper 80s for most of the Valley. 
PoPs will continue through tonight as the front makes its way into 
the area and stalls, but with the 500 mb trough axis moving off to 
our east and drier air moving in on a NW flow aloft, activity should 
only be scattered to isolated with highest chances in southern
sections.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)... 
Upper troughing will be present across the Eastern CONUS on 
Friday with a surface front becoming stationary from E-W across 
southern Tennessee. North of this boundary will be a drier and 
more stable airmass; whereas, south of the boundary, an unstable 
and moist airmass will persist. There is some uncertainty in the 
exact location of this stationary front on Friday, but guidance is
in good agreement at placing the front, and highest PoPs, 
generally south of Interstate 40. Highest PoPs will be expected 
during the afternoon and evening peak heating hours.

What remains of this front is expected to lift north Friday night 
and Saturday as low-level southerly flow increases on the eastern 
side of current PTC2. Due to the uncertainties of PTC2, forecast 
uncertainty is higher from Saturday through the remainder of the 
extended. Model guidance shows the potential for more convection, 
especially across southern portions of the forecast area, on 
Saturday. However, there are differences in the synoptic setup 
between model guidance that would have significant impacts on our 
weather. Ignoring these differences for the moment, there is 
confidence in additional scattered convection along and south of the 
stationary/warm front on Saturday where instability will be highest. 
For this reason, have likely scattered convection forecast for 
Saturday afternoon across southern portions of the forecast area. 
However, depending upon the strength of the low-level southerly flow 
around PTC2 and its exact track, we could have more widespread 
convection. The GFS is currently one of the most bullish on QPF for 
Saturday, and unsurprisingly, is one of the eastern and generally 
weaker track solutions which brings a broad 850mb jet and strong low-
level convergence into our area. Other guidance continues to place 
the strongest 850mb flow to our west, and this would keep our area 
drier. At this time, tend to lean more toward the ECMWF and Canadian 
which keep the majority of convection to our south and west. While 
uncertainty is high for coverage of convection on Saturday, this 
will need to be watched closely over the next couple of days, 
because if the GFS is correct, some heavy rainfall and flooding 
concerns may be enhanced across SE TN and SW NC.

Similar uncertainty exists on Sunday, but at this time, expect 
mainly diurnal scattered convection with PTC2 as it moves inland 
over the Southern Mississippi Valley. Highest chance PoPs are 
currently across southwestern portions of the forecast area which 
are most likely to be impacted by any outer rainbands enhancing 
convergence and mesoscale convective coverage. Otherwise, SW flow 
aloft and high clouds should keep temperatures a few degrees below 
normal.

Next week, the two big questions will be: 1) The exact track of PTC2 
as it transitions into an open wave; and 2) The magnitude and 
location of the ridge as it builds across the SE CONUS. As for the 
track of PTC2, current model guidance is in agreement with it 
reaching the Ohio Valley and moving eastward as it encounters 
stronger westerly flow. The impact on our weather from this will be 
the tropical airmass associated with the low-level center of this 
system where PW values of 2.0 to 2.4 inches will be present. An 
airmass such as this would bring the potential of localized heavy 
rainfall and flash flooding concerns toward the middle of next week. 
Confidence is still very low on the track of this system and the 
impacts to our weather next week, but it is something that bears 
watching over the coming days. Confidence in temperatures through 
the extended is much lower than normal because of the track and 
associated effects of PTC2.

.DISCUSSION...The current forecast for the overnight into daytime
hours Thursday appears to be on track with enough moisture and
low level convergence for a few isolated showers and even a
thunderstorm. Model forecasts continue to indicate greater
coverage of showers and thunderstorms on Thursday as a slow moving
upper trough drags a weak cool frontal boundary into the region.
Will tweak min temperatures up a degree or two in a few spots on
the Cumberland Plateau and across Southwest Virginia. There will
be a few more mid deck clouds around and dewpoint temperatures are
just a bit higher than 24 hours ago.

.AVIATION...Except for some of the higher terrain features near
the North Carolina border, the process of convection is having 
difficulty producing a shower or thunderstorm that lasts more than
a minute or two. Therefore, the terminals may be free from 
precipitation tonight. However, deep moist convection should 
develop more readily across the Great Valley on Thursday as the 
Great Lakes through Mid Mississippi Valley upper trough presses 
east. In this environment, a vicinity shower group was used from 
around 12-18z and then as a surface cool front makes progress onto
the Cumberland Plateau later in the forecast period, a prevailing
thunder group was forecast in an increasingly buoyant airmass.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Diurnally driven showers have already formed early this afternoon. 
Sensors are indicating that these storms haven't produced any 
lightning in the area, but they should continue to slowly increase 
in strength through the rest of the afternoon and into the evening. 
Still generally under the influence of high pressure through the 
rest of the day, so these storms won't have any synoptic forcing to 
help them strengthen. The front from the northwest is still expected 
to move through on Thursday. High Resolution Convective Allowing 
Models are wanting to either maintain or possibly redevelop weak 
convection late tonight into early tomorrow as the front approaches. 
Not a high confidence in this happening, but will keep low end 
precipitation chances overnight in case the influence of the 
approaching front is stronger than previously thought and storms are 
able to occur overnight.

If any location gets a decent downpour overnight we could see some 
patchy fog early tomorrow morning. But at this time widespread fog 
doesn't look likely and fog will hopefully be contained to areas 
that get some rain showers this afternoon.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
The extended range fcst period kicks off on Thursday night amidst an 
increasingly active pattern across the southeast CONUS thanks to an 
H5 trough moving through the OH Valley, and PTC Two moving through 
the northern GOM.  At the surface, a cold front will be approaching 
the region from the west beneath the aforementioned H5 trough, with 
a modestly unstable warm sector out ahead, thus prefrontal 
scattered/numerous thunderstorms are favored.  Fortunately the bulk 
of the upper dynamic support will remain north of the region, 
however guidance does favor around 20-30kts deep layer shear amidst 
2-3k j/kg sbcape. Thus, won't rule out a few strong/severe 
thunderstorms early on in the period with damaging winds, hail, 
brief heavy rainfall, and cloud to ground lightning being the 
primary threats. With that, SPC has placed the entire region in the 
Marginal Risk.

Moving forward through the remainder of the period, uncertainty in 
prevalent as guidance tends to stall the noted cold front somewhere 
near/along the US 64 corridor, possibly southward into north GA, all 
complicated by the eventual track of PTC Two (which has it's own 
inherent uncertainty).  As for PTC Two, NHC currently has the fcst 
track center making landfall across southwest LA as its driven 
westward by the developing/strengthen Bermuda High on Saturday, 
perhaps as a Hurricane.  Closer to home the airmass will continually 
moisten thanks to increasing flux from the GOM, consequent of PTC 
Two.  Therefore, uncertainty in the forecast beyond Saturday is 
high, with the possibility of heavy rainfall accumulations still up 
in the air.  Thus, favored likely pops across the southern 
valley/plateau and mtns both Friday/Saturday, with chance pops for 
the remainder of the region.  Beyond that, leaned toward WPC pops 
which favor chances southward, slight chances northward.  Given the 
intruding fropa as well as gulf moisture advection, sky cover should 
increase with the ridge centered over the Western Atlantic, thus 
temperatures through the period should return to around or slightly 
below normal levels.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Very little change in the synoptic pattern is expected today across 
the region. A mid/upper level ridge will contine to be located over 
West TN extending NE across KY/OH/PA, with low pressure systems over 
the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. One feature of note is a 700 
mb deformation zone over the Appalachians, which should make the 
higher elevations the favored area for afternoon convection. In the 
Valley, storms will be possible as outflow boundaires move through 
the low 70s dewpoint air mass, but coverage should be more isolated. 
Any storms will be slow moving in the weak steering flow, and while 
their life cycle should be short lived, locally heavy rain may be 
possible. Most activity will dissipate after sunset but will keep 
slight chance PoPs going through the night as the mid/upper ridge 
weakens and a shortwave trough approaches from the northwest. 

Based on the trends of the past few days, will have high temps
today a little above guidance - lower to mid 90s across the
Valley.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Wednesday)... 
Confidence is high early in the forecast period with scattered 
likely convection across the area on Thursday afternoon and 
evening. A shortwave diving southeast will amplify troughing 
across the Ohio Valley and Central Appalachians resulting in a 
weakening of the ridge and height falls across the Tennessee 
Valley by Thursday afternoon. An associated surface cold front 
will be moving southeastward and its forward motion will begin to 
slow as the surface low occludes across Quebec. While the main 
surface low and upper dynamics will remain further north of our 
forecast area, the resulting height falls and forcing along the 
surface front will increase probabilities of scattered showers and
thunderstorms late Thursday and Thursday night. Most guidance 
favors decent instability with at least 1000 to 2000 J/Kg MLCAPE. 
Deep layer shear will be weak across the area, but it will be 
strongest across NE TN and SW VA closer to the upper jet. In these
areas, effective deep layer shear of 30 kt is possible which will
favor better thunderstorm organization and the potential of some 
multicell convection. The main risk will be for damaging wind 
gusts with any severe thunderstorms that develop. With a high 
freezing level and WBZ level near 11k ft, do not expect much of a 
risk of severe hail, but some subsevere hail is possible with the 
strongest thunderstorms. Low level moisture is also going to be 
very high ahead of the cold front. Guidance is in good agreement 
showing a 2.0+ inch PW plume along and ahead of the front. This 
will favor some localized heavy rainfall and the potential for 
some localized flooding concerns.

The front is expected to dip south on Friday with the highest PoPs 
across southern sections of the forecast area where scattered 
convection will continue, mainly in the afternoon. North of the 
front, Friday is forecast to be mostly dry. What remains of the 
front may initiate a few thunderstorms on Saturday or Sunday across 
the area, but most convection is expected to be diurnal and 
clustered across the higher elevations. With most areas north of the 
front and a general troughing pattern across the Eastern CONUS, 
temperatures should be near normal.

Late in the weekend and early next week, uncertainty remains high 
and our weather will likely be influenced by the track of the 
potential tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico. The 0z guidance 
continues to show large spread in track with a clustering showing 
landfall in LA and the center moving north through the Mississippi 
River Valley between a weakness in the ridge. The main result of 
this for our area would be an increase in moist, southerly flow with 
scattered thunderstorms primarily in the afternoon hours. Did not go 
higher than chance PoPs during this time period because of the 
continued uncertainty in the timing and track of this tropical low.

Ridging is expected to increase across the Southeast CONUS early 
next week with the Canadian, GFS, and ECMWF all indicating the 
potential for 500mb heights of 592+ dam by next Tuesday. Isolated 
afternoon thunderstorms would be mainly limited to the higher 
elevations. Based on the stronger ridge, temperatures are expected 
to be above normal.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...

Scattered convection is ongoing this afternoon across mainly the
higher terrain. Chances for storms in the valley will remain low
this afternoon and evening, mainly in the 20-30 percent range.
Some outflow boundaries from higher elevation storms could push
into the valley and help initiate some convection there. However
steering flow is northwesterly today so the more likely scenario
would be storms initiating over the plateau would need to push off
into the valley, and outside of the elevated terrain near Frozen
Head State Park the CU field along the plateau region has looked
rather unimpressive so far today. Again, have some 20-30 PoPs in 
the forecast for lower elevations this evening, but that may be 
optimistic in the end.

Convective trends will take a downturn this evening after sunset,
with no rain chances to speak by late this evening. Lows tonight 
will be similar to the past few nights, with temperatures in the 
upper 60s to around 70. Tomorrow should be much the same as today 
as high pressure remains anchored overhead. Expect scattered 
storms to develop over the mountains by late morning, with again a
chance of a few of them drifting into the valley during the late 
afternoon and evening hours.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...

Another round of diurnally driven convection will likely occur on 
Wednesday with another warm day in store for us. These showers and 
thunderstorms won't really be aided by any significant synoptic 
forcing, so still think the most favorable area for convection will 
be along and near the higher elevations, or any potential outflows 
left behind by previous storms.

More widespread and stronger showers and thunderstorms look more 
likely on Thursday under a more favorable synoptic pattern. Upper 
level trough will be moving across the Ohio Valley on Thursday, 
along with it a surface low will pull across a cold front over the 
Eastern portions of the United States. These will help be the focus 
for showers and thunderstorms on Thursday. Looking more specifically 
over the Eastern Tennessee Valley the atmosphere does look to pose 
the potential for some strong to severe storms. The NAM is the most 
bullish with MLCAPE values generally above 2000 J/kg across the area 
while other models are a little more modest with values closer to 
1000-2000 J/kg. Almost all the models are indicating that there be 
very little shear to work with through any portion of the 
atmosphere. PWAT values on Thursday look to be about 1.5 - 2.0 
inches as well. These parameters are lining up to indicate the 
biggest threats with storms on Thursday will be strong winds and 
heavy rainfall in the strongest storms. 

Forecast models indicate the the front will stall out east of the 
forecast area, but west of the Atlantic. This will help to keep 
temperatures a bit more moderate with generally light northerly to 
westerly flow through the rest of the work week and into the weekend.

Forecast certainty begins to drop as we move through the weekend, 
mostly with respect to how the Tropical Disturbance in the Gulf will 
behave. Long range models are in somewhat general agreement that the 
storm will move towards the TX/LA coast and then begin to move 
northward. The biggest unknown is how strong will this system be and 
how much moisture will it be able to bring in from the Gulf. If it 
continues to strengthen and is able to draw up move moisture on the 
eastern side we may experience periods of heavy rain along the 
Cumberland Plateau down towards Chattanooga at some point next week. 
However, forecast confidence is very low at this time, but the 
tropical system will be worth keeping an eye on over the next 
several days.

Did include some VCTS this afternoon at KTRI and KCHA where high

convection nearing the terminals. Fog development was limited, at
best, in the TN valley this morning so went with a persistence
forecast and did not include fog at any terminal for tomorrow

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A weak surface low will be located over southern AL today, with an 
inverted trough extending across northern AL through the TN Valley. 
Models indicate that this trough will be a focus for convective 
development this afternoon, but each model has varying degrees of 
coverage. In any case, PoPs will have to be raised from the previous 
forecast, especially in SW NC/SE TN which will have a SE low level 
flow on the eastern side of the trough. There is still dry air in 
the mid/upper levels that storms will have to contend with, so the 
forecast will keep coverage scattered to isolated this afternoon. 
Some activity could persist after sunset with the surface trough and 
outflow boundaries, but most will likely dissipate by midnight. Some 
spots in the southern TN Valley, particularly CHA, could see heat 
indicies briefly reach around 100 this afternoon.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)... 
The long term period begins with ridging building across the 
Central CONUS. Ridging will also be in place across the Southeast 
and Eastern CONUS with an amplifying trough across the upper 
Mississippi Valley. With minimal synoptic forcing across our area 
on Wednesday, expect highest diurnal PoPs to be primarily across 
the higher elevations with outflows potentially leading to a few 
showers or thunderstorms across the valley late in the afternoon. 
With strong ridging still in place, temperatures should remain 
several degrees above normal.

Afternoon convective activity will decrease after sunset Wednesday 
night while a shortwave trough across northern Illinois moves 
southeast. This will act to amplify the trough across the Ohio 
Valley with height falls extending into the Tennessee Valley. An 
associated surface low will be across the Great Lakes with a 
trailing cold front moving southeast across the Ohio Valley toward 
our area on Thursday. As the front approaches the area and the ridge 
weakens, PoPs will increase on Thursday afternoon. Effective bulk 
shear remains weak, which is common this time of year, so 
significant organized severe weather is not expected. However, the 
NAM does indicate the potential for MLCAPE of 2000 to 3000 J/Kg on 
Thursday afternoon along with high PW values around 2.0 inches. This 
could lead to a few strong to marginally severe thunderstorms with 
heavy rainfall and downburst winds being the primary hazards. This 
front is expected to stall across southern TN or northern AL/GA by 
Friday with drier weather north of the boundary. Temperatures will 
be closer to normal late week as the ridge weakens. Model consensus 
is in reasonable agreement through Friday.

Beyond Friday, high uncertainty in the forecast exists, and our 
weather may be influenced by the potential tropical system in the 
Gulf of Mexico. The 0z track guidance on the low has significant 
spread, and expect models to have a difficult time with the track 
until the tropical low is better developed and resolved during data 
assimilation. At this time, a majority of guidance increases ridging 
across the area through the weekend with dry weather on Saturday to 
the north of the previously mentioned cold front. PoPs increase on 
Sunday into early next week with a general summer-like diurnal trend 
as low-level moisture increases and NW flow provides a chance for 
convective systems to move southeastward across our region. Because 
of the poor model agreement in the potential track of the tropical 
low, confidence is very low late in the extended.

.DISCUSSION...

Radar imagery is clear across the forecast area. There is a shower
near Clay County NC and have continued with a slight chance for a
shower/storm there over the next hour or so. Elsewhere, have went
ahead and removed PoPs from the update with the loss of daytime
heating. The other forecast challenge is the coverage of fog 
tonight. The coverage of precipitation was limited this afternoon
and evening and have cut back on the extent of fog overnight. The
best chances for fog will be near areas lakes and rivers. Fog 
will lift shortly after sunrise. Overnight lows will range from 
mid 60s to low 70s for most locations.

.AVIATION...

VFR conditions currently across the terminals with just an
isolated shower or two. Expect coverage of showers will continue
to decrease over the next hour or two with dry conditions
overnight. Fog formation will be the biggest challenge for the TAF
forecast. The coverage of showers/storms this afternoon/evening
has been rather limited and backed off on the fog a bit. Went with
MVFR conditions at TYS and TRI near sunrise and VFR at CHA. For
now, have not introduced VCTS to the TAFs for tomorrow afternoon
with no synoptic lift and best moisture to the southeast and west
of the terminals.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
Isolated to scattered convection has been forming this afternoon across
the forecast area. Highest concentration of storms has been from 
the VA/KY border down towards Chattanooga. There appears to be the
slightest of weak temp/wind gradient here (along with some 
orographic influence) that may be aiding in the additional 
convection in this area. Expect showers and thunderstorms to 
continue through this afternoon and eventually dissipate as the 
sun sets and diurnal heating stops. Trend of these storms is for 
them to be pretty short-lived and very little lightning in them so
far. Biggest threat right now would be from a quick downpour 
leading to gusty winds or maybe some isolated flooding. Stronger 
storms have formed further south in GA, so will keep an eye 
towards the southern TN/NC/GA border in case a strong storm is 
able to flare up before the afternoon is done.

Dew point values remain relatively elevated and with these
additional storms as well looks like we're in for another round 
of fog in parts of the area early tomorrow morning, similar to 
what we saw early this morning.

Once the fog is able to burn off we can expect to see another day
of slightly above normal temperatures and possible showers and
thunderstorms in the afternoon.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday Night through Monday)...
The extended will begin in a common summer type pattern with an 
upper ridge over the central U.S. extending into the 
area...placing the Southern Appalachian Region under a relatively 
dry northwesterly flow. This pattern will allow the air mass to 
weakly destabilized with little upper support and minimal shear to
work with. As a result...expect mainly diurnally driven 
convection centered over higher elevations with only a stray storm
moving into the low terrain. Will see a pattern change Wednesday 
night into Thursday as a weakening frontal boundary pushes 
southward and into the area. The front will act as a focus for 
convection as the air mass ahead of the boundary become unstable 
and low level moisture remains in place. This should create a line
of more organized thunderstorm activity across the area. The 
front will eventually settle south across the area before stalling
and becoming even more diffuse just south of the TN border. 

For the rest of the extended...confidence becomes quite low.  This 
is mainly in regards to an area of low pressure developing over the 
Gulf.  This low is expected to deepen and potentially take on some 
tropical characteristics.  Models in poor agreement with the 
position...track...timing and overall handling of the low. The GFS 
wants to have part of energy of the low funneled into the stalled 
front allowing these remnants to track along the boundary Friday 
into the weekend.  The rest or main part of the low then rotates 
around the coast eventually becoming incorporated into the boundary 
and other short waves riding through the flow.  On the other 
hand...the ECMWF trends towards maintaining the low over the Gulf 
through much of the weekend and eventually lifts it northward 
through the Mississippi Valley with the current run tracking it well 
to our west late in the extended period. With such significantly 
different scenarios...will basically keep the current thinking in 
place which focuses more on the old frontal boundary to our south. 
This will mean little to no PoPs north and at least a low to chance 
PoPs south from Friday through the end of the period.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The shortwave trough that enhanced convection yesterday will be 
south of our area today, with high pressure to the north building 
slightly southward. With a northerly flow through the column, drier 
midlevel air will be building in today, and as a result we should 
see much less coverge of afternoon shower and t'storms. There will 
be no cap so isolated showers could develop anywhere, but the 
mountains will be favored for chance PoPs this afternoon as there 
will be a weak upslope flow. Any convection should dissipate with 
sunset.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)... 
Pattern becomes drier with expanding upper ridge over the South 
Central and Southeast States Tuesday and Wednesday. Expecting only
isolated showers and thunderstorms during the peak heating hours 
in the valleys and chance of showers and thunderstorms eastern 
mountains. Another pattern change on Thursday as an upper trough 
carves a path into the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley and pushes a 
weak front through the Tennessee Valley. Scattered to numerous 
showers and storms to affect the region. Also late in the week a 
Low pressure area in the northern Gulf may take on tropical 
characteristics and move northward into the southeast states. 
Thursdays front will likely only make it just into Georgia and the
Carolinas before becoming stationary or moving back north. Chance
pops will continue for the eastern mountains and slight chance 
elsewhere except dry extreme northwest and north. Models diverge 
with the tropical system so uncertainty exists in the path after 
Friday. It appears the best guess for the last 2 days will be 
chance of showers and storms southeast half and slight chance to 
dry farther north and northwest. Temperatures through the extended
will be near to slightly above normal. The warmest day Tuesday in
the upper 80s to near 90 north and lower to mid 90s south. Only a
degree or 2 cooler the rest of the period. Best coverage of 
showers and storms in the extended will be Thursday which may keep
highs even lower that day.

.DISCUSSION...

The radar this evening is pretty clear except for a few scattered
showers/storms slowly drifting southward across the southern
valley. Due to this, went ahead and did an early update this
evening to lower PoPs across the northern 3/4's of the forecast
area and to increase PoPs in the near term for the southern
valley. Expect, most of the activity will come to an end over the
next couple of hours with the loss of daytime heating. 
Temperatures have dropped down into the low to mid 70s across a 
large part of the forecast area thanks to the widespread 
showers/storms earlier this afternoon/evening. Dewpoints are in 
the upper 60s to mid 70s this evening. Due to this, expect there 
will be more widespread fog tonight than the last couple of nights
and for the update bumped up the timing of fog formation by a 
couple of hours. Fog should lift rather quickly after sunrise.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

Not a lot going on in the short term. Scattered convection is
ongoing once again this afternoon and this will continue into the
evening hours. Chances for any severe storms are low, so this will
be mainly of the garden variety type, with beneficial rains.
High resolution guidance suggests there is perhaps a chance of an
isolated shower or two continuing into the overnight hours.
However, think that typical diurnal trends will win over and there
will be a significant downturn in convection after sunset this
evening. Temperatures tonight should be similar to those seen in
recent nights, with lows in the upper 60s and low 70s. Did
continue with mention of fog, especially in the north where
rainfall will have been prevalent both yesterday and this
afternoon/evening.

For tomorrow, the region will lie beneath weak northwesterly mid
and upper level flow. Surface winds will be light northerly,
however no change in air mass will have occurred as surface high 
pressure remains anchored to our west. So it will be just as hot
and humid as today. Do expect less coverage of showers and
thunderstorms tomorrow however. Most convection should be held in
the higher terrain thanks to persistent upslope northwesterly flow
in the mid levels.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...

An upper ridge will continue to expand across the region early in
the extended. This will place the area under a bit drier 
northwesterly flow and put us in a normal summer pattern. This 
means the main concern through Wednesday will be diurnally driven 
convection. The area with the best chance of thunderstorm activity
will be over higher elevations with a few storms occasionally 
dropping into the valley. There will be a pattern chance on 
Thursday as a weakening frontal boundary moves south and into the 
Southern Appalachian Region. This front will be the main focus of 
convection Thursday/Thursday evening with the added lift combined 
with a weakly unstable atmosphere and plenty of low level moisture
in place. As a result...should see chance to likely PoPs for this
time frame. The front will settle southward across the area and 
eventually end up south of the TN/GA border with high pressure 
building in. However...models are indicating a low moving in from 
the gulf. Confidence quite low in regards to position...track and 
timing of the low. With this overall synoptic pattern through the 
end of the period...expect the best chance of thunderstorms over 
higher elevations and along far southern locations Friday though 
the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Showers and storms continued well past midnight over northeast
Tennessee as a complex of storms developed over Greene County and
then spread into Washington and Sullivan Counties. Some locally
heavy rain fell in that area. The storms have decreased to showers
now. Patchy fog will likely form over northern sections of the
forecast area where significant rain fell as clouds decrease. 
Southern areas were mostly dry Saturday so fog not likely there. 
Weak frontal system over the Ohio Valley will shift south today 
and tonight as upper trough moves south from the northeast and mid
atlantic states and upper level ridge shifts to the southwest.
This front will be a trigger for showers and thunderstorms to 
develop in the very humid airmass over the region. Temperatures 
are again very warm this morning with lower 70s north and 
northeast to mid and upper 70s south. Raised highs a couple 
degrees south and central valley as temperatures will start out 
warm and convection should not become at least scattered until 
early afternoon. The biggest threat with storms that develop today
will be locally heavy rainfall due to the high moisture content 
and slow movement. Precipitable Water values are about 1.8 to 2.0 
inches and CAPE Values 2000 to 3000 J/KG. With approaching front 
late today and tonight, storms may linger longer in the evening. 
Patchy fog again probable tonight. Rain chances will reach a high 
of about 60 percent late afternoon and then 30 to 50 percent by 
early evening decreasing to slight chance late tonight. Lows will 
stay warm again near 70 to the mid 70s. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)... A large ridge over the 
Plains today will expand eastward for the beginning of the work 
week. This will place the Southern Appalachian Region in a drier 
northwest flow aloft. As a result, we will transition into a more 
diurnally-driven convective pattern. Models indicate that a trough
will be dropping south across the Mid Atlantic region on Monday 
to VA/NC on Tuesday, which will favor our NE TN/SW VA counties for
the highest rain chances both days, but still with just scattered
coverage expected at best. On Wednesday behind this trough and 
with the mid/upper ridge overhead, we should see only isolated 
coverage of showers and thunderstorms, mainly focused on the 
higher terrain areas. 

On Thursday a low pressure system crosses the Great Lakes region, 
bringing a cold front toward our area. This will add a little more 
forcing for better chances of convection Thursday afternoon. Still, 
with a west to northwest midlevel flow ahead of it and the Gulf 
being cut off, PoPs will be held in the chance range. The front 
should move out Thursday night with high pressure building in for 
Friday and Saturday, providing drier, more stable air. Will keep 
most of the area dry both days with slightly above normal 
temperatures, except for a slight chance in the mountains along the 
NC border.

.DISCUSSION...

Currant radar imagery indicates a few isolated showers/storms 
across the forecast area. Coverage continues to diminish with the 
loss of daytime heating. For the update, lowers PoPs in the near 
term into the overnight period. Most of the rainfall today 
occurred across NE TN and SW VA. Expect these locations will have 
the best chance for fog formation overnight. For the update, 
extended patchy fog throughout most of the forecast area near 
daylight. Dewpoints are in the upper 60s to low 70s with mostly 
clear conditions looking at the IR Satellite imagery and this will
aid in fog formation overnight. Lows overnight will range from 
the mid 60s to low 70s.

VFR conditions currently across the terminals with the coverage 
of showers/storms fairly limited currently. Due to this, went 
ahead and removed VCTS from the terminals for the current 
issuance. Will continue to watch the radar and make any amendments

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

A weak shortwave with associated surface trough is shifting east
through middle Tennessee this afternoon. Visible satellite imagery
shows this feature nicely, with plenty of towering CU along a N-S
oriented line south of I-40 and to the west of Nashville. Current
forward speed would have this arriving over the southern plateau
around 10pm this evening, however high resolution guidance has 
this feature falling apart after sunset this evening. Locally, 
there are some scattered showers and thunderstorms over mainly 
northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia with little elsewhere 
in the CWA. Suspect this will continue to be the case through the 
evening, with the best rain chances over areas north of the I-40 
corridor. That said, did not leave the forecast dry for southern
areas as I am not confident that line of storms to our west will
completely fall apart before it gets to the southern
plateau/valley area.

For the overnight period, dropped mention of rain from the
forecast as diurnal trends should prevail as far as convective
trends go. Did include some fog again tonight as it was present 
in a few river valleys this morning. And rainfall across the
northern areas should lead to more fog than was seen this morning.
Still, think patchy wording is likely the best approach.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

Scattered convection will continue into Sunday early evening. 
Coverage should decrease with the loss of daytime heating and the 
air mass slowly begins to stabilized. Most locations will be dry 
by midnight but a few showers/thunderstorms may linger over the 
higher elevations through the night. Then...there will be a 
pattern change during the early part of the work week. The upper 
ridge over the central U.S. will shift/expand eastward and begin 
to dominate area weather. This will place the Southern Appalachian
Region in a drier northwest flow aloft. As a result...we will 
transition into a more diurnally driven convective pattern with 
the main area of concern centered over higher elevations with only
an occasional storm dropping into the lower terrain. On 
Thursday...a broad and weakening frontal boundary pushes into the 
area. This will add sufficient lift and be a focus for convection 
Thursday afternoon. The front should move out Thursday night with 
high pressure building in for Friday and Saturday and the boundary
settling to our south. This will bring in a more stable air mass 
and decrease the chance of thunderstorm activity with the main 
chance of convection over southern areas and across the higher 
elevations.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Showers and thunderstorms ended within an hour after midnight with 
skies mostly clear north and partly to mostly cloudy south closer
to storms across Georgia early this morning. Temperatures at 400
AM were very warm in the lower to mid 70s with dewpoints in the
upper 60s to lower 70s. Fog has not formed as of yet but will
likely only be patchy...especially where rain fell Friday 
afternoon and evening. For today upper trough over mid Mississippi
Valley and lower Ohio Valley will approach middle Tennessee this 
afternoon. Expect increase of showers and thunderstorms as early 
as late this morning or early afternoon first northern plateau and
higher elevations of the mountains then spread into the valleys 
late afternoon and early evening. Have coverage 40 to 50 percent 
with higher chances plateau and mountains. Rainfall amounts 
expected around one half inch but locally higher amounts possible.
Storms will decrease in the evening but still could be widely 
scattered to scattered late evening as upper trough approaches. 
Expect more fog late night tonight. Lows tonight will again be 
mild near 70 to the lower to mid 70s.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)... A weak mid to upper level
trough will be across the Southern Appalachian region on Sunday. 
Deep moisture will remain in place with PWs near 2 inches and 
MLCAPE values on Sunday afternoon reaching to 1000 to 2000 J/Kg. 
Forcing will be weak but it will not take much to initiate 
convection. With the weak flow at mid levels, storm movement 
should be rather slow, giving the potential for localized heavy 
rainfall. The unstable air mass will provide the potential for a 
few stray strong to severe storms. 

High pressure over the Plains slowly shifts east early in the work 
week, setting up a drier northwest flow aloft across the TN Valley 
region. For Monday through Wednesday, any convection will be diurnal 
and focused over higher elevations with only a stray storm moving 
into the low terrain. By the end of the period...model and run 
consistency lessens and confidence lowers but there is indications a 
weakening and rather diffuse frontal boundary will move through 
around the Thursday time frame, adding some additional lift across 
the area for a better chance of convection across the entire area. A 
decrease in the chance of thunderstorms on Friday with high pressure 
and drier air aloft building back in.

.DISCUSSION...
A few showers and thunderstorms continue to move east across parts
of the area tonight. These should gradually come to an end.
Temperatures are currently in the upper 70s to low 80s with light
winds. Convection this afternoon and evening seems to be driven 
primarily from an upper level disturbance located across the 
Midsouth and outflow interactions. The rest of the night should 
feature decreasing PoPs. The HRRR and RAP are both in agreement 
with this, however the RAP has been indicating precipitation to 
move into the area around the early to mid morning time frame. 
While confidence in this is low, the upper level disturbance will 
drift closer to the area and this supports keeping slight chance 
PoPs in the forecast. Made updates to hourly temperatures and 
dewpoints to better fit latest trends. These updated grids have 
been published.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...

Water vapor imagery shows a weak upper low centered over Arkansas
this afternoon, with another upper low/wave over the Ohio/West
Virginia border. Locally, plenty of shower activity has developed
since the late morning hours but they have been mostly south of 
the I-40 corridor. Suspect that the lull in convective activity 
across far northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia is largely 
to subsidence on the backside of the WV upper low. However, much 
of the guidance indicates that some convection appears likely 
later on this afternoon. Further west a notable wave of storms is 
progressing east through middle Tennessee. This will sweep into 
the southern half of the CWA this evening.

Overnight, diurnal trends should result in a decline in convection
tonight. PoP forecasts reflect this, with no mention of rainfall
overnight. Some hires guidance shows another wave of storms moving
into the south after midnight tonight, but feel this might be too
aggressive so trended PoPs downward. However, tomorrow will be
much the same as today and storms should fire over the higher
terrain within a few hours after daybreak.

Otherwise, not much to talk about. Temperatures will be similar to
today, with highs in the upper 80s to around 90. Did include some
patchy fog in the forecast again tonight as conditions seem
favorable. Most of it will be confined to river valleys, but
patchy fog across the valley will be a possibility.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...

Saturday night into Sunday...a weak mid level trough will push 
across the area. At the surface...deep low level moisture remains 
in place with PWs near 2 inches and CAPE values on Sunday 
afternoon reaching to 1500 to 2500J/Kg. An area of low pressure 
will track through and all of this will result in scattered and 
occasional widespread convection. With the weak flow at mid 
levels...storm movement should be rather slow and this combined 
with good low level moisture will allow the for potential for 
localized heavy rainfall. The unstable air mass will provide the 
potential for a few stray strong to severe storms. 

High pressure slowly shifts east early in the work week setting 
up a drier northwest flow aloft across the Southern Appalachian 
Region. Though a couple of minor impulses ride through the upper 
flow...the main concern will be diurnal convection Monday through 
Wednesday and this should be focused over higher elevations with 
only a stray storm moving into the low terrain. By the end of the 
period...model and run consistency lessens and confidence lowers 
but there is indications a weakening and rather diffuse frontal 
boundary will move through around the Thursday time frame adding 
some additional lift across the area for a better chance of 
convection across the entire area. A decrease in the chance of 
thunderstorms on Friday with high pressure building back in.

.DISCUSSION...

Fog has cleared out of most all valley locations this morning so a
morning update was required to remove early morning wording in the
zones. Otherwise the forecast appears to be in good shape. Did
slow down the increase in rain chances today as I felt morning
PoPs were too high in general. However, felt afternoon trends and
values were very reasonable given current pattern so changes to
the PoP forecast were more timing related than anything.

Expect to see showers and thunderstorms pop up over the
mountainous areas of VA, TN, and western NC by midday, with the 
plateau filling in shortly thereafter. Valley locations will also
see some storms more in the late afternoon and early evening 
hours. Temperatures should be close to those seen yesterday, with 
highs near 90 in the mid and southern parts of the valley, and 
upper 80s in southwest VA, and the northern TN valley.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Convection ended by late evening across the forecast area with
skies partly to mostly cloudy and some added smoke possibly
allowed for more fog formation in areas that saw showers during
the evening. The area that had evening rainfall was the northern 
plateau and parts of the northern Tennessee Valley north of 
Knoxville. Fog was forming by midnight in these areas and was 
locally dense across parts of the northern plateau early this 
morning. Will watch to see how much area has the fog and could put
out special weather statement if conditions worsen. Temperatures 
early today were in the upper 60s to lower 70s at this hour. Most 
of the cloud debris from evening storms was only across northeast 
sections. Expect another day of scattered storms as upper ridge 
holds over the area one more day. Upper trough over the 
Mississippi Valley begins to move east toward the western 
Tennessee Valley during the day today. Precipitable water values 
reach around 1.8 inches with weak deep layer shear and instability
values about the same as Thursdays. Storms will be more numerous 
in the higher elevations with some storms producing locally heavy 
rainfall amounts...however no flooding expected. Temperatures 
will be in the lower 90s around Chattanooga and possibly 
Knoxville and Oak Ridge with heat index values mid to upper 90s. 
Expect showers and storms to decrease by sunset but clouds 
lingering overnight. Where there is clearing and rainfall patchy 
fog forms again.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...
On Saturday, we will have a weak mid to upper level trough over 
Middle TN/northern AL, with PW values in the neighborhood of 2 
inches, and plentiful CAPE. While forcing with the trough appears 
weak, it will only take a nudge to get storms to develop on 
Saturday, so the forecast of likely PoPs with an emphasis on the 
afternoon hours will be continued. Sunday looks much the same as 
the trough slowly drifts SE to GA, and high moisture content 
remains in place. Any storms that develop both days will be slow 
moving, creating the potential for locally heavy downpours and 
potential for flooding. 

A trend toward drier conditions should begin on Monday as the trough 
moves away and a building ridge over the Plains begins to have a 
greater influence over the TN Valley region. We will be in a 
northwesterly flow regime that will provide a drier air mass for 
Monday through Thursday, lowering rain chances to the low to slight 
chance range. The focus of diurnal convection will likely be over 
the higher terrain areas each day. There may be a possibility of 
upstream convection that develops on the northern periphery of the 
ridge to move into our area, but such details are too uncertain to 
pinpoint this far out.

.DISCUSSION...
Coverage of showers and thunderstorms have decreased this 
evening as the boundary layer continues to stabilize. Some light 
showers will still be possible from left over convection but even 
this should begin to taper off overnight. Temperatures have been 
modulated by convective activity in some locations, and have tried
to capture this in the hourly temperatures. Otherwise, it looks 
to be a quiet evening with calm winds. Patchy fog will likely 
develop late tonight in some areas and did include this into the 
grids. Updated grids have been published.

categories but did mention VCTS at all sites given the convective
trends this afternoon. This activity should quickly diminish
tonight with mainly upper level clouds present through the night.
There was some concern for lower visibilities impacting TRI
tonight but guidance has backed off that potential. Did not
deviate much from the previous forecast with MVFR fog likely to
develop late tonight. Friday, mainly VFR is expected with convection

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...

Seeing the coverage of showers/storms begin to increase early this 
afternoon as anticipated. Temperatures are currently in the 80s 
across most of the area with dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 70s. 
Upper level flow is weak with 300-500 mb winds around 10 kts or so. 
Due to this, 0-6 km bulk shear values are around 10 kts. SBCAPE 
values are around 1500-2000 J/Kg. Current water vapor imagery and 
RAP upper air analysis indicates a small weak shortwave trough 
across the central Appalachians and another to the southwest across 
the lower Mississippi River Valley. At the surface, there is a 
boundary to the east across the Carolinas. Closer to home, not 
seeing much in the way of synoptic or surface lift but as 
temperatures continue to rise and dewpoints in the upper 60s to low 
70s, expect a typical summer afternoon/evening with diurnally driven 
showers/storms. A few of the storms could become strong with gusty 
winds and small hail being the main risks. The coverage of 
showers/storms will effect some outdoor plans this afternoon but do 
not anticipate a washout. Any ongoing convection will begin to 
diminish in intensity and coverage near sunset with the loss of 
daytime heating. Heat indices this afternoon will also approach 100 
degrees in portions of the central and southern valley. Remember to 
practice heat safety at any outdoor activities this afternoon. Highs 
this afternoon will range from upper 80s to low 90s for most 
locations.

Fog development will be possible again tonight but will depend upon 
the coverage of shower/storms this afternoon. Lows overnight will
range from mid 60s to low 70s.

Atmospheric conditions look to remain relatively unchanged going into 
Friday. The shortwave trough currently over the lower Mississippi 
River Valley will move into the Tennessee River Valley on Friday and 
may provide a bit more synoptic lift for slightly better coverage of 
showers/storms. Deep layer shear will still be low with weak flow 
aloft and SBCAPE values will be similar to maybe even slightly lower 
than today. PW values will remain elevated in the 1.8-2.0 inch 
range, so have continued with 30-60% chances for tomorrow afternoon. 
Best chances will be over the higher elevations with the lower 
chances over the valley. Heat indices will once again be high with 
near 100 degree values in the southern valley and mid 90s in the 
central valley. High temperatures will range from the upper 80s to 
low 90s.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...

The broad upper ridging that has occupied the southeastern U.S. this 
past week will shift south to the Gulf Coast Friday night through 
the weekend with broad upper troughing developing over the OH and TN 
valleys. This will allow a cold front to slowly sag south and 
southwestward through the weekend, and the increasing convergence 
ahead of the front will bring an increase in thunderstorm coverage 
Saturday and Sunday. Chance pops are included all weekend, but the 
highest chances will be in the afternoon and evening hours. MLCAPE 
of 1500-2000 J/kg and 2500-3000 J/kg surface CAPE during the 
afternoons and evenings will combine with steep low-level lapse 
rates of 7.5-8.0 C/km and near 1000 J/kg DCAPE to allow for isolated 
severe storms with damaging downburst winds and small hail, however, 
deep layer shear is almost non existent and mid level lapse rates 
are flat, so any downbursts will be isolated. Individual cores will 
not be able to sustain strong updrafts for long before collapsing in 
this environment. The main impact will be locally heavy rainfall. 
The weak flow aloft will result in slow moving convection, and PWATs 
of 1.50-1.75 inches Saturday and 1.75-2.00+ inches Sunday will cause 
torrential rainfall rates underneath any thunderstorms, so localized 
flash flooding will be possible. Highs will be slightly cooler this 
weekend with the increased cloud cover and convective coverage, so 
stuck close to the cooler MAV guidance. Oppressively humid 
conditions will continue. 

The old front now looks to linger on Monday as the upper trough 
moves into the Northeast U.S. and the upper ridge starts to 
redevelop in the southern Plains putting the southern Appalachians 
in WNW flow. This will keep chance pops for showers/thunderstorms 
with the peak again being during the afternoon and evening. The 
southern Plains ridge will slowly try and build east into the TN 
valley Tuesday and Wednesday allowing highs in the upper 80's to low 
90's to return with lower chances of thunderstorms as the boundary 
gradually pushes back to the northeast and capping increases. A new 
trough developing near the Great Lakes will cause a cold front to 
approach from the north late Thursday, but any increase in 
convection will hold off until after the period.

.DISCUSSION...

Mostly sunny conditions across the forecast area this morning with
temperatures already climbing up into the upper 70s to low 80s. 
Convective temperatures should be realized by late this morning 
into the early afternoon. Models indicate SBCAPE values around 
1500-2000 J/Kg with 0-6 km deep layer shear of 10-20 kts. 
Therefore, do not expect any organized convection but could see a 
few stronger storms with gusty winds and small hail being the main
threats. Best coverage this afternoon will be over the higher 
elevations of east Tennessee where the mountains will add some 
orographic lift. Scattered showers/storms are expected this 
afternoon/evening across the entire area and will impact outdoor 
activities planned for this afternoon. Please stay tuned to the 
latest forecast and products from the National Weather Service. 
Highs today will warm into the upper 80s to lower 90s with heat 
indices approaching 100 degrees in the southern valley.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The synoptic pattern today features some flattening of the 
prevailing H5 ridge across the TN Valley and Southern Appalachian 
region as the primary axis shifts slightly east.  At the surface, 
still looking at weak/mod high pressure spread about the region, 
while numerous remnant convective outflows settle in.  As for this 
morning, any lingering convection will slowly degrade as instability 
wains further into the predawn hours, with any lower stratocu 
expected to sct as well.  With that, still think patchy dense fog is 
possible this morning (closer to daybreak), especially for areas 
that received earlier rainfall.

Moving on, Independence Day looks like another typical summer-like 
day, albeit with above climo pops/temps.  Given that the ridge is 
flattened to some degree, would expect that subsidence is weakened 
as well, therefore did favor widespread chance pops based on a 
diurnal trend while also including some likely pops over the mtns. 
Profiles are very similar to yesterday featuring weak unidirectional 
winds and thus little/no shear, as well as abundant instability. 
Likewise pwats remain high, generally in the 1.7-1.8 inch range 
thereby favoring efficient rain rates. Overall, think once again 
that general thunderstorms will dominate, however a few 
strong/severe storms cannot be ruled out with damaging winds, small 
hail, frequent lightning, and brief heavy rainfall being the primary 
threats. Generally, temperatures today will be slightly cooler, yet 
still a few degrees above normal levels.

For those firework fans out there, sunset tonight is around 9PM EDT. 
CAM guidance favors decreasing convective coverage in the 8-9PM EDT 
timeframe regionwide, however with perhaps a few residual 
showers/thunderstorms across the mtns as well as the southern 
valley/plateau.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
A weak upper trough over the Ohio and Tennessee Valley will 
replace the upper ridge that shifts south to the Gulf Coast by 
Friday. Deeper moisture will move in to the region with southwest 
flow aloft and weak shortwaves ahead of a weak frontal boundary. 
The front will slide across the forecast area by late Sunday. From
northeast to southwest rain chances increase Friday into Saturday
with showers and storms likely Saturday and Sunday. Afternoon and
evening thunderstorms through the weekend may become strong with 
locally heavy rainfall and gusty winds the main threats. No 
organized severe storms expected. The upper ridge then becomes re-
centered farther west across the central states Monday through 
Wednesday. Flow becomes more NW and higher pressure with drier 
airmass moves over the region from the north and northeast early 
next week, especially Tuesday and Wednesday. Rain chances drop to 
chance and then slight chance. Highs will be near normal through 
Sunday, then warm slightly Monday through Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...

Starting to see some scattered showers/storms across the area early 
this afternoon. The widespread mid to high cloud cover throughout 
much of the day delayed the onset of convection and may limit the 
coverage a bit this afternoon and evening. Despite the cloud cover, 
temperatures currently range from the low 80s to low 90s across most 
locations. Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis 
indicate a weak shortwave trough moving across the Tennessee River 
Valley. Models indicate a decent 300 mb jet streak across the area 
around 30-50 kts but this jet streak is forecast to weaken 
throughout the evening and overnight hours. Models only indicate 
around 20 kt of 0-6 km bulk shear. SBCAPE values are around 1500-
2000 J/Kg and with lower heights aloft, freezing levels are a bit 
lower than normal. Due to this, not expecting any severe storms but 
do expect a few strong storms will be possible with gusty winds and 
small hail being the main threats. Any ongoing convection should 
come to an end near sunset with the loss of daytime heating. Heat 
indices this afternoon could reach to near 100 for portions of the 
southern and central valley.

Patchy fog will be possible once again tonight but the coverage of 
shower/storms this afternoon/evening will depend on how limited or 
widespread the coverage of fog will be. Lows tonight will generally 
range from the mid 60s to low 70s.

Upper level heights will increase tomorrow as the trough weakens and 
slides to the east. The Bermuda high over the Atlantic becomes more 
established with weak southerly flow across the area. This will lead 
to some upslope flow across western North Carolina and into portions 
of the East Tennessee Mountains. For now, think the best chances for 
showers/storms on Independence Day will be across the higher 
elevations of East Tennessee. PW values and dewpoints remain 
elevated but with the lack of any synoptic or surface lift, have 
decreased PoPs slightly for the valley. High temperatures will top 
out in the upper 80s to low 90s for most locations with heat indices 
in the mid to upper 90s for most of the central and southern
valley.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...

Convection should become a little more widespread across the 
Southern Appalachian region as we move into the weekend. Upper 
level troughing will gradually replace the ridge that has been in 
place through much of the week. Moisture will increase across the 
region on deepening southwest flow. The moisture will be lifted in
the presence of several weak waves of low pressure. Eventually a 
slow moving long wave trough will develop Saturday into Sunday and
the mean west to northwest flow pattern with this feature will 
drag a weak cool front south of the forecast area later Sunday 
evening. Utilized a likely probability for showers and 
thunderstorms over the weekend in this scenario. Atmospheric 
buoyancy will become thermonuclear during this timeframe, but 
shear will be almost non-existent, so the threat for severe 
convection will be limited to isolated downbursts in the most well
developed cells. In the superblend broadbrush scheme, maintained 
a small chance for a continuation of some convection in the heat 
of the day on Monday. The continuation may work out due to the 
possibility that the synoptic front doesn't make it all the way 
south through the forecast area. However, Monday may be drier than
currently forecast. Went ahead and dropped pops for most of the 
area on Tuesday in a drier and more stable environment behind the 
front. Forecast uncertainty required using the possibility of some
thunderstorm development on Wednesday with a hint of an impulse 
dropping into the area out of the Upper Midwest. High temperatures
start out a little above normal on Thursday, but pulled back a 
few degrees over the weekend period due to less insolation and 
greater coverage of thunderstorms.

.DISCUSSION...

Mid to high clouds are a bit more widespread than previously
anticipated as a shortwave trough moves across the Tennessee River
Valley. Due to this, increased cloud cover throughout the end of
the day, with visible satellite imagery indicating clouds 
extending well back to the west into Middle TN. Also, lowered high
temperatures by a few degrees with highs generally in the mid 80s
to low 90s for most locations. There is a weak cap in place but 
it will not take much heating to see this eroded. SBCAPE values 
this afternoon will be in the 1500-2000 J/Kg range and expect 
scattered afternoon showers/storms again today. Deep layer 0-6 km 
bulk shear values will be around 20 kts, even with the shortwave 
trough moving through the region. Therefore, do not anticipate any
severe storms but could see a few stronger storms this afternoon 
with gusty winds and small hail being the main threats.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Overall little/no change in the synoptic pattern from 24 hours ago 
as broad/deep ridging extends northward from a GOM H5 anticyclone 
into the TN Valley and Southern Appalachian region.  Earlier diurnal 
convection continues to wain across portions of west/middle TN which 
has allowed for downstream advection of debris clouds in the mid 
lvls.  Guidance would suggest these clouds slowly eroding which 
could aid radiational cooling to some degree.  With that, already 
seeing some patchy fog across portions of the region that 
experienced rainfall yesterday afternoon/evening. Would expect any 
fog development to continue, perhaps with some areas of dense fog 
not to be ruled out into daybreak before burning off.

Moving on, not much difference from yesterday as airmass 
thunderstorms will dominate given abundant heating for convective 
initiation into the afternoon.  Thus, the fcst will initialize dry 
with pops ramping up to widespread chance levels (highest over the 
plateau/mtns), before lowering slowly into the early overnight hours 
with loss of heating.  Profiles once again exhibit fairly steep 
lapse rates with abundant CAPE albeit with little deep shear, as 
well as pwats approaching the 1.7-1.8 inch mark.  Therefore, think 
mostly general thunderstorms will dominate once again, however with 
freezing levels being slightly lower, wouldn't rule out some small 
hail in addition to gusty winds, frequent lightning, and brief 
heavy rainfall.  Regarding the rainfall, 1-2 inches of accumulation 
have fallen in association with isolated/scattered convection over 
the last 48 hours.  FFG values look to be lowest across portions of 
northeast TN and southwest VA, thus given slow storm motions and 
efficient rates, wouldn't rule out some very isolated and minor 
flash flooding issues if the same areas are impacted.  High 
temperatures today will once again be 3-4 degrees above normal 
levels, with heat indices in the low/mid 90s, possibly approaching 
the century mark across the lower valley.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...
Weakening upper level ridge over the southeast will allow weak 
shortwaves to move into the Forecast area Thursday through the 
weekend. Overall not much change in the forecast. Hot and humid 
conditions through the weekend. Between about 18Z and 03Z 
scattered showers and thunderstorms expected to develop Thursday 
afternoon and evening. Friday NAM model shows storms developing in
the mountains first, then plateau late in the day and lingering 
through the evening lower elevations to after midnight. GFS 
showing more coverage Friday as well and lasting longer at night. 
Saturday rain chances look to be highest ahead of front. 
Widespread showers and thunderstorms develop by afternoon and a 
chance of thunderstorms lingering past midnight. As upper ridge 
flattens and shifts southwest upper trough will take over eastern 
states. Sunday cold front approaches slipping south of the 
Tennessee line by Monday morning. Slightly drier airmass moves in 
Sunday so have slightly lower rain chances than Saturday. The 
upper ridge just to the west and upper trough along the east coast
will put the forecast area in path of weak disturbances moving 
down from the northwest so still have to keep in low pops Monday 
and Tuesday. Highs will stay upper 80s to lower 90s through Friday
then mainly mid to upper 80s through the weekend and Monday, 
slightly warmer Tuesday with less cloud cover. Lows will stay very
warm Friday through the period except slightly cooler Monday and 
Tuesday northeast behind front.

.DISCUSSION...
An update will be issued to shift PoPs from northern to southern
sections as convection near Chattanooga and the southern Plateau
have persisted, while northern areas that have been worked over
are unlikely to see redevelopment. Some slight temperatures
adjustments will be made but we should still end up with lows in
the upper 60s to lower 70s. A mention of patchy fog will also be
added, which will form mainly in areas that had afternoon/evening
rainfall.

318 PM EDT Tue Jul 2 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...We will remain in a rather 
stagnant pattern overall for the short term as the broad upper ridge 
remains over the region.  Convection is forecast to wane this 
evening and so will have PoPs fall to below mentionable levels by 
around midnight. Coverage of convection may be slightly higher on 
Wednesday as another weak short wave approaches and the boundary 
layer continues to slowly moisten, but will still keep PoPs in the 
chance range with the highest values north. Thunderstorms should be 
mostly of the general variety, but a few may have brief strong gusty 
winds and/or mostly small hail both late this afternoon and again on 
Wednesday. Temperatures are expected to run a degree or two lower 
tomorrow than today given increased clouds and precip coverage.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...The ridge which 
is present across much of the eastern states today weakens a bit 
into the weekend as a few subtle impulses press east across the 
Ohio Valley. Eventually, a long wave trough amplifies south and 
east through the Northeastern U.S. over the weekend into the first
part of the new work week. A gradual moistening will accompany 
the approaching amplification of the upper level pattern moving 
toward the end of the week, and with some cooling aloft and higher
dewpoint air in the lower levels, the probability of convection 
will increase each day into the weekend. The peak of pops will be 
on Saturday as the synoptic cool frontal boundary builds into the 
region. The front may not be entirely south of the forecast area 
by Sunday, but deeper moisture and instability is progged to be 
just south and east into Northern Georgia and the Carolinas, so 
pulled back a bit on pops for Sunday. Monday and Tuesday could be 
drier and even more stable in a weak west northwest flow regime 
behind the boundary. Temperatures start out a little above normal 
in advance of the front but should be a few degrees cooler by 
Sunday and Monday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Broad anticyclonic H5 flow prevails across much of the east/central 
CONUS once again this morning, with a weak wave traversing atop the 
ridge axis across the OH Valley.  At the surface, weak/moderate high 
pressure holds as the old backdoor front has lifted well northward. 
Current conditions are rather uneventful, albeit a bit balmy for 
this time of night as temperatures hold in the mid/upper 70s in the 
valley with dewpoints in the upper 60s to lower 70s.  With that, am 
expecting some patchy dense fog in association with any river 
valleys, which all should burn off shortly after sunrise. 

As for the remainder of the day, guidance suggests some weak 
convective initiation across portions of southeast KY into southwest 
VA and northeast TN late this morning beneath the aforementioned 
weak upper wave.  The NAM seems the most robust, with the CAMS 
slightly less aggressive.  Thus, kept mid/high chance pops favored 
north of I40, slight chances southward, except for across the lower 
plateau where initiation of heating induced convection is expected 
given overtaken convective temperatures.  As for threats, once again 
think general thunder will dominate with gusty winds, cloud to 
ground lightning, and brief heavy rainfall to highlight. 
Temperatures today will top in the low/mid 90s in the lower valley, 
upper 80s to lower 90s in the northern valley as well as across the 
plateau, with upper 70s to lower 80s expected at the higher 
elevations.  Heat index values will once again surge into the upper 
90s across the lower valley.  Pops will taper to below mentionable 
levels into the late evening/overnight as heating and thus 
instability is lost. Given observed precipitation today, would 
expect another round (perhaps more widespread) of fog tonight.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...
Upper ridge over the Southeast states continues Wednesday but with 
daytime heating scattered afternoon and evening showers and 
thunderstorms there will be some relief from the heat. Coverage 
mostly about 30 to 40 percent. Highs expected to be upper 80s to 
lower 90s. Showers and thunderstorms should die down by mid evening. 
Some patchy fog where storms bring around half inch or locally more 
rainfall but not widespread enough to put in forecast. Thursday 
slightly more coverage northeast sections but about the same central 
and southern areas and highs about the same. On Friday the upper 
ridge breaks down some with shortwave energy triggering more 
significant shower and thunderstorms. Temperatures will be a couple 
degrees cooler and rain chances 40 to 50 percent central and 
southern valley but 60 to 70 percent plateau and mountains. Over the 
weekend the pattern continues with higher rain chances like Friday 
and slightly cooler temperatures. A weak cold front is expected to 
move through late Sunday into Monday with a somewhat drier airmass. 
However with the uncertainty of a cold front moving all the way 
through this time of year and lingering moisture still have a chance 
for showers and storms on Monday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
Diurnal convection is already firing this afternoon. CU field 
right now looks like almost any location could see a quick shower,
but the best chances for stronger and more widespread storms 
still looks to be in Central to Southern portions of the Valley in
Tennessee. Based on the few showers that have appeared in VA 
there may not be enough heating to break through the cap, 
partially due to the lingering clouds they had up there this 
morning. With these storms this afternoon the primary hazard would
be gusty winds from a collapsing storm, the freezing levels look
too high right now to pose a major hail threat this afternoon.

Once the sun sets storms should quickly begin to diminish. 
Another round of fog looks possible tonight with the continued 
elevated dew points. Sheltered/valley locations, and especially 
those that get an afternoon downpour, are the most susceptible to
fog overnight tonight. 

Similar pattern expected tomorrow, but with a slightly weakened
ridge we will likely see temperatures drop a few degrees compared
to this afternoon.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...Models in decent 
agreement overall for the long term period. We start the period out 
under the influence of a broad upper ridge.  However, a series of 
short waves moving through the upper flow will be flattening this 
ridge out and helping to enhance convection chances during much of 
the period. While there is still uncertainty about the details of 
timing/strength of these waves, the strongest looks to affect the 
area in the Friday/Saturday time frame, with a reinforcing wave and 
a weak cold front in the Sunday/Sunday night time frame. Somewhat 
drier air is forecast to be moving in for Monday, but while Monday 
may be precip free, will go with low chance PoPs for now given 
timing uncertainties with the front. While low level shear looks to 
be generally weak overall, given expected available convective 
energy a few storms could become strong to severe on any given 
afternoon. Temperatures are expected to start out near to slightly 
above seasonal normals, then trend to slightly below normal by the 
end of the period.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A rather stagnant upper pattern highlights the weather today as 
broad deep layer ridging prevails across the south central/east 
CONUS, centered atop the Plains which effectively favors nwly flow 
across the TN Valley and Southern Appalachians.  Currently across 
the area, earlier convection continues to dissipate given nocturnal 
stabilization.  With that, a very moist boundary layer could promote 
patchy fog this morning.  Some of this fog could be dense across 
portions of northeast TN and southwest VA that received earlier 
rains, which is also where sfc condensation pressure deficits are 
lowest. 

For the rest of the day, a weak back door frontal boundary laid 
across the I64 corridor region of KY/WV will continue to meander 
southward a bit throughout the day, albeit in a rather diffuse 
fashion.  Given no larger upper forcing mechanisms to move through 
during the period, am expecting generally only airmass type 
showers/thunderstorms during peak heating, perhaps enhanced by 
residual outflows or the aforementioned boundary.  Fcst profiles do 
exhibit weak capping regionwide, however given ample insolation am 
expecting convective temperatures to be achieved, especially across 
the central/southern valley as well as the plateau.  As for threats, 
freezing lvls look to be around 15kft (which should inhibit large 
hail), thus think general thunderstorms will dominate possibly 
favoring gusty winds and cloud to ground lightning.  Likewise, pwats 
on the order of 1.65 inches are around the 75th percentile range 
according to sounding climo for BNA, which combined with little/no 
steering flow could result in some prolonged downpours leading to 
minor flooding. Otherwise, max temperatures will top out a few 
degrees above normal levels, which combined with dewpoints in the 
upper 60s to lower 70s could yield heat index values in the 
mid/upper 90s (especially across the lower valley).  Convection 
should diminish with loss of heating into the evening hours, leading 
into a quiet night, perhaps with some patchy fog.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...
Will begin the extended period in a normal summer-type pattern. 
Strong ridging over the southern U.S. and high pressure dominating
the surface. This will favor warm or actually rather hot 
conditions with highs in the mid 80s to mid 90s and heat indies 
expected to reach into the mid to upper 90s across at least the 
central and southern valley. The main threat of convection will 
focus on higher elevations with storms occasionally moving into 
the valley. By mid week and continuing through the rest of the 
period...a series of short waves tracking through the upper flow 
will slowly begin to flatten or at least dampen the ridge. This 
will translate to slightly cooler temperatures and an increase in 
the chance of convection. Throughout the extended there is little 
synoptic support but with strong diurnal heating...expect the 
afternoon atmosphere to become at least weakly unstable. Low level
shear should be fairly weak through the period but air should 
should remain quite moist. Therefore...expect at least scattered 
convection each day with best chance over higher terrain. Do not 
see any significant organization to the convection and do not see 
the potential for a serous severe weather day but any day could 
see scattered...pulse type storms that could reach strong to 
severe levels.

.DISCUSSION...
A frontal boundary is moving slowly south toward southwest
Virginia and northern Tennessee. A scattered line of thunderstorms
is in advance of this boundary. Latest meso-analysis shows MLCAPEs
remain between 1500 J/Kg over most of the area, so do expect this
line to move into the region this evening. However, loss of
daytime heating will slowly decrease the intensity and coverage
through early morning. 

However, storms still have the potential of strong/gusty winds,
brief heavy rain, and frequent lightning with the stronger
thunderstorms, especially areas north of interstate 40.

Made some minor changes to PoPs (increased) and temperatures
(mainly hourly temperatures).

A line of scattered showers and thunderstorms over Kentucky will 
pull south toward TRI/TYS airports but latest CAMS suggest this line 
will weaken and disspate by 02Z due to loss of daytime heating. A 
redevelop of scattered convection is expected across TYS and more 
likely CHA after 17Z Monday.

Bsides the storms, IFR/possibly LIFR conditions expected at TRI due 
to fog and low cloud development. Recent rains will aid in fog 
development. MVFR possible at TYS depending if convection can move 
into the area this evening before dissipating.

Otherwise, VFR conditions anticipated. Pressure gradients will be 
generally weak keeping winds generally less than 10kts, except near

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...
Late tonight, shortwave passes with the trough axis shifting
eastward. This brings subsidence across northeast portions of the
forecast area, generally north and east of Knoxville and allow 
high clouds to clear with ideal conditions for low clouds and fog 
to develop. Dynamic and statistical guidance is in agreement with 
this, but magnitude of fog should depend on how quickly the 
subsidence and drying aloft occurs. At this time, best clearing 
appears to be after 08-09z. Highest probability for fog will be in
areas that receive afternoon rainfall and near rivers.

On Monday, subsidence results in an inversion between 700-800mb 
across NE TN and SW VA which should act as a cap to convection. 
Still could have an isolated shower or thunderstorm if anything 
manages to break through the cap, but with the synoptic subsidence
and drier boundary layer air, believe most of NE TN and SW VA 
should remain dry. South and west of Knoxville where the cap is 
weak to nonexistent, there will be a higher probability of a few 
localized showers or thunderstorms, but synoptic forcing remains 
weak. NAM and RAP forecast soundings are showing up to 2000-2500 
J/Kg MLCAPE, but with weak flow along the deformation axis, 
effective bulk shear remains weak at approximately 10kt. This 
will support pulse convection capable of some strong downburst 
winds with the strongest thunderstorms across SE TN and SW NC. 
Will also have to monitor convection across the Upper Midwest as 
it rounds the ridge and dives south toward the Tennessee Valley. 
Remnant convection or outflow boundaries could play an important 
role in initiating convection on Monday afternoon. High-res CAMs 
are not in good agreement with the overall coverage and timing of 
convection Monday afternoon, but they do generally show the 
potential for remnant convective complexes or MCVs across the 
Midwest to dive south and potentially enhance our convective 
coverage. Because of the uncertainty of timing and location, will 
remain with slight chance and chance PoPs for SE TN and SW NC. 
Temperatures should be warm once again, especially across the 
southern valley as ridging begin to increase as we continue into 
the middle of the week.


.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
Relatively typical summer time pattern will set up for the first 
part of the extended portion of this forecast. Ridging over the 
Southeastern United States will be the dominant feature, leading 
to warm temperatures and isolated afternoon showers and 
thunderstorms. 

Temperatures will likely be able to climb into the 90's in the 
central/southern portions of the Valley through Thursday with Heat 
Index's climbing into the upper 90's in some locations these days. 
With these warm temperatures and moisture trapped under the ridge we 
should see some isolated showers develop in the afternoon hours. 
There is no major source of synoptic forcing for these storms to 
work with so am currently expecting any storms that develop the 
first half of this week to be the typical diurnally driven summer 
thunderstorms... Can't rule out the possibilty that a stray storm 
gets strong, but at this time widespread severe weather looks 
unlikely. 

Ridge looks to broaden out and weaken a bit as we move into the 
second half of the work week towards the weekend. This looks like it 
may allow a few weak ripples of energy to move near the area 
increasing the chances for more widespread precipitation. This 
weakening  of the ridge will also help to cool temperatures off a 
bit, bringing them closer to normal values over the weekend.

.DISCUSSION...
Morning observations continue to show us in between a strong low
across the Northeast CONUS, ridging across the Great Plains, and 
a cutoff low retrograding across TX and the Lower Mississippi. WV
imagery shows the drier air in the upper levels across NE TN and 
SW VA with NW flow increasing as shortwaves amplify the Eastern US
trough. Morning fog is dissipating as temperatures begin to rise
and the boundary layer mixes out midmorning.

A surface cold front will approach the area this afternoon from
the north/northeast and will bring scattered showers and
thunderstorms to the area, primarily across NE TN and SW VA. With
dry mid-levels, DCAPE will be high and may have some strong wind
gusts with thunderstorms. Instability will be sufficient for
thunderstorms with MLCAPE rising to approximately 1500 J/Kg this 
afternoon in RAP forecast soundings. Effective deep layer shear 
will be strongest across NE TN and SW VA, but will be weak 
areawide, so thunderstorm organization will be limited.

Made some minor adjustments to the forecast based on current
conditions and trends this morning. Otherwise, forecast is
progressing as expected.

development along an approaching weak frontal boundary.  A few 
storms may become strong or severe. Coverage should remain scattered 
and for now will keep mention of VCTS in TAFs for the late 
afternoon.  However...if a strong storm does move into a TAF

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Any areas of fog that develop late 
tonight should lift by mid morning. The main weather feature for 
the short term will be a weakening and rather diffuse frontal 
boundary settling southward into the area this afternoon. The air 
mass in place will become increasing unstable as the front 
approaches. ML CAPEs should increase to 2000 to 3000 J/Kg with 
DCAPE becoming 1000 to 2000 J/KG and PWs are generally between 1.5
to 2 inches. As the front moves in...weak low level shear will 
develop mainly over northern locations. What all of this should 
translate to is an increased chance of thunderstorms this 
afternoon...they may become a bit more organized along/ahead of 
the boundary though convection will still be rather pulsy. 
Depending on the model...mid levels show some degree of drying. 
The overall threat of the convection will be a slightly greater 
chance of strong winds...the potential for heavy rainfall remains 
a threat and the chance of large hail is limited. The front will 
continue to weaken as it makes it way south through the area. 
Convection should decrease and weaken after sunset but do expect 
the potential for lingering convection to continue through much of
the night mainly over higher elevations.


.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...The biggest issue for this 
forecast period is the heat.  Max Temps each day will be 90s in the 
valley at most locations, and due to high dewpoints (muggy 
conditions), Heat Index values look to be about 5-7 degrees warmer 
than the air temp--near or above 100 degrees over the central and 
southern valley each day.  

At the beginning of this period (Monday morning), the upper ridge 
will still be in place.  Weak surface high pressure will be in place 
as well.  Overall, the upper heights this week look a little higher 
than the models did 24 hours ago.  The ridge almost looks like it 
weakens, but actually it is the weakening of the troughs on either 
side with heights holding or rising in the latter half of the week. 
So even though the center of the ridge works south of us, it looks 
like it will have a strong influence over us all week.  There will 
be chances of shortwaves riding through the area that could promote 
better chances of convection. Toward the end of the period, it looks 
like better chances of shortwaves being able to cut into the upper 
ridge to get better chances of showers and storms. Max temps by then 
also look like they may edge a few degrees lower, but dewpoints 
might be edging a little higher as the return flow from the Gulf 
sluggishly gets more established.  So in a couple of words--hot and 
steamy for this Holiday week.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

Isolated thunderstorm activity is expected to decrease this
evening and overnight as atmospheric stability increases.
Locations that received rainfall this afternoon and sheltered 
river valleys will likely see fog development again with a mostly 
clear sky and calm wind.

Between 09z and 15z Sunday, a weak shortwave is forecast to move
through the area around the Northeast CONUS cyclone. Upper level
winds shift to the NW behind this shortwave with drier air
advection and shortwave ridging for Sunday afternoon. This results
in forecast soundings from the NAM, and a more limited magnitude
from the GFS, being very dry above 700mb. A back door surface cold
front will move southwestward across the Mid-Atlantic and approach
SW VA late Sunday and Sunday night. While the primary area of
surface convergence and instability will be across NE TN and SW
VA, have doubt about overall coverage of precipitation if the
atmosphere is as dry as guidance such as the NAM and RAP 
indicate. However, instability will be relatively high with the 
NAM placing 2000-3000 J/kg ML CAPE across the forecast area during
the afternoon. Additionally, weak effective deep layer shear 
approximately 10kt and plentiful low-level moisture will favor
ordinary pulse convection that does develop. With what isolated 
convection does form, DCAPE will be high and downdrafts would 
likely be the main hazard.


.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

At the start of the extended, a large portion of the CONUS will be 
dominated by upper level ridging. A shortwave moving off the New 
England coast will allow the ridge axis to build into the Ohio and 
Tennessee valley. At the surface high pressure will be in control 
with light winds. Diurnally driven convection will be possible 
Sunday night and Tuesday but coverage looks isolated to scattered at 
best. Temperatures will be near to above average through this time 
as 850mb temperatures increase to near 20-21 degrees C. The warmest 
days should be Monday and Tuesday with heat index values increasing 
as well. By mid week, upper level low moving southward out of the 
northern Canadian provinces is forecast to flatten the ridge a bit 
with lowering heights across the region. Developing low pressure 
across the plains will veer low level winds to the south and west. 
Obvious differences are still apparent in global models with the 
ECMWF holding the ridge a bit stronger through mid to late week. 
This will ultimately have implications on PoPs but the consensus is 
that chances of showers and thunderstorms will be increasing with 
maximum chances during the diurnally favored times. Widespread 
severe weather looks very low but cannot rule out strong to possibly 
a severe pulse storm or two. The weekend period shows low confidence 
as previous model runs showed differences in the strength of the 
ridge.  A weak shortwave trough is advertised to drop out of the 
Ohio valley during the weekend with increased PoPs associated with 
this feature.

.DISCUSSION...
Surface observations this morning show our area in a relatively
weak pressure gradient with cu beginning to develop across the
higher elevations. Expect a few afternoon thunderstorms to develop
across the higher elevations, but expect coverage to be less than
yesterday with lower mid-level lapse rates and instability. We're
located between several cyclonic and anticyclonic systems in an
area of relatively weak flow, so shear is low and storm motion
would be mostly driven by outflows. With the weak shear, any
thunderstorms will be ordinary pulse convective mode. Mid and
upper level dry air on WV imagery will once again enhance
entrainment and downdraft potential with thunderstorms.

Made a few minor updates to the forecast by adjusting max
temperatures to be similar to yesterday. Heights and low-level
thickness are very similar, so expect max temperatures to be

.AVIATION...Areas of fog have developed across the area early 
this morning...generally centered around TRI and TYS for MVFR 
conditions.  The fog should lift by mid morning and expect VFR 
conditions to prevail through the rest of the day at all three TAF 
sites.  Scattered showers and thunderstorms are once again expected 
to form over the area this afternoon.  However...the main focus 
should be over higher elevations with only minimal coverage across 
the valley.  Therefore...will not mention TS in TAFs at this time. 
Areas that do receive rainfall this afternoon could potentially see 
fog development late tonight.  Since confidence is low on TAF sites 
seeing rainfall...will leave conditions VFR though the night.  As 
for winds...today they should be fairly light...staying below 10 
KTs...tonight they should become light to near calm.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Will see little change in the
overall weather pattern for the short term. Basically...an upper
low will meander around Gulf States/Mississippi Valley area
providing rather weak flow aloft over the Southern Appalachian
Region. Surface high positioned to our east will dominate the low
levels. This set up will keep warm...moist air lifting into the
area. Also...this will maintain limited shear across the region
with the air mass expected to be not quite as unstable as
Friday...MLCAPE should be around 1000 to possibly 1500 J/Kg. As a
result of all of this...expect scattered...pulse type thunderstorm
development this afternoon mainly focused along higher
elevations...though a stray storm may occasional push into the
valley. The main threat will be heavy rainfall but any storm that
becomes strong to potentially severe will be capable of strong
damaging winds with a lesser potential for large hail. Convection
should weaken and decrease with sunset but a few cells may linger
through the evening before ending overnight. Temperatures will
continue to average near to lightly above normal through the next
24 hours.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...At the beginning of this period 
(Sunday morning), the area will be under the general influence of a 
weak upper ridge, oriented NW-SE, but the farther northeast in the 
area, there is still the tail-end of influence of the upper trough 
that will be moving through the northeastern U.S.   By Wednesday, 
this upper ridge is breaking down from the north, that should allow 
better chances of showers and storms, and the pattern looks to stay 
unsettled through the end of the period, as we stay in a weak upper 
level westerly flow with weak shortwaves in the flow that bring lift 
as well as destabilize the airmass, by cooling temps aloft.  Went a 
1-2 degrees below blend Max Temps.  Once upper ridge starts breaking 
down--should be more cloud cover, less warming subsidence, and more 
convection that would disperse surface heating vertically. Expecting 
storms to mainly be below severe levels, with marginal instability 
and weak wind field aloft.

.DISCUSSION...Current forecast on track with just a few minor
adjustments. Went ahead and added some patchy dense fog to the
forecast to areas that saw precipitation today as they will 
likely see patchy dense fog overnight. Did adjust overnight lows 
by a degree or two up across SWVA as LNP is already at their 
previously forecasted low. Don't expect the temp to drop too much 
more though as the temps is currently 64 and so is the dewpoint. 
Will send out new zones for the aforementioned low temp adjustment
and addition of patchy dense fog.

Lastly, one lone storm remains near CHA but expect it to diminish
soon as neither the RAP or HRRR show activity past 02Z.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
Should continue to see scattered thunderstorms through the
afternoon, especially across the higher elevations and near
outflow boundaries. MLCAPE is between 1500 and 2000 J/Kg and
effective bulk shear is around 10kt which favors ordinary pulse
convection. WV imagery continues to show dry air in the midlevels
across SE TN and up the TN/NC border which will enhance DCAPE and
downdraft potential. While widespread and organized severe weather
is not anticipated, a few localized severe thunderstorms are
possible with damaging winds being the primary hazard. For 
tonight, expect convection to diminish after sunset, but a few 
isolated thunderstorms may be initiated from remnant outflow 
boundaries. Areas that received rain this afternoon or early 
tonight will likely see some localized fog development.

Weak flow continues on Saturday with the upper low over the lower
Mississippi Valley retrograding southwestward and an increasing
thermal ridge as we remain in very weak flow. This should limit
PoPs relative to Friday afternoon with lower instability, weaker
mid-level lapse rates, and continued low shear in this very weak
flow. Ordinary pulse convection would still be the favored mode
with MLCAPE of 1000 to 1500 J/Kg and effective bulk shear of
approximately 10kt. With these values, have the potential of a few
thunderstorms, some strong with gusty winds, primarily across the
higher elevations.


.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
On Saturday we will still be situated between a couple of upper 
level lows. One will be across the Texas coast while the other one 
remains north of the Great Lakes region. We will continue to get 
some moderate moisture inflow from the Gulf of Mexico under this 
regime, combine this with continued warm temperatures we will likely 
see isolated diurnal showers and thunderstorms each day over the 
weekend. Severe parameters don't particularly line up well for long 
lived or wide-spread storms, but can't rule out a few strong to 
severe storms popping up each afternoon.

High pressure will increase as we move into the workweek with 
temperatures expected to climb into the lower 90's and upper 80's 
through out the week. Best chance for more widespread rain may come 
during the middle of the week, depending on which model you believe. 
GFS wants to position the ridge slightly east compared to the ECMWF, 
which will help to bring in more moisture the Tennessee Valley under 
the ridge. This would lead to decent chances for widespread 
precipitation... While the ECWF want to keep the ridge a little 
further to the west meaning that less moisture will be available for 
potential storms to work with. Shower and thunderstorm chances will 
continue each afternoon through the rest of the work week as we 
remain under the influence of the upper level ridge.

.DISCUSSION...
Morning surface observations and satellite imagery show clear
skies across most of the area with some cu starting to develop
across the mountains as of 15z. A weak pressure gradient is 
located across the area with high pressure generally located off 
of the East Coast with weak SE flow at the surface. WV imagery and
12z soundings continue to show the upper level low placed over 
northern Mississippi with SE flow aloft. WV imagery also shows an 
area of drier air in the 500-700mb levels in NE AL and NW GA that 
is slowly moving NNW through the weak flow regime.

With lower heights across the area due to the weakness in the
ridge/upper low across the midsouth, RAP analysis is showing
MLCAPE of about 700-1000 J/Kg across much of the area, and this 
is expected to grow with surface heating. However, there is very 
weak shear with cloud layer bulk shear generally around 10kt or 
less. This will favor ordinary pulse convection and make it 
difficult to sustain updrafts for very long. Thunderstorms are
expected to develop and drift NW early this afternoon primarily 
along the mountains and southern plateau due to the differential 
heating along the terrain and upslope convergent SE flow. Other 
more local areas of development are possible along any residual 
outflow boundaries from previous overnight convection. As these 
thunderstorms collapse and produce their own outflow boundaries, 
additional isolated thunderstorm development is possible across
the valley later this afternoon and evening. Severe weather is not
anticipated because of the weak flow and storm mode; however, a
few isolated thunderstorms may become marginally severe with 
strong downburst winds due to the drier air and high DCAPE across
the southern half of the forecast area.

Made some minor adjustments to temperatures by increasing most 
areas a degree or two based on current observations, low-level 
heights, and yesterday's max temperatures. Otherwise, forecast is 
progressing as expected.

will aid in the development of additional convection across the 
Southern Appalchians Region this afternoon. The thunderstorm 
activity should be rather limited and for now will only mention VCTS 
in TAFs for late afternoon.  A few storms may linger into 
tonight...but this should be minimal and will not mention in TAFs. 
Therefore...it should be a quiet night with clearing skies and VFR 
conditions. Winds...should remain below 10KTs today...however if a 
thunderstorms does impact a local TAF site be prepared for brief

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A stray isolated thunderstorm
may linger over the area early this morning as the overnight
convection continues to dissipate. The overnight activity will
likely have left a few residual outflow boundaries over the area.
The overall synoptic pattern has a cut off low wandering over the
southeastern U.S. with surface high pressure dominating the lower
levels. This pattern will continue to bring low level moisture and
warm air into the area. The air mass will destabilize this
afternoon with DCAPE reaching near 1000 J/kg and steepening low-
level lapse rates. All of this will combine to create a weakly
unstable atmosphere. With strong diurnal heating this
afternoon...expect convection to develop across the area. The
initial round of new convection should form over higher
elevations. As boundaries from these storms move into the
valley...they along with any lingering boundaries will add focus
for additional afternoon convection. Coverage should be a bit more
widespread than previous days. With deep low level moisture in
place...the main threat will be heavy rainfall. However...a stray
strong to severe storm can not be ruled out with storms creating
strong winds...frequent lightning and possibly large hail.
Convection will continue into the evening hours...but should
eventually dissipate after sunset and much of Friday night should
be quiet. 

.LONG TERM (Friday through Thursday)...By 12Z Saturday, an upper 
level low will be situated across the northwestern GoM while a 
shortwave trough moves southeast out of Canada and into New 
England. Further upstream, upper level ridging will be located 
across the desert southwest into the northern plains with ridging 
also extending into the western Atlantic. At the surface, high 
pressure will be located across the mid-Atlantic with lower 
pressure located across the northern plains. The region will be in
this upper level regime through the weekend with surface high 
pressure situated across the Tennessee valley. Diurnally driven 
convection will be possible on Saturday and Sunday given the very 
unstable airmass. This will be especially true across southwest 
Virginia as the tail end of a front approaches. While mid level 
lapse rates will be weak given the lack of synoptic scale features
nearby, low level lapse rates will likely be large given the 
degree of near boundary layer heating. A few strong storms cannot 
be ruled out but should remain isolated in nature. 

Upper level ridging intensifies on Monday with generally 
anticyclonic flow through much of the US. This will place the region 
in a northerly to northwest flow aloft. Will carry slight chance 
PoPs through Tuesday to highlight potential of diurnally driven 
convection. Temperatures this weekend and early next week look to 
remain near to slightly above normal. Heat indices will likely 
approach the mid to upper 90s Monday and Tuesday afternoon. 

By the middle of next week, models begin to diverge a bit. The GFS 
indicates the ridge axis to move eastward while an upper level low 
moves out of the southern plains. The ECMWF holds the ridge axis 
over much of the Tennessee valley. Nonetheless, a surface low will 
likely develop lee of the Rockies and move into the midwest and into 
the Ohio valley by Thursday morning. With low pressure to the west, 
and high pressure to the east, southwesterly flow will commence 
Wednesday aiding in moisture advection. This along with at least 
weak synoptic scale forcing should promote chance PoPs Wednesday 
into Wednesday night. Kept chance PoPs in through Friday as a couple 
of upper level disturbances could generate additional SHRA/TSRA 
through the end of the extended period. Temperatures will stay near 
to above average.

sites.  Main concern over the TAF areas through the night will be 
the potential for patchy fog formation towards sunrise.  Fog will 
mainly be a concern around the TRI area where reduced VIS is 
expected for MVFR to IFR conditions.  Additional convection is 
expected to develop over the area on Friday.  Coverage should be a

Therefore...will only mention VCTS in TAFs for a few hours during

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...

An upper level ridge will remain overhead with a cut off low 
in the deep South through the period keeping east TN, southwest VA, 
and southwest NC in a very warm and humid airmass. MLCAPE has risen 
to 1000-1500 J/Kg this afternoon with 2500-3000 J/Kg at the surface. 
This has allowed a few diurnal thunderstorms to form in the higher 
terrain this afternoon. Very weak shear and fairly flat mid level 
lapse rates have kept this disorganized, but brief heavy rain and 
lightning strikes will continue with any of these cells into the 
evening hours. It is possible that outflow boundaries could also 
initiate isolated convection in the valley. Expect the activity to 
quickly decrease in coverage after 01 or 02Z. Used the warmer MET 
guidance for lows tonight in this muggy airmass. Soundings indicate 
a low-level temperature inversion late tonight, and temp/dew point 
crossovers suggest patchy fog once again after 07 or 08Z. Similar to 
the past few nights, patchy fog will most likely develop in 
protected river valleys, but could also occur in areas that saw 
rainfall Thursday evening.

For Friday, the upper level low meandering over the deep South will 
start to advect greater low-level moisture into the region. This 
combined with the continued warm and humid pattern and soundings 
quickly becoming uncapped suggest greater coverage of the diurnal 
convection. Have chance pops in most areas expanding after 15Z. 
Locally heavy rain and lightning strikes will be the main impacts, 
but DCAPE increasing to near 1000 J/kg and steep low-level lapse 
rates could allow for isolated wet microbursts. Went with the warmer 
MET guidance for highs which will bring another day of widespread 
upper 80's to lower 90's, near to slightly above average for late 
June.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...

We begin the extended with an upper low centered over the Lower 
Mississippi Valley and anomalous ridging across the Great Plains and 
Western Atlantic. With surface high pressure centered off the East 
Coast and southerly flow across our area, expect a very moist 
environment across the Southern Appalachians. This will lead to 
slight chance/chance PoPs across much of the area with highest 
coverage and concentration of thunderstorms expected across the 
higher elevations and southern portions of the forecast area closer 
to the low.

On Saturday and Sunday, the upper low retrogrades across Texas with 
an upper trough diving southeastward across the Northeast and Mid-
Atlantic states Sunday night with an associated surface low off the 
coast of Nova Scotia. The trailing cold front will become a back 
door cold front for our area moving slowly southwestward and 
approach our SW VA and NE TN counties. This will lead to our highest 
chance PoPs across NE TN and SW VA on Sunday afternoon through 
Tuesday as the front lingers in this area. With near normal heights 
and no widespread convection forecast, temperatures should be near 
or slightly above normal through the weekend.

Guidance is in good agreement with ridging building in midweek next 
week, and this is likely to favor above normal temperatures next 
week through the Independence Day holiday. Main forcing for 
developing convection would be afternoon differential heating along 
the higher terrain.

that TYS and TRI see a passing shower or thunderstorm this 
afternoon too, but this is less of a chance. TYS and TRI will go 
to MVFR and IFR off and on between 06 and 11Z due to patchy fog. 
Timing is low confidence, and TRI has the best chance at seeing 
periods of fog.

.DISCUSSION...Quick update to add a slight chance of a shower in
far southeast TN and southwest NC from now through 15Z. Weak radar
returns and deeper cloud cover suggests a few light showers or
sprinkles are passing through those areas. Slightly increased 
cloud cover from the southern valley through southwest NC through
15Z as well to account for this activity. This is associated with
an upper low that continues to slowly pivot through AL and MS. A 
mostly sunny, hot and humid afternoon is still expected in all 
areas with afternoon cumulus and isolated diurnal thunderstorms 
developing around the plateau and eastern mountains.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The upper levels of the atmosphere feature an h50 low near the
midsouth with upper level ridging noted across the plains. 
Further upstream, a deep low was moving onshore of the Pacific 
northwest. At the surface, ridge of high pressure remains in 
control of regional weather with mostly clear skies overhead and 
near normal temperatures. Recent convection to the west has shown 
considerable weakening as noted in warming cloud tops. This has 
been captured well by high resolution models, which keeps the area
dry overnight. Light winds, and clear skies should allow for some
fog development overnight. In fact, area observations and GOES-16
imagery are starting to depict this. 

The upper low will meander through the midsouth on Thursday and 
become cutoff by 00Z Friday. While better moisture and forcing for
ascent will be located near the low to our west, recent guidance 
has shown an upward trend in PoPs as instability increases under 
peak heating along a weak convergence zone. As a result, increased
PoPs mainly south of I-40 and west of I-75. Convection should 
come to an end during the evening with another dry night expected 
area wide. Some fog is again possible. Temperatures will remain 
near average.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...
A rather unsettled weather pattern will be in place over the 
Southern Appalachian Region through the extended. Weak surface 
high pressure will wonder around the region often shifting east 
and creating good southerly flow across the area...allowing for 
decent low level moisture return. Aloft...a ridge of high pressure
will briefly strengthen then be dampened down as a series of 
short wave...boundaries and areas of low pressure rides through 
the upper flow. This scenario will translate to the potential for 
convection each day. The best timing will be during the afternoon 
and early evening as strong daytime heating helps to destabilize 
the atmosphere. Additionally...higher elevations will also see an 
increased chance of thunderstorms. Timing of the short waves 
moving through is difficult as model consistency on this has been 
poor. So basically...will maintain a mix of 20 to 40 POPs through 
the period. Temperatures should trend toward near to slightly 
above normal levels through the period.

Complex of storms over western and middle Tennessee just east of
weak upper trough over the Mid Mississippi Valley. Air mass here
is quite unstable and expect convection to move little the rest 
of the evening. Across the forecast area moisture and instability
is much more limited. Some high clouds will spread east across 
parts of east Tennessee overnight so skies will be partly cloudy
to mostly clear. Otherwise expect partly cloudy skies with some 
patchy fog across mainly northeast Tennessee late tonight and 
early Thursday. Current forecast looks good with lows in the 60s 
to near 70. Updated forecast to add patchy fog in some counties.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...

A weak disturbance over northern Alabama will continue to move away 
this afternoon and evening allowing for clearing skies except for 
afternoon cumulus. High pressure at the surface and aloft will be in 
full control tonight keeping skies mostly clear with light winds. 
Went slightly below MET and MAV guidance for lows since dew points 
have not yet come up to oppressive levels. The most protected river 
valleys could see some patchy fog toward dawn, but a drier look to 
soundings and the warm/dry weather the past two afternoons should 
keep this isolated, so will not put it into the forecast. 

The surface high will shift farther east Thursday with the mid and 
upper level ridge further strengthening. This will allow for 
stronger warm and moist advection. The slightly higher dew points 
and strong surface heating will result in MLCAPES of 1500-2000 J/Kg. 
Projected soundings do not indicate much of a cap in the afternoon, 
so isolated diurnal convection will form. The most likely places to 
see a brief shower or thunderstorm will be the plateau and far 
eastern mountains from southwest VA through southeast TN. Used the 
warmer MET guidance for highs which will bring widespread upper 80's 
to lower 90's to the entire region, except mid 90's in the southern 
valley.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...

The long term period will largely feature high pressure overhead, 
with a few shortwave disturbances to our north causing weaknesses in 
the ridge and allowing for scattered shower and thunderstorm 
development each day. With surface high pressure anchored to our 
east, southerly flow will remain in place across the CWA through the 
period with warm and humid conditions continuing. Warm temperatures, 
and plentiful low level moisture will lead to scattered convection 
each day. This will mainly be over the higher terrain on Friday. 
Saturday onward however, the upper high will begin to weaken a bit 
as an upper trough drops southeast from the Hudson Bay area into New 
England. As such, convection will become possible across more and 
more of the area as we move into Sunday and early next week. Again, 
it should largely initiate in the higher terrain, but will spread 
out with time.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Surface high pressure and a 
broad mid/upper level ridge building over the region will dominate 
our weather for the short term.  We will see some high clouds around 
especially today, but overall expect a mostly sunny day and a mostly 
clear night tonight.  Temperatures today will be just slightly above 
normal for this time of year, and humidity levels will not be 
oppressive.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...High pressure will be in 
control across the Southern Appalachian Region as the extended 
period begins.  Thursday into Friday this high will slowly shift 
eastward...placing the MRX CWA under southerly flow and allowing low 
level moisture and slightly warmer air to filter in.  This combined 
with strong diurnal heating will generate isolated convection mainly 
over higher elevations on Thursday.  Coverage will slightly increase 
on Friday.  By Saturday....this air mass will be at least weakly 
unstable with increasing moisture in place. This will allow the 
chance of shower and thunderstorm activity to expand across the 
entire area...though the best probability will remain over higher 
terrain.  Around the Sunday/Monday time frame...a weakening frontal 
boundary will settle southward and into the region.  Timing and 
strength of this feature remains in question but this should add a 
little lift across the area allowing for more widespread and a bit 
more organized convection.  By Tuesday... remnants of the boundary 
should be lifting slightly north though potentially a few residual 
outflow boundaries may remain over the region.  As a result...good 
diurnal heating should be sufficient for some additional convective 
develop Tuesday afternoon.  So overall...it should be an unsettled 
extended period.  Temperatures should warm to normal levels if not a 
bit above normal throughout the period.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...
High pressure from the surface through the midlevels will dominate
the weather pattern through the period. With calm wind and clear
skies, fog will be a concern tonight. So far this afternoon, 
dewpoints have not dropped much across the area, holding in the
mid 60s despite boundary layer mixing. This suggests that fog will
be more prevalent than just near rivers and lakes, so will mention
patchy fog everywhere. Dense fog may be isolated to bodies of
water, and confidence in greater coverage is too low to warrant an
advisory at this time, but it will bear watching. Tomorrow will be
mostly sunny and rain-free with highs in the mid 80s to around 
90.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
A typical early summer pattern will be in place through early 
next week with primarily zonal flow gradually transitioning to 
more ridging and above normal temperatures.

A surface high will be shifting east toward the Mid Atlantic 
Wednesday night and Thursday which will allow return southerly flow 
and WAA to begin. Mid level heights will correspondingly rise to 590-
592 DAM at this time, so expect highs around 90 to return to the 
southern valley Thursday with mid to upper 80's elsewhere. All areas 
will see upper 80's to near 90 Friday. The increasing heat and 
humidity will allow for some diurnal convection Thursday and Friday 
afternoons as MUCAPES look to be in the 2000-3000 J/Kg range, but 
some thermal capping should limit coverage to southeast TN and the 
eastern mountains.  

Similarly hot and humid conditions will continue this weekend, but 
the coverage of afternoon/evening convection will be greater as the 
TN valley becomes squeezed between a sharpening upper ridge in the 
Plains and Midwest and digging upper trough in New England. This 
will cause a weak cold front in the vicinity of the OH valley to 
slowly sag southward toward our region. Any outflow boundaries from 
convection tied to this front will spark an increase in diurnal 
convection across east TN, southwest VA, and southwest NC, and some 
subtle cooling aloft will result in a weaker cap too. Shear 
parameters are very weak, so no organized severe weather is 
expected. Locally heavy rain will occur in any thunderstorm since 
PWAT values will once again be high at 1.30-1.80 inches.

The above mentioned front will remain in tne region Monday with 
chance pops for showers/storms continuing. Both the ECMWF and GFS 
are in good agreement on this. The old front will lift back north 
Tuesday bringing a lower chance of convection as the Midwest upper 
ridge axis builds a bit farther east. Still maintained slight chance 
to chance pops at this time for diurnal convection. Temps will 
continue above normal.

.DISCUSSION...
An early update will be issued to remove the mention of fog and to
remove the slight chance PoPs this morning. So far the hi-res
models have overdone showers in our area, as radar shows only a
few isolated showers to the north. The models show additional
development this afternoon, but looking at the 12Z sounding from
OHX and forecast soundings, an inversion around 800 mb with 
stable and very dry conditions above should discourage
development. The forecast will keep PoPs less than 15% today but a
small, very isolated shower can't be completely ruled out in
northern sections.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...A few isolated lingering showers 
will be possible this morning mainly north and east, but drier air 
will be moving in today behind the departing weak cold front.  By 
afternoon, plenty of sunshine and near normal temperatures can be 
expected. Surface high pressure will be centered over the area

and low temperatures that will be near to slightly below seasonal 
norms.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...The extended will begin
in a rather quiet weather pattern. High pressure will dominate 
the surface with weak flow aloft. As a result...Wednesday and 
Thursday will be mostly dry with the exception of the potential of
some isolated diurnal convection generally over far southern 
areas and across higher elevations. The surface high will 
eventually shift east and allow low level moisture to return to 
the region with weak ridging aloft. For Friday and Saturday...the 
air mass to become weakly unstable and with diurnal heating...the 
potential for convection...especially during the afternoon and 
evening...will spread across the area with the best change 
remaining over southern areas and higher terrain. By Sunday and 
Monday...the chance of shower and thunderstorm activity will 
increase as a weakening frontal boundary drops into the area. 
Confidence is low with the timing and strength of the boundary and
for now will keep precip chances in the 20 to 30 POP range. As 
for temperatures...they should stay rather seasonal to slightly 
above normal through the period.

Made some quick updates to hourly grids and low temperatures. 
Line of showers and thunderstorms have exited the area with mostly
cloudy skies in its wake. Should be a quiet overnight period with
relatively light winds. Some patchy fog may develop across areas 
that received heavier rain. Low temperatures tonight should range 
from the low to upper 60s.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...Through the afternoon and 
evening, a line of strong to severe storms will cross from east to
west across the area. With the amount of sunshine that has 
occurred across much of the TN Valley, and with dewpoints in the 
upper 60s to lower 70s, there will be a good amount of instabilty 
in the pre-storm environment. Gusty winds so far indicate a more 
dynamic environment than the past few days as well, and downdrafts
will transport strong winds aloft to the surface. The activity is
expected to exit to the east around 00-01Z. The zone forecast 
will include a late afternoon period to account for this timing. 
Dry air in the mid levels builds in quickly but low level moisture
may linger and allow for some cloudy skies overnight. Winds 
should provide enough mixing to prevent widespread fog. Surface 
high pressure will be building over the area tomorrow, with a dry 
westerly flow aloft that will provide mostly sunny skies and highs
in the mid to upper 80s.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Monday)...Finally, slightly
drier air will build into the Southern Appalachian region in the
wake of a departing upper trough. The sub-tropical high will
slowly build across the region through much of the remainder of
the work week which should help to limit diurnal convection to the
higher terrain features. A weakness will gradually develop in the
ridge pattern over the Lower Mississippi Valley. A light southerly
component to the low level flow may help to moisten the local
Southern Appalachian atmosphere Friday into Saturday allowing for
a little higher chance probability for showers and thunderstorms.
However, the best chance of more widespread convection may occur
toward the end of the extended period Sunday into Sunday night as
a back door frontal boundary slips into the region as an unusually
strong upper trough drops southeast across the Northeastern U.S.
Temperatures will be seasonably warm through the forecast period.

.AVIATION...
A line of showers and thunderstorms is expected to cross the area
this afternoon and evening from west to east, mainly from 19Z to 
00Z. It is expected to produce strong wind gusts and MVFR to IFR
conditions at all TAF sites, but confidence is highest at TRI. The
TRI TAF will have gusts to 40 kts but higher speeds are possible.
Once the storms pass, VFR conditions are expected at CHA and TYS,
but TRI may hang on to MVFR cigs overnight before lifting to VFR
in the late morning hours.

National Weather Service Morristown TN
1039 AM EDT Mon Jun 24 2019

.DISCUSSION...
No major changes are needed to the forecast this morning, as a
line of showers and thunderstorms is still expected to cross the
area in the 18-00Z time frame, with a slight risk of severe
thunderstorms. The hi-res models have come into better agreement
with the timing and coverage of the convective line, and with this
higher confidence, the PoP/Wx grids will be tweaked slightly to
match the models and to raise PoPs. Winds will be the main threat
as deep shear is unidirectional and DCAPE values ahead of the line
will be near 1000 J/kg. MLCAPE values are rather modest, around
1500 J/kg, so a hail threat will be marginal at best. 

With clearing in the eastern half of the area this morning,
temperatures have outpaced the forecast, so some upward 
adjustments will be made to temps with the update.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...A short wave will be lifting out 
of the Mississippi Valley and into the Great Lakes Region today, and 
a weak cold front will be pushing through our area late today and 
exiting this evening. Convection is expected to form ahead of this 
frontal boundary and push through our area this afternoon/early 
evening. Models still showing decent lapse rates with MLCAPE values 
in excess of 2000 possible, and 0-6 km shear values in excess of 30 
kts are forecast which will enhace potential storm organization and 
severe potential.  Will continue to have strong to severe storms 
included in the HWO for today with damaging winds and hail the 
primary threats.  There may be some lingering convection especially 
eastern parts of the area early tonight depending on exact timing of 
the front, then drier air will be moving in bringing and end to the 
precipitation.  Winds will be gusty from the southwest across the 
area this afternoon, and temperatures are forecast to be withing a 
few degrees of seasonal normals. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...For Tuesday, surface 
ridging will be over the southern Appalachians with drier air 
across the region.

For Wednesday and Thursday, surface ridging will remain but a weak 
upper trough over the lower Mississippi valley will begin to pull 
moisture back into southeast Tennessee and southwest North Carolina 
producing mainly diurnal (afternoon/evening) convection. Main 
forcing will be terrain features.

For Friday into next weekend, upper ridging develops over the Plains 
with unseasonably deep upper trough over the northeast/mid-Atlantic 
region. Moisture and instability pulls back north into the southern 
Appalachians with increasing coverage and intensity of the showers 
and thunderstorms each day. Again, main forcing for Friday and 
Saturday will be local terrain features with activity spreading into 
the valley during the day.  For Sunday, a back door front may move 
into the region but confidence is low on this feature.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Monday tonight)...
Ample instability south of a warm frontal boundary that is lifting 
across the area has led to some strong storms developing over the 
southern Plateau. With the boundary well north and little synoptic 
forcing, this activity should dissipate with sunset. Overnight, fog 
may develop again in areas that received rain or near bodies of 
water, but dense fog should remain fairly isolated. 

A shortwave trough with a slight negative tilt will be crossing the 
MS River tomorrow morning, with its attendant cold front moving into 
Middle TN in the afternoon. Convection ahead of this front is 
expected to move into our area in the 18-20Z time frame, according 
to the HREF members. Much like today, MLCAPE will be in the 
neighborhood of 2500 J/kg; however there will be better deep shear 
tomorrow compared to today, around 30 kts in the 0-6 km layer, so 
storms should have better organization and severe potential. With 
the shear being mainly unidirectional, a QLCS or squall line is 
expected to be the main mode of convection, posing a threat of 
damaging winds. This line should be on our eastern border around 
00Z, with the frontal passage soon after bringing an end to all 
precip chances.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)... 
After the anomalously strong Mid America upper trough slips 
northeast through the Eastern Lakes and New England, there won't 
be enough northwesterly flow to dry out the Southeastern U.S. in 
the middle of the work week. Relatively high dewpoint air will 
hang around the Southern Appalachian region with more than enough 
insolation to create some instabilty for the development of widely
scattered convection, mainly on the higher terrain features. 
Maintained the concept of gradually increasing pops Friday into 
Saturday in the presence of a developing weak upper low over the 
Lower Mississippi Valley and associated slight increase in 
moisture off the Gulf of Mexico. Perhaps the highest probability 
for more widespread convection would occur on Sunday with the 
Canadian, European, and American models showing another unusually 
amplified upper trough building south across the northeastern 
quarter of the nation. In this scenario, the strong feature would 
be associated with a healthy backdoor cool front which should be 
more than adequate to lift a broad pattern of showers and 
thunderstorms into existence across the Southern Appalachians. 
Again, the temperature forecast will be near normal through the 
extended period.

.DISCUSSION...
The norther Cumberland Plateau has been the focus of most
convective activity this morning, associated with a low level
convergence boundary. The hi-res models haven't had a very good 
handle on this so far, but they show this activity diminishing
over the next few hours. They may be too eager to weaken it as
CAPE will be plentiful this afternoon. The forecast update will
raise PoPs this morning and early afternoon in the central Valley
based on current radar trends, then lower PoPs this afternoon as
coverage should be isolated to scattered. The northern sections
are expected to have the best chances of redevelopment this
afternoon as boundary will be in that vicinity. Strong to severe
storms appears unlikely as shear is lacking.

Main concern through the forecast period convection development 
along a warm frontal boundary that will move northeast up the 
Tennessee valley today. The latest CAMS show only scattered coverage 
at best. Once the warm front moves east of the TAF site the chances 
of storms will diminish.

Some low clouds and fog this morning, especially at TYS, producing 
IFR/LIFR conditions. Low clouds and fog will likely redevelop at TRI 
early Monday morning.

Winds will remain light and generally southwest/west, aside for 
adjacent to any storm outflow where variable gusting is possible.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
For the early morning hours, where clouds have cleared and winds
are calm patchy fog (some dense) has formed. Due to the recent
rains and wet ground, do expect additional fog development to
occur. 

For Today, a warm frontal boundary will lift northeast across the
region. Models differ greatly on the extent of convective
development. CAMS show a variety of coverage but decided to go for
scattere development. CAM ensemble CAPE show instability
increasing to 1500-2500 J/Kg this afternoon with mid-level dry air
producing DCAPEs between 700-1000 J/Kg. Some of the storms this
afternoon could be strong with the main concern being strong/gusty
winds and heavy rains. SPC has continued our area in the marginal
risk of severe storms.

For Tonight, warm front will have lifted northeast of the area
with convective development dissipating in the evening. There
could some patchy fog development.

.Long Term...(Monday through Saturday)...A mid/upper level short 
wave will be lifting out of the Mississippi Valley into the Great 
Lakes region early in the period, and a weak cold front will push 
through our area late Monday/Monday night.  Expect numerous showers 
and thunderstorms on Monday ahead of the front, and a there 
continues to be a chance for some of these to be strong to severe 
with damaging winds and hail the primary threats.  Will keep this 
mention in the HWO.  Quite a bit of uncertainty in how things evolve 
after Monday, as GFS has been the most aggressive in showing a weak 
wave that moves slowly across the region and inhibits drying, 
keeping more convection around for the mid week period. The ECMWF is 
trending this direction as well, so will keep isolated convection 
around on Tuesday and then mainly south and east areas on Wednesday. 
By Thursday this weak feature should be off to our east and we will 
be under the broad upper ridge.  Will just keep a slight chance of 
showers and thunderstorms over the eastern mountains on Thursday. 
Friday and Saturday should see a gradual increase in isolated to 
scattered mainly diurnally driven convection.  Temperatures are 
forecast to be fairly close to seasonal normals during the long term 
period.

prevailing or with VCSH/VCTS this evening/tonight, with prob30s
and more VC on Sunday. As for cigs/visb, profiles and BL moisture
suggest low MVFR to IFR conditions at TRI/TYS tonight, with less

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...
Mesoscale convective systems will dominate the forecast tonight
and Sunday, insofar as creating uncertainty in the when and where
of precip coverage and intensity. The latest event is departing to
the southeast while another system brews over western KY. This new
system will likely move southeastward perhaps along the back side
of the boundary today's system left behind. Notable are the high
temps and dewpoints near the MS River of w TN and ne AR, as to
whether it will entice the MCS more southward, but radar and
satellite trends aren't too suggestive of that happening.
Expecting the system to impact w TN and middle TN through evening
and perhaps with our Plateau-and-adjacent areas, so my highest
pops (50%) for tonight are there, lowest (20%) over sw VA.
Synoptic models have not been very refined at differentiating 
these systems and impacts, but the HRRR has a better initiation
with the systems detailed above, although not too confident with
how it handles them by tonight. With most surrounding offices, I 
am going with SCT POPS Sunday, which should be a warmer day for
most spots barring a direct MCS hit.

.Long Term (Sunday Night through Saturday)...It's summertime so 
the atmosphere is moving along slowly with features that are not 
forecast well in even the short term. The western states long wave
trough will still be ambling east through the second half of the 
weekend; eventually making its way through the Great Lakes as it 
lifts northeast into Canada. It still looks like a rather decent 
chance for more convection in association with a surface "cool" 
frontal boundary on Monday. Model forecasts pick up on a weak 
feature over the Lower Mississippi Valley which slows the progress
of the boundary on Tuesday. This requires medium chance pops for 
a few more showers and thunderstorms before the weak perturbation 
clears out through the Southeastern states. Was able to keep the 
region generally free of convection Wednesday and Thursday while 
awaiting the development of a weakness in an expanding ridge over 
much of the eastern two thirds of the nation. This area of low 
pressure deepens every so slightly into the first part of the 
weekend. In this environment, a moistening air mass with 
associated instability will gradually emerge on weak southerly 
flow. Gradually increased the pops for the development of 
scattered convection Friday into Saturday in response to this weak
feature. Typical summertime warmth is forecast through the long 
term period.

.AVIATION...A convective complex is moving southeast across the
Great Valley this afternoon dropping flight weather conditions to
mvfr, or briefly worse. The system should clear the region by 
22z. There will be a few hours of improvement before the Mid 
Mississippi Valley complex builds into the region in a weakened 
state. Utilized an mvfr visibility reduction later tonight with 
moist surface conditions from today's deluge. There may even be an
ifr reduction at tri. The next complex builds into the region 
possibly Sunday morning, so used a prob30 section at the end of 
the forecast period for this action.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Rain from dissipating MCS is diminishing quickly this morning but
clouds remain. The cloud cover will help keep fog from developing
this morning.

Main story for Today is MCS currently over Missouri/Illinois/ 
western Indiana. NAM and to a certain degree the GFS have not
handled these convective complexes well. The HREF CAMS seem to
have a better diagnose of the MCS and takes this area of storms
toward the northern Plateau into southwest Virginia between
12-14Z, then moves across the region from late morning through
mid-afternoon. CAMS ensembles show airmass recovering some with
CAPES near 1500 J/Kg SW VA/NE TN to 2500-3000 J/Kg over SE
TN/Plateau. Decent lapse rates and DCAPES of 900-1300 J/Kg will
enhance the threat of damaging winds again for Today. Marginal
severe hail as well due to the steep mid-level lapse rates.
Lastly, localized heavy rainfall.

For this Evening and Tonight, outflow boundaries from this MCS and
southwest boundary layer flow trying to pull warm front north.
Will maintain scattered showers and thunderstorms. 

.Long Term...(Sunday through Friday)...The mid/upper level ridge 
axis will be shifting east over our area on Sunday, and convection 
on Sunday should be more scattered in nature. Shear is forecast to 
be weak but model soundings still show large CAPE values and 
significant mid level drier air, so will still have a risk of some 
strong to severe storms with damaging winds and hail the primary 
threats.  Will keep this mention in the HWO.  The ridge will be 
breaking down Monday as a short wave approaches and a weak cold 
front will push through Monday night. Expect additional showers and 
storms Monday and Monday night, and will carry the possibility of 
strong to severe storms in the HWO with this activity as well. Some 
scattered convection may linger into Tuesday, then drying is 
forecast for Wednesday as a broad upper ridge builds over the the 
region. After a dry day Wednesday, enough moistening may occur for 
mainly diurnally driven isolated to scattered convection for 
Thursday and Friday. Temperatures through the period will not be far 
off of seasonal norms.

.DISCUSSION...
Large bowing MCS continues to work east across Middle TN and
southcentral/southeast KY this evening. Out ahead, a warm front
and consequent swly moisture advection continue to move into the
TN Valley at this time. Thus, am expecting continued elevated CAPE
levels regionwide, with the most unstable regions along/west of
the I75 corridor tonight. The primary threat tonight will be
damaging winds along/ahead of the passing MCS, some gusts as high
as 60-70mph are expected. Also, backed flow out ahead of the 
front could enhance localized llv helicity, therefore a few 
embedded tornadoes cannot be ruled out. All said, looking at a 
stormy night across east TN and southwest VA/NC with timing as 
follows. Latest HRRR runs favor intrusion of the bowing line 
across the Plateau by 11PM, then moving east/southeast approaching
the I75 corridor by around midnight, before moving further east 
across the I81 corridor into the foothills/mountains closer to the
2AM timeframe. Severe Thunderstorm Watch 419 continues through 
2AM.

As for the fcst, tweaked pops to align with current coverage
westward, as well as latest CAMPOP trends over the next 3-4 hours.
No other sig changes needed/made with this update.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
The main weather story tonight and Saturday will be the potential
rounds of strong to severe thunderstorms. Much of the risk 
associated with the Saturday evening severe potential will be 
conditional on the first round tonight through Saturday morning.

For tonight, ridge axis will be to our west across the 
Mississippi Valley with an upper low across the Northeast and 
another upper low across the Rocky Mountains. SW low level flow 
will increase with positive theta-e advection and a warm front 
moving northeastward across the forecast area. In addition, a 
small shortwave and 500mb jet streak will enhance ascent and cool 
mid- levels. This will result in the unique situation where 
instability actually increases overnight from sunset to sunrise. 

An MCS complex currently across southern IL and southeast MO is 
forecast to move ESE/SE toward our area and move along the warm 
front boundary tonight. With increasing instability through the 
night and effective deep layer shear of about 30kt, mesoscale 
conditions will be favorable to maintaining a marginal to slight 
severe wind threat as thunderstorms move into our area, especially
across western portions of the forecast area (generally west of 
Knoxville across the Cumberland Plateau). Timing is still 
uncertain, but currently believe the HRRR has the better solution 
with arrival along the Cumberland Plateau about 03z to 04z. The 
HRRR initialization has done well this morning and has been 
consistent for the past several runs with its timing. Am cautious 
to trust the High-Res NAM since it did not resolve the convection 
and cold pool very well across NE MO at 12z this morning. The GFS 
and NAM are also much slower with PoPs tonight, but this would be 
expected as they may not be resolving the forward propagation and 
quicker movement of the MCS as compared to the mean layer flow. 
Thunderstorms will be moving very quickly southeast, so they are 
expected to move through and exit the area within about 3 hours. 
An additional complex of thunderstorms may develop along the warm 
front behind this original MCS and move southeast toward our area 
and affect us near sunrise on Saturday. A lot of questions still 
exist about the environment behind the first MCS, but there should
be enough elevated instability to support thunderstorms Saturday 
morning. Temperatures should be near or above normal tonight as 
cloud cover and southwest flow increases.

We should see a relative break in convection midday Saturday
before additional thunderstorms are likely on Saturday afternoon.
However, the severe threat Saturday afternoon is conditional on
the environment from convection early Saturday morning and how
much afternoon clearing we are able to receive. The NAM is showing
very high instability across our region with MLCAPE of 4000-5000
J/Kg, very rare for the Southern Appalachians. The GFS has lower
levels of instability on Saturday afternoon with MLCAPE of
1500-2000 J/Kg, but these are still high values for the GFS. An
important reason that the NAM has much higher instability is
because it does not have the expected early morning convection
across the area. An upper shortwave/MCV is expected to move south
from the Ohio Valley Saturday afternoon enhancing ascent and 
supporting additional convection in this unstable environment.
Effective deep layer bulk shear is not very high, only about
20-25kt, but will be sufficient to support multicell convection. Once
again, damaging winds would be the primary hazard with an 
isolated hail threat. Localized flash flooding will be another 
hazard to monitor with increasing PW values near 1.8 inches, 
approximately the 90th percentile. Southwest flow perpendicular to
outflow/cold pools could result in convergence and training 
thunderstorms with heavy rainfall. Afternoon temperatures are 
expected to be near guidance but will be dependent upon convective
debris cloud cover during the day.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
A couple of convective complexes are projected in model depiction
to pass southeast along the Southeastern U.S. instability 
gradient across the mrx forecast area. These features will have 
some rather significant cape available for buoyancy however, 0-6km
bulk shear magnitude will be limited to about 15-20 kts. 
Therefore, possibility of severe convection a bit limited, 
therefore severe thunderstorm development appears to be isolated 
at this time. After a brief break in the action, a relatively 
significant upper trough will be driving northeast across the 
Upper Midwest. The probability of showers and thunderstorms cranks
up again Monday into Monday night ahead of the surface cool front
associated with this upper feature. Held onto a slight chance for
convection on Tuesday for possible slower departure of this early
week system. Model uncertainty increases through the last part of
the extended forecast but, it appears there will be little chance
for convection Wednesday and possibly Thursday. Added a small 
chance of a couple showers and thunderstorms on Friday due to the 
possibilty of increasing moisture and instability in association 
with an area of low pressure over the Lower Mississippi Valley. 
Temperatures through the period will be very close to seasonal 
norms for late June.

aviation will be in the later portion of the period when a remnant
thunderstorm complex may affect TAF sites as it moves from 
Central KY and Middle TN ESE toward our area. Main impacts would
be expected from 04z to 09z tonight. Still uncertainty on the 
timing and magnitude of this thunderstorm complex, so included

.DISCUSSION...
Forecast is progressing as expected. Upper trough axis is now to
our east with ridging building in from the west. Northwest flow
and subsidence east of the ridge axis is resulting in a mostly 
clear sky, drier air, and lots of sunshine across the region. 
Surface stationary front is currently across the midsouth oriented
NW-SE across West TN through Central AL. This boundary has 
resulted in a few thunderstorms forming in West TN, but these
should not affect us. Becoming a warm front, it will move 
northeast tonight across the forecast area with SW flow increasing
bringing warmer, more moist air. The combined factor of low-level
WAA and mid-level cooling due to ascent will result in increasing
instability through tonight and into Saturday morning.

Main weather issue that will need to be watched closely is the 
potential for remnant MCS structures moving SE toward our area 
from the Ohio Valley tonight and again on Saturday. Timing and 
magnitude of any MCS is still highly uncertain, so further updates
may be needed when confidence increases in a solution.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Saturday)...
For early this morning, breaks in the cloud cover, recent rains,
and winds becoming calm have allowed patchy dense fog to develop.
A few light showers across southwest Virginia. This activity will
dissipated within the next couple of hours.

For Today, morning scattered to broken cloud cover will dissipate
giving way to mostly sunny day. Main forecast question is with MCS
over the central Plains. Some of the CAMS show this MCV and
associated convection moving southeast into Tennessee and possibly
into our area. Confidence of this scenario is low as airmass over
the southern Appalachains will have a mid-level capping inversion
with relatively dry air. Will only include a low chance PoP toward
the evening hours.

For Tonight, a warm frontal boundary over the mid-Mississippi
valley into the northern Gulf Coast states will begin to lift
northeast as low-level southwesterly jet increases. Another MCS
will likely develop over the mid-west and slide southeast toward
Tennessee/southwest Virginia early Saturday morning.

For Saturday, model soundings are in fairly good agreement in
showing increased mid-level lapse rates and boundary layer
moisture. This will increase the CAPEs over the area. NAM shows
CAPEs increasing to 2500-3000 J/Kg with DCAPEs of 1300-1500 J/Kg
which will be favorable for damaging winds. The Wind Damage Index
is well over 1. Also the steep mid-level lapse rates will produce
high Hail CAPEs so large hail will be a concern with the stronger
storms.

The main questions for late Friday night and Saturday is timing of
the convection. If the storms move through in the morning, then
the atmosphere will not be able to recover. Will include the
potential of strong to severe storms in the HWO for late tonight
and Saturday.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Thursday)...
Models in decent 
agreement overall, although still important differences in the 
details.  We will start the period with the mid/upper level ridge 
axis to our west, and models are still showing MCS activity sliding 
southeast on the east side of the ridge toward our area. However, 
NAM wants to keep much of this activity confined to the northern 
parts of our area with the ridge keeping things capped further 
south, while the GFS spreads the convection further south. The ECMWF 
may not be quite as aggressive with the southern convection but leans 
toward a further south progression as well. Will keep the highest 
PoPs across the south but will include at least a slight chance PoP 
across southern areas.  Some of this convection may be strong to 
severe given the models depiction of steep lapse rates and very 
significant convective energy.  Will include possibilty of damaging 
winds, hail, and flooding in the HWO for Saturday night into Sunday. 

The ridge axis will slide east over our area Sunday 
night bringing some drying, but then a mid/upper level trough will 
be moving into the great lakes region kicking the ridge to our east. 
A weak surface cold front will approach and move through early in 
the week.  We will see showers and thunderstorms around Monday and 
Tuesday, before drier air moves in behind the front for the latter 
part of the period with mostly precip free weather expected. 

Temperatures for the long term period should generally be near to 
a bit above normal for this time of year.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...

The main concern for the short term period is convective potential
through the evening hours. SHRA/TSRA ahead of a front has
developed across middle Tennessee in a moist and unstable
environment. LAPS analysis shows SBCAPE values in excess of
2000j/kg with dewpoints in the upper 60s. The HRRR has shown this
coverage well and continues to develop scattered convection this
evening. Further north across southern Kentucky and northern
Tennessee, convection is developing along the front where better 
moisture convergence in occurring. 

Given the convective parameters, and increased shear due to an
upper level jet, strong to severe storms are still possible
through the afternoon and evening. Main threats will be damaging
winds, and hail. With the shortwave trough exiting the area
tonight, convection will exit as well. Drier air filtering in
behind the front should begin to clear skies overnight. Friday, a
surface ridge will bring tranquil weather conditions to the area.
A lifting warm front will move into parts of the area by Friday 
afternoon. As a result high temperatures should be a couple 
degrees warmer with daytime highs in the mid to upper 80s over 
most of the area. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...

The extended period kicks off on Friday evening amidst deep ridging 
across the southeast states with the ridge axis centered over the 
MidSouth region, thus favoring weak nwly flow aloft into the TN 
Valley and Southern Appalachians.  Guidance continues to suggest 
multiple rounds of MCS activity firing across the Kentuckiana region 
along the theta-e ridge.  Models (GFS/ECMWF) seem to be in better 
agreement with regard to mean layer flow suggesting one or more of 
these MCSs tracking across KY into east TN, southwest VA, and 
eventually southwest NC.  The first of these MCSs looks to arrive 
mid/late morning Saturday which depending on heating/instability, 
could favor a round of strong/severe convection, which is supported 
by fcst soundings with steep lapse rates and thus large/deep cape 
profiles.  Given this scenario playing out, would expect elevated 
chances for damaging winds and large hail. The second MCS looks to 
move in from the northwest overnight into Sunday morning, which 
based on timing would suggest a less unstable environment for deep 
convection.  That said, confidence is still marginal as the NAM 
continues to suggest abundant subsidence amidst the deep ridge 
keeping the vast majority of any MCS activity generally confined 
across extreme northeast TN and southwest VA, therefore essentially 
just glancing the forecast area.  Because of this, kept pops in the 
mid/high chance range for much of the area on Saturday with only low 
end likely pops featured over the above noted regions.  Into Sunday, 
once again pops are highest across northeast TN and southwest VA 
given the most favorable model MCS forecast tracks, but confined to 
only mid/high chances at best.  

Pops will taper late Sunday into Monday morning as the upper ridge 
axis slides east atop the region, eventually moving over the 
Carolinas by mid/late day.  Meanwhile, a northern stream trough will 
eject from the Rockies into the Plains with cyclogenesis to occur 
beneath, and a surface cold front draped southward across the 
mid/lower MS and OH Valleys.  At this point the operational guidance 
tends to diverge a bit as the GFS favors a more progressive track of 
the upper wave into the Midwest and eventually the Great Lakes into 
Tuesday, thus surging the cold front into the TN Valley Monday 
evening.  This solution would support a fairly wet pattern for 
Monday.  On the other hand, the ECMWF features slower progression of 
the upper trough leading to a delayed fropa (relative to the GFS) 
Tuesday afternoon/evening, thereby favoring only diurnal prefrontal 
convection on Monday.  All said, the start of the work week looks 
somewhat active therefore the fcst will generally feature mid/high 
chance pops.  Beyond that for Wednesday/Thursday, am expecting at 
least 1-2 drier days amidst nwly flow and high pressure. 
Temperatures through the entire period will generally be near a 
category above normal levels, especially by next week.&&

.DISCUSSION...
Made a few updates to the forecast mainly to PoPs for latest
trends. The afternoon forecast is a bit uncertain in regards to
convective coverage as well as severity of convection. Morning
SHRA/TSRA have moved off to the east as of this update. Breaks in
cloud cover were noted the past few hours, but SHRA is quickly 
moving north and east out of northern Alabama with an increase in 
cloud cover. Water vapor satellite imagery depicts a shortwave 
trough axis situated across the Ohio valley and into the midsouth 
with southwest flow aloft across the southern Appalachians. At the
surface, an area of low pressure is situated across northern 
Indiana/northern Ohio with a cold front moving through the Ohio 
and Tennessee valley. The aforementioned shortwave along with the 
favorable region of an upper level jet streak will provide large 
scale ascent across the area this afternoon. 

Past few model runs especially the HRRR and RAP have been fairly 
consistent in developing scattered SHRA/TSRA across middle 
Tennessee and moving this activity into the MRX area. This seems
reasonable especially with increasing moisture convergence along
and ahead of the front. The best timing for this convection to
move through the area would be between 18Z to 00Z as the 
shortwave axis looks to be nearly through the area by 00Z. 
Favorable parameters for strong to severe thunderstorms will exist
with H7 to H5 lapse rates near 6.0 C/km, ML CAPE values between 
1000 to 1500 J/kg, and 0-6km shear values near 40 knots. Main 
threats would likely be damaging winds and possibly hail, although
freezing levels heights should be fairly high.

.AVIATION...

Tried to trend shower/thunderstorm coverage towards the RAP
guidance in terms of timing. Think this initial round of
convection will shift northeast of KTYS and KTRI by roughly 16z at
the latest. A few hours of clearing this morning will lead to
another round of thunderstorms mainly in the south this afternoon,
before the cold front sweeps through this evening and ends rain
threat. Guidance brings all sites back down to MVFR levels
tonight, but unsure what the likelihood of that is at KTYS and
KCHA so only have KTRI coming down to MVFR tonight.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

If I'm honest I don't have a high degree of confidence in the
forecast through midday or so. Currently there's a linear MCS
moving east through middle Tennessee and northern Alabama, with
scattered convection well out ahead of it across parts of the
northern Tennessee Valley and southwest Virginia. Most, if not
all, of the CAM guidance wants to completely dissipate the middle
TN convection and really shove rainfall through the daybreak or 
mid morning hours north to the KY/TN/VA border region. This would 
pose at least some risk of flash flooding as rain rates have been 
pretty good with overnight convection and any training of storms 
would certainly lead to some excessive rainfall in spots. However,
the uncertainty with all of this is that a lot of that same 
guidance is not currently modeling that line of storms well at 
all, and lesser resolution models such as the NAM, have virtually 
no signal of it whatsoever. So, with that said, trended towards 
some earlier runs of the RAP, which had the line weakening while 
moving east through TN (south of I-40) but not completely 
dissipating. Then, through the mid/late morning hours the RAP 
ramped up thunderstorm coverage across the CWA before dissipating 
things in the late afternoon hours. Conceptually, upper level
support favors that northern track for storms/rainfall. But the
current mishandling of that line of storms leads me to believe
there's enough confidence to go higher across the south as well,
thus the trending towards the 03z-05z runs of the RAP model.

Otherwise, convective trends should take a notable downward turn
during the late afternoon hours. An upper trough, currently
crossing the Mississippi river this morning, will rotate through
the area this afternoon and be east of the Appalachians in the
5-8pm range today. Some lingering showers will likely continue in
the wake of this trough, but expect rainfall to rapidly begin to
wind down after 5pm or so. Clearing skies should allow for lows to
fall into the mid or even low 60s tonight.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...

Active weather pattern continues through much of the extended 
forecast with a fairly amplified and progressive upper flow. End 
result will be bouts of convection, some strong to severe. Lets get 
to the particulars.

For Friday, ridging surface and aloft will PWs fairly dry for mid to 
late June. Low level inversion will also help to inhibit convective 
development. A very warm day is in store.

For Friday night into Saturday, models agree with a vigorous MCS 
developing over the mid-west late Friday and Friday night, then 
moving southeast toward the southern Appalachians/east Tennessee 
valley. This MCS and associated MCV will be feed by southwesterly 
boundary layer jet enhancing isentropic lift. Timing of this MCS 
into the region is different between models, however, they agree 
with a moderately unstable airmass as mid-level lapse rates steepen.
Strong gusty winds, potentially damaging, hail up to quarter size 
and torrential rainfall are possible.

A break in the convection is likely in the wake of the storms 
Saturday.

For Saturday night and Sunday, the GFS and ECMWF suggest another MCS 
will develop over the Ohio valley and ridge southeast into the 
region. Models do not show as steep mid-level lapse rates reducing 
the CAPES some, but still heavy rainfall and strong/gusty winds are 
anticipated.

For Monday and Tuesday, an upper trough finally kicks out across the 
Plains to the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley increasing the dynamics over 
the area for Monday night and Tuesday. Frontal boundary moves 
through Tuesday afternoon.

.DISCUSSION...Previous forecast still mostly on track. Line of
showers and strong to severe storms currently moving through 
central KY and middle TN is associated with the shortwave trough 
moving in. Latest thinking is that the line of storms will still 
be fairly strong by the time it reaches our plateau counties, 
roughly 03Z for the northern plateau and 04z for the central 
plateau. The strength of line the line depends on if the cold 
pool races out ahead of the line or not. Most recent radar data 
indicates that it may already be happening. There has also been a
decrease in lightning activity over the past hour which further
supports the weakening of the storms. A warning or two is still
possible by the time the line reaches our area but expect the 
weakening trend to slowly continue as these storms draw near as
surface based instability continues to decrease as we get further
into the evening hours.

Made adjustments to hourly POPs, WX, SKY, and QPF to try to
account for incoming showers and storms. New zones already sent.

is uncertainty on the strength of the storms by the time they

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
332 PM EDT Wed Jun 19 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...

Two primary topics to discuss in the short term forecast period: 
convection potential, and increasing gradient winds on Thursday.
Large scale troughing will be the main driver of surface weather
tonight through Thursday. Currently, area radars show SHRA/TSRA
beginning to develop likely associated with large scale forcing
for ascent due to shortwave troughing moving out of the central
plains and into the Ohio valley and solar heating in a moist and 
unstable boundary layer. LAPS analysis indicates CAPE values 
approaching 2000 j/kg while surface dewpoints range from the upper
60s to low 70s. The latest CAMs show the current convective 
coverage well, and moves SHRA/TSRA east through the region by this
evening. Limited shear and weak lapse rates should keep potential
of severe weather limited this evening but cannot rule out a 
strong storm or two. 

Convective coverage should begin to decrease as we move into the 
overnight period with the loss of daytime heating. However, by 06Z
tonight, upper level forcing for ascent is forecast to strengthen
as a shortwave propogates into the Ohio and Tennessee valley. At 
the surface, an area of low pressure will be located across 
central Indiana with a trailing cold front extending through 
central Kentucky, western Tennessee, and south central Arkansas. 
The increased synoptic forcing along with increasing moisture 
convergence from a low level jet should allow convective coverage 
to increase toward the west in western/central Tennessee. This 
activity will spread eastward overnight and should begin to move 
into the area by morning. By 21Z Thursday, the cold front will be 
located just to the north of the Tennessee/Kentucky state line and
should help to redevelop convection across the area. Favorable 
parameters for strong to possibly severe storms are depicting in 
model guidance with H7-H5 lapse rates of around 6.0 C/km, 35-45kts
of 0-6km shear, and at least 1500 j/kg of CAPE. Large hail and 
damaging winds would be the main threats with any strong to 
marginally severe thunderstorms. 

The other topic for Thursday are increasing gradient winds due to
an increase in the low level jet. Some of this should be able to 
mix to the surface with gusts upwards of 20-30 mph at times. 
Temperatures should remain near to slightly above normal. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...

The extended fcst period kicks off on Thursday evening amidst the 
passage of an H5 trough atop the Appalachians, while a surface cold 
front advects into the OH/TN Valleys.  With that, some residual 
shower/thunderstorm activity from earlier in the day is expected to 
continue into the early/mid evening hours before any supportive 
upper dynamics advect east and drier air spills in behind the front. 
Thus, the fcst will feature chance/likely pops early on Thursday 
night, maximized across the high terrain given nwly upsloping, all 
eventually tapering below mentionable levels by Friday morning.
On Friday the guidance favors shortwave ridging amidst nwly flow 
aloft, while llv flows backs southwesterly into the afternoon hours 
as a warm front advects in.  Fcst profiles suggest high cape (>3k 
j/kg) Friday afternoon/evening, however with the aforementioned 
ridging presenting an insurmountable capping inversion.  That said, 
the GFS does favor convection westward across the MidSouth region in 
association with the warm front, which could advect east into this 
highly unstable airmass.  If that occurs, expect deep and 
potentially strong/severe convection.  

Meanwhile shifting focus northward into the OH Valley, a series of 
potent MCSs are progged to develop across Kentuckiana atop the 
strengthening southeast CONUS ridge, advecting into east TN and 
southwest VA first early Saturday morning, with the second to arrive 
later in the afternoon.  Guidance does exhibit some solution 
discontinuity with these systems as the GFS/ECWMF track them right 
into the area, while the NAM favors a stronger and more eastward 
focused ridge axis which tracks the MCS activity more north and 
east.  While uncertainty remains high at this point for Saturday 
morning/afternoon, strong/severe convection is certainly a 
possibility.

Moving into Sunday, the upper ridge axis looks to amplify across the 
TN Valley and Southern Appalachian region thereby favoring diurnally 
focused instability.  Profiles do exhibit steep lapse rates, however 
amidst modest llv capping which could inhibit convection to some 
degree.  The start of the new work week looks highlighted by a 
progressive trough moving east across the Midwest states with a 
surface cold front tracking beneath over the MS/OH and TN Valleys. 
There is notable disagreement relative to the progression of this 
next fropa within the GFS/ECMWF, therefore leaned lighter on pops 
for these later periods.  

Overall, the extended period will feature multiple round of showers 
and thunderstorms with temperatures returning to above normal levels, 
especially into next week.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Water vapor satellite imagery shows a weak shortwave crossing the 
lower Mississippi River Valley this morning, while locally we are 
situated beneath weak WSW flow aloft, with a southerly flow regime 
in place at the surface. Analysis of the 300K isentropic surface 
reveals an area of strengthening, albeit generally weak, ascent 
forecast to lift lift northeast from northern Alabama and Georgia 
across the forecast area this morning. CAM guidance depicts the 
response to this ascent by way of increasing coverage of showers in 
the same general area. This makes sense as the ascent should be able 
to lift parcels into areas of elevated instability through daybreak, 
whereafter surface based convection can become dominant as fcst 
soundings show a largely uncapped environment once again by mid 
morning. Radar imagery from northeast Alabama and northern Georgia 
seem to confirm this, so have trended the forecast in that 
direction, showing higher rain chances lifting northeast through the 
first half of the morning. Behind this initial wave, scattered 
diurnal convection seems likely once again today. Perhaps areas of 
the northeast where the aforementioned wave of ascent and associated 
clouds/showers is last to clear, afternoon convection may be limited 
but that remains to be seen. Elsewhere, severe chances with 
afternoon storms appear limited. Lapse rates aloft are nearly moist 
adiabatic and the only reason instability is as strong as it is, 
generally less than 1,700 J/kg for even MUCAPE, is largely due to 
warmer surface/low level temperatures. However, PWATs will be high 
and shear is low, so pulse type convection with wet downbursts will 
pose a conditional severe threat. In addition to winds, flash 
flooding is a localized concern as well. No strong geographical 
signals stand out so this would be an isolated threat confined to 
areas that received heavy rains yesterday or the day before.

Diurnal trends will takeover this evening with convection quickly 
waning as we approach sunset. However, rain chances will ramp back 
up late tonight as the influence of the next disturbance begins to 
be felt. More on that in the long term period however.

Temperature wise, cloud cover should be a little more scattered 
today than yesterday so expect afternoon highs to be warmer 
somewhere in the 2-5 degree range.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...

The extended pattern will remain active with a series of short-waves 
moving across the Ohio/Tennessee valleys. Main question is timing of 
convective clusters as nocturnal MCSs will occur for late Friday 
night/Saturday morning and again Sunday morning.  Lets get to the 
particulars.

For Thursday, a short-wave will be moving across the Ohio/Tennessee 
valleys in the afternoon. Models suggest a cluster of convection 
will move across the region in the morning, but then redevelop along 
a frontal boundary near the Plateau in the afternoon. CAM Ensemble 
shows CAPEs of 1500-2000 J/Kg and mid-level lapse rates of near 6.5 
degree C with decent speed shear. The 0-6km shear of 30-35kts will 
be supportive of some rotating updrafts.  Some marginal severe 
storms possible with hail up to quarter size and strong/gusty winds.

For Thursday night and Friday, ridging pulls into the area with 
drier conditions and warmer temperatures. Low level capping 
inversion will limit convection development even though airmass 
becomes quite unstable in the afternoon and mid-level lapse rates 
increase to over 7.0+.

For Friday night and Saturday, the GFS and ECMWF suggest a 
convective cluster/MCS will develop over the lower Ohio valley then 
pull southeast into the area. Isentropic lift as ridge moves east 
will help support this area of convection along with diffluent 
flow aloft. Airmass remains moderately unstable with good mid-
level lapse rates support of strong updrafts. Redevelopment during
the afternoon is possible depending on how fast and extensive MCS
becomes. Some strong to possibly severe storms are expected with 
heavy rain, strong/gusty winds, hail (up to quarter size) and 
frequent lightning.

For Saturday night and Sunday, GFS and ECMWF shows almost a repeat 
action as another MCS develops over the Indiana/Ohio then moves 
southeast into the region. Fairly steep mid-level lapse rates will 
produce a moderately unstable airmass with CAPES of 2000 J/Kg+. Some 
strong to possible severe storms are possible.

For Monday and Tuesday of next week, models show another short-wave 
moving toward/across the Tennessee valley and southern Appalachian 
producing showers and storms.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...
Southwesterly flow prevails atop the TN Valley and Southern 
Appalachian region this afternoon, while a weak shortwave advects 
east along the mean H5 flow.  Meanwhile, 20-30kt H85 flow out of the 
south/southwest favors ample moisture advection into the area amidst 
weak sfc ridging.  Latest trends favor sct/num convection moving 
east across the valley into the mtns, while new convection begins to 
initiate over the eastern plateau as expected.  Pops this afternoon 
will favor at least likely levels regionwide with categorical pops 
mentioned across the high terrain, tapering to likely levels 
westward into the valley.  Overall still think the primary threat 
this afternoon is deep/moist convection favoring efficient warm rain 
processes thanks to pwats in excess of 1.6-1.7 inches and warm cloud 
depths approaching 11kft. A review of most recent FFGs would suggest 
the most susceptible areas for potential flash flooding as a 
consequence of recent rainfall would be across portions of the TN 
Foothills, northward into much of southwest VA. Although the latest 
SPC MesoAnalysis indicates sbcape approaching 1.5-2.0k j/kg, am 
expecting updrafts to remain fairly water loaded which should 
inhibit severe convection, although won't rule out a strong wet 
microburst if any updrafts can get tall enough before collapsing.  

Overnight, pops will be allowed to fall off into the slight/chance 
range as the aforementioned H5 wave advects east of the region, 
leaving only minimal elevated nocturnal instability to fuel 
convection.  Given a very moist and decoupled boundary layer, some 
patchy fog is expected tonight, especially if skies sct out a bit. 

As for Wednesday, profiles look to dry out somewhat as the mean 
low/mid level flow veers westerly, thus chances for increased 
updraft height look to elevate.  All said, instability should favor 
diurnal trends on Wednesday with upward of 1-2k j/kg possible, thus 
a few strong/severe storms featuring gusty/damaging winds and hail 
cannot be ruled out.  Highs on Wendesday will be around a category 
warmer than that of today given fewer clouds (especially after 
sunrise) thanks to drier profiles.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
By 00Z Thursday, the upper levels will feature broad cyclonic flow 
through much the CONUS. A shortwave trough will dive southeast 
through the midwest Wednesday night into Thursday morning. At the 
surface, an area of low pressure underneath increasing diffluent 
flow aloft should move into the Ohio valley by 12Z Thursday. 
Increasing SHRA/TSRA chances are expected Wednesday night through 
Thursday. Point soundings indicate CAPE values quickly increasing 
through the day on Thursday with ML CAPE in excess of 2500 j/kg. 
Increased h50 flow should also help to increase shear with 0-6km 
shear increasing to 30-35 knots. As a result, can't rule out some 
strong to possibly severe storms. 

Increased height rises behind the departing upper level disturbance 
will lead to surface high pressure underneath the descending branch 
of the h50 shortwave. As a result, drier weather can be expected on 
Friday. In fact, Friday may be the driest day of the extended 
period. An upper level ridge will continue to build into the Ohio 
and Tennessee valley through the weekend. Some timing differences 
become apparent between global models on Saturday but increasing 
SHRA/TSRA can be expected Saturday and Saturday night. Temperatures 
should be near to slightly above average through he weekend. 

The ridge begins to slowly break down into early next week as an 
amplifying trough moves into the plains. An area of low pressure at 
the surface will move through the midwest and into the Great Lakes. 
Increased chances of precipitation are expected into Monday night 
ahead of a frontal boundary with thunderstorms likely with 
increasing instability. PoPs begin to lower across most of the area 
on Tuesday as high pressure at the surface begins to move in. 
Temperatures should continue to be near to slightly above normal 
through the end of the extended period.

A fairly restrictive taf period ahead as MVFR/IFR and possibly
LIFR are expected. Moisture remains prevalent across the region 
as a weak upper impulse advects east. Therefore am expecting 
sct/num shra/tsra this afternoon, with decreasing coverage 
overnight. A moist/decoupled boundary layer will favor patchy fog 
development into early/mid morning at all sites, with the best 
chances being at TRI/TYS. Thus, all tafs feature light/vrb flow 
today/tonight with shra/vcts and tsra tempos. All sites will see 
removal of wx mention overnight with MVFR/IFR cigs and visb at 
TRI/TYS. MVFR cigs will then prevail at all sites through the end

.DISCUSSION...
Weak convection continues to advect east across the region this
morning ahead of an approaching H5 impulse. Latest SPC
MesoAnalysis favors 1.0-1.5k j/kg sbcape across the region, amidst
pwats in the 1.6-1.8 in range. Likewise, 12z Nam soundings favor 
sustainment of deep moisture through the afternoon with 
tall/narrow cape profiles highlighted. Thus, adjusted pops 
through the remainder of the day to align with current radar 
trends as well as recent CAM guide. This all favored the initial 
ongoing wave of convection sweeping through the region into early 
afternoon, while some recovery is favored westward. Later in the 
afternoon am expecting another round of sct convection to fire 
across the plateau, moving into the valley for early evening. 
Meanwhile, convection looks to remain fairly prevalent over the 
mtns through much of the current period. As for threats, cannot 
rule out a few strong/severe storms capable of strong/damaging 
wind gusts, however given the very moist profiles, think the 
primary threat will be heavy rainfall and possible flooding 
issues. Otherwise, made a few minor tweaks to t/td and sky to 
align with recent ob trends. No other changes made at this time.

.AVIATION...

Another day of widespread convection is on tap. This makes it 
difficult to time exactly when SHRA/TSRA will affect any given 
terminal so have just timed in TEMPO groups for when convection 
should be most widespread. Flight categories should be mostly VFR,
but may drop well into MVFR levels in showers. Should see lull in
storms this evening and overnight. Likelihood of cloud cover 
overnight makes any fog/low cloud development a low confidence 
forecast so kept VFR conditions into the overnight hours as well.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Today will be much the same as yesterday with regard to rain
chances. The atmosphere will be largely uncapped, even earlier 
than yesterday (daybreak this go round versus late morning 
yesterday) actually, so widespread showers and thunderstorms are 
expected once again. An initial wave of convection will move north
out of Georgia and western North Carolina around daybreak. This 
should clear the forecast area early enough to allow for continued
destabilization into the afternoon hours with another round of
storms expected. Hard to time all of this with respect to rain 
chances, so have fairly high rain chances through the day. 
Afternoon/early evening PoPs are slightly lower than this morning 
given the possibility that morning convective debris clouds reduce
shower coverage later, but again I do not think this will be a 
concern given the bulk of guidance showing widespread storms 
later.

With respect to severe chances, much like yesterday instability
will be sufficient for some risk of severe storms. Damaging winds
are the most likely hazard type with any strong to severe storms.
Also, flooding is a concern as well given overall slow storm
motions. Forecast PWAT values will be high, so any training of
storms over the same area will need to be watched for flooding
concerns. Do not expect heavy rainfall to be widespread today, so
what does occur will be scattered in nature. Given this, have held
off on issuing any Flash Flood Watch products at this time. Will 
continue to mention the possibilty in the Hazardous Weather 
Outlook and here in the AFD for now.

Otherwise, an upper trough axis shifting through the area today
will wind up east of the Appalachians during the overnight hours.
Between the passing of the trough and typical diurnal trends,
convection will likely markedly decrease around and after midnight
tonight before increasing into the long term period. Left some
chance PoPs in overnight however as there is some hint in some of
the CAM guidance of some nocturnal convection approaching from the
west overnight. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...

The extended forecast is fairly complex with a series of fairly 
significant short-wave effecting the Tennessee valley and southern 
Appalachians. The strongest waves will be Thursday, and possibly 
Monday.  Lets to the specifics.

For Wednesday, models differ some on the possibly of a weak short-
wave moving through the Tennessee valley, but either way, model 
soundings show plenty of moisture/instability for afternoon and 
evening storms. Heavy rain, marginal hail, and isolated damaging 
winds anticipated.

For late Wednesday night and Thursday, models are in agreement with 
a significant short-wave moving across the Ohio/Tennessee valleys. A 
frontal boundary will move through the area in the afternoon. Upper 
jet forcing will move through Thursday with a 850mb jet of 40kts 
during the day. Air mass will be unstable with MLCAPEs of 1500-2000 
J/Kg with decent mid-level lapse rates of 6.5-7.0 in the mid-levels. 
Strong boundary flow producing 0-6km shear of 30-35kts. Expect some 
supercell characteristics enhancing updraft strength. Main 
concern will be large hail up to quarter-half dollar size with 
damaging winds.

For Thursday night and Friday, ridging will build into the region 
behind exiting short-wave. Enough instability to support low chance 
of convection over the higher terrain of the eastern Tennessee 
Mountains and southwest Virginia in the afternoon, otherwise drier 
conditions.

For late Friday and Saturday, a complicated forecast as a warm 
frontal boundary will pull northeast across the area. GFS suggest a 
strong complex of convection will develop over the lower Ohio valley 
then pull southeast into the region Saturday. Timing of storms is 
crucial. GFS model soundings at 18Z Saturday are fairly unstable 
with MLCAPEs of 1500-2000 J/Kg with decent mid-level lapse rates of 
6.5-7.0. Fairly large hail CAPEs will support potential of large 
hail. Low level lapse rates of 7.0-7.5 will also help to support 
damaging winds. 

For Sunday, frontal boundary hangs up across the area with a good 
chance of showers and thunderstorms with the main concern being 
heavy rainfall.

For Monday, models suggest another short-wave approaching the area 
with stronger storms once again possible.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight Through Tuesday Night)...

The pulse convection will weaken quickly after 01Z as diurnal 
cooling takes place and much of the area becomes convectively 
overturned. Kept chance pops for showers and a few rumbles of 
thunder through tonight as the shortwave approaches from the west, 
with the best chances being over the plateau and central/southern 
valley later tonight. Convergence will slowly be increasing ahead of 
a weak surface frontal boundary, likely reinforced by convective 
outflow, and MLCAPE across the central and southern valley will 
remain above 1000 J/Kg in this moist airmass overnight. Stayed above 
MET and MAV guidance for lows due to increasing clouds tonight on 
top of this muggy airmass.

The above mentioned shortwave will cross east TN, southwest VA, and 
southwest NC during the day Tuesday. A weak surface low will move 
northeast through KY, and the NAM is stronger with this surface low 
than the GFS and ECMWF. Suspect that the NAM solution is due to some 
convective feedback, but either way, a weak frontal boundary looks 
to cross from west to east between 18 and 02Z. Large scale ascent 
from the upper wave and frontal convergence will lead to greater 
convective coverage Tuesday, so have likely pops from mid morning 
through the day. Severe weather potential will be low overall, but 
slightly higher than the past couple of days. SPC has the entire 
region in a marginal risk, and this is reasonable since 1500-2000 
J/Kg of MLCAPE will once again develop along with a few hundred 
joules of DCAPE during the afternoon as low-level lapse rates 
steepen with afternoon heating. The main threat will be damaging 
winds in convective downdrafts. Limiting factors continue to be poor 
mid level lapse rates of only 5-6 C/Km and weak 0-6 Km and effective 
shear values of 15-30 kts. This will keep any strong wind threat 
isolated since strong convective updrafts will have a hard time 
sustaining for a long period of time. An additional limiting factor 
will be morning clouds and showers that will delay stronger surface 
heating. With all of this being said, torrential rainfall and 
localized flash flooding will be the bigger impact from any 
convection since PWATs will continue to be 1.50 to 2.00 inches 
(locally higher) with high freezing levels for warm rain processes. 
Storm motion will also be slow due to the weak deep layer wind 
fields. CAMs offer varying solutions for tomorrow, but thinking is 
that an initial round of showers and some embedded thunderstorms 
will move through between 10 and 16Z followed by some redevelopment 
in the afternoon. Kept a heavy rain mention in the HWO for Tuesday. 
High temps Tuesday will be slightly cooler than today due to the 
clouds and widespread convective activity.

Much of the convection will move east of the region after 00Z 
Wednesday as the shortwave and weak front exit to the east. Have 
chance pops through Tuesday night since we do not see a change of 
airmass and remain on the southern fringe of a convectively active 
quasi-stationary front beneath a fast mid level zonal jet around the 
OH valley. Convective complexes moving along this corridor north of 
our region will occasionally send outflow boundaries into our 
area, which warrants keeping chance pops through the night. Lows 
will remain warm and humid.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...

By 12Z Wednesday, the upper levels will feature a rather low 
amplitude pattern with several disturbances moving through weak 
cyclonic flow. A stronger shortwave trough/PV anomaly will be moving 
through the central plains Wednesday. At the surface, an area of low 
pressure will move through the central plains and into the Ohio 
valley by 12Z Thursday. A subtle PV anomaly moving through the area 
Wednesday afternoon and evening combined with differential heating 
will likely be enough to generate TSRA especially with a moist and 
unstable airmass as CAPE values climb upwards of 1500 j/kg. 
Afternoon convection will decrease in coverage by Wednesday night 
with the loss of solar heating.

The aforementioned shortwave trough will deepen as noted by 
increasing cyclonic flow as it begins to approach from the west. A 
trailing cold front will be aligned NE/SW from the parent low into 
the Arklatex. Increasing forcing for ascent underneath height falls 
along with low level convergence should increase SHRA/TSRA chances 
through Thursday morning. Additional chances of precipitation are 
expected immediately along the front through the day Thursday with 
TSRA expected as CAPE values increase.

The area will see a short break on Friday as increasing heights 
aloft and surface high pressure underneath the descending branch of 
the h50 shortwave lead to increasing subsidence and dry weather. An 
upper level ridge axis will be situated across the GoM northward 
into the Great Lakes over the weekend. Both the GFS and EURO 
indicate the ridge breaking down enough a few disturbances to rotate 
around the ridge axis. Expect increased SHRA/TSRA chances through 
the weekend as a result. Closer to early next week, the upper level 
pattern will feature large scale troughing out west with ridging 
along the east coast. This places the region under southwest flow 
aloft. Increasing moisture along with several upper level 
disturbances will keep chances of SHRA/TSRA in the forecast for 
Sunday through Tuesday. Temperatures through the extended will be 
near to slightly above seasonal averages.

1014 AM EDT Mon Jun 17 2019

.DISCUSSION...Slightly decreased pops and sky cover the rest of
the morning. Soundings suggest some capping is still in place, so
convective temperatures will not be reached until probably after
16Z. The latest CAMs have backed off on convective initiation by a
couple of hours. The afternoon forecast remains on track because
the atmosphere will become uncapped allowing for pulse convection.
Still think that the activity will first develop along the far
east TN mountains after 16Z then develop across the plateau 
through the afternoon. Some of the convection will move into the
valley during the late afternoon and evening. The main impact
continues to be heavy rain with PWATs of 1.70-2.00 inches and high
freezing levels, but enough DCAPE develops with surface heating to
potentially have isolated downburst winds this afternoon and

.AVIATION...

Convection will fire across the area this afternoon, with random 
placement owing to outflow boundaries over time. Confidence in
highest coverage is between 21z-02z so timed that in all terminals
with combo of VCTS and TEMPO for TSRA. Brief lull is expected this
evening before approach of next disturbance and associated
SHRA/TSRA. Have this accounted for at KCHA with mention of VCSH
late tonight. Otherwise, expect mostly VFR conditions throughout
the period with some MVFR possible in stronger showers.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Regional radar imagery shows ongoing convection across eastern 
Kentucky, with some scattered showers stretching back into middle 
Tennessee this morning. This is all situated along the axis of the 
low level jet and best moisture transport. This has clipped parts of 
Scott, Campbell, and even far northern Morgan counties overnight. 
However, do not expect this to shift much more to the east, if at 
all, since the LLJ is about as far east as it will make it before 
daybreak. Have some slight chance PoPs through daybreak over parts 
of the northern plateau to account for this, and that should do
just fine.

For the remainder of the short term, an upper level low/trough over 
Arkansas this morning will continue to shift east through the day 
and into tonight, providing increasing rain chances. Southerly 
surface flow out ahead of this system will make for another warm and 
muggy day. Highs yesterday reached into the upper 80s for many 
place, and expect similar conditions to be seen today. Rain chances 
will quickly ramp up through the day today. Model soundings show 
a virtually uncapped environment by mid to late morning, so expect
the plateau and mountainous areas of southwest Virginia, eastern 
Tennessee, and far western North Carolina to begin to convect 
fairly early today. PoP forecast reflect this trend, showing 
higher values there early on, with lower elevation areas trending 
upwards more significantly during the afternoon. Model soundings 
do show a significant amount of instability today, but shear will 
be lacking. And with an uncapped atmosphere in place convection 
will increase in coverage fairly rapidly, with placement largely 
be driven by outflow boundary interactions as time goes by. A few
severe storms, with mainly a damaging wind threat, seems very 
plausible today given the instability profiles, but don't expect 
widespread severe weather. Heavy downpours will also be a concern
given the slow storm motions and higher PWAT air advecting into 
the region.

Diurnal trends will mean a lull in convection during the first half 
of tonight, but expect coverage to increase late tonight heading 
into the long term period tomorrow as the aforementioned upper low 
draws near.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...

The active weather pattern continues during the long term period 
with a couple rather significant short wave features operating in 
a deep moist environment. The first wave presses through the 
region Tuesday into Tuesday night generating a widespread pattern 
of showers and thunderstorms with a bit of a break in the action 
during the day Wednesday. The next wave drives through the 
Southern Appalachian region Wednesday night into Thursday. The 
thermodynamic environment is more than sufficient for convection 
with capes around 1500-2000 J/kg for the passage of each of these 
features. However, as is typical during the Summer season in the 
Mid South, shear won't be terribly impressive, so if severe 
thunderstorms develop, they would be isolated. Some uncertainty 
still exists in the latter part of the extended period, but it 
appears there will be a break in the more active weather on 
Friday. Had to keep a recent trend of increasing pops for 
convection (in the medium chance range) over the weekend with 
model depiction of some short wave energy trying to ride into the 
long wave ridge position over the Eastern U.S.

With the loss of heating this evening...showers and isolated 
thunderstorms across east Tennessee have decreased so no vicinity
remarks in TAFS. Isolated showers and/or a few storms may linger 
a few more hours and could form close to KY/VA line as organized 
convection continues there. A short wave trough will move into 
east Tennessee late tonight into Monday morning. This system is 
expected to weaken later so with the uncertainty will not add to 
TAFS now. Winds will be light after sunset. Better chance for 
convection Monday afternoon so have added VCTS to all sites at 
20-21Z for all sites as showers and thunderstorms break out 
during the peak heating of the afternoon.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Monday)...A broken line of convection 
that moved across middle TN this morning has pretty much 
dissipated. However...a few isolated cells are forming...generally 
over the Cumberland Plateau and additional convective activity is
expected across the area this afternoon. The atmosphere has 
become weak to moderately unstable but there is little upper 
support or shear to work with. There will continue to be the 
potential for a short lived strong to severe storm but 
overall...do not expect much significant activity. Later this 
evening with the loss of daytime heating...the convection should 
decrease. However...with southerly flow continuing to bring in 
warm...moist air...a few lingering showers may continue over the 
area tonight. 

Then...a short wave moving through the upper flow late tonight
into Monday will generate another round of convection. The air
mass will again destabilize by the afternoon with CAPE values
1500-2500 J/Kg. Again there will be little shear to work with but
a couple of residual outflow boundaries may help enhance
thunderstorm development. So overall...the potential for strong to
severe storms will be slightly higher on Monday compared to
today...but believe the severe threat is marginal. With the
expected increase in clouds and rainfall...temperatures should end
up near to a degree or so cooler on Monday. 

.LONG TERM (Monday Night Through Sunday)...Seasonably warm and 
humid conditions with daily shower and thunderstorm chances are 
expected for the entire workweek as east TN, southwest VA, and 
southwest NC remain on the southern fringe of zonal west-
southwesterly mid to upper level flow and a quasi- stationary 
frontal boundary across the Midwest and OH valley. Most of the 
convection will be scattered in nature, and mainly occur during 
the afternoon and evening when daytime heating will be maximized, 
but Tuesday and Thursday will offer opportunities for greater 
convective coverage due to well defined mid level shortwave 
troughs and weak surface reflections moving across the region.

All guidance is consistent on bringing the Tuesday shortwave through 
the region during the afternoon and evening. Have likely pops for 
this time as fairly widespread convection will accompany this 
disturbance. Severe weather potential is very low since 0-6 Km shear 
will only be 15-25 kts and unidirectional, and mid level lapse rates 
will only reach 5-6 C/km which will keep MUCAPE on the order of 1000-
1500 J/kg and limit the duration of strong, sustained updrafts. 
However, isolated downburst winds are possible since low-level lapse 
rates will steepen during peak heating with at least several hundred 
joules of DCAPE. The biggest impact from thunderstorms will be 
torrential rainfall since PWATs are progged to be 1.50-2.00 inches 
with high freezing levels to support warm rain processes.

The Thursday shortwave looks to be the strongest of the two. Daily 
convection upstream over the Midwest and Mississippi valley will 
likely influence the precise timing and strength of this feature, 
but Thursday could offer a slightly greater chance of seeing a few 
strong to severe thunderstorms. Have likely pops for this period 
too. Early projections suggest 30-35 kts of deep layer 
unidirectional shear which could help increase strong wind 
potential, but negative factors continue to be poor mid level lapse 
rates resulting in lower than ideal MLCAPE to maintain stronger 
updrafts. For this reason, will not mention severe weather in the 
HWO at this point for Tuesday or Thursday. The bigger impact 
Thursday will once again be heavy rain as PWATs will continue to 
average 1.50-2.00 inches with high freezing levels. Additionally, 
some areas will have likely seen repeated thunderstorms containing 
heavy downpours by the time Thursday comes around, so the potential 
of localized flash flooding will be increasing. WPC introduces a 
marginal risk of excessive rainfall across the entire region on Day 
3. Will mention localized flash flooding in the HWO for the coming 
week.

Guidance continues to differ next weekend with the GFS maintaining 
the zonal pattern and resultant seasonable temps and humidity, while 
the ECMWF continues to amplify the pattern with strong western CONUS 
troughing and southeastern ridging developing. Ensemble forecasts of 
teleconnection indices from the Climate Prediction Center show the 
NAO trending neutral to positive and the PNA going strongly negative 
for the latter half of June. This typically yields a western 
trough/eastern ridge pattern, so will side with the warmer ECMWF 
solution for our region and adjust high temps upward to upper 
80's/low 90's next weekend.

.DISCUSSION...A broken line of convection over middle TN this

east TN this afternoon. Lower levels continue to moisten and warm
with the southerly flow and with the aid of strong diurnal
heating...expect the air mass to destabilize this afternoon with

shear and little upper support. So overall...a strong to
potentially severe storm is possible...but do not anticipated a
significant weather day. As for temperatures...the southerly flow
will continue the warming trend and highs this afternoon should
reach into the mid 80s to around 90 across most valley locations.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...The atmosphere will continue to
gradually moisten across the Southern Appalachians today and the
protective warm layer aloft has eroded. In this environment, 
instability won't be a problem with ml capes in the neighborhood 
of 1500-3000 j/kg. It still appears the better chance for 
convective development will be on the higher terrain features and 
mainly across the northern part of the forecast area. Model 
forecasts continue to suggest convection may form along outflow 
boundaries building east southeast from more organized storm 
development across Kentucky. Adjusted best pops later in the 
afternoon into the evening per model depiction. Would expect 
coverage to fade later in the night with loss of heating. Today's 
high temperatures will be another three to four degrees warmer 
than Saturday's maxes in the dominant southerly flow regime. Mins 
tonight will be milder as well due to somewhat more expansive 
cloud cover. 

.LONG TERM (Monday through Sunday)...The overall pattern through
the long term period will feature zonal west-southwesterly mid to
upper level flow, with southerly flow at the surface, making for 
much more humid conditions and seasonable temperatures for the 
official start of summer. Showers and thunderstorms will be a 
possibility each afternoon, but a couple of distinct shortwaves 
moving through the region will lead to greater coverage on Tuesday
and Thursday. Much of the convection will be diurnally driven, 
but convective signals in numerical guidance suggest that Tuesday 
and Wednesday night may see some lingering MCS type activity 
during the overnight hours. 

Overall, not very impressed with the chances for severe storms this 
coming week. Tuesday would likely be the best day with more 
pronounced upper forcing and widespread convection. If anything I am 
more concerned about the chances for flooding as the week 
progresses. High PWAT air will be situated over the TN Valley 
through the period, and with several days of shower and thunderstorm 
activity forecast this week some localized flash flooding could 
become an issue. Given this isn't an atmospheric river event where 
several prolonged periods of heavy rain will be parked overhead, 
will hold off on any mention of this in the HWO for now.

Beyond Thursday uncertainty is high. The ECMWF wants to produce a 
very pronounced ridge over or just east of the Mississippi River 
Valley, while the GFS remains more so to the zonal flow side of 
things.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...The Southern Appalachian Region
will transition into a more active weather pattern during the
short term. The surface high that has dominate area weather is
moving east over the Atlantic. Circulation around this high has
shifted winds southerly which in turn will increase low level
moisture and bring in a warmer air mass. Flow aloft will slowly
become southwesterly. There will be a couple of short waves riding
along this upper flow. Through the short term...the main track of
the short waves will stay to our north and west but will see
clouds increase during the upcoming 24 hours and while the main
area of convection should track north...a few scattered showers
and even a stray thunderstorms could move in. The best chance of
showers/thunderstorms will be over northern locations and across
high elevations Sunday afternoon. The air mass may become weakly 
unstable.  Additionally...there is little upper level support. 
So...while a strong storm can not be ruled out...do not anticipate
significant convection. 

.LONG TERM (Sunday night Through Saturday)...The overall pattern 
beginning Sunday night and lasting through the upcoming workweek 
will feature zonal west-southwesterly mid to upper level flow with 
much more humid conditions but seasonable temperatures for the 
official start of summer. This pattern will bring chances of showers 
and thunderstorms each day as fast moving, difficult to time, low 
amplitude shortwaves propagate through the flow and combine with 
daytime heating. At the surface, a quasi-stationary front will be 
draped across the Midwest and Ohio valley placing east Tennessee, 
southwest Virginia, and southwest NC on the southern edge of the 
best forcing mechanisms.

The two strongest shortwave troughs appear to be Tuesday and late 
Wednesday into Thursday. These will bring greater coverage of 
showers and thunderstorms outside of the mainly diurnally driven 
scattered afternoon and evening showers and thunderstorms that will 
occur Sunday through the workweek. Have higher pops for these time 
periods. As mentioned above, the synoptic front should stay to our 
north through the week keeping the main focus for widespread 
excessive rainfall out of our region, but have maintained high 
chance to likely pops across most areas during the day and chance 
pops at night to account for the diurnal cycles as well as potential 
outflow boundaries that could occasionally move down into our area 
and ignite convection. Severe weather potential throughout the week 
will be low, but any stronger multicell clusters that develop could 
produce isolated downburst winds during the afternoon and evening 
hours. Surface CAPE will increase to over 2000 J/Kg each day with 
steep low-level lapse rates and PWATs of 1.70 to 2.00 inches aiding 
in strong downdraft potential, but very weak deep layer shear of 
only 15-25 kts most days and poor mid level lapse rates will prevent 
widespread convective organization. Isolated flash flooding will be 
possible since any thunderstorm will produce torrential rainfall due 
to the high PWATs and freezing levels. 

By next weekend, the zonal pattern will try to amplify as longwave 
western CONUS troughing develops and forces Bermuda ridging over the 
Southeast. The latest ECMWF is most aggressive in building mid level 
heights over 590 DAM across our region next weekend with the GFS 
maintaining flatter flow. For now, have temps rising above normal to 
upper 80's to near 90 at that time along with chance pops for 
continued diurnal convection.

and flow aloft will slowly move towards southwesterly.  This will 
allow low level moisture return and begin to shift the area towards 
a more active weather pattern.  This shift in the pattern has 
allowed a weak impulse moving through the upper flow to track across 
the area.  This feature has brought with it a band of clouds and 
possibly an occasional pocket of sprinkles.  This will push out of 
the area this morning and expect to be dry with decreasing clouds 
for the afternoon.  The southerly winds will also bring in warmer 
air and afternoon highs should climb into the 80s across most valley 
locations.  Little to no changes expected with the morning update.

with a weak upper level wave are moving slowly east across the
Great Valley this morning. Of course this layer, or the cumulus
that pop up later in the morning and continue to form during the
afternoon will not impact flight operations as the cu will be 
scattered with limited vertical development. The lower layer will

appears to be the case. Adjusted the forecast to allow for
persistence of partly to mostly cloudy conditions deep into the

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

The weather pattern will continue to gradually shift toward 
slightly more active conditions in terms of convective 
development, but not today and tonight. The impacts from the 
beautiful subsidence producing ridge that continues to slip slowly
east over the Western Atlantic waters will be felt across the 
Southern Appalachian region today with just a few higher clouds 
along with some scattered cumulus development. The cu is a 
reflection of the gradual low level moistening on a little 
stronger southwesterly flow off the Western Gulf of Mexico. The 
cumulus clouds will be mainly across the southern part of the 
forecast area this afternoon and will be held in check by a most 
pleasant warm layer around 750-800 mb. A decent amount of 
insolation and stronger southerly component to the low level flow 
will boost high temperatures about five to six degrees above maxes
that occurred on Friday. A moistening airmass won't allow as much
cooling as we've seen in recent days. Lows tonight will be back 
in the 60s across most of the region.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...

The long term period remains active in terms of convective
activity. The upper level pattern will feature a quasi-split flow
pattern through the short term, with the polar jet near the
Canadian border, and influence from a weak subtropical jet across
the southern tier states. Embedded in that southern stream will 
be a semi-closed shortwave that will begin over the southern 
plains on Sunday and gradually shift east across Arkansas and 
Tennessee Monday into Tuesday. The passage of this trough late
Tuesday gives way to more broad cyclonic flow aloft over the
eastern half of the US as troughing tries to build south. At the 
surface, persistent southerly flow will keep a steady supply of 
Gulf moisture streaming into the area, along with aiding in 
producing more summer like temperatures than in recent days.


With the passage of the Tuesday shortwave, and broad troughing
attempting to build south across the eastern CONUS, there will be
a continued focus for showers and thunderstorm activity across
the Tennessee Valley. In terms of rain chances, most every period
will feature at least some chance of rain, with the highest 
chances being Monday and Tuesday as the aforementioned shortwave 
approaches from the west. Much of the rain will be diurnally 
driven, but will keep some chances even overnight as most 
guidance continues to show some convective QPF during nighttime 
hours most nights.

.DISCUSSION...
Evening soundings and WV satellite imagery show the longwave
trough across the Northeast exiting off the East Coast. Behind
this, zonal flow is predominant across much of the nation and
troughing across the Southwest CONUS. A few high clouds are 
currently across the forecast area with weak isentropic lift with 
the increasing upper southwest flow. Surface high pressure has
shifted east of the forecast area with southerly low-level flow 
expected on Saturday.

This southerly flow will lead to some warmer temperatures and
increasing low-level moisture. Should see some additional
afternoon cumulus, especially across the southern half of the
forecast area, but do not expect any precipitation because of
capping between 850mb and 700mb.

Overall, forecast is progressing as expected, and only made minor
adjustments to hourly elements based on current observations.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...Overall...it will be a dry
and quiet in the short term with high pressure in control. With a
dry air mass in place...dew point are in the 40 and low 50s. This
along with a mostly clear sky will allow overnight temperatures to
fall into the 50s to around 60 over most valley locations. The
high will begin to shift east on Saturday allowing for low level
moisture to return...increasing dew points and bringing in warmer
air. This will push afternoon highs back to near normal levels. A
few high clouds will begin to move in from the northwest on
Saturday but with the high continuing to dominate area
weather...we will stay in a dry and benign weather pattern. 

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...A transition to a 
warmer and wetter period begins on Sunday as a low level southerly
flow transports Gulf moisture toward the area, and a upper level 
trough moves into the Plains. On Sunday there is little in the way
of forcing, and forecast soundings show a weak midlevel inversion
that should act to cap deep convection. But there is enough 
instability and moisture for slight chance PoPs over much of the 
valley, and low chances in the terrain areas. The focus of lift 
and therefore the best rain chances appear to be mainly to our 
north and west on Sunday.

The eastward progression of the Plains trough to the Ozarks and MS 
Valley will bring increasing rain chances on Monday, with the trough 
passage briging likely PoPs on Tuesday. Instability will be 
increasing as well with no capping inversion and MLCAPE values 
around 200 J/kg. Shear is weak but a few strong to marginally severe 
storms can't be ruled out these days. 

Wednesday may be a short lull in the higher rain chances as a weak 
mid/upper ridge builds overhead, but some chance PoPs will still be 
kept in the forecast as the exact timing of these shortwave troughs 
is uncertain. The next trough axis swings through on Thursday, and 
may have a little better dynamics and amplification than the first 
as the low pressure center is more well definied as it tracks across 
the OH Valley. Again, some strong storms may be possible depending 
on the timing, which remains unclear. Likely PoPs on Thursday will 
drop back to a low chance on Friday behind the trough.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Early this morning it was
mostly clear over the forecast area. Temperatures are generally in
the 50s and dewpoints are in the 40s. Most locations are reporting
calm winds. 

The upper trough axis was situated across Pennsylvania stretching
to North Carolina. It will continue to translate east today.
Meanwhile, at the surface, high pressure will gradually shift
eastward today off the coast of North Carolina. The upper flow
will become more zonal through the day and into tonight. 

Today expect light winds, abundant sunshine, and slightly below
normal temperatures. Overnight temperatures will drop to about 10
degrees below normal under clear skies and winds generally less 
than 5 mph.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)... The long term 
forecast period will become increasingly active, with several 
rounds of showers and thunderstorms likely to affect eastern 
Tennessee, southwest Virginia, and far western North Carolina 
beginning late this weekend and lasting well into next week.

High pressure currently over the region, will have shifted eastward 
off the coast of the Carolinas by Saturday morning. This will bring 
winds around out of the south locally, helping to warm temperatures 
into the 80s for Saturday afternoon and also bringing dewpoints 
up for a more summer like feel to the air. Dry conditions will 
continue through Saturday and into Sunday before the shift to a 
wetter pattern takes place.

By Sunday, high pressure will become anchored off the southeast 
coastline, with relatively zonal flow aloft over the continental US. 
This will yield fairly steady southwesterly flow over the central 
Gulf states and into the Tennessee Valley region from late Sunday 
through much of the rest of the extended. Several disturbances will 
move through the region, generating multiple rounds of showers and 
thunderstorms. Confidence is low with regard to timing any single 
shortwave disturbance, but models pretty much keep the area in at 
least chance to occasional likely categories for convection each 
period. Rain chances will reflect this trend. With the added low 
level moisture...expect an increase in RH but with cloud cover and 
occasional rainfall...temperatures should be fairly seasonal.

.DISCUSSION...
Surface observations at 02z show the scope of the cold, dry air
advection associated with NW flow across the region as high
pressure shifts eastward toward our region. With the dry air, a 
clear sky, and calmer winds through the night, expect temperatures
to be well below normal. In fact, expect minimum temperatures 
tonight to be within a few degrees of record lows at CHA. Could 
see some very patchy fog near area rivers, lakes, and sheltered 
valleys that received some rain today, but expect it to be very 
limited and shallow because of the unseasonably dry airmass.

Trough axis shifts east overnight with surface high pressure 
shifting eastward and becoming centered across the Tennessee 
Valley and Southern Appalachians by Friday morning. High pressure 
at the surface and subsidence east of the 700mb ridge axis will 
allow for a clear sky and warmer, but still below normal, 
temperatures on Friday.

Made minor adjustments to the forecast with current observations,
but otherwise, it is progressing as expected.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...The cold front is finally 
to our east and drier air is continuing to move into the area. 
Gusty winds will continue through the early evening hours though as 
the pressure gradient remains tight, winds will gust in the 20 to 30 
mph range. Clouds will slowly continue to clear through the 
overnight hours from west to east along with calming winds. With the 
drier and cooler air, overnight lows will range from the mid 40s to 
low 50s. Though we won't break any overnight temperature records we 
will be close. The record low for CHA on 6/14 is 50 deg from 1985, 
TYS 44 deg from 1985, and TRI 43 deg from 1938. 

Thanks to high pressure along with the dry and cool air, tomorrow 
will be a fantastic day. Highs will be in the lower 70s to near 80 
with dewpoints in the lower to mid 40s making it feel like a nice 
fall day! 

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...The extended will begin 
in a rather quiet weather pattern with surface high pressure in 
control and zonal to weak ridging aloft. This will allow for dry 
conditions and near to slightly below normal temperatures through 
Saturday night. The Southern Appalachian Region will then shift 
into a wet and active pattern for the rest of the extended. 
Overall, high pressure will build over the eastern Atlantic. 
Circulation around the high will pull low level moisture in and 
will create southwesterly flow aloft. A series of short waves 
riding along the upper flow will continue to generate new rounds 
of convection. Confidence low on timing of each wave but models 
pretty much keep the area in at least chance to occasional likely 
categories for convection each period. With the added low level 
moisture, expect an increase in RH but with cloud cover and 
occasional rainfall, temperatures should be fairly seasonal.

.DISCUSSION...A few adjustments to the forecast this morning. The
cold front is taking its sweet time exiting. The front is
currently east of I-75 but still west of the Appalachians. With
the front still in the area, showers began to re-fire along the
front a few hours ago and continue to do so. The front will
continue to slowly move east and out of the area by early 
afternoon but until then, showers will continue to develop along 
and ahead of the front. Have adjusted POPs accordingly. The 
biggest question is whether we will see any storms develop before 
the front exits. Soundings do show some instability up across NETN
and SWVA and the SPC meso page currently shows 500 J/kg surface 
based CAPE in place across SWVA. MLCAPE should remain weak but 
just enough in place to warrant including isolated/slight chance 
storms in the forecast for the aforementioned areas.

The rest of the forecast is on track and no changes needed. Will
send out new zones for the POP adjustment.

Showers have cleared all terminals, but some low clouds continue
to linger in the valley near KTYS and KTRI. Those should dissipate
by 15z or so as the cold front moves in from the west and drier
air gets into the valley. Otherwise the main concern will be gusty
winds of 20-25kt today at all terminals, beginning in the 15-17z
time frame. Models hint at some possibility of fog at KTRI tonight
but not extremely confident in how that plays out so will leave
out of TAFs for now.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

A cold front was approaching the Cumberland Plateau as of 3:00am
EDT this morning. Ahead of this front was a line of showers, with
embedded thunderstorms, located over the Tennessee Valley. These
showers should push east of the area by around, or very shortly
after, daybreak with the surface cold front moving through by late
morning. The question with regard to rain chances is, how long 
will showers linger into the late morning or early afternoon 
hours. The upper trough driving all of this is noted on water 
vapor imagery over the mid Mississippi River Valley this morning. 
And while additional jet energy will pivot overhead this 
afternoon behind the upper trough axis, the air mass is forecast 
to dry out rapidly today behind the front. Furthermore, the trough
will largely be situated to our north. Despite the trough axis
passing by this morning, colder air will remain to our north and 
mid level temperatures will actually warm slightly as the day 
wears on. Thus, while some clouds may linger in the higher 
terrain into the afternoon hours, especially in southwest 
Virginia, think that rain chances will come to an end rather 
quickly this morning as the atmosphere dries out significantly and
elevated instability becomes non-existent.

One thing of interest today however will be gusty conditions.
Model soundings show a well mixed, post-frontal air mass in place
today, with breezy conditions beginning by mid morning across
western areas near the plateau. Mixed layer depths extend up to
7-8k ft above the valley floor by this afternoon, which will
extend far enough vertically to tap into some 25-35kt winds aloft.
Couple the mixing down of these winds, and increased surface
pressure gradients across the region and a fairly breezy day is
expected across the forecast area. Would think some gusts into 
the 25-30mph range will be seen this afternoon. Expect the 
stronger winds to be north of the I-40 corridor, though still 
think some gusty winds will be seen as far south as the Georgia 
border also. 

For tonight, winds will relax and clouds will clear out. With
dewpoints in the 40s, a fairly cold night is expected by summer
standards. While record lows don't appear in the offing, lows in
the 40s to low 50s tonight will certainly be in the top 10 
for calendar day low temperatures for June 14th.


.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...

At the start of the period the upper trough will be east of the 
forecast area leaving an area of high pressure in its wake. Much 
cooler and drier air will spread across the region providing 
comfortable conditions for this time of year with max temperatures
on Friday and Saturday in the 70s and 80s. Lows on Saturday 
morning will generally be in the 50s.

As the surface high shifts east later on Saturday, southerly winds 
will gradually advect in warm, moist air. However, the chance of any 
rainfall will hold off until Sunday. A series of shortwaves in 
southwest flow and increasing instability over the forecast area 
will produce showers and thunderstorms by Sunday afternoon. With 
little to no change of airmass and persistent southwest flow - 
relatively high rain chances will continue through the middle of 
next week.

A line of SCT SHRA is progressing east through the TN valley and
should be east of KCHA by 07z, and east of KTYS and KTRI by the 
12-13z time frame. Do have a TEMPO group in at KTYS and KTRI for
some moderate/heavy showers with reduced vsby and ceilings as the
line of convection passes through. Otherwise, terminals should
rebound to VFR levels quickly today as the air mass drys out.

.DISCUSSION...

Forecast is in good shape tonight. Made some changes to hourly 
PoPs through the morning to account for latest radar and short
term model trends. SHRA/TSRA continues to move northeast along a 
frontal boundary. LAPS shows CAPE values quickly diminishing 
tonight which should mean a downward trend in convective coverage
over the next several hours. Can't rule out another strong storm 
or two with a couple hundred joules of CAPE and bulk shear values
approaching 40 knots. Thursday, winds will veer toward the west 
advecting a drier airmass and quickly ending SHRA chances.

.AVIATION...
Challenging forecast for the 00Z TAFs with lowering CIGS, 
SHRA/TSRA chances, and gusty winds. SHRA and TSRA are beginning 
to move into east Tennessee associated with an surface trough 
and enhanced convergence. Not really confident on TSRA impacting 
the terminal and recent lightning data confirms this, but have 
included VCTS through 02Z. Based on latest CAMS, decided to 
include a TEMPO at TYS for TSRA early in the TAF period. Lowest 
convective confidence is at TRI and added a PROB30 for -SHRA 
Thursday morning. CIGS should begin to clear out by Thursday 
afternoon as much drier air advects into the area. Expect west 
winds to increase during the day Thursday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...Showers and clouds 
earlier today limited the instability across the central valley. 
Some weak instability is setting up across our plateau counties and 
portions of the southern TN valley. The better instability is off to 
our west and southwest. Showers and a few isolated storms are 
beginning to fire just to our west, within the better instability, 
in response to positive vorticity moving in with the leading edge of 
an upper level trough and shortwave. Areas west of I-75 have the 
best chances of seeing a few isolated storms. Instability may 
slightly increase over the next few hours so there is still a low 
end chance that areas along and west of I-75 could see some gusty 
winds and small hail but I'm not overly excited about it. This line 
of showers and storms progress eastward through the evening and 
overnight but transitions to showers later tonight as we lose all 
instability. Temperatures remain in the upper 50s to low 60s with 
the cloud cover in place. 

Models showing some showers hanging around NETN and SWVA into 
tomorrow morning as the cold front hasn't completely exited yet. 
There is the potential for a storm or two up that way late 
morning/early afternoon before POPs drop off as the front and trough 
exit. Clearing conditions through the afternoon with highs in the 
upper 60s to mid 70s. Winds will become gusty tomorrow as the 
pressure gradient tightens behind the frontal passage. Winds will 
generally gust from 15 to 25 mph from out of the west.




.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...A well-amplified
upper trough axis and cold front will be to our east by 00Z 
Friday, with high pressure building in from the northwest. This 
airmass, with origins in central Canada, will be unseasonably cool
and dry, which will allow for temperatures to drop into the upper
40s and lower 50 across much of the TN Valley on Friday morning 
and afternoon highs in the mid to upper 70s. 

The surface high and midlevel ridge axis move to our east on Friday 
night, allowing a more southerly low level flow to develop. Clouds 
will increase Saturday as a shortwave trough moves overhead, but low 
levels remain too dry and stable for any chance of precip with this 
feature. Gradual moistening of the column will occur Sunday ahead of 
a trough and surface low crossing the Great Lakes. The best forcing 
with this system will be to our north, but chance PoPs are warranted 
Sunday/Sunday night, favoring northern sections.

A broad trough will be positioned over the Plains and MS Valley for 
the first half of next week, which will place East TN in the deep SW 
flow with a series of disturbances bringing some lift in a moist 
environment. Timing details are sketchy this far out, but the 
general pattern that the models agree on does favor high chance to 
likely PoPs Monday through Wednesday. There may be some potential 
for heavy rainfall in this period, however that will likely depend 
more on mesoscale dynamics as the synoptic pattern does not look 
ideal, and the details are too uncertain at this point.

afternoon and overnight hours at CHA and TYS but will keep them 
VFR. A few isolated storms are possible later this 
afternoon/early evening at CHA and TYS, which could briefly bring 
CIGs down into the MVFR range. No tempo TSRA though, only enough 
confidence to put in VCTS but even that is low confidence overall.
Bring TRI down to MVFR CIGs overnight but back to VFR tomorrow
morning. CHA and TYS clear out through the day tomorrow with gusty
west-southwesterly winds at all sites by late morning.

change was to lower max temps today by a few degrees from the

currently in place. Other changes were to tweak hourly POPs 
through the rest of the day as well as hourly temps and dewpoints.
With the showers and clouds that are in place now, thunderstorm
activity should be even further suppressed. Still believe the

the central valley. Early on, precip was light and was not 
reaching the ground. Over the past hour or so returns have 
increased and rain is falling. This is likely due to the weak low
to our south across GA/AL spreading more moisture into the area

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Water vapor satellite imagery shows an upper trough situated over
the southern plains this morning, with another disturbance over
the South Carolina coast. At the surface, high pressure over New
York has created a weak CAD setup along the eastern escarpment of
the southern Appalachians, with an inverted surface trough
situated essentially from the Tennessee Valley southward into
Georgia this morning. Previous thinking was that convergence 
along this inverted trough, along with increasing influence from
the approaching southern plains trough, would be enough to spark
showers and possibly some embedded thunderstorms across a better
part of the forecast area today. And indeed there are some 
ongoing showers drifting northward across northern Georgia this 
morning. However low level moisture will be a limiting factor for
substantial convective coverage today I believe. Dewpoints are in
the upper 40s to low 50s in places as you get as far north as the
I-40 corridor, and certainly north of that. Furthermore, the
latest high resolution guidance, including the 12km NAM, indicate
that much of the shower activity will be along or west of the
Cumberland Plateau today, in line with an axis of higher PWAT
values and low level moisture. Did not completely abandon the rain
chances for today by any stretch, but did trend them downwards 
just a bit overall. Did keep a mention of thunder in there, mainly
after midday when instability will be the highest, but suspect it
will be mostly showers.

Otherwise, below normal temperatures will continue today, with
highs likely topping out just below 80 degrees or roughly 5-7
degrees below normal for this time of year. The upper trough axis
will shift overhead late tonight. A chance for showers will 
continue across mainly the higher terrain of northeast Tennessee 
and southwest Virginia late tonight as this occurs, with rain
chances ending from the southwest with time. With cloud cover
hanging around into the overnight hours, and the trough axis not
shifting east of the forecast area until tomorrow, there is not
likely to be any substantial advection of dry and cool air.
Temperatures will be below normal again tonight, but the cooler
air will hold off until the long term period.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...

An unseasonably deep trough over the eastern U.S. will bring 
another bout of welcomed cooler temperatures to the region 
Thursday and Friday. For Thursday - confidence is low for 
measurable precipitation with models differing quite a bit on QPF 
and extent. However, if the showers materialize it appears they 
will be confined generally along and north of I-40 with the best 
locations over southwest Virginia and Tri-Cities area. 
Additionally, rainfall amounts will likely be no more than one 
quarter inch. Precipitation would end by early evening Thursday 
night as drier air and high pressure build into the area. Friday 
morning some low temperatures will dip into the 40s!

The surface high will gradually build east and return the winds to 
the south. This will usher in warmer temperatures and increasing low 
level moisture by Saturday. Showers and thunderstorms will be on the 
increase by Saturday evening and persist through the remainder of 
this forecast period. The upper flow is generally zonal during this 
time frame. Forecast soundings show PWs near the 90th percentile 
indicate that any storms that develop will be efficient rainfall 
makers. Therefore, potential for heavy downpours and localized 
flooding could become a concern by early next week.

.DISCUSSION...

Made some updates to hourly temperatures, dewpoints, and wind
based on latest observations and short term guidance. Also
increased PoPs early Wednesday morning. The area is currently 
situated downstream of an upper level trough with southwest flow 
aloft. This has been able to transport mid to upper level moisture
into the area as evident by IR satellite with numerous high level
clouds currently streaming in. The surface features high pressure
to the northeast while a surface low develops across the midwest.
Lows tonight will be cooler with overnight lows in the mid 50s to
mid 60s. 

Southeasterly low level winds will transport low level moisture
northward into the area overnight. A surface trough will likely
shift into the area overnight and increase low level convergence
and SHRA activity. Locations that would likely see this would be 
across the southern valley and started to increase PoPs in these 
areas between 06Z and 09Z. A better chance for SHRA/TSRA will 
occur Wednesday afternoon which will be aided by low level 
moisture convergence, and upper level diffluence downstream of an 
amplifying trough. Instability looks to be limited given the 
amount of cloud cover and lower dewpoints, so kept TSRA at slight 
chance to chance.

VFR conditions are expected with light and variable winds through
mid morning before winds begin to veer toward the south by the
afternoon. The main concern will be regarding precipitation 
chances and thunderstorm potential in the afternoon hours on 
Wednesday. Showers will possibly be pushing in from the south in 
the morning hours and would affect CHA and TYS. Additional 
SHRA/TSRA will likely develop from 18Z onward ahead of surface 
troughing. Most likely locations to see convective potential are 
at CHA and TYS. CIGS should stay at VFR but MVFR are possible

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Wednesday Night)...
Tonight moisture will start to return to the area, starting in the 
west. Clouds will be increasing as well.  Clouds will be slow to 
increase in northeast TN southwest VA, both due to later to get 
return flow, but also due to some downsloping that will continue 
into Wednesday.

On Wednesday, a return flow of moderately warm, moist air will begin 
to move into the area, on the Plateau in the morning, and across the 
rest of the area during the afternoon.  Deep weak to moderate lift 
will be occurring during this period as well as an upper jet moves 
across the area. Also, it looks like there may be a weak N-S surface 
trough moving into the area to give a focus for convection. Overall 
moisture levels will be increasing as Precip Water values rise to 
around 1.25 inches across much of the area.  At peak heating and 
instability, deep convection will be expected somewhere near or west 
of the Plateau, with MLCAPE values up to about 1000 J/kg.  There 
could be some strong to even briefly severe storms in this area in 
the afternoon and into the early evening.  With the steering flow 
being to the northeast, the storms will initially just move along 
the terrain, then in the evening as the whole system moves east, 
there will be better chances of storms across the rest of the area, 
however, instability will be weakening as evening cooling continues. 
Will taper off thunder after midnight to just showers for the last 
few hours Wednesday night.   

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...A long wave trough over the 
Great Lakes will usher cooler and drier air into the region to end 
the week, with isolated to scattered showers diminishing during the 
day Thursday. An autumn-like morning on Friday with many lows 
reaching the upper 40s. Dry weather will hold Thursday night through 
Saturday as surface high pressure traverses our area from west to 
east. Once the surface high reaches the east coast and then 
continues to head toward Bermuda, the Gulf will open and southerly 
winds will bring humid air back into the area. A frontal boundary 
will move into the Ohio Valley and perhaps further southward, and 
this front will be oriented parallel to the steering flow aloft, so 
will be a potential focal point for repeated rounds of rainfall. 
Will the brunt of that weather remain to our north or will the front 
buckle far enough southward to have greater impact on our area? 
Right now our extended models keep the front to our north. 
Regardless, disturbances in the flow aloft will be enough to trigger 
rounds of convection in our forecast from Sunday through Tuesday.

.AVIATION...
Main focus for these TAFs is the ceiling height and the wind
direction. Ceilings should come in tonight at KCHA/KTYS with KCHA
being a little lower but probably only getting down to 5000 feet.
Downsloping winds at near KTRI should help to delay ceiling; only
have 10,000 foot ceiling there last couple of hours of the TAF.
Greatest precip and storm threat will be after these TAFs, but did
include VCSH after 11z at KCHA due to agreement with models on
threat of precip in the area as well as seeing that models have
axis of elevated instability that swells into the area overnight,
but stays west of KTYS/KTRI. As surface high moves to the east,
winds will be turning as well, picking up out of the south at KCHA
Wed morning, but more of an easterly component at KTYS/TRI.

.DISCUSSION...
Forecast looks on track as surface high pressure controls pattern
today. Clear skies from this morning will get coverage of cirrus 
this afternoon, but checking traffic cams upstream in mid Tenn, 
looks like sun still burning through much of this. Bumped up cloud
cover slightly across the area, but still think "Mostly Sunny" 
will suffice. Max temps look good for this afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

An area of thicker mid level cloud cover lingers from southwest VA 
through the east TN mountains as of 06Z associated with some 
lingering moisture and northwest upslope flow behind the front. 
These clouds should dissipate by sunrise as drier air continues to 
work in, so have decreasing clouds the rest of the night. Dew points 
will continue to slowly fall.

Surface high pressure gliding eastward across the Ohio and Tennessee 
valleys underneath a broad H5 trough will lead to a mostly sunny but 
cool day today with highs generally in the mid 70's to low 80's. A 
much drier airmass with lower dew points will make it feel more 
comfortable outside. The influence of the surface high and the 
already cool airmass in place will lead to another cool night 
tonight as winds go light and variable, however, used the slightly 
warmer MAV guidance for lows since projected soundings suggest an 
increase in mid level moisture which will cause a high and mid level 
cloud deck to slowly develop throughout the night. Upper 50's to low 
60's for lows are expected across the valley, plateau, and southwest 
NC with low to mid 50's across southwest VA and far northeast TN.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...

A long wave trough will be amplifying as it progresses slowly 
east across the Eastern U.S. from Wednesday through Friday. An 
initial wave rides through the base of the trough Wednesday night 
while a weaker short wave follows behind during the day Thursday. 
The initial wave is associated with a fropa early in the day 
Thursday and will have sufficient most unstable cape on the order 
of 1-2k j/kg and rather impressive 1000-500mb bulk shear in the 
neighborhood of 40-50kts Wednesday night. The western half of the 
forecast area will be under a Marginal risk for severe 
thunderstorm development in this environment. Again, a trailing 
piece of energy will move across the Central Appalachians on 
Thursday, keeping the threat for a few more showers and 
thunderstorms going through the day. Thursday night into Friday 
will be a cooler and drier period with surface high pressure 
building into the region. By Saturday, the center of the surface 
ridge will have shifted to the Southeast Atlantic Coast allowing a
gradual return to low level southerly flow off the Gulf of 
Mexico. Forecast confidence decreases to some degree in the latter
part of the extended, however slow moistening along with the 
passage of some weak short wave energy through the Ohio Valley; 
will lead to the possibility of a few showers and thunderstorms 
across the area mainly on Sunday. There appears to be a little 
better chance for more widespread convection in the Southern 
Appalachian region on Monday as a more well developed short wave 
moves encounters moist and unstable air on its eastward trek 
across the Ohio Valley through the day. The first three days of 
the extended period will be several degrees below normal with 
recovery to typical mid June warmth over the weekend into the 
early part of the work week.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...After a few lingering 
showers eastern areas this evening near the exiting cold front, 
the remainder of the short term period will be precip free as 
drier air pushes in. Clouds will be decreasing overnight, with 
plenty of sunshine on Tuesday as surface high pressure builds in. 
Relative humidity values will be low Tuesday afternoon and high 
temperatures will be a bit below seasonal normals.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...By 00Z Wednesday, 
broad troughing will be situated across the eastern two thirds of 
the CONUS with a leading shortwave exiting New England while 
another shortwave begins to dive southeast out of the Dakotas. At 
the surface, an area of low pressure will be in the process of 
developing under h50 height falls in the midwest. Further south, 
another area of low pressure will be located across the Gulf Coast
and is progged to move northeast Tuesday night. Surface high 
pressure will still have an influence over most of the Ohio 
valley, and Appalachians. This subsidence will favor dry weather 
from Tuesday night into Wednesday. Temperatures will continue to 
be below normal through Wednesday. 

Wednesday, the trough continues its descent to the south veering 
winds in the lower troposphere to the southeast. Moisture return 
will be quick and point forecast soundings confirm the limited 
moisture. Increased large-scale forcing for ascent supports isolated 
to scattered SHRA for most of the area. There are some questions 
involving how much instability that can develop ahead of the upper 
level forcing. However, soundings and 2-D plane views suggest 
increasing elevated MU CAPE values above the boundary layer. The 
upper level jet impinging on the area and a 30-35 knot low level jet 
will increase shear with EBWD near 40 knots. This could support a 
couple of strong storms and the SPC has some of the forecast area in 
a Day-3 marginal risk. Hail would be the main threat given lower 
freezing level heights. Confidence is low but will include this into 
the HWO. SHRA/TSRA will come to an end late Wednesday night into 
early Thursday as the main trough and associated surface low exits 
the area. High pressure underneath the descending branch of the h50 
trough will quickly move in by Thursday with dry weather expected 
through Friday. Temperatures will continue to be below normal.

The upper level pattern begins to flatten out a bit toward the 
weekend. Several disturbances will likely travel through this flow 
aloft. A well established southwest flow in the lower levels will 
advect moisture northward. Several of these disturbances could lead 
to increased chances of SHRA/TSRA. Enough uncertainty exists to keep 
PoPs at slight chance. More uncertainty exists toward early next 
week. Broad cyclonic flow will likely set up across the area. The 
ECMWF and GFS hint at a stalled frontal boundary becoming situated 
across the Ohio valley with several rounds of precipitation 
associated with that boundary. Introduced slight chance to chance 
PoPs for the late weekend and early next week period. Temperatures 
will likely stay near to below normal during this time.

ahead of a prefrontal surface trough, with the actual front
lagging just a bit behind. This front will be moving through

bit, and will also adjust sky cover and raise most temperatures

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...The area of low pressure that has 
been responsible for the showers and storms the last several days
finally moves out tonight. An upper level trough swinging through
the Ohio River Valley pushes the low east and an associated cold 
front brings in drier air. However, we still have to deal with one
last day of active weather. 

CAMs show showers and storms firing back up by mid to late morning 
with coverage increasing from late morning through mid/late 
afternoon. CAMs show the bulk of the activity initiating generally 
along I-75 and points eastward so have reflected this in the hourly 
POPs. The main threat with the storms today will once again be 
moderate to heavy rain. WPC day 1 excessive rainfall outlook has our 
extreme eastern areas, foothills up through NETN into SWVA, in a 
slight risk for today. The airmass over these areas hold onto the 
deep moisture the longest with drier air not moving in until 
tonight. Areas west of I-75 will see some showers and storms as well 
but don't expect them to be the main problem areas for today. This 
is due to the drier air moving into these areas first, roughly 
early/mid afternoon. Any areas that see repeated bouts of heavy rain 
have the potential to see localized flash flooding, especially for 
areas that have already seen several inches of rain over the past 
few days. Didn't have enough confidence to issue a flash flood watch 
for our far eastern areas today as the storms should be moving 
quicker but will be watching things closely. Winds will also become 
gusty this afternoon as the front draws closer. Expect gusts in the 
15 to 25 mph rage for most areas from out of the northwest.

Conditions improve tonight as the front moves through. Favored 
upslope areas will hold onto the clouds and light showers the 
longest. Overnight lows will range from the lower to upper 50s.


.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...The long-term will be 
highlighted by near to below normal temps with shower/storm 
chances every couple of days as west-northwest flow aloft brings 
several disturbances and their associated cold fronts through the 
Tennessee and Ohio valleys. 

A broad H5 trough across the eastern U.S. with surface high pressure 
moving eastward across the Tennessee and Ohio valleys will bring 
beautiful weather Tuesday with lots of sunshine, highs in the mid 
70's/low 80's, and much lower humidity. The surface high just to our 
north Tuesday night with clear skies and nearly calm winds will 
allow for good sleeping weather as lows fall into the 50's across 
most of the region.

Heights will quickly rise across the TN valley Wednesday in response 
to a strong shortwave trough dropping through the N Plains and upper 
Midwest. This will induce weak surface low pressure over Iowa that 
will move into the Great Lakes Wednesday night and Thursday. This 
will allow for slightly warmer temps across our region Wednesday 
with gradually increasing dew points as WAA increases ahead of the 
system. Soundings and model plan view trajectories suggest some 925-
700 mb moisture and theta e advection Wednesday into Wednesday night 
as the above mentioned WAA increases, but it will be short duration 
and result in very limited instability. Nevertheless, large scale 
ascent will increase from Wednesday afternoon through Wednesday 
night ahead of the associated cold front, so have chance pops for 
showers/storms at this time. The surface low will deepen and quickly 
move northeast into eastern Canada Thursday reinforcing a deep 
longwave trough across the eastern U.S. The associated cold front 
should push through east TN, southwest VA, and southwest NC Thursday 
morning with chance pops continuing into the early afternoon as wrap 
around moisture dives through the trough. Temps will be cool once 
again Thursday with highs generally mid/upper 70's.

A surface high dropping into the region on the backside of the 
trough Thursday night and Friday will maintain the cool pattern, but 
mainly clear skies will allow for picture perfect weather for 
outdoor activities.

We should squeeze out one more dry and pleasant day Saturday before 
rain chances return Sunday and Monday. The surface high moving east 
generating return flow and rising H5 heights will cause high temps 
Saturday to moderate to seasonable levels, but another H5 trough 
will be developing across the northern tier of the U.S. A series of 
weak disturbances rotating through this mid/upper level flow pattern 
will result in a frontal boundary gradually sinking south into the 
TN valley Sunday through early next week, so have broad chance pops 
at this time. This front may stall across the region early next 
week, so it could be the beginning of another wet pattern.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...Pattern will finally be 
changing during the short term period, as the upper low has opened 
up and the lingering trough will be ejected east as a new upper 
trough digs into the Great Lakes Region.  A cold front will swing 
through our area during the day Monday, with drier air starting to 
move in behind it later in the day.  There will still be showers 
around into tonight, and better coverage of showers/thunderstorms 
can be expected Monday as the front moves through. Still looks like 
the primary threat with any showers/storms will be heavy rain that 
may lead to flooding, especially where training occurs and/or heavy 
rain falls on already saturated soils. Still looks like this is best 
covered as a mention in the HWO, as this threat still looks 
localized.  High temperatures monday are expected to be near or 
a bit below seasonal normals.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...After several days 
of rainfall, the area will begin to dry out as a frontal boundary 
continues to exit the area by 00Z Tuesday. High pressure moving in
quickly behind the front will provide a northerly wind advecting 
much drier air into the area. Lows Monday night should be cooler 
as cold air advection ramps up behind the front and 850mb 
temperatures drop to +6 to +8 C. By 12Z Tuesday, much of the 
eastern two thirds of the country will be underneath cyclonic flow
as a rather deep trough moves out of the Canadian provinces. 
Surface high pressure will glide northeast through the TN and OH 
valley by late Tuesday night. A descending upper level jet across 
the northern Rockies will tend to amplify the pattern by 12Z 
Wednesday with a deep shortwave cutting through the midwest. The 
surface response will be low pressure developing across Iowa and 
will move east underneath h50 height falls. At the same time, a 
weak area of low pressure will likely develop across the GoM 
underneath mid level troughing. Moisture will not be as plentiful 
as this past week and weekend, but with increasing forcing for 
ascent SHRA/TSRA chances will be increasing Wednesday afternoon 
and night. 

Troughing and the surface low pressure quickly moves north and east 
with increasing heights aloft and high pressure moving in underneath 
the descending branch of the h50 trough. This will provide another 
dry period through Saturday. Temperatures should be near to slightly 
below normal through this time period. Models begin to diverge 
toward the latter half of the weekend and into early next week. The 
GFS is a bit stronger with a weak shortwave and associated surface 
low over the plains. Both however indicate a low amplitude h50 
pattern with several disturbances moving through weak flow. A 
southwest low level flow should be sufficient to transport moisture 
northward, and any of these waves could trigger isolated to 
scattered SHRA/TSRA from Saturday into early Monday. As a result, 
included slight chance PoPs from Saturday through Monday. 
Temperatures will likely start to increase closer to climatological 
values for the end of the weekend and early next week.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Monday)...

The cut off low pressure system that has brought the wet weather to 
the region the past few days will finally begin to open up today 
into an H5 trough that will be centered from the TN valley to the 
central Gulf coast. However, this will continue to keep diffluent 
southerly upper level flow across the southern Appalachians on the
east side of the trough axis which will continue deep layer lift 
and enhance an 850 mb jet. This low-level jet will continue 
transporting tropical moisture into the region. Winds in the 
925-700 mb layer continue to show high theta e and moisture fluxes
transported right into the area which will keep PWATs as high as 
2 inches as well as continue to keep freezing levels high for warm
rain processes. At the surface, the low will be centered in 
northern AL today with a cold front extending south and a quasi-
stationary front stretching east across north GA and SC. Expect 
the scattered light showers early this morning to expand in 
coverage again during the day as daytime heating takes place. 
Afternoon surface based CAPE of 1500- 2000 j/kg will allow for 
thunderstorms again with locally heavy rainfall rates. Low to mid 
level flow looks more southerly today, likely a result of the more
open wave, which will reduce downsloping and allow for greater 
coverage of showers/storms in the valley compared to yesterday.

A diurnal decrease in rainfall coverage is expected again tonight, 
although chance pops for scattered showers will continue. A strong 
northern stream shortwave trough moving toward the Great Lakes will 
begin to absorb the old southern U.S. H5 trough and surface low 
resulting in more of an elongated trough from the Great Lakes to the 
deep South by Monday afternoon. This will cause a surface cold front 
to slowly move into our region tonight with large scale ascent 
acting as a lifting mechanism for the scattered showers. The cold 
front will slowly move eastward across the southern Appalachians 
Monday with daytime heating generating widespread showers/storms 
ahead of the boundary for one more day. High freezing levels and 
PWATs will once again cause locally heavy rainfall Monday 
afternoon before the front exits the region and finally allows a 
surface high to begin to bring a drier airmass Monday night. Near 
to below normal temps will continue through Monday due to limited 
sunshine.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...

The period begins with the last hurrah of our ongoing rain event.
The culprit H5 trough axis will move east of the area as a 
shortwave trough moves into the Great Lakes and gives our old 
trough axis a shove out. After Monday evening, rain chances should
drop quickly, with no POPS in the forecast for Tuesday and 
Tuesday night. A stronger piece of energy will then drop into the 
MS Valley Wednesday which will work upon some marginal return 
moisture to produce a round of showers and tstms late Wed and Wed 
night with light scattered showers Thursday. Rapid drying again 
occurs Thurs evening, and Friday looks to be an unseasonably 
comfortable day for mid June with below normal temps and lower 
humidities. Extended models then diverge for late week, with the 
GFS bringing in another system, but the Europeans and Canadians 
favoring a dry pattern. Will toss in some 20 percent POPS for 
Saturday.

.DISCUSSION...
For the very short term, an area of low-topped showers and
localized thunder is moving across far northeast Tennessee and
southwest Virginia. High PWs and efficient warm rain process
producing fairly high rainfall rates over this area. So far, no
reports of flooding, but would not be surprised of local runoff
issues for the next hour or two.

Otherwise, upper trough over the Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys
will keep periods of showers and possibly a thunderstorm as waves
rotate around this low. Downsloping has limited the coverage over
the Knoxville/Morristown areas. Will continue with current chances
of rainfall.

Made some minor changes to min and hourly temperatures for
tonight.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...
Pattern continues to be rather 
stagnant, with the upper low centered over western TN making only 
slow progress east and northeast. This low will gradually weaken and 
open up during the short term, but will continue to move very 
slowly. We will remain in a very moist environment, with PW values 
running between 1.5 and 2 inches for the most part across the area. 
Pieces of weak short wave energy will eject out of the base of the 
upper low and will help to enhance showers and thunderstorms at 
times. One of these is helping to enhance the current activity, 
although the southeast low level downslope flow is acting to inhibit 
activity across much of the valley. Models are struggling to handle 
timing of these weak impulses as is often the case, but it looks 
like another will affect the area later tonight and/or during 
Sunday. 

The southeast low level flow across the mountains is forecast to 
weaken a bit later tonight into Sunday, so activity in the valley 
should have less downslope flow to inhibit it.  

Given the moist environment and the possibility of training 
showers/storms, along with expected efficient rain processes given 
the high freezing levels/skinny CAPE profiles, the threat of 
localized flooding will continue for the short term. Will continue 
to mention this threat in the HWO, but no flood/flash flood watch at 
this time as the risk of widespread flooding does not look high at 
this time.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...Models are in 
fairly good agreement through the extended. By 00Z Monday, an h50 
open wave is progged to be situated through the Tennessee valley 
and southeast while a strong shortwave moves through the northern 
plains. The surface reflection depicts an are of low pressure 
situated across central KY with a trailing frontal boundary 
through central TN and AL. Low level winds will be south to 
southeasterly to start the extended period continuing to transport
moisture northward. Increased forcing for ascent can be expected 
Sunday night into Monday associated with the wave as several mid 
level waves travel through weak mid level flow leading to 
continued SHRA/TSRA.

During the day Monday, the northern shortwave continues to move 
eastward into the Great Lakes and as a result elongates the mid 
level circulation across the Appalachians. This results in a 
weakened shear axis while low pressure develops further north under 
h50 height falls in the Great lakes. Forcing for ascent and 
convergence along the front should be sufficient for scattered to 
numerous SHRA/TSRA through much of the afternoon. Will need to watch 
for areas of heavy rain and flash flooding as PWAT values will still 
be in the 1.5 to 1.75 inch range and combined with high freezing 
level heights means that conditions will be favorable for efficient 
warm rain processes. Temperatures Sunday night through Monday should 
be near to slightly below normal.

The front moves through the region Monday night with high pressure 
at the surface quickly moving in behind it. This results in a brief 
period of dry weather ahead of the next system. Upper level heights 
begin to fall ahead of a developing shortwave trough to the 
northwest. Low pressure at the surface develops in the midwest by 
12Z Wednesday before moving into the Great Lakes and deepening by 
00Z Thursday. SHRA/TSRA are forecast to move back into the region 
Wednesday/Wednesday night ahead of the developing trough and 
associated cold front. The front will pass through the area by 
Thursday with high pressure at the surface developing behind it. Dry 
weather returns for the latter part of next week with temperatures 
near normal and lower relative humidity values.

.DISCUSSION...Another impulse rotating around the upper low is
bringing showers and a few rumbles of thunder to southern areas.
This is expected to gradually lift north, but still expect the 
increasing low level southeast downslope flow to diminish the 
activity in the valley as it tries to move north. There remains a 
threat for flash flooding with any areas that get under 
lingering/repeated heavy showers or storms, and this threat 
continues to look mostly isolated in nature. Will make some minor
adjustments to the forecast for today, but no wholesale changes 
at this point.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Sunday)...

Coverage of showers has significantly decreased over the past few
hours, and lightning is not currently being detected anywhere in 
east TN, southwest VA, and southwest NC. Mainly chance pops will 
cover the remainder of the night. 

The upper level low currently centered around the west
TN valley will continue to slowly move eastward. Expect showers 
to expand in coverage again from mid morning through the afternoon
as another 300 mb jet streak rotates around the system across the
southern Appalachian region and enhances lift. As daytime heating
takes place, surface based CAPE will increase to 1000-2000 J/Kg, 
so will once again mention thunderstorms embedded within the rain 
showers from late morning into the evening. Locally heavy rainfall
will once again occur underneath the strongest showers and 
thunderstorms since there continues to be high PWAT values of 1.70
to over 2.00 inches and a deep warm cloud layer with freezing 
levels between 12,500 and 14,000 ft. Shear parameters continue to 
be very weak, but there could be an isolated strong to severe 
storm with gusty winds due to a few hundred joules of downdraft 
CAPE this afternoon and heavy precip loading to enhance downdraft 
strength. 

Flooding potential today continues to look localized. Recent
rainfall has eased the dry conditions that had been in place,
however, as the low moves into middle TN, the squeeze between the
low and high pressure over the Northeast U.S. will cause
southeasterly surface flow. This is a downsloping situation for
much of east TN and southwest VA which typically leads to lighter
overall rainfall compared to what is shown by model guidance. The
one exception will be in Cherokee and Clay counties NC where
possible bands of heavier rainfall may have to be monitored later
today. The majority of the heavy rain today should occur on the
east side of the Blue Ridge across NC where upsloping is favored,
so for these reasons, have not issued a Flash Flood Watch for any
of our CWA. We will continue to mention localized flooding/flash 
flooding in the HWO. 

As the jet dynamics shift off to the north tonight and some
diurnal cooling also takes place, coverage of showers/storms will
once again decrease, so lowered pops to reflect the reduced
coverage. The cut off low will not move much heading into Sunday,
so with continued moisture transport, spokes of mid/upper level energy
rotating around it, high PWATs, warm cloud layer, and afternoon 
heating, showers/storms with locally heavy rain will develop again.
This will result in additional localized flooding. Temps will
remain below average this weekend.


.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

A slowly eastward drifting open H5 trough axis will be roughly 
along the I-75 corridor Sunday night and will move to the TN/NC 
state line by sunset Monday. This means a continuation of humid 
and convective conditions for those periods, and localized heavy 
rains and associated flooding risks will continue through Monday 
in our forecast area. These rains will finally taper off from west
to east Monday night to Tuesday thanks to the passing of the 
trough axis, probably with low POPs lingering near the eastern 
mountains. However, a sharp H5 trough will move through the Plains
into the MS Valley Tuesday night and Wednesday, which will resume
showers and some tstms again across middle and east TN Wednesday 
and Wed evening. The rains that return midweek do not appear to be
as potentially heavy. 

As this second system closes off across the Great Lakes, our winds 
aloft will become westerly and drying will resume, except for light 
precip mainly along and north of I-40 Thursday. This Great Lakes 
system, however, will usher in some unseasonably cool temperatures 
for mid June, with min temps Friday morning in the low to mid 50s 
across the Valley, and sunny highs in the 70s to near 80 on Friday 
afternoon with lower humidity! Warmer temperatures and muggy air 
will return for the weekend.

.DISCUSSION...
Showers and thunderstorms have decreased generally across the
forecast area but have continued across the northern plateau with
flash flooding on going across Campbell County Tennessee with 3 
to 5 inches of rain estimated to have fallen and about 3 inches at
the Campbell County airport. The upper level low to the west is 
bringing a moist tropical southerly flow northward onto the
plateau. The short range models like the HRR continue to show 
this upslope flow generating showers and a few thunderstorms in 
the same area the next couple hours before shifting it north. 
Fortunately with the loss of daytime heating the rainfall rates 
have diminished but flooding in Campbell County will likely
continue several more hours. More storms across southern middle 
Tennessee at this hour may brush the southern plateau. Also 
upslope flow east of the Appalachians will keep rain chances high 
across extreme northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia 
overnight. Another shortwave rotating around the upper low late 
tonight should move into the southern plateau and southern valley 
counties after around 7-8Z which current forecast already shows. 
Have updated hourly temperatures and dewpoints and also lowered 
thunderstorm chances for the rest of the night. Updated forecast 
sent.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...Pattern will be rather 
stagnant for the short term, with the upper low centered near 
Memphis TN making only slow progress east and northeast.  We will 
remain in a very moist environment, with PW values running between 
1.5 and 2 inches for the most part across the area. Pieces of weak 
short wave energy will eject out of the base of the upper low and 
will help to enhance showers and thunderstorms at times. One of 
these is exiting to the northeast early this afternoon. Models often 
do not handle timing of these weak impulses well, but at this point 
it looks like another weak wave will be affecting our area later 
tonight. Another interesting part of this equation is the 
strengthening of the southeast low level flow across the mountains, 
which should bring some downslope motion to inhibit precipitation at 
least to some extent in the northern and central valley areas later 
tonight and especially Saturday. Will carry lower PoPs in these 
areas.  

Given the moist environment and the possibility of training 
showers/storms, along with expected efficient rain processes given

localized flooding will continue for the short term. Will continue 
to mention this threat in the HWO, but no flood/flash flood watch at 
this time as the risk of widespread flooding does not look high at 
this time.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...By 00Z Sunday, a large closed h50 low will be situated 
across the Ohio/Tennessee valley providing deep forcing for ascent 
with extensive cloud cover and precipitation expected to be ongoing. 
At the surface, an area of low pressure is forecast to be located 
across west/central Tennessee providing a southerly flow across the 
area. Moisture content will be high with precipitable water values 
in excess of 1.75 inches and mean layer RH values greater than 90%. 
The closed low will gradually progress to an open wave through the 
day on Sunday as it interacts with the shortwave moving through the 
northern plains. Upper forcing for ascent along with deep saturated 
profiles will support numerous rain showers through the day. 
Elevated instability supports chances of convection which if this 
does occur then potential flash flooding concern increases. 
Temperatures Sunday will be cooler given the extensive cloud cover 
and rainfall.  

Monday, the upper level wave further weakens with a well defined 
shear axis across the Appalachians. At the surface, a wave should be 
aligned along the spine of the Appalachians.  Upper forcing for 
ascent along with low level frontal convergence will be conducive 
for upward motion and precipitation. Forecast soundings indicate 
near moist adiabatic lapse rates with a nearly saturated column 
leading to efficient precipitation processes. Again will need to 
watch for flash flooding but the quick nature of the boundary and 
cloud layer winds orthogonal to this boundary means training is of 
low concern. The upper level shear axis and associated frontal wave 
become less evident as a potent jet streak to the north quickly 
evacuates northward out of the Great Lakes. West to northwest flow 
fills in behind the frontal passage with surface high pressure 
moving into the region. Increased subsidence associated with this 
feature will begin to dry the area out through Tuesday night. 
Temperatures during this time will be near normal to slightly below 
normal.  

By 18Z Wednesday a shortwave trough/PV anomaly is forecast to drop 
out of the northern plains and Midwest. The surface will feature an 
area of low pressure directly underneath the upper level low. The 
response to lowering pressure to the west will be to veer low level 
winds toward the south. The result will be increased low level 
moisture. Another area of low pressure at the surface will develop 
underneath lower heights across the Florida peninsula. The PV 
anomaly and jet streak rounding the base of the shortwave trough 
will provide large-scale forcing for ascent Wednesday 
afternoon/evening with increased precipitation expected. Marginal 
instability parameters support chances of thunder during this time 
as well. The latter portions of the extended feature fairly good 
model-to-model agreement with a deep layer trough axis extending 
from Hudson Bay southward into the GoM. Increased large-scale 
forcing supports keeping slight chance to chance PoPs through 
Thursday.

rates have not been overly high so far this morning, but there 
still remains a threat for flooding, given the high precipitable 
water values and potential for efficient rain producers, as we

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Saturday)... 
The first wave of showers have gradually lifted north overnight 
toward the KY border and into southwest VA as the warm front and 
isentropic lift along it is lifting north. As the upper low now 
centered near eastern OK and AR slowly moves into the TN valley, a
wet pattern will continue through the short term. A true tropical
airmass will lock in place south of the above mentioned warm 
front with PWAT values increasing to 1.70 to 2.00+ inches from 
late tonight through the weekend as well as a deep warm cloud 
layer with freezing levels of around 13,000 ft at TRI and over 
14,000 ft at TYS and CHA. CAPE values through the period will be 
long and skinny. All of this being said, any showers and 
thunderstorms will produce highly efficient rainfall rates with 
little to no hail contamination expected. 

In terms of rainfall coverage, the two most concentrated periods of 
more widespread, steadier rainfall still look to be late tonight 
through midday Friday then again Saturday. The left exit of a 300 mb 
jet streak shifting over the southern Appalachian region late 
tonight through Friday morning will strengthen the low-level jet 
to 30 kts. This enhanced warm and moist advection should blossom a
solid shield of rain and thunder, and most CAMS suggest rain 
filling in after 08Z then moving north through the region. After 
this jet streak moves away Friday afternoon, rainfall coverage 
will transition to diurnally driven scattered showers and 
thunderstorms in the deep cyclonic flow under the approaching 
upper low. Locally heavy rainfall will continue in the strongest 
cores with 1-2" per hour rates possible at times.

Expect a slight decrease in coverage Friday night before the second 
wave of steadier rain arrives Saturday morning. The surface and 
upper low will be nearly stacked in west/middle TN on Saturday with 
another upper level jet streak rotating across the southern 
Appalachians on the east side of the system. This will once again
enhance the low and mid level moisture transport leading to a 
fairly solid shield of rain and thunder. After collaboration with 
neighboring offices, decided to hold off on a flood watch at this 
time. Much of the area has had below normal rainfall in the past 
month, but would expect reports of localized river, stream, and 
low- lying area flooding to increase Saturday since we will have 
seen multiple rounds of rain by that time to overcome the dry 
antecedent conditions. 

Likely to categorical pops will cover late tonight through midday 
Friday then again Saturday. Likely pops are expected outside of 
these periods. Temps will average below normal due to the cloud 
cover and rain.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
A slowly weakening H5 closed low will be sitting over western TN 
Saturday night, keeping east TN and adjacent areas under warm and 
humid conditions. The low will open as a long wave trough during 
Sunday, although still to our west. This barely moving system will
keep rounds of precip impacting the area, with several inches of 
rainfall to be seen by most areas throughout the event. Localized 
flooding risks will probably increase each day as soils moisten 
from antecedent rainfall. Upsloping winds could focus heavier 
rainfall in the mountains of the Carolinas and Georgia this 
weekend, which may result in rises on rivers flowing into TN from 
western NC, like the Pigeon and French Broad and Hiwassee and 
Nolichucky. Experimental probabilistic ensemble river hydrographs 
have yet to show a river forecast point get above flood stage, but
this will be monitored as the event continues to unfold over the 
next few days.

Models suggest precip will push off to the east Tuesday as the long 
wave trough axis finally does as well, but GFS/ECMWF/Canadian all 
agree that precip returns on Wednesday as a clipper reinforces 
troughing over the Mississippi valley and draws moisture back into 
the area. Scattered precip chances will continue into Thursday.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...A cut off low slowly entering
the Mississippi Valley continues to intensify. Circulation around
the low is bringing significant moisture into the Southern
Appalachian Region. PWs are increasing and approaching the 2 inch
mark...especially over southern locations. A short wave riding
along the upper flow will lift into the area this evening into
tonight and bring with it widespread showers and possibly a few
thunderstorms. The air mass will remain rather saturated into
Friday as an 850MB jet lifts north and into the area. This will
initiate another round of convection for Friday morning into the
afternoon. Through all of this...the air mass will be only weakly
unstable with limited upper support. Therefore...though a strong
or severe storm can not be ruled out...do not anticipate
significant thunderstorm activity. However...bands of moderate to
heavy rainfall is expected. Due to the recent dry period...the
area should be able to handle these first initial rounds of rain
with little problem during the short term. However...local
flooding or flash flood will be possible if a location does see
significant rainfall in a short period of time. The clouds and
moisture in place will help keep the short term temperatures near
to slightly below normal.

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Thursday)...Models are in 
decent agreement through Monday, but solutions diverge a bit later 
on leading to lower forecast confidence for the latter periods. The 
main feature for the long term period is the persistent mid/upper 
level low that very slowly weakens and eventually opens up by early 
in the week and ejects east as a long wave trough digs into the 
eastern states. PW values will be quite high, and impulses rotating 
around the upper low will help to enhance rainfall at times.  There 
continues to be a threat of at least localized flooding/flash 
flooding, and will keep the mention of this risk in the HWO. 
Downslope flow may help to decrease rain amounts for the 
central/northern valley areas for the weekend, thus the highest risk 
for flooding still looks to be Southeast TN and Southwest NC. 

A cold front should finally move through Monday night ushering in 
some drier air for Tuesday and Tuesday night.  A short wave will dig 
in helping to further carve out the eastern trough for the latter 
part of the period although timing is uncertain. Will just have 
slight chance to low chance PoPs for showers and thunderstorms 
during the Wednesday through Thursday period.  Temperatures during 
the long term period are not expected to diverge much either side of 
seasonal normals.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Showers and t'storms moving southeast across ern KY have been 
dissipating as expected, and will likely only affect SW VA over the 
next hour or two. Through today, we will continue to have deep Gulf 
moisture feeding into the area on the eastern side of a cutoff low 
over TX/OK. Forcing is generally weak over our area today, but any 
weak residual boundaries or low level convergence will be enough to 
spark a shower in this moist environment. The forecast will 
broadbrush likely PoPs area-wide this afternoon as pinpointing a 
favored location is highly uncertain.  

A shortwave trough rotating around the southern portion 
of the cutoff low this morning will track NE across MS/AL through 
today, and influence our area with the potential for heavy rain 
starting this evening. Strong lift associated with frontogenetic 
forcing in a jet exit region will begin to move into our southern 
sections around midnight. The NAM is most bullish on this forcing, 
placing the nose of a 40-50 kt LLJ with strong low level convergence 
at the TN/GA border. Other models follow this trend but are not as 
agressive with lift and QPF as the NAM - the forecast will follow 
this concensus by mentioning locally heavy rainfall in the southern 
sections tonight with QPF amounts there around 1 inch, which is 
close to the SREF mean. Through tonight, the focus of heavy rainfall 
should be slowly drifting northward as the surface low does the 
same. With fairly dry conditions preceding this rainfall, no 
widespread flooding problems are anticipated, although this round 
will be setting the stage for what is to come this weekend. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...
The main focus in the long-term continues to be the periods of 
heavy rainfall Friday through early next week. A surface low and 
parent upper level low still look to become stacked in the lower 
Mississippi valley and west TN valley Friday with this system very
slowly moving eastward across the TN valley and deep South this 
weekend due to a strong northern stream ridge setting up across 
the Great Lakes. This is a classic Rex block where the low is "cut
off" underneath the ridge to the north. Guidance suggests that 
the closed low will finally open up by Monday and begin to eject 
toward the eastern seaboard as a long-wave trough develops in the 
upper Midwest and Great Lakes, however, the latest runs of the 
ECMWF and GFS have slowed and now suggest the system lingering 
near the Carolinas and throwing some moisture back into far east 
TN, southwest NC, and southwest VA into Wednesday. Suspect that 
this slower trend is accurate considering that models tend to move
out summertime cut off lows too quickly.

The first round of steadier rain looks to cross much of the region 
Friday morning as the left front quadrant of a diffluent 300 mb 
southwesterly jet moves over the region and strengthens the 850 mb 
jet to 30-40 kts. The NAM is the most aggressive with this strong 
low-level jet early Friday morning as it tries to develop a 
secondary meso low near the southern valley, whereas the GFS and 
ECMWF suggest a more modest low-level jet. Nevertheless, periods of 
moderate to heavy rain will occur as strong 925-700 mb moisture flux 
and theta e advection take place bringing tropical moisture from the 
Gulf into the region. PWATs of 1.60 to 2.00+ inches still look to be 
advected into the area in this tropical airmass with freezing levels 
of 13,000-14,000 feet. A few hundred joules of ML CAPE will allow 
for band of convection within this rain shield leading to periods of 
torrential rainfall. The good news is that the ground has become dry 
in recent weeks, so we can handle a decent amount of rain before 
flooding begins.

After the initial wave Friday morning, scattered areas of convection 
will redevelop in the afternoon as surface CAPE increases under the 
upper system followed by some diurnal decrease in coverage Friday 
night. Again, locally heavy rainfall rates will occur under any 
convective cells with greater than 1 inch per hour rainfall rates 
not out of the question.

The second window of steadier rain looks to come Saturday when 
another enhanced mid and low-level jet crosses the region and 
interacts with the continued deep tropical airmass. Localized 
flooding could begin at this time since there will be repeated 
rounds of rain leading up to it. New WPC guidance places a marginal 
risk of excessive rainfall in southwest VA and much of northeast TN 
with slight risk in the southern valley and southwest NC day 2. The 
entire CWA is in the slight risk for excessive rainfall on day 3, 
and after collaboration with WPC, a moderate risk has been 
introduced from the Chattanooga area to southwest NC. Some decrease 
in coverage will again occur Saturday night.

Timing and coverage of heavier rain is more difficult to discern 
Sunday and Monday. The upper system will be slowly moving east which 
will in turn take the enhanced jet dynamics toward the Carolinas, 
but moderate instability, continued high PWATs, and warm cloud layer 
with high freezing levels underneath the upper system will promote 
diurnal increases in convective coverage each afternoon with swaths 
of heavy rain and localized flooding/flash flooding. 

Chance pops will continue Tuesday and Tuesday night, but the 
heaviest rain threat should be over. Dry weather should finally 
arrive Wednesday and Wednesday night with brief high pressure. Temps 
will average a little below normal Friday through Tuesday followed 
by moderation to near normal Wednesday.

.DISCUSSION...
Overall the fcst looks pretty good, however did make some tweaks
to pops. Latest 00z CAM guidance would suggest a stabilizing
environment across northeast TN and southwest VA with loss of
heating. Thus, convection upstream in the OH valley should weaken
as it evolves southeast with time. Therefore opted to lower pops
back into the chance range for the overnight across these areas.
Also dropped the southern Plateau and Valley into the slight
chance range through morning. Skies should remain mostly cloudy
overnight, however given rainfall today and already fairly low

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...

The synoptic outlook begins with a developing surface low over the 
Great Lakes region with an associated mid level wave. Some weak 
ridging in the northern Great Plains states with a developing low 
pressure center over New Mexico that is slowly moving to the east. 
As this low over the American southwest moves lee of the Rockies, it 
will produce plenty of WAA from the Gulf into the southern and mid 
Atlantic states.

The previously mentioned H5 shortwave will produce showers and 
thunderstorms for eastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia this 
afternoon and evening. The main threats look to be a combination of 
damaging winds and heavy rain. NAM soundings show MLCAPE peaking 
around 2000 J/kg in the south with slightly decreasing values 
further northward. Consistent deep layer shear of around 30 knots 
suggest that some areas of convection could develop into severe 
storms. DCAPE upwards of 650 J/kg and inverted V soundings point to 
potential downbursts and outflows of 60+ mph, while high PW values 
ranging between 1.50in and 2.00in show the possibility of localized 
heavy rainfall with runoff an localized flooding possible from any 
training storms. Hail threat is lower but possible, with some decent 
HCAPE and modest SHIP values between 0.5 and 0.7. Tornado potential 
is also low as LCL heights will be greater than 1000m and low level 
shear is weak.

CAMs are still inconsistent on this event, with the NAM showing the 
initial cells in the northern portion of the CWA dying out as the 
mid level wave continues east with any evening storms staying well 
to the north into Kentucky. The HRRR, while similar to the NAM, 
shows a few isolated cells forming just to the west and moving 
northeast through the CWA. A second round of convection looks 
possible for the northern half of the CWA later tonight due to the 
decrease in cloud cover. Worth noting that both the NAM and GFS 
soundings show a decrease in MLCAPE and 0-6km shear into the 
overnight hours, so any storms that form will have a more difficult 
time produce severe weather.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...

Overall...the Southern Appalachian Region will transition into a 
rather active weather pattern for much of the extended. 
Initially...a frontal boundary will be over the general area as a 
short waves rides along it. This will keep scattered convection 
moving across the area Thursday night. At this time...with lack of
diurnal heating... weakening instabiltiy and limited upper level 
support...expect the threat of strong to severe storms to be 
minimal. 

The main feature to watch during the extended will be an upper low 
currently moving out of the southern plains.  This low will track 
across the Mississippi Valley and eventually push through the 
Southern Appalachian Region.  The low will strengthen over time and 
will become cut off as in moves towards the area.  This 
intensification will slow the movement of the low significantly.  As 
a result...expect it to begin to affect the area on Friday as 
circulation around the low increases low level moisture and begins 
to destabilized the air mass over the area.  The low will struggle 
with its eastward propagation and is currently progged to move 
through late this weekend and eventually open up and slide out of 
the area around the Monday time frame.   From Friday through the 
weekend...the air mass in place will be weak to occasionally 
moderately unstable.  Shear is more directional with limited speed 
shear.  At this point...strong to severe storms can not be ruled 
out...but chances are slight and the main threat will be 
flooding/flash flooding.  Low level moisture will increase 
substantially through the rest of the week.  Recent dry conditions 
will allow for decent rainfall amounts before flooding becomes a 
concern.  However...as the week progresses and we receive rainfall 
each day...by this weekend...this could potentially create localized 
problems with flooding/flash flooding.  

Widespread convection will continue over the region into Monday as a 
front pushes the low out.  Convection chances will decrease 
significantly Tuesday and Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A shortwave trough is currently producing some convection in srn
IL/wrn KY, and this feature will be moving east through the
morning. The general concensus of the short term hi-res models is
that convection with the trough will move into our area this 
morning, affecting mainly the northern half. Residual boundaries
from this morning activity are expected to settle across the
southern half in the afternoon, which may provide a focus for
additional development. With abundant CAPE and adequate shear, 
this will pose a threat of severe storms. An inverted V profile
and high DCAPE in the NAM sounding suggests a damaging wind
threat, and MLCAPE over 2000 J/kg points to a large hail
potential as well. The tornado potential appears low as LCLs are
high and low level helicity, while present, is weak. 

Convection is expected to blossom near the OH Valley this
afternoon, with the activity moving south across ern KY through
the evening. The NAM is bullish on these storms maintaining some
intensity as they enter our area tonight, but other models weaken 
it significantly before it gets this far south. The forecast will 
keep high chance PoPs in northern areas tonight, but expect that 
it will be weakening and should not pose a severe threat.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...
The northern stream trough will begin lifting northeast Thursday 
as a southern stream upper low moves into the southern Plains. 
This upper low will induce a weak surface low with the system 
closing off and becoming virtually stacked in the vicinity of the 
lower Mississippi Valley and west TN valley Friday through the 
weekend. Latest guidance appears slightly slower with the movement
of this cut off low compared to 24 hours ago and is also more in 
agreement that the system will slowly track across the deep south 
instead of moving toward the Ohio Valley. These trends are 
reasonable since a Rex Block develops by the weekend with northern
stream longwave troughing from the Pacific northwest into the 
northern Plains and longwave ridging in the Great Lakes and 
northeast causing the cut off low to be stuck underneath around 
the deep South.

In terms of sensible weather across east TN, southwest VA, and 
southwest NC, this pattern will lead to frequent showers and 
thunderstorms with the greatest coverage of rainfall expected Friday 
through Monday. Chance pops for showers/storms will occur Thursday 
and Thursday night as WAA and weak impulses moving through the flow 
interact with a slowly lifting frontal boundary. By Friday as the 
stacked low slowly moves into the lower Mississippi Valley, strong 
925-700 mb moisture flux and theta e advection will bring 
increasingly tropical air into the region with PWAT values progged 
to range from 1.50 to 2.00+ inches Friday through the weekend. These 
values are above maximum climatology for early June and are partly 
due to the advection of moisture from a weak tropical disturbance in 
the western Gulf into our region. Likely pops for showers and 
thunderstorms will cover most periods Friday through Monday with 
slightly lower pops during overnight hours. While it will not be 
raining all of the time, the high PW airmass combined with a deep 
warm cloud layer with freezing levels above 13,500 ft will lead to 
heavy rainfall rates. The frequency of the showers/storms which will 
contain these efficient downpours will cause localized flooding, 
especially by the weekend after repeated rounds. WPC continues to 
put much of the region in a marginal risk for excessive rainfall 
beginning day 2 and 3.

A few strong storms cannot be ruled out late week through the 
weekend as the proximity of the cut off low leads to some 
directional shear, however, very weak 0-1 and 0-6 Km speed shear and 
weak mid level lapse rates will keep this threat isolated. The main 
threat from a stronger storm would be strong winds since several 
hundred joules of DCAPE will develop each afternoon as low-level 
lapse rates steepen. 

The cut off low will finally open up and eject eastward Monday and 
Tuesday as longwave troughing develops over the eastern CONUS. 
Likely pops continue most areas Monday but will be reduced to mainly 
chance Monday night and Tuesday. Surface high pressure will finally 
bring dry weather by Tuesday night.

Temps early in the period will be seasonable then cooling to a 
little below normal Friday through the weekend due to the rain and 
clouds before slowly moderating early to mid next week.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Wednesday Night)...
Deep upper ridging continues to highlight the pattern across the TN 
Valley and Southern Appalachian region this afternoon, thus favoring 
partly/mostly cloudy skies (consequent of upstream convection over 
the Plains).  At the surface, high pressure centered off the Mid-
Atlantic coastline stretches east across much of the Southeast CONUS 
(favoring sly veering surface winds), while a warm front is draped 
from the Gulf Coast across the MS Delta and northward into the 
Ozarks.  Overall, the remainder of the day looks quite pleasant 
across the region as skies slowly fill in given moisture advection, 
with temperatures in low/mid 80s in the northern valley, mid/upper 
80s southward.

Moving into Wednesday, the fcst becomes somewhat complicated 
overnight tonight as the aforementioned warm front slowly lifts 
northward with weak isentropic ascent to possibly favor iso/sct 
showers, with the best chances in closest proximity to the Plateau 
northward into southwest VA.  Into the later portions of the 
morning, a weak upper impulse (with origins over the Mid MS and 
Lower OH Valleys) will advect eastward across the area providing 
upper support atop the diurnally destabilizing warm sector.  With 
that, CAMs continue to favor a broken multi-cellular line of 
convection that will sweep southward across east TN, southwest VA, 
and eventually into southwest NC through the afternoon hours. The 
SPC has expanded their initial Day 2 slight/marginal outlooks 
slightly southward given 12z guidance favoring enhanced deep shear 
(30-40kts) and instability (2.0-2.5k j/kg sbcape).  Thus, the fcst 
will feature likely pops sweeping across the area from the northwest 
(around 10-11AM EDT timeframe) to southeast (through 6-7PM EDT) for 
showers/thunderstorms, some of which could be severe with damaging 
winds and large hail being the primary threats.  Although not ruled 
out completely, llv srh looks rather weak for tornadoes, mainly due 
to unidirectional profiles and thus straight hodographs. Likewise, 
heavy rainfall will also be a threat with some isolated flash 
flooding possible, although that threat will increase moreso later 
in the week as FFGs lower.

Moving on into the overnight hours Wednesday night (early Thursday 
morning), guidance also favors a secondary more nocturnal MCS 
firing across the OH Valley and eventually advecting southeast.  A 
CAM consensus would suggest this line weakening as it enters the fcst 
area out of southeast KY around/after midnight.  Given the 
uncertainty surrounding this potential complex, kept pops capped in 
the chance range. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...
The long term synoptic outlook starts with a mid level wave east of 
the Great Lakes with an associated cold front extending southwest 
across the east coast that will continue to suppress the ridge over 
the southeast. A developing closed low moving just lee of the 
Rockies with a low level jet over LA that will advect warm moist air 
up from the Gulf. The persistent southwesterly flow will help to 
advect the subtropical airmass and raise PW values over the end of 
the work week.

NAM soundings show very saturated temperature profiles and high PW 
values reaching up to 2.00 inches by Thursday night for the southern 
counties which will be above the seasonal maximums. A number of 
airmass showers and thunderstorms expected for Thursday night as we 
will be well within the warmer airmass with continued moisture 
advection from the south. Some disagreement in the models however, 
as NAM soundings show MLCAPE around 1700 J/kg during the early 
afternoon with deep layer shear of around 20 knots which suggests 
the potential for a few embedded thunderstorms. The GFS is looking 
far less optimal however, with MLCAPE under 150 J/kg and deep layer 
shear of 15 knots or less. Leaning more towards the NAM at this 
point, but felt the discrepancy was worth mentioning.

The previously mentioned low pressure center will be over the south-
central Great Plains by late Thursday and looks to become quasi-
stationary from a lack of upper level steering flow. With the low 
positioning to our west, we can expect plenty of WAA from the south 
over the weekend with associated showers and potential afternoon 
thunderstorms. The cut off low looks to sit and spin over the 
central Mississippi valley into and over the weekend then slowly 
transition eastward by early next week. A few areas of localized 
flash flooding are possible from the excessive heavy rainfall over 
the weekend. WPC estimates totals around 1.0 to 2.0 inches for the 
northern to central valley areas with southern and higher elevation 
areas receiving from 3.0 to 5.0 inches.

Models are not in great agreement as to when the low will finally be 
pushed out of the area. The GFS and ECMWF both are showing sometime 
on Tuesday next week due to increasing surface high pressure, drier 
air advection from the north, and quasi-zonal flow aloft. Consensus 
is even less in regard to the direction of the surface low, with the 
GFS showing it drifting towards the southeast while the ECMWF 
depicts it moving up towards the northeast.

.DISCUSSION...
Deep ridging continues to dominate across the TN Valley and
Southern Appalachian region this morning. With that, convection
upstream across the Central Plains continues to advect downstream
along the mean mid/upr lvl flow across east TN and southwest
VA/NC, thus favoring partly/mostly cloudy skies amidst high
clouds. Given this, temperature trends looked to be a little
behind the previous forecast, therefore opted for a ConsShort 
blend for max temps this afternoon which effectively lowered them 
by a degree or so. Otherwise, light and sely/sly veering surface 
winds will prevail. No other sig changes needed/made at this time.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Surface high pressure to our north will shift to our east today, 
resulting in a more southerly low level flow that will begin to 
advect moisture and warmer temps into our area. Aloft, there is 
quite a bit of cirrus this morning as a jet streak rounds the top of 
a ridge, but the cloud cover should decrease through the day as the 
flow flattens and the jet streak moves east. Highs will be a few 
degrees warmer than yesterday. 

Tonight, isentropic lift will begin to saturate the midlevels after 
midnight, and aided by some elevated instability, it may bring some 
light precip to the area. Low levels are still rather dry in 
forecast soundings so will keep PoPs in the low to slight chance 
range with light QPF, favoring the northern Plateau counties. A 
slight chance of thunder will be mentioned due to the elevated 
instability.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...
An increasingly wet pattern continues to take shape in the long-
term. A weak cold front associated with a northern stream short-
wave trough will first cross the region Wednesday into Wednesday 
night resulting in chance pops for scattered showers and 
thunderstorms. As this trough digs into the Great Lakes, a brief 
period of northwest flow aloft will surpress the upper level ridge
over the Gulf of Mexico. At the same time, a southern stream 
upper level low will be moving from the desert southwest into the 
southern Plains, so heights will quickly rebound Thursday and 
Friday as WAA strengthens ahead of the upper low. The moisture 
return ahead of the low late in the week will bring an 
increasingly humid airmass into east TN, southwest VA, and 
southwest NC with 1.30 to 1.60 PWAT values Thursday and Friday 
increasing to around 2.00 inches this weekend. These values will 
be above maximum climatology. Additionally, soundings suggest a 
warming cloud layer late week through the weekend with high 
freezing levels.

Any showers and thunderstorms late week through the weekend will 
produce heavy downpours, but the main question will be coverage on 
Saturday and Sunday when the best potential of heavy rain looks to 
occur. All guidance suggests that the upper low will stay well to 
the west Thursday and Friday, but weak disturbances ejecting out of 
the system through the southern stream flow combined with the WAA 
pattern will keep scattered showers/storms in the forecast, 
especially during afternoon and evening. Bigger differences arise 
this weekend into early next week. The latest GFS continues to 
gradually move the upper low and resultant surface cyclone 
northeastward toward Ohio, while the ECMWF has a much more closed, 
"cut off" system that meanders across the Tennnessee Valley then 
eventually moving off the Southeast coast by mid next week. Either 
solution brings the greatest chances of heavy rainfall Saturday 
through Monday, but the ECMWF would have periods of steadier 
rainfall while the GFS would be a little more scattered. Thinking 
the best approach to the forecast is to run chance pops Thursday and 
Friday gradually increasing to high end chance and likely Saturday 
and Sunday then pulling back to chance Monday and Tuesday. WPC 
continues to keep our area in a marginal risk for excessive rainfall 
beginning late in the week, so we will mention this possibility in 
the HWO. Preliminary 4 day rainfall totals from Friday through 
Monday range from 1 to 3 inches with the highest amounts across the 
plateau, southern valley, and southwest NC.

With the upper low passing nearby the region this weekend and a 
warm, moist environment firmly in place, some of the thunderstorms 
could be strong to severe. Both 0-6 and 0-1 Km shear will be 
elevated, and surface CAPE values will rise to 1000-1500 J/Kg each 
afternoon. At this time, location and timing of any stronger storms 
is low confidence, but trends will continue to be monitored 
throughout the week.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...Clouds finally starting to 
thin out more this afternoon as the drier air works its way into the 
area. Dewpoints will continue to fall overnight and will range from 
near 40 near our VA counties to near 50 across the extreme southern 
TN Valley. Clear skies and lowering dewpoints will allow overnight 
lows to dip down into the upper 40s to mid 50s for most areas. Light 
northerly winds continue into the night as the surface high pressure 
remains to our northeast.

The high drifts east tomorrow which returns us to a southerly flow 
by the afternoon hours. Rising heights and southerly flow allows 
temps to climb into the low to mid 80s for the high. Though 
climbing, dewpoints will still only be in the mid to upper 50s 
tomorrow afternoon so it will still feel quite nice outdoors with RH 
values ranging from the mid 30s to low 40s.


.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...The extended fcst
period kicks off on Tuesday evening amidst quasizonal H5 flow 
across the eastern CONUS atop the southern stream 590dm 
anticyclone centered over the GOM, all while a closed upper low 
deepens over the Desert Southwest and a shortwave works through 
the northern stream into the lower Great Lakes region. At the 
surface, high pressure will have shifted east across the 
Appalachians, eventually setting up offshore of the Mid-Atlantic 
states as a weak waa regime prevails over the Deep South. 
Into/through Wednesday the aforementioned northern stream 
shortwave looks to dive southeast over the OH Valley region 
favoring suppression of the upper ridge and intrusion of weak 
upper dynamic support via PVA, all warranting elevated regional 
pops. Moving into Thursday, the northern stream shortwave will 
eject eastward while out west the closed H5 cyclone advects east 
into the Plains with surface cyclogenesis to initiate. Closer to 
home, guidance does suggest some weak upper wave impulses moving 
through the mean southern stream flow across the TN Valley and 
Southern Appalachians, thus will keep pops elevated based on 
diurnal trends.

By Friday morning the pattern becomes increasingly active as the 
Plains H5 low and subsequent surface cyclone work to increase waa 
across the MidSouth and TN Valley.  Unfortunately it is also at this 
point that guidance tends to diverge in their solutions, thus 
introducing uncertainty. The GFS features an opening upper low as it 
moves northeast across the Ozarks into the mid/upper MS and lower OH 
valleys, approaching the lower Great Lakes.  The ECMWF on the other 
hand keeps the upper cyclone closed off longer as it advects further 
east, never really ejecting northward. Essentially, both solutions 
would suggest a wet pattern across the MidSouth region, however with 
uncertainty increasing eastward into Middle and east TN. Therefore 
it's still to early to iron out the details at the end of the work 
week into the weekend, but increasing precipitation chances are 
expected/fcst.  Likewise, given the possible proximity of the closed 
upper cyclone (especially in the ECMWF), deep shear will be 
elevated, which combined with modest instability thanks to sustained 
waa could present the threat for strong storms.  Given model fcst 
pwats well into the upper quartile (possibly approaching daily 
maxes), combined with the potential for a slowly progressing system, 
wouldn't be suprised to see modest QPF and perhaps an increased 
flooding threat Friday and through the weekend.  In fact, WPC 
already has the TN Valley and Southern Appalachian region 
highlighted in the Marginal risk for excessive rainfall on 
Wednesday/Thursday, would expect that to extend in time as days 
progress.  Otherwise, expect near normal temperatures through the 
period.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A front currently located across KY and srn WV will continue to
push south and move across our area today. The main impact of this
front will be to bring lower dewpoints and cooler temperatures
today and tonight. 

Despite broken cloud cover from earlier convection, some obs in 
SW VA and srn WV already have fog, so a mention of patchy fog will
be added this morning in SW VA where rain fell yesterday. Clouds 
and fog will clear through the morning, leaving sunny skies by the
afternoon. Highs in northern sections will be a few degrees below
normal - in the mid to upper 70s - while central and southern 
sections will be near normal - in the lower to mid 80s. Tonight, 
the center of the surface high will be over WV and extent SW 
across the Appalachians. Clear and calm conditions will allow 
temps to fall into the upper 40s in SW VA and NE TN, with 50s 
central and south.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...
A fairly complicated extended forecast with a ridge over the area
Tuesday being slowly broke down as a short-wave moves across the 
Ohio valley into the mid-Atlantic states for Wednesday. Initially 
dry airmass will begin to moisten up for Wednesday as boundary 
flow becomes more southwest. Convection is expected mainly over 
the higher elevations Wednesday afternoon/evening hours.

For Thursday, short-wave will have exited the mid-Atlantic/norheast 
United States. Associated frontal boundary will try to back-door 
into the southwest Virginia/northeast Tennessee. Model soundings 
show airmass continuing to moisten with instability increasing. 
Unclear on how much MLCAPE will be available but coverage of storms 
will increase during the heating of the day. Some of these 
thundestorms could be strong with strong gusty winds and locally 
heavy rainfall possible. 

For Friday into the weekend, GFS and ECMWF are in large disagreement 
in the evolution of the upper trough over the central Plains. GFS 
lifts the more open wave northeast toward the western Great Lakes. 
The ECMWF maintains a cut-off closed low into the mid-Mississippi 
valley and lower Ohio/western Tennessee valley. 

A significant difference for late week into the weekend. Either way, 
models do agree with keeping the airmass moist and unstable with 
decent coverage of showers and thunderstorms, especially during the 
afternoon and evening hours. Some of these storms will likely be 
strong to possibly severe given the increase flow and potential of 
more organized convection but confidence is low of the evolution of 
this system.

Evening update to reflect precipitation chances with current

evening closer to the upper low and cold front. Expect these 
storms to continue for the next few hours. Environment is 
continuing to become more and more unfavorable for thunderstorm 
development, but can't rule out the chance for an isolated storm 
to flare up and become strong. Trends further south in the Valley 
around Chattannooga are also trending downards with daytime 
heating deminishing and storms losing steam. Slight chance for 
some fog development overnight, but think that even if temps drop 
enough that the winds should remain elevated enough to keep back 
dense fog.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Monday)...The cu is starting to pop 
across the Southern Appalachian region in the mid afternoon heat. 
Scattered showers and thunderstorms will form across Southwest 
Virginia and Northeast Tennessee through early evening ahead of a 
cool front. Development should be more widely scattered to 
isolated across much of the remainder of the forecast area. There 
is enough cape and shear for the possibility of some of the storms
to associated with a strong wind gust and some small hail. The 
cool front will move south of the region later tonight, ushering 
in drier air for a most pleasant day Monday. Sunshine will 
dominate on Monday and dewpoint temperatures will be quite a few 
degrees lower than the past several days and while high 
temperatures will only be about five degrees cooler, the lower 
humidity will be welcome. 

.LONG TERM (Monday night through Sunday)...Not a whole lot of 
change during the long term period. The only real change is the 
GFS and ECMWF are in pretty good agreement overall with the 
weekend low pressure system considering how far out that is.

Monday night will be pleasant as we are in dry northwest flow behind 
the frontal passage. Clear skies and low temperatures in the upper 
40s to mid 50s can be expected. We lose our northwest flow on 
Tuesday as high pressure builds back in. Temperatures and dewpoints 
begin to climb with the southwesterly flow that develops. Highs 
climb back into the low to mid 80s. Southwesterly flow transitions 
to strengthening westerly flow Tuesday night into Wednesday as we 
are sandwiched in between the high to our south and a shortwave 
trough passing through the Ohio River Valley. This wave will bring 
increasing POP chances across our area through the day on Wednesday. 

This wave exits to our northeast Wednesday night into Thursday. We 
are in between systems on Thursday but the developing low to our 
west will allow for a diffluent and diverging pattern across our 
area. This combined with increasing moisture from out of the 
southwest should be enough to produce some scattered showers and 
storms through the day. Friday through Sunday the low slowly moves 
across our area as it is cut off from the upper level jet. During 
this time there will be on and off rounds of showers and storms. 
There will also be quite a bit of cloud cover around and temps will 
hold steady with highs in the low to mid 80s Thursday through 
Sunday. Overnight lows still look mild with temps in the mid to 
upper 60s.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Night time satellite fog product shows patchy fog development
early this morning across the streams of southwest Virginia and
northeast Tennessee. Will include patchy fog near area waterways
again this morning.

Main forecast concern is expected scattered storm development 
this afternoon through early evening. A frontal boundary will 
approach the Tennessee valley late this afternoon and evening. Air
mass ahead of the front will become moderately unstable with 
MLCAPEs of 1500-2000 J/Kg. DCAPEs of 700- 900 J/Kg, mid-level dry 
air with Theta-E difference of 25-30 will produce strong and gusty
winds with storms, possiblly damaging winds. Decent lapse rates
producing Hail CAPEs of 400-600 J/Kg and favorable WBZ of 
9500-10,000ft could produce 1/2 to 1 inch size hail with the 
stronger storms. Will highlight the marginal risk of severe storms
in the HWO.

The frontal boundary will move across the area this evening with
drier air advecting into the region. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...
Monday and Tuesday will feature surface high pressure drifting SE
from the Ohio Valley to the NC coastline, with a dry NW flow 
through the mid and upper levels. The main story for these days 
will be temperatures below normal on Monday and Monday night, 
especially over NE TN and SW VA, closer to the surface high 
center, where calm winds Monday night will allow for lows to fall 
into the 40s. Temps rebound closer to normal on Tuesday as the 
high over NC provides a southerly surface flow.

A transition to a wetter and unsettled period begins on Wednesday. 
Positive theta-e advection and disturbances in a westerly flow aloft 
will bring a chance of precip as early as Tuesday night, but mainly 
on Wednesday. Precip chances continue to rise into Thursday as a low 
pressure system develops in the lee of the Rockies. A deep SW flow 
of moisture ahead of this system will bring a good chance of showers 
and thunderstorms on Thursday, with PoPs rising to likely on Friday 
as the system slowly moves across the central Plains. After this 
time, the models differ in the track of the system, leading to lower 
confidence for the weekend. The ECMWF stalls the low to our west as 
a Rex block pattern develops, while the GFS slowly progresses the 
low across the OH Valley. In either case, it is a wet setup for us, 
so the forecast will follow the Superblend solution of likely PoPs 
continuing into Saturday.

development this afternoon through early evening at all TAF sites. A 
frontal boundary will approach the Tennessee valley late this 
afternoon and evening. Air mass ahead of the front will become 
moderately unstable with MLCAPEs of 1500-2000 J/Kg. DCAPEs of 700-
900 J/Kg, mid-level dry air with Theta-E difference of 25-30 will 
produce strong and gusty winds with storms, possiblly damaging winds.
Decent lapse rates and favorable WBZ of 9500-10,000ft could produce 
1/2 to 1 inch size hail with the stronger storms.

Light winds this morning will give way to southwest winds increasing 
to 9-12kts sustain with gusts up to 15-20kts possible this afternoon.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...A subtle wave is shifting east
across the region late this afternoon and the atmosphere has dried
out a bit behind yesterday's weak front. A capped atmosphere is
keeping a handle on convection across most of the area this
afternoon. However, there is a slight chance for a shower or
thunderstorm to develop in the slightly more unstable air across
Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee on the higher terrain
features early this evening. Some patchy fog could develop again
in the deep valleys of Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee
again toward daybreak tonight. Amplified upper trough over
Southern Ontario drops southeast across the Eastern Great Lakes
later tonight into Sunday evening driving another cold frontal
boundary through the forecast area by late Sunday evening. Enough
moisture will be available for lifting with respectable cape and
shear. Therefore, some strong storms could develop during the
afternoon ahead of this boundary. Stayed close to guidance mins
tonight which will be a few degrees warmer in the upper 50s and
60s. Max temperature Sunday will be close to if not a degree or
two cooler due to increased cloud cover and some convective
precipitation.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)... The long term 
starts out nice but becomes increasingly unsettled as we approach 
mid week and beyond.

Sunday night, we will be dealing with a few leftover showers and 
storms that developed earlier in the afternoon. The bulk of this 
activity should quickly fade as the front moves through the area 
Sunday night. Would expect any ongoing activity at the start of the 
period to be weakening at this point. Conditions quickly clear 
behind the front as drier and cooler air move in. However, upslope 
flow may allow for some light showers/drizzle to linger across our 
higher eastern terrain into the overnight hours. Temperatures 
overnight will range from the lower 50s to near 60, which is near 
normal for this time of year. 

Monday still looks like the best day of the long term. Monday 
features clear skies as we are in a dry, post-frontal, Canadian 
airmass. Though the airmass will have modified some by the time it 
arrives, highs will still only be in the lower 70s to near 80, which 
is 5 to 8 degrees below normal. If those temperatures aren't cool 
enough, head on up to Mount LeConte where the temperatures will be 
in the mid 50s for highs. Dewpoints still look to be in the lower to 
upper 40s so the afternoon will have a crisp, fall-like, feel to it. 
Monday night will be perfect as well with overnight lows in the 
upper 40s to mid 50s.

Tuesday still looks quite nice but high pressure begins to build 
back into the area with clouds increasing late in the day. Highs 
will be in the lower 80s with overnight lows in the lower to mid 
60s. Wednesday through Thursday features zonal flow setting up as we 
await the development of a low pressure system across the front 
range of the Rockies. A few weak disturbances move through the flow 
and chance POPs are in place each day for showers and storms. Friday 
into Saturday is when the low moves into our area, ramping up the 
POP chances across the region. During this time the low becomes 
cutoff and slowly meanders across the Ohio River Valley. It looks 
like we will be dealing with this low beyond the extended as there 
is nothing to push it along. This period will be unsettled with 
elevated chances for showers and storms each day. Highs will remain 
in the mid 80s due to the increased cloud cover with mild overnight 
lows in the mid to upper 60s.

.DISCUSSION...The deep valley fog across Southwest Virginia and
Northeast Tennessee is finally dissipating as insolation
strengthens. That insolation along with the heat wave of the past
week (dry surface) may allow for another degree or two of warming
this afternoon, so will tweak max temperature. There may be just 
enough instability and moisture for the development of a isolated 
thunderstorm or two on the higher terrain features; mainly across 
Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee. However, there may be 
a couple on the Cumberland Plateau as well so will keep this idea 
going in the current zone forecast.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Early this morning, satellite
night-time fog product shows fog (some likely dense) has 
developed across mainly the river and lakes of southwest Virginia 
and northeast Tennessee spreading into the northern Plateau. The 
fog will continue to develop along the waterways given the 
relatively warm lakes producing steam fog.

For today, a weak wave will move across the area with only lift 
coming from area terrain. Will call for isolated to widely scattered 
storms this afternoon/evening mainly near the higher elevations. 
Cooler and lower dewpoints will make for a more pleasant day.

For tonight, convection will likely dissipate soon after sunset, but 
another wave in the northwest flow aloft will approach the Tennessee 
Valley/southern Appalachians toward daybreak. Will continue trend of 
low chance of convection by 12Z Sunday for the northern sections.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...A pre-frontal trough is 
expected to move into the area from the north on Sunday. The NAM 
continues to be the most bullish model on precip chances, and the 
forecast will favor its solution. Although mid and upper level 
forcing is weak and moisture will be lacking, there appears to be 
adequate instability for scattered showers and thunderstorms in 
the afternoon, favoring areas north of I-40 and particularly SW VA
where LI values will be in the -4 to -7 range. The threat of 
severe looks low as shear is weak, but MLCAPE over 2000 J/kg could
result in a marginal hail threat. Precip chances drop off behind 
the trough passage around 00Z, but will keep a slight chance going
until 06Z Monday when the cold front passage occurs. 

High pressure with origins in central Canada will drop southward 
across the Great Lakes region on Monday, providing a dry and cool 
air mass for our area. Highs on Monday will be in the 70s to lower 
80s in most spots, with lows Monday night in the 50s. A Dry NW flow 
continues into Tuesday, providing sunny skies and highs in the lower 
to mid 80s. 

Moisture will start to increase on Wednesday as the high pressure 
system shifts to the Mid Atlantic region and a more S-SW low level 
flow develops. To the west, a low pressure system will be developing 
in the lee of the Rockies, and the models generally agree that it 
will transition to a closed low as it slowly moves east through 
Friday. Details are unclear at this point as there is model 
disagreement on the position of the low, but the general pattern of 
a SW flow ahead of this system will favor chance PoPs across the 
area for Wednesday through Friday.

.DISCUSSION...Lingering convection over the Southern Appalchians 
Region is quickly coming to an end this evening.  Dry conditions 
should prevail overnight.  Recent rains could potentially allow 
patchy fog to develop towards sunrise...but with drier air moving in 
and some residual mid to high clouds overhead...any fog formation 
should be minimal.  With the slightly cooler and drier air filtering 
in...overnight lows should fall to near seasonal levels with most 
valley locations pushing down into the mid 50s to mid 60s range. 
Some diurnal convection may develop over higher elevations on 
Saturday...but the valley and much of the higher terrain should stay 
dry.  With the slightly cooler and drier air mass in place...highs 
will be closer to normal with temperatures generally expected to 
reach in the upper 70s to mid 80s. Current forecast in good shape 
will update to bring any 30 POPs down to 20 and remove evening

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...Upper level wave building into 
the Central and Southern Appalachian region this afternoon trying to 
generate convection in a local atmosphere that has relatively warm 
air aloft; especially across much of the south half of the 
forecast area. Colder air aloft associated with the short wave and
some orographic lift is aiding the development of a few showers 
and thunderstorms across the Northern Cumberland Plateau counties 
as well as Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee. Would 
expect this trend to continue with the highest pops north with 
very little convective precipitation south of I-40. Development 
fades away through the evening as the upper wave continues east 
and surface heating abates. There may be a little patchy fog 
across northern sections late tonight with some cooling behind a 
weak surface boundary and this afternoon's spotty rainfall. 
Generally drier and more stable northerly flow builds in with 
short wave ridging across the region on Saturday. Did include a 
slight chance pop on the terrain features across Southwest 
Virginia and Northeast Tennessee for the afternoon hours for an 
isolated shower or thunderstorm with model depiction indicating 
just enough moisture and orographic lift for this limited 
possibility. Stayed close to guidance mins in the middle and upper
50s north to the upper 50s and lower 60s across the south and 
maxes mainly in the lower and middle 80s.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...We start the period 
under northwest flow, which will bring a welcome relief from the 
heat we've been experiencing over the past week. Expect dry 
conditions with Saturday night low temperatures in the upper 50s 
to low 60s, which is near normal for this time of year. 

By Sunday morning a cold front is approaching our area from the 
northwest. This front is associated with an upper level trough that 
is digging down into the Great Lakes from out of Canada. The front 
begins to lose steam as it drops down into our area. However, enough 
forcing should be present to at least produce some scattered showers 
and storms on Sunday as the front passes through. Sunday night will 
be quite pleasant with clearing conditions and lows down in the 
lower to upper 50s, which is a few degrees below normal.

Monday will be the best day of the period with the cooler and drier 
air in place behind the frontal passage. Expect clear skies and 
temperatures ranging from the lower 70s to low 80s. Afternoon RH 
values will be down in the mid 30s making it feel like a nice fall 
day. Cooler and pleasant conditions persist through Monday night as 
we remain in the northwest flow. Lows Monday night again in the 
lower to upper 50s. Tuesday high pressure builds back in as the 
trough lifts off to the northeast. Highs will be around 5 to 8 
degrees warmer compared to Monday.

Tuesday night through Wednesday night we are under zonal flow. 
During this time we will have chance POPs in place as a few weak 
disturbances zip through the flow as we are on the northern 
periphery of the high. Thursday into Friday a shortwave trough and 
developing low across the Great Plains begins to advance toward our 
area. This feature will produce the highest POPs of the period as it 
draws closer to the region with high end chance POPs in place. High 
temps will be back in the mid 80s with overnight lows back in the 
mid to upper 60s.

.AVIATION...The current forecast is still on track with a short
wave present over the Ohio Valley and forecast by models to build
into the Central Appalachians through tonight. Already some deeper
lift and moisture evident in satellite imagery with some radar
returns over the Lower Ohio Valley and some convection blossoming
farther up the Ohio Valley region across Southeast Ohio. The
higher resolution cams still suggest the stronger convection will
occur a little farther north of our forecast area across the
Central Appalachian region into the Mid Atlantic States. The best
chance of higher pops in our viewing area will be across Southwest
Virginia into part of Northeast Tennessee. However, even the gfs
and met pick up on that area of lift showing up with some higher
cloud tops in the ir satellite imagery over Western Kentucky at 
the current time and some of this action will drift onto the
Cumberland Plateau and parts of Central East Tennessee. Best capes
around 1500-2500 j/kg forecast with some respectable 0-6km bulk
shear on the order of 30-40kts for the afternoon into the early
evening. Temperature forecast appears to be on track so the only
adjustment will be to tweak the pop picture a bit to push the
convection more into the afternoon-evening timeframe according to
model suggestion and evidence from satellite and radar depiction
at the current hour.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Elevated SHRA/TSRA overnight have developed along a weak surface 
trough located across the forecast area. Further it seems that 
this weak convection has also been aided by modest upper lvl 
forcing from a departing h50 jet streak and weak PV anomaly in 
southwest flow aloft. Overall instability has been limited but 
LAPS analysis still suggests MU CAPE values are in the 500-1000 
j/kg range. However, with limited support, expect remaining 
coverage of SHRA/TSRA to continue to diminish overnight. 

By 12Z Friday, a sharply defined shortwave trough will be moving 
through the Ohio and Tennessee valley. A 50-60 knot h50 jet core 
will be in the process of rounding the base of this shortwave 
axis. At the surface, there isn't much reflection but a very weak
boundary will be located through the forecast area moving east. 
The aforementioned shortwave trough will provide large-scale 
forcing for ascent during the day on Friday. CAPE values are 
forecast to be around 1500-2500 j/kg by the afternoon across 
northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia. Values will be lower 
further south and west as the better mid lvl cooling will be 
displaced northward. Based on the above, there is a chance of 
isolated thunderstorms this afternoon with daytime heating but 
the lack of stronger low lvl forcing really hinders confidence. If
thunderstorms develop then an isolated strong storm is also 
possible across northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia.

The shortwave begins to depart the area late tonight with chances
of precipitation gradually coming to an end. Lows overnight 
should be mild with upper 50s to low 60s area wide.


.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...

The midlevel shortwave trough will be east of our area by Saturday, 
with a north to northwesterly low to midlevel flow providing a dry 
and stable air mass through the day. The models produce a little 
precip in our NE mtn zones on the back side of the shortwave, which 
should not amount to much if it happens, but the forecast will 
maintain a slight chance PoP in that area. 

On Sunday a trough will be dropping into the Great Lakes region, 
pushing a cold front into our area Sunday night. Models show a 
pre- frontal trough crossing our area Sunday afternoon, but they 
differ with how much convective activity will be associated with 
it. The NAM has the most and focuses mainly on our NE sections, 
and the forecast will follow this. However, PoPs will remain in 
the chance range as preceding moisture will be limited with a 
westerly low level flow, as well as weak forcing aloft. A 
northerly wind shift occurs Sunday evening, followed by the fropa 
Sunday night, which will bring much lower dewpoints. High pressure
dropping south out of Canada will build over the area Monday, and
highs will be mainly in the 70s to near 80 again with lows Monday
night in the 50s and some 40s in the northern sections. 

A trough over the east coast and western Atlantic and a ridge over 
the lower MS Valley region will put us in a dry and stable NW flow 
pattern through Tuesday with a warming trend. The ridge breaks down 
on Wednesday, allowing a shortwave trough to approach and bring a 
chance of showers and thunderstorms Wednesday and Thursday.

.AVIATION...A weakening frontal boundary will slowly push across the 
Southern Appalachian Region tonight.  Along and ahead of the 
boundary...a broken line of convection will move through.  If a 
shower or storm moves over a TAF site...be prepared for increased 
thunderstorms winds...lowering CIGs and VIS generating MVFR 
conditions and brief moderate to heavy rainfall.  A few lingering 
showers will continue over the region through the overnight hours 
though most areas should remain dry.  So for now...will only mention 
VCSH in TYS and TRI TAFs.  Additionally with the recent 
rainfall...localized fog development is possible and this may cause 
occasional MVFR conditions towards sunrise.  A trough axis shifts 
into the area on Friday...potentially generating additional 
scattered convection and will include VCSH in TRI late in the TAf 
period.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
Weak front moving eastward today will bring the chance
for some scattered afternoon showers and thunderstorms, primarily
across the northern two-thirds of the forecast area. MLCAPE of 
1000 to 1250 J/Kg and effective deep layer shear of 50kt will 
support thunderstorm maintenance and organization, but overall 
severe threat should remain marginal. Some of the stronger 
thunderstorms may produce some damaging winds with DCAPE around 
800 to 1000 J/Kg, and potentially some low-end severe hail.

The weak front becomes even more indistinguishable tonight with just
a weak wind shift, convergent boundary across the region. Upper 
level shortwave trough continues southeastward toward the region 
with a developing lee trough on the eastern side of the Southern 
Appalachians.

Trough axis will be over NE TN/SW VA Friday afternoon with steeper
mid-level lapse rates aiding some convective development. With the
cooler upper-levels, could have some small, sub-severe hail with
some thunderstorms that develop during the afternoon. Should have
cooler afternoon temperatures under the upper low in NE TN/SW VA
where cloud cover and shower activity will be more widespread.
With the loss of daytime heating, expect PoPs to trend down during
the evening. This shortwave will deepen the longwave trough across
the East Coast and place the region under NW upper flow through
the weekend.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...Model solutions are 
generally on the same page with a return to more typical 
temperatures and convective precipitation for the late Spring 
season. The period begins with decreasing pops Friday night behind a 
departing short wave and synoptic cool frontal boundary. Much of 
Saturday should be dry with a period of stabilization behind the 
late work week system. Sunday could become a little more active as 
an amplified upper level trough presses southeast out of the Great 
Lakes early in the day; swinging slowly east while deepening into 
the Northeastern U.S. Showers and thunderstorms would develop ahead 
of an associated cool front Sunday into Sunday night in this pattern 
with drier, more stable air building into the Southern Appalachian 
region on Monday and Tuesday, with possible extension into 
Wednesday. The surface ridge which takes up residence across the 
area during this period will be gradually shifting east, allowing 
more unstable, moist southerly flow to return ahead of another 
Midwest cold front. Therefore, maintained the idea of increasing 
pops for more convection, mainly Wednesday night into Thursday. In 
addition to the possibility of actually seeing a little more 
widespread rainfall, temperatures will return closer to normal with 
highs in the lower and middle 80s and lows back in the 50s and
60s.

.DISCUSSION...
Current surface analysis indicates a surface low across the Great
Lakes with a weak cold front trailing southward across the
Mississippi Valley. An associated shortwave is located across the
Upper Mississippi Valley and will move southeast toward our
forecast area through tomorrow.

As this front moves eastward today, it will continue to weaken but
provide some weak surface convergence. With MLCAPE near 1000 to
1250 J/Kg across the central and northern portions of the forecast
area-generally near or north of Interstate 40-and effective shear
near 50 kt, the atmosphere will be favorable for storm
organization and maintenance. The primary marginal risk of severe
weather will be for damaging winds with DCAPE of 800 to 1000 J/Kg
across the northern sections. The stronger shear across these 
areas could support some storm rotation, and any localized 
rotating updrafts could increase the risk of isolated severe 
hail. It is important to note that low-level shear is very weak 
which will limit any tornadic potential. This idea is shown in 
recent CAMs showing convection developing across the Cumberland 
Plateau this evening and tracking ENE across the Tennessee Valley.

As the upper trough tracks toward the region tonight,
chance/slight chance rain showers or isolated thunderstorms will 
continue, but the severe threat should quickly diminish after
about 02z tonight as instability decreases.

Quiet this morning, but should have chances of storms this
afternoon and into this evening at each site--some storms should
be pretty strong. Going with VCTS at each site, but longest at 
KTRI as instability lasts longer there overnight.  Storms should 
be moving quickly today as mid-level winds accelerate ahead of the
trough. Keeping ceilings and visibilities VFR during period. Winds
will be gusty through at least mid-afternoon, then start to relax
as pressure gradient loosens due to lee troughing in the
Carolinas. After this period, airmass should become more unstable
again at KTRI as upper trough and lift cool the mid levels, but 
that effect is just getting started in the KTRI area at the end of
this period.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Pattern change with upper ridge finally getting squashed to the 
south and then west as we get into the influence of an upper 
trough over eastern North America. 

At the beginning of this period we will still be in the established 
warm southwest low level flow.  There is a cold front stretching 
from the upper Midwest southward into Texas and an upper shortwave 
associated with the front.  

This afternoon the airmass should be getting pretty unstable with 
MLCAPE values over 1000 J/kg, along with some moderate shear. Strong 
storms are possible over the area this afternoon and into the early 
evening, even with a few severe storms possible.  Chances for the 
strongest storms are slightly better on the plateau with lessening 
chances farther east.  Storms will be moving quickly to the east-
northeast, probably around 40 mph this afternoon and evening.  The 
main threat will be damaging thunderstorm winds, to around 60 mph.
The storms should slowly weaken this evening as nighttime cooling
takes effect, but a low level jet should keep moisture supplied to
the storms, that should sustain them a little deeper into the
night. For temps, went on the warm side of guidance for Max Temps
today, based on temps from the last couple of days, but went close
to guidance mins.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)... By 12Z Friday, a 
shortwave trough extending from a Hudson Bay low will be in the 
process of moving through the Ohio valley. Further west, troughing
will be situated across much of the western US, with weak ridging
across the southern plains. At the surface, a weak area of low 
pressure is forecast to be located in southern Ohio with a frontal
boundary draped across the Tennessee valley. This cold front will
be in a weakening state as it moves through the forecast area on 
Friday. The synoptic scale lift and modest moisture will keep 
slight chance to chance PoPs over much of the forecast area with 
slightly lower PoPs over southern portions. While enough 
instability will exist across the entire forecast area for 
thunderstorms, higher lapse rates and better instability is 
forecast across northeast portions of the forecast area where mid 
level temperatures will be slightly cooler. A fairly decent upper 
level jet streak associated with the aforementioned shortwave will
contribute to increased 0-6km shear. The above parameters hint at
the potential for a strong storm or two. Based on forecast 
soundings, lower freezing levels across SW VA and NE TN and 
sizable CAPE profiles could allow for some hail in any of the 
stronger storms. Overall severe chances are low but will go ahead 
and include the chance of a strong storm or two for SW VA, and NE 
TN into the HWO. 

Friday night, the shortwave exists the area with mid level height 
rises and increasing surface pressure.  The result will be rain 
coming to an end, and skies beginning to clear with drier air 
advecting in. The weekend features a deepening Hudson Bay low while 
upper level heights increase across the southern and central plains. 
This synoptic configuration sets up northwest flow aloft with 
temperatures near or just slightly above average. A few disturbances 
will likely propagate through the northwest flow but timing of said 
features are difficult to pinpoint this far out. The highest 
confidence will be on Sunday as a PV anomaly/shortwave moves through 
the Ohio/Tennesse valley. Increased precipitation can be expected on 
sunday with slight chances to chances of thunderstorms. Models begin 
to diverge after Sunday in how amplified the upper level pattern 
becomes but surface high pressure moving south out of the Great 
Lakes will bring dry weather through Tuesday. Increased chances of 
precipitation will move into the forecast near the end of the 
extended due to mid level waves moving through the area.

Pattern is changing, and with it, better chances for storms in 
this forecast. Looks like pretty good chances of storms west of 
the TAF sites on the plateau this afternoon. In the valley and at
the TAF sites, there could be some storms developing as well, and
the storms on the plateau should move out over the valley in the 
evening hours. So, in the late afternoon today and into the 
evening have VCTS listed for each site. Winds look to be gusty out
of the southwest during the day today, but should lighten this 
evening as the surface decouples and as a lee trough continues to 
develop east of the Appalachians that will loosen the pressure 
gradient.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Deep southwesterly flow continues across the Ohio and Tennessee 
Valleys. Several weak impulses just ahead of the main area of 
convection in northern KY will move east southeast across extreme 
northeast TN and SW VA late this afternoon and early evening or 
around sunset. The main line in eastern KY was moving east toward 
southern West Virginia with a few reports of hail and higher winds. 
A few showers had already developed before 18Z and some storms
about to move over Wise County Virginia. These showers and storms
could be locally strong across SW VA with locally damaging 
winds...small hail and heavy rainfall late this afternoon to early
evening. However overall the hot and humid conditions will 
continue through the afternoon. Temperatures at mid afternoon were
in the lower 90s most lower elevations central and southern 
valley but in the 80s across extreme northeast Tennessee and 
southwest Virginia where there is more cloud cover. 

The storms should die down early tonight with skies partly cloudy 
with mostly high clouds overnight and warm overnight lows in the mid 
60s to lower 70s. Thursday the cold front over the Mississippi and 
lower Ohio Valleys will make its push east into middle Tennessee and 
central Kentucky by late in the day. Scattered showers and storms 
are expected to develop from NW to SE in the afternoon across middle 
Tennessee and slowly spread east into the northern part of the 
forecast area by late in the day. A few strong storms with damaging 
wind and large hail are possible mainly northern plateau and 
southwest Virginia. Thursday with the convection not moving in until 
around mid afternoon temperatures will still be several degrees 
above normal. Highs in the mid 80s to lower 90s.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
Models are in decent agreement overall, and show a cold front 
swinging through during the Thursday night/early Friday time frame
and a mid/upper level short wave trough moving across Friday. 
Moisture still looks somewhat limited, and convective energy looks
best north where there will be more cooling aloft. Will carry 
chance PoPs for some showers and thunderstorms north and no more 
than slight chance south. Slightly drier air will move in later 
Friday night into Saturday, but then another cold front is 
forecast to approach and push through later Saturday night and 
Sunday with another chance for convection. Drier and cooler air 
will move in again for Monday as the area will be dominated by 
northwest flow aloft and an area of surface high pressure builds 
in, but temperatures will just drop to near or slightly above 
normal. Tuesday should be dry as well, then moisture is forecast 
to increase enough by Wednesday to include some showers and 
thunderstorms once again.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The upper pattern this morning continues to feature a dominant ridge 
across the Deep South, while a longwave trough prevails out west 
with an embedded closed H5 cyclone slowly sliding east across the 
northern Plains.  This pattern continues to promote deep swly flow 
across the MS/OH and TN Valley region, with a series of weak 
impulses embedded in the mean H5 flow to advect northward across the 
MidSouth into the OH Valley today.  At the surface, ridging (albeit 
weaker than day's past) remains across the Southern Appalachian 
region, with weak wave activity expected to traverse northeast 
beneath the aforementioned H5 vort impulses today.  With that, 
guidance continues to suggest these impulses moving in close 
proximity to northeast TN and southwest VA this afternoon, which 
combined with ample instabilty, would suggest increased chances for 
showers/thunderstorms.  Thus, while the remainder of the fcst area 
remains dry today, did add in slight/chance pops across portions of 
extreme northeast TN and southwest VA where recent CAM blends favor 
the most fcst coverage. Given weak flow aloft, and thus weak shear 
through the profile, would expect any convection to remain 
disorganized. That said, profiles do feature steep enough lapse 
rates and sufficient dcape to produce some small hail and perhaps a 
few gusty downbursts. 

Otherwise, temperatures will remain nearly 2 categories above normal 
levels, the warmest of which being furthest south where skies are 
expected to be less cloudy.  Winds today will increase with mixing, 
which could favor a few low end wly gusts. Any pops will taper into 
the evening/overnight with loss of heating and northeastward 
advection of the weak upper impulses, therefore the fcst will dry 
out across the board after midnight.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...
By 12Z Thursday, a positively tilted shortwave trough will be 
located over the midwest while a PV anomaly rounds the base of the 
trough across the four corners region.  This PV anomaly should 
become absorbed into the midwest shortwave as the shortwave drops 
into the Ohio valley Thursday night into Friday. Closer to the MRX 
area, a few weak disturbances moving through southwest flow aloft 
could produce isolated showers during the day Thursday. At the 
surface, the induced surface low located over Illinois will 
gradually weaken as it traverses the Ohio valley while a trailing 
cold front slowly moves through the Midsouth and Tennessee valley. A 
secondary low could develop across the Midsouth under increasing 
height falls aloft and move northeast into Ohio by 21Z Thursday. The 
front, barely noticeable in surface fields, is forecast to move 
through the forecast area Thursday night into Friday morning. At 
least weak surface convergence and low level moisture should be 
enough to keep slight chances of showers and thunderstorms over 
portions of the forecast area through Thursday night.  

The shortwave trough/PV anomaly moving through the Ohio valley will 
begin to approach the area on Friday.  Guidance also hints at a 
strengthening 80-90 knot upper lvl jet streak across the Tennessee 
valley and southern Appalachians with northern portions of the 
forecast area in the left front region of this jet.  This will 
increase synoptic scale lift and combined with some low to mid lvl 
moisture will tend to increase PoPs during the day Friday.  Overall 
instability is weak but should be sufficient for scattered 
thunderstorms.  

The upper level shortwave will depart the area Friday night into 
Saturday leaving quasizonal flow in its wake.  A deepening low 
across SE Canada will promote a northwest flow regime aloft for the 
latter part of the weekend bringing slightly cooler conditions (near 
normal for this time of year) to the area.  Daytime highs Saturday 
and Sunday should reach the mid to upper 80s.  Models do show a 
couple of PV anomalies moving through the flow, but it is difficult 
to tell if these are convective feedback issues or actual 
disturbances aloft. At least slight chance to chance PoPs will be 
left in the forecast for Sunday to account for these latest model 
trends. Models are in pretty good agreement toward the latter 
portions of the extended with the main differences being related to 
how amplified the upper lvls become. The GFS is more amplified than 
the ECMWF however both would keep the area under a northwest flow 
regime and keep temperatures near average for this time of year. 
High pressure at the surface should keep conditions dry through 
Tuesday night.

VFR through the vast majority of the period at all sites as high
pressure prevails, with the only possible exception being at TRI 
this morning for MVFR fog. Confidence is low, thus just tempo'd 
for now. Otherwise, mostly high clouds on Wendesday with some mid
afternoon cu. Winds will remain in the 5-10kts range overnight at
CHA/TYS (light/calm at TRI), before ramping up into the 10-15kts 
range (gusting to around 20kts) out of the w/sw with increased
afternoon mixing. Winds will slowly weaken into the end of the

northern Plateau, northern Valley, northeast TN, and southwest VA.
A weak shortwave and some elevated CAPE has led to a few isolated
showers and rumbles of thunder. This activity will continue to

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...

The synoptic forecast begins with the ridge over the southeast 
strengthening today with deep troughing across the Rocky mountains 
that will begin to flatten the ridge out by tomorrow. Temperatures 
today will be above the seasonal average with some areas near record 
highs despite the increasing cloud cover. The low level 850mb flow 
of about 20 kts combined with a well mixed boundary layer today will 
produce some gusting winds with the southwesterly flow.

Both the GFS and ECMWF hint at a slight chance for some 
afternoon/evening showers and storms for the southwestern area of 
the CWA along the plateau due to a subtle shortwave moving through 
the mid levels. NAM soundings show nearly super-adiabatic low level 
lapse rates for this afternoon with an isothermal layer around 700mb 
and very dry air aloft. Storm formation may be difficult because of 
the ridging and any cells that do initiate probably won't last for 
too long. Clearing skies and calm overnight winds will allow for 
potential localized fog formation along the major rivers and low 
valleys for the early morning tomorrow.

Wednesday afternoon will present another chance for showers and 
thunderstorms for the more northern area of the CWA. A mid level 
shortwave moving along the ridge axis looks to drop far enough to 
the south to provide some additional lifting along with diurnal 
heating. Went with slight to chance PoP's for southwestern Virginia 
and northeastern Tennesee as soundings show the isothermal layer 
weakening significantly by the end of the period as the ridge begins 
to break down. With heights similar to Tuesday, expect temperatures 
for Wednesday to remain well above normal.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...

The good news in the extended is that the persistent upper ridge 
will begin to break down late week. Approaching shortwaves will 
result in height falls across the region on Thursday suppressing the 
ridge to our south. The surface cold front will weaken as it moves 
south, but weak convergence will allow a few showers or 
thunderstorms to develop with chance PoPs late Thursday. Front moves 
south of the area by Friday with upper flow becoming quasizonal.

Numerical model guidance is consistent with several shortwaves will 
dive southeast from the Upper Midwest through the weekend amplifying 
the upper trough across the Atlantic Coast. This will place the 
region under NW flow aloft with cooler temperatures expected late 
week through the weekend - closer to normal for this time of year. 
With strongest forcing across NE TN/SW VA have chance PoPs most days 
in these locations.

Next week, guidance indicates upper level NW flow remaining across 
the region with several weak disturbances potentially impacting our 
weather. However, low-level ridging increasing across the region and 
to our south may help to suppress convection and keep us mostly dry.

While we will see a reprieve from the near record heat, rain 
chances remain low across the region through the extended.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Upper heights continue to rise this morning as an upper ridge 
amplifies across the southeast CONUS, while surface high pressure 
prevails beneath.  With that, deep swly/wly flow will dominate today 
amidst partly cloudy skies.  Highs today will once again be 2-3 
categories above normal levels, which will favor ample/deep mixing 
and perhaps some low end wind gusts in the 15-20mph range.  As for 
any precipitation, some guidance sources favor chances for 
showers/thunderstorms over the Plateau this afternoon with peak 
heating, while others keep things dry given strong 
subsidence/capping. With this uncertainty in mind, did include pops 
for these areas, but kept them at slight chance levels. Otherwise, 
should be fairly nice/hot day.  Overnight, skies should clear out 
allowing for modest radiational cooling, which may lead to some 
river/mtn valley fog.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...
The persistent upper level ridging that has dominated most of the 
past week will finally begin to break down later this week allowing 
for northwest flow aloft by the weekend.  The result will bring a 
cooler weather pattern with increasing chances of precipitation.  By 
mid week, the synoptic configuration will consist of deep layer 
ridging across most of the southeast with troughing across the west. 
The surface features high pressure to the south and east with low 
pressure moving across the central plains and midwest. Subsidence 
from ridging aloft should keep most of the area dry on Wednesday and 
Wednesday night with the exception of northern areas where 
thunderstorm activity could occur on the periphery of the ridge. 
Another warm day is expected with highs in the upper 80s to low 90s. 
 The ridge begins to break down and shift east Thursday as the upper 
low across the Rockies begins to become absorbed into the Hudson Bay 
vortex. An area of low pressure at the surface will move into the 
Great Lakes with a trailing cold front tracking through the Midsouth 
and Arklatex.  The frontal boundary should weaken as it approaches 
the area late Thursday night into Friday morning, as is typical for 
this time of year.  However, some low level convergence along with 
deep layer moisture will be sufficient to carry slight chance PoPs 
through this time frame.  

This weekend, the upper level pattern features quasi-zonal flow 
aloft with a shortwave trough moving out of the Ohio valley. The 
ECMWF is a bit stronger with this shortwave and as a result 
generates more lift than the weaker GFS.  Both agree on stronger jet 
dynamics aloft which should promote increased lift for slight chance 
to chance PoPs across northeast Tennessee, and southwest Virginia. 
The Hudson Bay vortex strengthens and a result should encourage 
northwest flow aloft across the area through the end of the weekend 
and into early next week.  Several perturbations could track through 
this northwest flow aloft and would bring increasing chances of 
showers and thunderstorms.  Confidence and timing of these upper 
level features remain limited and as a result the forecast reflects 
the lower confidence. Temperatures during this time should be 
slightly cooler with highs in the mid to upper 80s and overnight 
lows in the low to mid 60s.

.Short Term (This Evening through Tuesday)...Widely scattered 
showers and thunderstorms have developed this afternoon across 
southwest Virginia and northeast Tennessee. An old outflow boundary 
from yesterday evenings convection is located across southeast 
Kentucky into northeast Tennessee. Satellite does continued towering 
cumulus and CB development over this area. Will maintain chance of 
showers and thunderstorms over southwest Virginia, northeast 
Tennessee, and northern Plateau into the early evening hours.

Forecast soundings show MLCAPEs of 1000-1500 J/KG with decent 
DCAPEs to produce strong downburst winds. The mid-level lapse 
rates are better today but freezing levels are high (near 11kft). 
Small hail is possible with the stronger storms.

Otherwise, persistent upper ridge over the southeast United States 
will remain the dominant weather feature through Tuesday producing 
hot and muggy conditions during the day. The upper ridge will 
continue to suppress convective development. Can not rule out an 
isolated storm, but confidence is too low to include.

Given persistence and continued raditional/steam fog development 
will include patchy fog for early Tuesday morning, mainly near area 
lakes and streams. 

Hot conditions again Tuesday with heat indices in the lower and 
middle 90s most valley locations.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...
Long term outlook features a pattern change late in the week from 
the persistent upper ridge to a more west to northwest upper flow. 
The primary synoptic feature early on in the long term outlook will 
be the upper level ridge and mid level anticyclone centered over 
Florida. A closed low will be over the northern Rockies tracking 
towards the east with an associated long wave trough extending off 
the Baja coast. A stationary boundary sits just to our north over 
the Ohio valley with a cold front extending into Texas with multiple 
mid level shortwaves that will move along the stationary boundary in 
an ongoing attempt to break down the ridge. The blocking high still 
looks to hold strong through Thursday with a few diurnally driven 
afternoon storms possible for southwestern Virginia and far 
northeast Tennessee where the subsidence is not as strong.

Through Thursday and Friday, the previously mentioned low pressure 
system will move lee of the Rockies and begin to flatten out the 
ridge while taking on a more positive tilt. The cold front 
originating from the low will make it's way across the CWA by 
Thursday night with relatively weak upper dynamics. Model soundings 
show limited instability with CAPEs of 250 to 500 J/kg so only 
scattered showers with a few embedded thunderstorms are expected. A 
more zonal west to northwest flow pattern will be in place behind 
the front as the trough will finally displace the blocking high with 
the remaining stationary boundary setting up to the south. A few 
minor impulses look to produce some showers and potential afternoon 
storms for next weekend with cooler air from the northwest dropping 
daily highs down to the low 80's.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The synoptic pattern this morning continues to be highlighted a 
broad H5 anticyclone centered over the central Gulf Coast, while a 
closed cyclone and deep associated longwave trough prevails out 
west.  At the surface, high pressure dominates over the southeast 
CONUS, while a slow moving cold front slides southward across the 
I64 corridor region of KY/WV.  As for the fcst today, another summer-
like day amidst deep ridging with warm swly flow in the low/mid 
levels keeping profiles capped, for the most part.  That said, the 
aforementioned frontal axis will approach the region, likely 
stalling across southeast KY and southwest VA/WV, before moving back 
northward tonight.  Thus, any weak surface convergence along/north 
of I40 (in closest proximity to the surface boundary) will combine 
with weaker ridge induced subsidence to favor increased precipitation 
chances.  Likewise, TRI fcst soundings exhibit modest mucape upward 
of 2.0-2.5k j/kg (which would suggest deeper updrafts), inverted V 
profiles given vast drier air in the BL favoring dcape in excess of 
1k j/kg, all amidst weak deep layer shear.  Therefore, wouldn't be 
suprised to see a couple upright and slow moving strong/severe 
thunderstorms across extreme northeast TN and southwest VA capable 
of damaging downburst winds and large hail.  Otherwise, high 
temperatures will once again be 2-3 categories above normal levels, 
possibly approaching record levels across the southern valley.  As 
for tonight, think any remnant convection will slowly degrade with 
loss of heating leading into a dry yet partly cloudy night.  Lastly, 
wouldn't rule out some patchy dense fog overnight, especially 
in/around any locales that receive abundant rainfall today. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...
Changes coming during the long term. Tuesday through Thursday 
still feature the ridge as being the dominate factor of our 
weather. However, by Thursday afternoon the ridge has been 
displaced off the coast of Florida. This is due to a broad long 
wave trough moving across the Western US during the Tuesday 
through Thursday time frame. The long wave trough has an 
associated low and cold front that will advance toward our 
region. The low is quite strong over the Plains but weakens as it 
moves up toward the Great Lakes. However, the trailing front will 
drift into our area by Thursday evening providing focus for 
showers and Thunderstorms. The front is quite weak so only expect 
scattered showers and storms at best but for all areas.

By Friday, the high that was off the coast of Florida is all but 
gone as the broad long wave trough moves far enough east to finally 
break it down. By this time though the trough really isn't a trough, 
the flow is pretty much zonal. Zonal flow opens up the door for 
showers and storms from Friday through the weekend as several small 
disturbances zip through the flow and across our area. POPs won't be 
higher than chance though as there is no big forcing mechanism that 
moves through (strong front, etc...). 

High temperatures during this time will drop into the lower to 
upper 80s with lows in the lower to mid 60s.

feature impacting the terminals for much of the forecast period
keeping vfr conditions in place. However, later this evening into
the early morning hours, there could be a shower or a thunderstorm
around tri as the tail end of convection associated with an upper

.SHORT TERM...(This Evening through Memorial Day)...
Near record or possibly record highs this afternoon. CHA is pretty 
close to it's daily record high now.

A MCV is moving across the lower Ohio Valley. Some of that activity 
may move into southwest Virginia and far northeast Tennessee. 
Airmass is marginally unstable with MLCAPEs of 500-1000 J/Kg so not 
expecting any severe storms, but DCAPEs of 1100+ J/Kg could produce 
some strong gusty winds. Will include this potential in the HWO.

Otherwise, upper ridge over the area remains in control with 
subsidence and dry airmass across much of the Tennessee 
Valley/southern Appalachians. An convection will dissipate by 
midnight.

For tonight, another round of patchy fog for mainly area 
streams/lakes developing late tonight. Any precipitation over 
southwest Virginia/northeast Tennessee will increase the coverage 
there.

For Memorial Day, models suggest an outflow boundary may move into 
the northern half of Tennessee/southwest Virginia. Southwest flow 
will pull increasing moisture and instability with PWs up to 1.2-1.3 
inches. MLCAPES of 1000-1500 J/Kg. Will include a low chance of 
mainly afternoon showers and thunderstorms generally north of 
interstate 40. Otherwise, another hot day and a little more muggy.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
The long term forecast looks to still be under the influence of the 
persistent upper level ridging through most of the outlook. An 
initial synoptic set up of a surface high pressure anticyclone 
located just off the Gulf coast of Florida with deep troughing that 
exists over the American southwest and a developing low pressure 
center over the Four Corners. A weak boundary is located to the 
north of our CWA across the Ohio valley and Great Lakes region with 
a mid level shortwave that look to move along the ridge axis early 
next week. Paired with diurnal heating this mid level wave will 
provide the best possible chance at any precip on Tuesday 
afternoon but looks to be restricted to mostly southwestern Virginia.

With the continued influence of the ridge, the most prominent 
weather for most of the period continues to be the unseasonably warm 
temperatures. Subsidence aloft will restrict a fair amount of cloud 
formation allowing for lots of daytime surface heating. Paired with 
the consistent south to southwesterly WAA bringing in moist 
subtropical air, hot and humid conditions are expected for most of 
the week. With the continued surface heating, the PBL looks to be 
well mixed through the daytime periods with unstable atmospheric 
profiles held back by a capping inversion. Any storms that do manage 
to form will most likely be short lived with the potential of 
producing gusty outflow winds.

By Wednesday night, the previously mentioned cyclone over the Four 
Corners will have tracked eastward to the lee side of the Rockies 
around western Nebraska and will develop a cold front extending 
into the southern Great Plains. While the low pressure center looks 
to remain somewhat stationary and eventually drift to the north, the 
front itself will be propelled forward by the 300mb jet which will 
elongate the boundary. The trough will take on a positive tilt as it 
attempts to push the blocking high to the south thus weakening the 
front as it moves into eastern Tennessee by late Thursday night 
through Friday morning. With the overnight timing of the front and 
weaker troughing at time of FROPA, mostly showers are expected with 
a few embedded thunderstorms possible.

A more zonal pattern will be in place after the passage of the front 
with cooler and drier air expected as the boundary looks to possibly 
stall to our south. Decreased confidence after FROPA due to 
disagreements in the models. The zonal flow will allow the 
shortwaves to quickly move across the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys but 
timing will be difficult.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Overall, big picture doesn't 
change much but a few more things to talk about in the short term 
compared to the past few days. 

Strong ridge still located to our south and will once again allow 
for a hot day. Have CHA at 94 today which would tie a record that 
was set back in 1962. TYS and TRI both look to fall a few degrees 
short of their daily record. 

The difference with today is a shortwave trough moves through the 
Ohio River Valley during the late afternoon/evening. As this trough 
draws near the pressure gradient tightens due to the ridge holding 
strong to the south. This allows an 850 mb jet to develop this 
evening of roughly 35 to 40 kts. So expect breezy winds above 2000 
feet with gusts generally from 15 to 20 mph through the night. Areas 
below 2000 feet will be under the nocturnal inversion and won't be 
near as breezy. 

Showers and storms look to develop across western/central KY later 
this afternoon in response to the shortwave. The best lift remains 
north of our area but SWVA and extreme NETN could see some showers 
and storms late but not too confident as all of the CAMs show this 
activity diminishing as it begins to enter the aforementioned areas. 
Will carry slight chance POPs to account for this. Day 1 SPC outlook 
has slight chance risk just to our north but again where the better 
lift will be. 

Other than that, expect a repeat performance of the weather today. 
Overnight lows will be mild again, with lows in the lower to upper 
60s. 



.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...The extended range fcst period 
kicks off on Monday morning amidst a persistent pattern that 
features continued deep layer ridging, highlighted by a 591dm 
anticyclone centered over the Gulf Coast while surface high 
pressure prevails over the Southern Appalachians. Pattern 
evolution through midweek will be highlighted by said deep ridging
and a series of weak H5 impulses traversing west/east across the 
Great Lakes and northern OH Valley. With that, the best 
opportunity for any notable precipitation continues to center 
around the peak heating hours, and mainly across northeast TN and 
southwest VA given weaker subsidence as well as any weak upper 
support from the passing aforementioned northern H5 waves (and any
associated MCS activity). 

By Tuesday night the pattern begins to alter as the western CONUS H5 
cyclone ejects eastward into the central/northern Plains, 
effectively suppressing the ridge to the east.  This will result in 
height falls over the TN Valley and Southern Appalachian region, 
which could aid convective initiation on Wednesday into Thursday. 
Meanwhile a secondary southern H5 shortwave will eject over the 
southern Plains into Thursday, eventually phasing with the northern 
stream H5 low, and initiating surface cyclogenesis over the 
Arklatex.  This surface front/low complex will advect east through 
Thursday into Friday morning, favoring increased chances for showers 
and thunderstorms.  Behind the front into the weekend, cooler/drier 
surface high pressure looks to build in from the west beneath 
quasizonal H5 flow.

Overall the primary notable weather hazards this upcoming week 
continue to be well above normal temperatures and heat indices in 
the low/mid 90s.  Also, said abundant heating will translate to 
unstable profiles each afternoon, thus any thunderstorms that do 
materialize could produce gusty downburst winds.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

The near record breaking heat due to the upper level ridge continues 
to be the main story in the short-term forecast period. As of 
early this afternoon, most locations are in the mid 80s to lower 
90s. Heat indices are in the mid to upper 90s across portions of 
the central and southern valley with dewpoints in the upper 60s to
low 70s. However, the overall atmosphere is relatively dry with 
subsidence thanks to the ridge. PW values are near to slightly 
below the mean for late May. Additionally, model soundings 
indicate a capping inversion in place. There have been a few weak 
returns on radar from time to time this afternoon mainly over the 
higher elevations of E TN and SW VA. Visible satellite imagery 
indicates a decent cu field across the forecast area but not much 
vertical development outside of the higher elevations. Any ongoing
activity should come to an end near sunset. Afternoon highs will 
top out near record highs in the upper 80s to low 90s for most 
locations.

Another mild night is forecast tonight with lows only dropping down 
into the mid 60s to low 70s. With the sparse coverage of 
precipitation this afternoon, do not expect any widespread fog 
formation. There could be some patchy fog near area lakes and 
rivers but do not have enough confidence in this to add it to the 
forecast.

The heat wave will continue into Sunday as the upper level ridge
holds strong. The ridge axis will retrograde to the west and the
winds will become more westerly throughout the atmosphere. This
wind direction will lead to slightly drier air across the region
with PW values falling down into the 25th percentile or so for
late May. Due to this, have not mentioned any precipitation
chances for Sunday. Highs on Sunday will once again be near record
levels in the upper 80s to low 90s.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

The long term synoptic outlook begins with continued strong ridging 
centered over the southeast CONUS with amplified troughing over the 
southwest coast and a developing low pressure center moving into the 
Pacific Northwest. A lingering stationary front will be located over 
the northern Ohio valley and will see a number of shortwaves move 
along the boundary that will work to flatten out the ridge. A few 
periods of afternoon convection are possible for southwestern 
Virginia and northeast Tennessee as the shortwaves track just to the 
north. A number of isolated cells could make it far enough south to 
provide some rainfall, but confidence isn't great.

The most substantial weather for early next week continues to be the 
high temperatures. The combination of steady southwesterly flow from 
the surface high and plentiful moisture advection along with little 
cloud cover from the subsidence of the ridge, will aid in keeping 
daily maximums several degrees higher than the seasonal averages. 
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday all look to peak in the mid 90's with 
heat indices hovering around the mid 90's as well.

As the previously mention low pressure center moves lee of the 
northern Rockies it will develop a cold front that will extend 
across most of the southern and central Great Plains. As the low 
tracks to the northeast the front looks to elongate along the ridge 
axis as it moves into the Appalachians with the trough pushing the 
blocking high further to the south. The front looks to reach eastern 
Tennessee by late Thursday to early Friday but confidence as to the 
coverage and timing is not high as the consistency between model 
runs and individual models is low.

A more zonal pattern is in store after FROPA with the trailing 
boundary setting up either just over us or to the south. Slightly 
cooler and drier air will be behind the front, although the 
temperatures may not drop by too much and could remain a few degrees 
above average into next weekend dependent on the placement of the 
stationary front.

.DISCUSSION...

The dominant upper level ridge continues to be the main talking
point for the near-term to short-term forecast period. Heights at
500mb will remain in the 590-593 dm range. The low level high has
shifted a bit further to the north and west leading to more
westerly low level winds today. Due to this, PW values are a bit
lower today around to slightly below the mean for late May. Models
still show a small chance for a few isolated showers/storms 
mainly over the higher elevations of E TN and SW VA where there 
will be additional orographic lift. Temperatures are already 
running a couple of degrees warmer than compared to yesterday and
increased highs slightly. Forecast highs will once again be near 
record values in the upper 80s to low 90s. Max heat indices will 
be a couple of degrees higher with mid to upper 90s across 
portions of the central and southern valley.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Patchy dense fog expected along 
area rivers again this morning. This should quickly burn off after 
sunrise. Similar conditions expected again today as the large scale 
pattern hasn't changed much. Only real difference is the high to our 
south has shifted slightly east. This will allow for a little more 
upvalley flow during the afternoon hours today compared to 
yesterday. Again have some slight chance/low end chance POPs in for 
SWVA and extreme NETN but low confidence in this forecast. Wanted to 
go dry as soundings again show an isothermal layer which looks to be 
too much to overcome but models still showing some precip across 
those areas this afternoon thus the low POPs. So overall, another 
hot one in store with temps in the upper 80s to low 90s with most 
areas dry. It looks like highs will stay a degree or two below 
records for today so don't expect any to be broken.

Clear conditions tonight with lows in the mid to upper 60s with some 
river fog again after midnight.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...The extended range forecast 
period initializes on Sunday morning amidst continued deep layer 
ridging consequent of a 593dm H5 anticyclone centered over the I10
corridor, while surface high pressure prevails atop the 
southeast, generally centered over the Southern Appalachians. 
Little change in the forecast from previous issuance through at 
least midweek as deep subsidence favors little (if any) 
precipitation, with the best chances being along the northern 
periphery of the ridge across southwest VA and northeast TN given 
weaker inhibition. With that, chances are slim with the forecast 
only featuring slight/chance pops, all aligned around a diurnal 
trend with perhaps some late evening MCS activity moving in out of
the OH Valley. By late Wednesday into Thursday, heights will 
begin to fall as a western trough moves east, all favoring 
slightly higher pops, especially on Thursday given an OH Valley 
shortwave passage, and Thursday night as the associated surface 
cold front nears. Latest model progs (GFS/ECMWF) suggest the fropa
to occur overnight into Friday morning with little fanfare. 
Behind that on Friday and Saturday, slightly cooler/drier high 
pressure will build in from the north amidst quasizonal flow 
aloft. All in all, the highlight of the forecast period continues 
to be heat. High temperatures are expected in the low/mid 90s with
heat indices in the mid/upper 90s, possibly approaching the 
century mark across the southern valley on Sunday/Monday/Tuesday 
(the warmest days).

.DISCUSSION...
Very few tweaks made to the forecast this evening. Added a few
areas of patchy fog in the low lying areas in Southeast Tennessee
for just a couple of hours right before sunset. Decent chance that
the fog doesn't end up forming, but temperatures were running a
degree or two cooler than previously expected, so it will be just
that little bit easier to see some patchy fog, but at this time
expect most places to have a clear night tonight. Overall forecast
is still on track.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...

The upper level ridge continues to dominate the weather pattern 
across the southern Appalachians. Temperatures early this afternoon 
are already just a couple of degrees away from record highs. Most 
locations are currently in the mid 80s to low 90s. PW values have 
increased just a bit from yesterday as the ridge slides slowly to 
the east. As this happens, winds throughout the atmosphere are more 
from the southwest Visible satellite imagery indicates a decent 
coverage of cu across southern portions of the forecast area. Radar 
imagery even indicates a few light showers associated with this cu. 
Model soundings indicate a cap around 700 mb and not seeing much 
vertical development in the cu field due to this. Therefore, have 
around 15-20 PoPs across southern portions of the forecast area. 
Further to the north, a shortwave trough will pass to the north and 
east around the periphery of the upper level ridge from the Great 
Lakes into the Mid-Atlantic, due to this, have continued with 15-20 
PoPs this afternoon and evening for most of SW VA. Any ongoing 
activity should dissipate around sunset. 

Another mild night is forecast tonight with lows only dropping down 
into the mid 60s to low 70s. Some model guidance suggests a bit of 
patchy fog overnight but with the limited coverage of precipitation 
and the lack of fog formation last night, did not introduce any fog 
to the forecast at this time. However, would not be surprised to see 
some patchy brief fog near sunrise. The low-level ridge will build a 
bit further to the west on Saturday with low level winds taking on 
more of westerly component. Due to this, PW values will be a bit 
lower than today but still near the average for late-May. However, 
with the lack of any synoptic lift, have only include 15-20 % chance 
for a few isolated showers/storms mainly over the mountains of E TN 
and SW VA. Upper level heights will be similar to today with the 
ridge holding strong and expect highs once again in the upper 80s to 
low 90s near record levels. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...

The majority of the long term forecast will be under the influence 
of the persistent high pressure ridge over the southeastern US. 
Troughing over the American southwest looks to form a series of weak 
mid level waves just lee of the Rocky mountains that will move along 
the perimeter of the ridge. A much stronger front looks to develop 
by Wednesday next week as the parent low moves across the mountains 
as the trough begins to progress eastward. A stationary boundary 
looks to set up to our north over the weekend around the central 
Ohio valley, with several shortwaves that will move along the 
boundary in an attempt to break down the ridge. Strong southwesterly 
flow over much of the Great Plains out ahead of the trough and along 
the ridge will aid in increasing temperatures through the advection 
of subtropical moisture.

With the combination of the southwesterly winds, moderate dew 
points, and suppressed cloud formation from the ridge which will 
lead to plentiful daytime surface heating, high temperatures will look 
to be the prominent weather concern. Daytime highs could meet or 
exceed established records over the weekend and into early next 
week. A few slight to chance opportunities for some afternoon 
showers and thunderstorms in southwestern Virginia and far 
northeastern Tennessee as the mid level shortwaves flatten the ridge 
out enough to reach far enough to the south to create some 
additional lift. Greatest chance for this occurring during the most 
opportune time of the afternoon looks to be Monday, but confidence 
isn't too great, as models just don't have good consensus. A few 
areas might see formation of patchy early morning fog over the 
weekend due to the moisture advection from the southwest, clear 
overnight skies, and light winds. Greater chance of fog formation 
exists if any areas see some additional rainfall.

The ridge looks to finally give way on Thursday of next week as the 
previously mentioned cold front develops over the Great Plains and 
moves into the area. Thursday looks to be the day with the highest 
probability for areawide thunderstorms across the CWA as the front 
tracks eastward. However confidence is somewhat low as to the 
timing of the front's arrival at the moment. GFS shows sometime 
between late Wednesday night to Thursday morning, while the ECMWF 
shows a better potential for thunderstorms as the front arrives late 
Thursday afternoon. A much more zonal pattern looks to follow after 
FROPA near the end of next week with the boundary stalling either 
over southern Appalachia or just to our south, with cooler 
temperatures finally arriving as we sit either in the cool sector or 
under the boundary.

.DISCUSSION...

Not much change to the ongoing forecast this morning. The upper
level ridge continues to hold strong across the region. With the
ridge in place, temperatures this afternoon will climb into the 
upper 80s to low 90s with highs near record values. PW values are 
near to slightly above normal for late May but there isn't much in
the way of any lifting mechanisms. Additionally, most model 
soundings indicate a weak cap will be in place for most of the 
day. Best chances for precipitation, although small, will be 
across SW VA and NE TN as a shortwave trough rides around the 
periphery of the ridge from the Great Lakes into the Mid-Atlantic 
by this afternoon. Additionally, a few higher resolution models
indicate isolated showers/storms across southern portions of the 
forecast area later this afternoon but for now have not mentioned 
anything in the forecast.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Strong ridge centered 
directly to our south today will allow for another hot day. 
Temperatures will once again be in the upper 80s to low 90s. Based 
on soundings, expect more low level cumulus clouds today compared to 
yesterday and less high clouds. 

The biggest question of the day is will any precip move across SWVA 
and extreme NETN. Models show a very weak impulse moving across the 
northern periphery of the high. We will be on the far southern extent 
of this impulse and may be too far removed to see any activity. 
Latest HRRR and RAP runs show some showers developing across the 
aforementioned areas later this morning and then dissipating, then 
more development later this afternoon but mainly north of our CWA. 
If we do see development don't expect too much out of it as there is 
a deep isothermal layer in the soundings from roughly 800mb to 
600mb. This will likely help to suppress any strong convection. To 
cover this, have slight chance and chance POPs in the forecast.

Dry conditions overnight with lows in the mid to upper 60s. Some 
patchy fog is possible if the previously mentioned northern areas do 
see any precip today.


.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...The extended period kicks off 
on Saturday morning amidst deep ridging across the southeast 
CONUS, highlighted by a nearly 584dm H5 anticyclone atop a 1020 mb
surface ridge. Meanwhile, southern stream troughing over the 
southwest CONUS will promote deep swly flow into the MS/OH and TN 
Valleys, all while a northern stream wave moves through the Great 
Lakes. All in all, much of the period (through Tuesday) looks 
rather stagnant as this southeast ridge persists, albeit weakening
slowly with time. Thus, it looks as if the highlight of the 
period will be well above normal high temperatures (low/mid 90s, 
with heat indices in the upper 90s), especially Saturday-Tuesday 
given proximity/strength of the ridge. During this time, records 
could be in jeopardy at all three climo sites. As for 
precipitation, expecting slight/chance levels at best given the 
aforementioned subsidence ridge. The best chances would be aligned
with peak heating, and/or perhaps with any approaching MCS 
activity riding atop the ridge across the OH Valley moving into 
portions of extreme northeast TN and southwest VA. 

Moving on, Wednesday looks to be the day when the upper ridge 
finally becomes suppressed thanks to falling heights aloft as a 
trough approaches from the west.  With that, a surface cold front 
will make a run into the region Wednesday night into Thursday 
bringing the best chances for widespread precipitation over the next 
week.  Beyond that, cooler high pressure advects into the region 
amidst zonal flow aloft.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
Ridge of high pressure still in control today with considerable
high cloudiness over the forecast area blowing off storms that
were over the Ohio Valley that moved east toward the Mid-Atlantic
states just north of the ridge. Temperatures this afternoon are
in the mid to upper 80s a few degrees cooler than yesterday. A few
locations may still hit 90 but the clouds have held temperatures
down. Tonight skies will stay partly cloudy to mostly clear 
overnight with mild overnight lows in the mid 60s to around 70 
near Chattanooga. Friday a weakening shortwave moving around the
ridge could affect the northeast part of the area by afternoon but
it will depend on the strength of the ridge. Did not change 
current forecast with 20 percent chance of showers and storms. 
Central and southern valley locations will stay mostly sunny
Friday with highs back around 90 degrees.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
A strong ridge of high pressure will continue to be the main 
feature driving area weather this extended period. The main impact
of the ridge will be to continue the very warm to hot conditions 
across the Southern Appalachian Region over the next 7 day. 
Temperatures will average around 10 degrees above normal.

Additionally...the ridge will tend to suppress or inhibit 
convection.  However...there will be a series of shorts waves and 
frontal boundaries riding long the upper flow...dampening the ridge. 
While there is some minor differences in model timing and strength 
...the overall trend has been consistent.  As the extended 
begins...a minor impulse will be pulling out of the area.  A stray 
shower/thunderstorm could linger over the far northeastern area 
Friday evening before moving off for a dry and quiet night.  A 
frontal boundary over the Ohio Valley this weekend will drop south 
and becomes oriented with the upper flow around the ridge. This will 
flatten the ridge and allow lift added by an orographic component to 
provide the potential for isolated convection over northern areas 
and the East TN Mountains.  Another short wave will drop through the 
upper flow late Monday and again the main area with the potential 
for a stray thunderstorm will be over far northern areas and the 
East TN Mountains.  Some diurnal convection will be possible on 
Tuesday along the higher terrain.  By the Wednesday/Thursday time 
frame...the model begin to shift the ridge east.  Flow aloft over 
the area will become southwesterly with the next system moving in 
for at least a slight chance of thunderstorms areawide.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...The mid/upper level ridge 
will continue to persist across the southeastern states for the 
short term period. The ridge will flatten a bit as some significant 
short wave energy moves by well to our north, and the axis of the 
ridge will shift just a bit west.  GFS has been persistent in 
showing some weak vort energy brushing northern areas today, which 
leads to some showers and thunderstorms over mainly northern and 
eastern portions of the area.  However, not much support for this 
elsewhere in the models, and model soundings still look to be on the 
dry side even with the GFS. For now will go with the drier models 
and have a precip free forecast for the short term period. 
Temperatures will be above normal both today and tonight.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...Long term period 
still features a strong area of high pressure that resides over the 
region with periods of flattening and restrengthening. Ridge finally 
pushes east a little by Wednesday as a shortwave trough moves up 
through the Missouri River Valley and into the Great Lakes.


To start the period the ridge is centered directly to our south. 
This puts our region under a west-to-northwest flow throughout the 
atmospheric profile. A weak impulse moves down through the flow from 
out of KY and into WVA/VA. SWVA and extreme NETN may be close enough 
to the impulse to see a few showers and storms develop. Though low 
level lapse rates are quite steep across this area at roughly 7 deg 
C/km and plenty of CAPE, there is a deep isothermal layer that 
stretches from 800mb up to 600mb. This isothermal layer may prohibit 
convection all together. 

The ridge flattens over the weekend as a frontal boundary moves down 
into the Ohio River Valley and becomes east-to-west oriented. Though 
the front remains well off to our north, the flattening of the ridge 
may help to spark an isolated shower or storm across our high 
terrain and up into SWVA. Sunday night/Monday morning another 
impulse rolls through the west-to-northwest flow and into our area. 
This will again allow for slight chance/chance POPs across the high 
terrain, NETN, and SWVA. Models were previously showing this impulse 
coming through on Monday which gave us our best shot of precip of 
the extended. However, now it looks like it exits by Monday morning 
so most areas stay dry now on Monday. The ridge restrengthens Monday 
afternoon through Tuesday.

Wednesday a shortwave trough and trailing front swing up into the 
Great Lakes Region. This weak trailing front approaches our area 
giving us another shot of slight chance POPs, though this time 
areawide.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Very warm temperatures today with mid afternoon temperatures in
the upper 80s. Some locations may reach 90 late this afternoon.
Dewpoints have risen to the lower to mid 60s, with apparent
temperatures approaching 90. Skies are mostly sunny to partly 
cloudy with no convection across the area. Upper level ridge has
stayed strong over the southeast states and eastern Tennessee
Valley today and is causing convection to the NW to weaken rapidly
as it approaches northern middle TN. For tonight and Thursday the
upper level ridge is expected to flatten with shortwave energy
moving into the Ohio Valley. Also southerly flow around surface
ridge centered over the Carolinas will cause more upslope flow on
the east side of the Appalachians. GFS is more aggressive with the
system to the north while the NAM wants to develops showers and
storms in SW North Carolina and along the Appalachian crest. So
kept about 20 percent rain chances NE sections and along the
mountains and SW North Carolina. Lows tonight will stay mild and 
Thursday highs will be upper 80s to lower 90s lower elevations
once again but slightly cooler higher elevations.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
Will see little change in the overall weather pattern through the
extended. This pattern is basically a strong upper ridge of high 
pressure positioned over the southeastern U.S. Throughout the 
extended...a series of weak to moderate short waves/frontal 
boundaries will track through the upper flow...briefly flattening 
the upper ridge. Models do show some differences with detail in 
the timing and strength of the waves but it generally looks like 
one of the waves will be moving out of the area at the very 
beginning of the extended...early Wednesday night...another will 
move in on Friday...and another during the weekend...then Sunday 
night into Monday the strongest of the short waves will track 
through. The upper ridge begins to shift eastward around the 
Wednesday time frame. Throughout the period...as a short wave 
rides through the upper flow...it may add enough lift and pull in 
a bit of low level moisture to generate isolated...mainly 
afternoon... convection across northern and eastern locations. The
high terrain will add some orographic lift giving this area the 
best chance for the shower/thunderstorms activity. The Monday wave
with the strongest of the series and scattered to isolated 
convection could be possible over much of the area. During the 
rest of the time...the upper ridge will re- strengthen and inhibit
most convection. However...with strong diurnal heating and weak 
orographic lift...afternoon high elevations convection can not be 
totally ruled out. 

The other story with the strong upper ridge in place will be the 
very warm temperatures expected throughout the extended.  Highs will 
average a good 10 degrees above normal each day.

Another mostly sunny day today with high cloudiness from leftover

move east today which may filter the sun some. Hourly 
temperatures and dewpoints modified slightly to match current
conditions. Short range models try to develop a few showers/storms
in higher elevations around 21 to 00Z but with building ridge and
lack of upper level moisture and a trigger expect vertical cloud 
development to be limited. Could be isolated shower or storm over
the eastern Tennessee mountains and Southwest North Carolina but 
will keep rain chances out for today. No changes to current

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...The mid/upper level ridge 
will remain anchored over the southeastern states for the short 
term period. We will remain in a very warm air mass, and today 
will be mostly sunny across the area. Moisture will increase a bit
in the boundary layer, but model soundings still look quite dry 
and while some models try to develop isolated weak convection near
our eastern mountains this afternoon into tonight, this should be
limited and most likely will stay just to our east so will keep 
the forecast precip free for now. Temperatures will be above 
normal both today and tonight.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...Still not a whole lot 
of change through the long term period. Main story will be the 
above normal warmth for this time of year, around 10 degrees above
normal for both highs and lows. Except for some slight chance 
POPs here and there it will be pretty dry through the period.

On Thursday the strong ridge across our region flattens a little in 
response to a cold front sagging southward into the Ohio River 
Valley. The front is associated with a low moving into the Great 
Lakes Region. Models still show a weak impulse moving across the 
northern periphery of the high which allows for some slight chance 
POPs across the TN/KY state line and into SWVA. Low-end chance POPs 
in place for the high terrain of SWVA and the far eastern mountains. 

The ridge surges back northward on Friday and doesn't flatten again 
until the Sunday/Monday period. Friday through Sunday look pretty 
dry. Highest and best coverage of POPs occur on Monday with low-end 
chance POPs across NETN and SWVA and slight chance along and north 
of I-40. This is due to the ridge flattening again which puts us in 
zonal flow with a few impulses moving through. Ridge slightly 
strengthens again on Tuesday in response to an upper level trough 
swinging through the Great Plains.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...

Not a lot to talk about in the short term forecast. Upper ridging
will stay anchored just to our south through the period as a
deep trough/upper low shifts from the southern plains to the upper
midwest over the next 24 hours or so. This will keep us in warmer
than normal temperatures, with highs in the 80s again tomorrow for
many areas.

Dry conditions are also in the forecast, with only some afternoon
cumulus buildup expected over the mountains tomorrow afternoon and
also in the southern plateau and southern Tennessee valley
where low level moisture content is a little higher. Some models
hint at some isolated showers over the mountains tomorrow. However
these should mostly be on the NC side of the state line and pretty
isolated in nature. Cut PoPs out of the forecast as a result.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...

Weather pattern shows little overall change next several days. 
Strong upper level ridge will stay centered over the southeast 
states for the extended period of the forecast. The GFS and ECMWF 
and to a lesser degree the NAM shows it flatten Wednesday night 
and Thursday with weak shortwave to move across the northern 
sections for some isolated to scattered showers and storms. This 
will be only a temporary situation as the Upper Ridge 
restrengthens by Friday and in fact strengthens further. GFS even 
with the strengthening wants to put in some daily pops Friday and 
Saturday but will keep dry for now. Sunday all models show systems
moving a little farther south into the Ohio Valley so will have a
slight chance showers and storms northern areas last 3 days. 
Models move ridge a little farther south or shift it west which 
would open door for a chance of storms along northern edge of CWA.
Temperatures stay warm to hot over the period. lows will stay in 
the mid 60s to near 70 and highs will be mostly upper 80s to lower
90s around 10 degrees above normal.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Heights will rise as the 
upper level ridge builds during the short term. The atmosphere 
will be on the dry side overall, so while we will see some mainly 
high clouds around, overall expect a precip free short term period
with plenty of sunshine today and a mostly clear sky tonight. 
Temperatures will be well above normal for this time of year this 
afternoon.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...Very little change from 
the previous long term forecast. Models still showing a strong 
upper ridge in place throughout the period. This will allow 
temperatures to climb into the mid 80s to low 90s for highs and 
mid to upper 60s for overnight lows. These temperatures will be 
roughly 10 degrees above normal for this time of year. 

Most areas will stay dry throughout the period. Except for the high 
terrain where has some slight chance POPs will be in place during 
peak heating. The best chance for valley areas to see precip occurs 
on Thursday as a weak impulse rounds the northern periphery of the 
high. POPs only in place for valley areas north of I-40 though, with 
low-end chance POPs for the high terrain. The only other thing worth 
noting is that Wednesday will be breezy due to the position of the 
high off to our southeast. Southerly winds from 8 to 12 mph with 
gusts from 15 to 20 mph can be expected.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
Frontal boundary stalls near the area tonight with drier air
across the region, especially across NE TN and SW VA. With high
pressure increasing at the surface and ridging building in aloft,
expect a clear sky and relatively light winds. With the drier air
advection, expect any patchy fog to be limited to river valleys.

High pressure begins to shift east on Tuesday with the mid and
upper ridge axis shifting eastward. This will result in increasing
moist SW flow, especially across the southern valley and
Cumberland Plateau, by the afternoon with WAA at 850mb. With
increasing low-level temperatures and increasing heights, expect
max temperatures to be 3 to 5 degrees warmer than today. Should have
some sct cu along the southern plateau and valley by the 
afternoon where dew points will be highest, but no precipitation 
is expected.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...
The main story for the long term forecast will be the continued 
heat. A strong upper ridge will be anchored over the southeast 
United States through the week, yielding afternoon highs that will 
be +10 degrees above normal for most places, culminating with temps 
in the 90s by Friday and Saturday afternoon. 

Rain chances will remain low overall, but despite the upper ridge 
holding strong over the area, some showers originating in the higher 
terrain in the afternoons beginning Friday will be possible. Have 
kept some slight chance over the higher terrain each afternoon 
thereafter to account for this.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...A weak frontal boundary will 
push into our area this morning and will exit to the south and east 
this afternoon.  Convective energy will be limited, but a few 
showers, and possibly some isolated thunderstorms, can be expected 
during the morning/early afternoon mainly eastern two thirds of the 
area. Drier air will be working in behind the front, so expect 
clearing skies today and a mostly clear sky tonight. Temperatures 
will be above normal today but will dip closer to seasonal norms 
tonight.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday night)...A summer like 
synoptic pattern will be in place through most of the long term 
outlook, with a strong upper level ridge over the southeast that 
will stay in place through the week. A deepening low will be 
located lee of the central Rockies that will track to the 
northeast with an associated cold front preceding it. The longwave
trough will elongate by mid week as it begins to move around the 
edge of the ridge with a series of shortwaves moving along the 
boundary. The shortwaves will attempt to break the ridge down, 
with the GFS showing a slight flattening by Thursday morning.

Locally, the high pressure for the week will help to suppress cloud 
formation leading to plenty of surface heating. Along with the near 
constant moisture advection resulting from the south to 
southwesterly flow, temperatures and humidity will remain high with 
some days seeing low to mid 90's in the valley. All this increasing 
instability will lead to a few days seeing some afternoon 
convection, driven by differential surface heating and lift from the 
mountains. Most diurnally driven storms will be short lived and 
restricted to the higher terrain due to the elevated LFC levels for 
most afternoons, but a few cells could drift into the valley. The 
best chance for greater convective coverage looks to be late in the 
week moving into the weekend. The afore mentioned shortwaves could 
create enough lift along the stalling front to cause isolated to 
scattered thunderstorms.

The ridge will build back in by the end of the weekend, drifting 
slightly to the west and centered just off the Gulf coast by Sunday. 
Temperatures look to remain high into next week as a similar 
synoptic pattern looks to play out again early next week with 
another longwave trough setting up over the American southwest.

chance to slight chance pops for this activity the second half of 
the night. Removed all thunder mention this evening through the 
overnight since instability is decreasing, and the latest ENTLN 
lightning data is no longer showing any flashes. The only other 
changes were to slightly tweak hourly temps, dew points, and 
winds this evening to match recent observations. The rest of the

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...
Water vapor imagery and upper air analysis places a ridge of high
pressure across the eastern seaboard with a shortwave trough 
sliding into the Great Lakes. Further west, troughing is analyzed
across the west coast. This configuration places the southern 
Appalachians under 30-35 knots of southwesterly flow aloft. The
surface reflects an area of low pressure across southern 
Wisconsin with a trailing cold front extending south into the 
Ozarks and southern plains. Satellite imagery is beginning to show
signs of a developing CU field with vertical development. 
Additionally, recent radar scans are beginning to show isolated 
showers and thunderstorms across mostly northeast areas of the 
forecast area. Steep low level lapse rates on the order of 8.0 to 
8.5 C/km along with strong solar radiative heating has allowed the
atmosphere to become very unstable this afternoon. Latest SPC 
mesoanalysis places nearly 1500 to 2000 J/kg of surface based CAPE
values and LI’s around -2 to -3 . The lack of any appreciable
mid level forcing for ascent means that our source of lift will 
likely be from differential heating and orographic forcing for 
ascent. Further, weak surface troughing analyzed across southwest 
Virginia could also aid in lift for parcels to reach their LFC. 
Increased 500mb flow has allowed effective bulk shear to increase 
this afternoon to near 30 knots. This along with strong 
instability could lead to strong and sustained updrafts this 
afternoon and early evening. Further, hail CAPE values near 300 to
400 J/kg suggest a hail threat will accompany any of the stronger
convection. A damaging wind threat also exists today given the 
large DCAPE values in excess of 1000 J/kg and very dry air aloft 
above 700mb. The most likely locations to experience thunderstorm 
activity today are across extreme northeast Tennessee and 
southwest Virginia. Further west, drier air in the atmospheric 
column will tend to prevent convective development through the 
afternoon and evening. 

Through tonight, the upper level pattern begins to flatten out as
the strong shortwave advects north of the Great Lakes. This 
ultimately means the surface front will weaken further as it 
approaches the area. Moisture does increase along the front and as
a result do expect scattered showers across most of the area late
tonight through Monday morning. The abundance of cloud cover will
keep temperature mild with overnight lows progged in the low to 
mid 60s. Upper level ridging builds behind the weak impulse aloft 
and will advect drier air into the area. Otherwise it will be 
another warm day on Monday with high temperatures in the low to 
mid 80s area wide. 


.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
Main weather story for the extended will be the developing heat 
and humidity by mid to late week as upper ridge strengthens over 
the southeast United States and southern Appalachians.

Persistent upper troughing in the Great Basin area of the west with 
ridging over the southeast United States will keep with the weather 
quiet over the southern Appalachians and Tennessee Valley for 
Tuesday through Thursday.  Some gradual increase in moisture is 
anticipated by late Wednesday and Thursday with isolated to widely 
scattered storms over the far east Tennessee Mountains anticipated.

For Friday into the weekend, a series of short-waves will ride a top 
of the upper ridge over the Ohio Valley.  This will help flatten the 
upper ridge over the ridge some allowing for slightly greater 
convection coverage, especially for the higher terrain. Some of 
these storms could be strong to isolated severe with the main 
concern being downburst damaging winds and hail up to quarter size.
At this time, Saturday and Sunday afternoons seems the best day for 
coverage and intensity.

Gusty southerly winds will continue through the early evening with
gusts up to 20-23 knots at times. Scattered to broken diurnal CU
will continue to develop this afternoon over the TAF sites before
gradually diminishing after sunset. Recent radar and satellite 
trends give enough confidence for VCTS at TRI through 00Z with a 
TEMPO of TSRA between 21Z and 23Z. Expect thunderstorm activity to
end closer to sunset with the loss of heating. Less confidence 
exists in regards to CIGS early morning through late morning 
Monday. Guidance does indicate lower CIGS to MVFR at CHA and TYS 
and the TAFs reflect this. TRI should stay in VFR category through
the TAF period.

.DISCUSSION...

Made some tweaks to the current forecast based on latest trends.
Visible imagery shows mostly clear skies this morning as
temperatures warm into the upper 60s to low 70s. Today should be
similar to yesterday with daytime highs in the mid to upper 80s.
The current surface analysis places an area of low pressure across
northeast Iowa with a cold front extending south into the Ozarks,
and southern plains. High pressure to the east has been allowing
the pressure gradient to increase. This should increase south
winds by this afternoon with wind gusts between 15 and 25 mph. 
Not expecting winds to reach advisory criteria today but this will
be monitored.

Made minor tweaks to PoPs and weather grids to account for latest
hi-res guidance. The highest chances of thunderstorms this
afternoon are across northeast Tennessee, and southwest Virginia.
CAPE values increase to upwards of 2000-3000 J/kg. Differential 
heating across the higher terrain could lead to convective 
initiation. Some of these storms could be strong to possibly
severe given the thermodynamics involved this afternoon with 
large CAPE profiles and steep low level lapse rates. Hail and 
damaging winds are possible with any of these strong to severe 
storms.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Strong upper level ridge remains in place over the southeastern 
states with a well established Bermuda high located off shore. A 
longwave trough is currently located over the central Great Plains 
and is tracking eastward. The ongoing cyclogenesis looks to further 
develop a low pressure center over Iowa that will move to the 
northeast into the Great Lakes region by tonight. An associated cold 
front out ahead of the trough will bring scattered storms to 
southern Appalachia by this evening. The front will be preceeded by 
a low level jet that will increase southerly winds for the mountains 
and plateau for much of the. Gusty winds should remain below 
advisory criteria and are expected to fall off by late evening.

In addition to the front, another afternoon of air mass type storms 
possible for the eastern mountains, northeastern Tennessee and 
southwestern Virginia. Showers and storms could again initiate from 
the combination of orographic lifting from the mountains and 
differential daytime heating of the surface, as cloud cover is 
expected to be mostly scattered for much of the day today. NAM 
soundings show a substantial amount of MLCAPE at around 2000 J/kg by 
the afternoon hours with a few isolated severe storms possible. 
DCAPE of over 1200 J/kg with near 30 knots of deep layer shear show 
the potential for some damaging winds from any more established 
cells that collapse.

Another chance for fog development this morning along the major 
rivers and larger bodies of water as skies will clear overnight and 
winds remain light. Any areas that received rainfall early last 
night could also see some fog due to the increased low level 
moisture.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...

Models in decent agreement overall for the long term period. The 
weak cold front will be exiting the area on Monday, and some 
lingering convection will be possible especially during the 
morning hours. While there will not be much cooling behind the 
front, there will be some drying, and with the drier boundary 
layer convective energy should be minimal for Tuesday so will have
a precip free forecast. A high amplitude upper ridge is forecast 
to build over the region and persist through at least Friday. This
will lead to hot afternoons with temps climbing to near or even 
above 90 degrees in many valley locations. Some isolated 
convection cannot be ruled out in the afternoons, with the best 
possibility of this expected to be over the eastern mountains. 
Will carry slight chance PoPs there. By Saturday some models, 
especially the GFS, hint that the ridge may be flattening out with
a weak cold front sagging south toward the area. Given the model 
disagreement and the fact that it is at the end of the period, 
confidence is low that this will actually occur, so will just 
include slight chance PoPs for showers and thunderstorms over much
of the area on Saturday.

.DISCUSSION...The pulse convection will continue to dissipate over
the next two hours as diurnal cooling continues, but increased 
pops and cloud cover in northeast TN and southwest VA to cover 
the leftover activity. This will be in the form of showers and 
rumbles of thunder, so no additional severe weather is expected. 
Current temps and dew points show a wide range across the region 
with areas that saw the thunderstorms running significantly 
cooler. Adjusted hourly curves to account for these variations

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

Upper level ridging remains across the southeast and into the 
Mid-Atlantic this afternoon with a rather potent shortwave trough 
advecting off the Rockies. Closer to the surface, high pressure 
remains situated across the area leading to generally clear 
skies. Water vapor imagery shows a fairly dry atmosphere in place 
with some convection beginning to initiate across western NC. 
Convective activity across the MRX area remains uncertain, however
as of discussion time, some of the diurnally driven CU seems to 
be showing signs of cooler cloud tops and vertical growth. The 
atmosphere is unstable with CAPE values in the 1000 to 2000 J/kg 
range. A light southeasterly low level flow could enhance 
orographic lift, and along with differential heating could allow 
for isolated thunderstorms this afternoon. Again, confidence 
remains low but feel the need to keep low end PoPs in the forecast
for the afternoon. Would expect any convection to remain short 
lived given the relatively light flow aloft, and no forcing. 

Overnight, the aforementioned shortwave aloft will lift northeast
into the Midwest with surface low pressure developing across the
central plains and ejecting northeast into Iowa by Sunday morning.
A cold front attendant this surface low will begin to move into
the Tennessee valley before slowing down as the main dynamics
aloft move into the Great Lakes. An increasing pressure gradient 
would promote an increase in southerly flow and gusty winds. The 
forecast will remain dry through Sunday afternoon with highs in 
the mid to upper 80s.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

The main headline for the extended will be anomalous ridging 
building in across the region for the middle to late part of next 
week with mostly dry weather and above normal temperatures. There 
will be a large ridge across the Western Atlantic with troughing 
across the Central CONUS on Sunday night. A shortwave trough and 
closed low will be moving northeast across the Great Lakes. The 
occluding surface low will have a slowing cold front which will 
approach our area by late Sunday night. Main dynamics remain to our 
north and west with this system with weak forcing across our area. 
For this reason, expect lower PoPs with the front as it moves east 
into our region with the highest PoPs across western and southern 
portions of the CWA. Overall, chance PoPs are expected with some low-
end likely PoPs possible across the Cumberland Plateau and southern 
Tennessee Valley. Believe that most areas will have light precip 
with this system. but it will be lighter and more scattered as the 
front approaches compared to further north and west. The front 
stalls near our area on Monday before moving quickly north as a warm 
front on Tuesday. Could have a few lingering slight chance/chance 
PoPs on Monday near the frontal boundary, but expect most areas 
remain dry.

Ridging builds in on Wednesday and continues to increase through the 
end of the week. Some weak isentropic ascent could lead to a few 
scattered showers or thunderstorms on Wednesday morning, but 
confidence is low. Even if some develop, slight chance PoPs are all 
that's expected Wednesday. The 500mb heights are expected to be near 
590 to 594 dam Wednesday afternoon through Friday which is near the 
max climatological percentile. This anomalous ridging will keep us 
mainly dry and result in max temperatures about 10 to 15 degrees 
above normal. Expect we will have a few diurnally driven isolated 
showers or thunderstorms across the higher terrain of the mountains, 
but most areas should remain dry and unseasonably warm. It will 
definitely be a summer-like pattern during the majority of the 
extended.

As we get into next weekend, the GFS breaks from the ECMWF and 
Canadian by trying to flatten the ridge as several shortwaves move 
across the Ohio Valley. However, tend to forecast with persistence 
with such a strong ridge, so will trend closer to the ECMWF and 
Canadian keeping ridging firmly in place.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

High pressure will continue to increase through the weekend as an 
upper level ridge over the Mississippi river valley advects 
eastward. A positively tilted longwave trough over the southern Great 
Plains states will increase in amplitude as it starts to ride along 
the periphery of the strong blocking high. A weak shortwave impulse 
will move northeastward along the ridge into the CWA Saturday night. 
This mid level wave, paired with strong daytime heating and light 
southerly flow, with the additional lift provided by the southern 
Appalachian mountains, could be enough to form some isolated areas 
of elevated convection in the afternoon. Showers and thunderstorms 
are not a sure thing, however, due to very dry air aloft and
strong suppression from the ridge. Clearing skies tonight will
lend to longer periods of radiational cooling, along with residual
moisture at the surface and light winds will allow decoupling of
the PBL, promoting potential fog formation for the early mornings
this weekend along the major rivers and larger bodies of water.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...

Cold front moving through the MS and OH Valleys Sunday will 
draw up warm and humid air upon southerly winds across our area. The 
front will then bring scattered showers and thunderstorms across the 
area Sunday night into Monday, but the forcing will be weakening 
from what it once was and so precip will not be particularly heavy. 
The frontal boundary will come to rest to our south Monday night and 
then lift northward during Tuesday as sharp troughing occurs over 
the Rockies which will induce warm southerly flow back across our 
area. This sharp western troughing will be matched by strong ridging 
over the southeast US, and temps by midweek will soar to nearly 10+ 
degrees above normal. Expecting only isolated diurnal convection 
during those hot days.

VFR conditions expected through the forecast period. Light winds
and sparse clouds overnight will lead to areas of patchy fog
formation along rivers for the early morning. TRI could see some
fog advect on station during the morning hours, but any impact on
visibility is expected to be minimal. Scattered clouds tomorrow 
afternoon with the possibility of a few isolated showers along 
areas of higher terrain. A slight chance of any terminals
receiving precip on station tomorrow with current confidence high
enough to leave even VCSH out of the TAFs.

.DISCUSSION...The current forecast is on track for the overnight
period. I tweaked the pop, in terms of coverage across Southwest 
Virginia, for the remote possibility there may be a shower or a 
thunderstorm on the extreme western extent of an outflow boundary 
slipping southeast this evening into the Central Appalachians. 
Temperature forecast is on track for upper 50s and lower 60s 
across Southwest Virginia with lower and middle 60s across much of
the remainder of the forecast area. There may be some light fog 
development near the waterways toward sunrise due to efficient 
radiation in the generally clear sky, light wind environment 
tonight.

.AVIATION...The terminal forecast looks quite good compared to
last night when convection developed during the early morning
hours. In fact, in the ridge pattern that will be in place on 
Saturday with a relatively dry atmosphere, there will be a very 
small chance of any thunderstorm development in the Great Valley. 
Most of the period should be vfr at each terminal. The only spot 
that may see a small amount of patchy fog would be at tri around 
daybreak. However, visibility may stay above five miles if this 
develops; keeping vfr operations in place.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...

Upper level ridging is currently building across the Mississippi 
river valley southward into the southern plains with a weakness in
mid level flow across the southeast and northern GoM. The surface
features high pressure centered across the southeast with weak 
surface flow across much of the area. Further west, low pressure 
is analyzed lee of the Rockies underneath mid level height falls 
associated with a shortwave trough advecting northeast. 
Temperatures this afternoon have warmed into the 80’s to near 90
at CHA underneath increasing heights aloft. Dry air advecting in 
from the west will tend to limit convective chances this afternoon
and evening. Clear skies and calm winds are expected tonight 
associated with the aforementioned surface high pressure. Some 
radiational cooling could promote patchy fog development 
overnight in places that received rainfall this morning.

The ridge intensifies on Saturday leading to another day of 
mostly clear skies. Temperatures will be warm with daytime highs 
in the mid to upper 80’s expected area wide. A well mixed lower 
troposphere will tend to increase low level lapse rates as 
reflected in forecast soundings. This combined with differential
heating along the terrain will lead to chances of isolated to
scattered thunderstorms Saturday afternoon and as a result increased
PoPs across mainly the higher terrain and foothills. The limited 
factors are nearly weak upper level flow, and dry air aloft. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...

The big story for the extended will be anomalous ridging building in 
across the region for the middle to late part of next week. On 
Sunday, we will have a large ridge across the Western Atlantic with 
troughing across the Central CONUS. A shortwave trough and closed, 
stacked upper low will be across the Northern Mississippi Valley. 
The surface low will have a trailing cold front which will approach 
our area by Sunday night. However, this low will become occluded 
with the forward progression of the front slowing rapidly. Main 
dynamics remain to our north and west with this system. This will 
lead to weak forcing across our area with quickly diminishing PoPs 
as activity moves eastward toward our region on Sunday night. 
Current thinking is that most areas likely still see some QPF, but 
it will be lighter and more scattered as the front approaches. The 
front stalls near our area on Monday before moving quickly north as 
a warm front on Tuesday morning. Could have a few lingering slight 
chance/chance PoPs on Monday and Tuesday near the frontal boundary, 
but expect most areas remain dry.

Ridging builds in on Wednesday and continues to increase through the 
end of the week. The 500mb heights are expected to be near 590 to 
593 dam Wednesday afternoon through Friday which is near the 99th 
climatological percentile. This anomalous ridging will keep us 
mainly dry and result in max temperatures about 10 to 12 degrees 
above normal. Could have a few diurnally driven isolated showers or 
thunderstorms across the higher terrain of the mountains, but most 
areas should remain dry and unseasonably warm. It will definitely be 
a summer-like pattern during the majority of the extended.

.DISCUSSION...

Morning round of showers and thunderstorms across NE portions of
TN and far western VA has been reduced to just showers at update
time. These are likely to continue for a couple more hours before
pushing out of Eastern TN. Will allow for PoPs to fall off as we 
move through the afternoon, however, under the northwest flow 
aloft and with plenty of instability around, a late afternoon 
thunderstorm cannot be ruled out. Best chances for this to occur 
will be south of I-40 as orographic lift assists in tossing those 
parcels into the atmosphere. A few could become strong with gusty 
winds and small hail, but the likelihood of this is small. If you 
have outdoor plans, remain weather aware, otherwise enjoy this 
early taste of summer as temperatures climb into the mid-80s for 
everyone west of the mountains.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

A frontal boundary is currently over the southern Ohio Valley along 
the axis of the upper level ridge. A shortwave impulse is moving 
southeast along the boundary that will bring a few early morning 
showers with some additional areas of rain along the mountains for 
Friday. NAM soundings show some decent MLCAPE on Friday, along with 
higher Theta-e which implies a slight chance for a few thunderstorms 
to develop along the mountains. Although due to the increasing 
pressure from the ridge paired with little to no forcing aside from 
orographic lift, little to no chance of any severe storms are 
expected. Ceilings will scatter out by the afternoon as high 
pressure continues to build into the region, pushing the stalled 
front further to the north. Winds will back to the south along the 
pressure gradient through Friday night leading to increased WAA. The 
combination of the moist southerly flow and clearing skies will lead 
to much warmer temperatures proceeding into the weekend.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...

The general longwave pattern throughout the extended will be H5 
troughing over the Rockies and ridging over the Southeast, with a 
northward pull of Gulf moisture and rain in the Central Plains. This 
means very warm temperatures approaching 10 degrees above normal by 
the middle of next week, and 7 day rainfall totals averaging less 
than an inch across the CWA. 

A weak frontal boundary associated with an H5 trough will bring the 
best chances of rain during Sunday night and into the day Monday. 
Once the trough passes, however, the warm ridge will quickly 
reassert itself, and even stronger. It looks like it will keep the 
storm track mostly to our north, which means SW VA will be the main 
area to experience convection chances Wed Ngt and Thurs after hot 
and dry days Tuesday and Wednesday.

Decaying convective cell to the north may bring a few vicinity
showers to TYS and TRI as it tracks southward. TYS looks to see a
possible thunderstorm on station so added a tempo for the first 
two hours with mostly showers expected for much of the event. CHA
looks to remain free of any overnight precip as the cell is 
expected to stay to the north of the terminal. Some morning 
showers along the mountains may be possible from orographic 
lifting, with the increasing high pressure that will work to limit
any thunderstorm potential. The rest of the TAF period looks to 
be VFR as temperatures continue to warm as a result of the 
southerly winds.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...Surface high pressure will
continue to dominate area weather for quiet night. A short wave
riding along the upper will push through the Southern Appalachian
Region late tonight into Friday. This will increase mid and high
level clouds tonight with some initial convection possible towards
morning over far northern areas. The clouds combined with
southerly flow increasing low level moisture will allow for warmer
temperatures tonight. As the main lobe of the short wave moves in
on Friday...isolated convection may develop. There is minimal
upper level support but with an increase in moisture and weak
lift...a few isolated showers and thunderstorms will be possible.
With the aid of orographic lift...the East TN Mountains will see a
better chance of convection. DCAPE values will be around 1000 to
1500 J/kg but with little dynamics to work with...do not
anticipate any strong or severe storms. The warming trend will
continue into Friday with afternoon highs forecast to reach into
the 80s across most valley locations.

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Thursday)...The start of the 
long term period will feature upper level troughing out west with 
ridging across the southeast promoting an increase in 
southwesterly flow aloft transporting moisture northward. At the 
surface, cyclogenesis lee of the Rockies will occur under upper 
level height falls and move east northeast through the weekend 
period dragging a cold front through the central and southern 
plains. A rather potent shortwave trough will eject northeast into
the central and northern plains Saturday night into Sunday which 
should send the aforementioned low pressure quickly northward. 
However, continued height falls lee of the Rockies will promote 
additional cyclogenesis with another surface low. An increase in 
southerly flow will lead to isentropic lifting and with at least 
some moisture present could lead to scattered showers on Saturday 
afternoon and evening. By late Sunday night into Monday morning 
the potent shortwave will advect quickly into the Great Lakes 
region with dry air quickly wrapping around the low. A weak cold 
front will move through the Tennessee and Ohio valley Sunday night
into Monday providing a focus for scattered showers. Forecast 
point soundings and 2-D surfaces show some elevated instability 
present underneath mid-level cooling, and would be sufficient for 
a few rumbles of thunder. Given the increased southerly flow, 
temperatures during this time will be above normal. 

Further west, a stronger shortwave trough will move off the Rockies 
and quickly eject northeast into the Great Lakes while upper level 
ridging builds across the GoM. Upper level height falls lee of the 
Rockies will induce surface cyclogenesis with low pressure moving 
through the central plains and Midwest.  A cold front attendant this 
low will move through the plains and into the Mississippi river 
valley by midweek.  There is some uncertainties in regards to if 
this cold front will be able to make its way into the Tennessee 
valley.  If the ridge builds in too quick, this will ultimately mean 
the cold front will not be able to push through and will remain to 
our north.  As a result chances of widespread frontal precipitation 
seems unlikely at this point, yet there remains the probability of 
scattered thunderstorms given some instability that will be present 
due to increased moisture and heating. However, mid-level 
temperatures will be quite warm leading to weak mid to low level 
lapse rates. This combined with weak wind profiles will limit storm 
organization and chances of strong storms. Precipitable water values 
near 1.25 to 1.5 inches along with deep warm cloud layers could 
promote areas of heavy rainfall especially in any convective 
elements. Model soundings indicate a well mixed boundary layer by 
Wednesday which will allow daytime highs to approach the mid to 
upper 80's across most of the forecast area with 90 degrees 
certainly not out of the realm of possibilities. 

Ridge of high pressure will quickly build in behind this mid week 
system and will produce a summer like pattern with drier weather 
conditions and much warmer conditions with highs in the mid to upper 
80s and lows in the upper 60s.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

An increasing ridge over the eastern Great Plains will continue to 
build into the area over the next few days. Up north, a cold front 
looks to move into the Great Lakes region and eventually stall out 
at the axis of the ridge with a shortwave impulses that will move 
southward along the boundary. A shortwave looks to move over 
northeastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia late tonight and 
into Friday morning, bringing a chance for showers and some possible 
thunderstorms. Convection will be elevated in nature and tied to 
orographic lifting, which is why the models show some QPF tied to 
the terrain. Currently, the GFS looks to be over doing the chance 
for precip, while the NAM, RAP, and HRRR are showing drier 
conditions, which looks to be more realistic, so am leaning towards 
the greater consensus.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...

The gist of it is that the main story for the long term period will 
be the notable warm up that will occur, with well above normal 
temperatures continuing through much of next week. Some chances for 
showers and thunderstorms will exist on Friday and Saturday, mainly 
over the higher terrain locales, but any significant chance of 
rainfall holds off until a decaying front attempts to move in from 
the west late Sunday evening or into Sunday night. Then it's back to 
a period of warmer weather as upper ridging builds overhead again.

Going into more detail here, a deep trough will be in place across 
the western CONUS at the start of the period, with northwesterly 
upper flow from the northern plains across the Great Lakes region, 
and upper ridging across the Gulf states, and lower Mississippi 
River Valley regions. Some guidance hints at elevated convection 
forming over the Tennessee and southwest Virginia mountains early 
Friday morning. Not particularly sold on the early morning 
convection part, but with a weak shortwave passing through to our 
north, there may be enough of a weakness in the upper ridge to allow 
for some afternoon storms to fire over the plateau and mountain 
regions. Have some 20-30 PoPs in to account for this but it is a low 
confidence forecast. A similar setup is expected on Saturday, with 
another round of isolated to scattered storms over the plateau and 
mountain areas. The more significant item of note here will be how 
warm temperatures get. As the ridge builds in from the west, highs 
will run near 10 degrees above normal on both Saturday and Sunday, 
with highs in the mid to upper 80s expected in the south on Sunday 
afternoon.

Further west on Saturday and Sunday a strong disturbance will eject 
out of New Mexico and into the plains. This will lead to widespread 
severe storms over the plains, but more importantly it will push a 
cold front our direction. Have rain chances increasing through the 
afternoon and evening hours Sunday, but the best chances for showers 
and thunderstorms will likely hold off until late Sunday night. 
Slowed the timing down a bit from previous forecasts due to better 
agreement in a slower arrival time. This should bring fairly 
widespread rainfall to the forecast area though, before departing on 
Monday morning. It should knock temperatures down a bit too, with 
lower 80s forecast for Monday. However, a strong ridge builds back 
overhead by Monday evening in response to another trough entering 
the southern plains, so expect to see summer like temperatures to 
round out the period. Rainfall with the next system probably holds 
off until just after the long term forecast period.

.SHORT TERM(Tonight and Thursday)...A weakening convective complex
continues to track across the area late this afternoon/evening.
The strongest portion of the complex will remain south of the TN
border with scattered showers containing some embedded thunder
pushing through the MRX CWA. The main band of convection will stay
south of I-40. There is an 850MB jet of 25 to 30 KTs, also there
is minimal upper level support and the air mass is only weakly
unstable. As a result...do no anticipate any strong or severe
thunderstorms. The convective complex should move out of the area
late this evening though a few lingering showers may continue over
the far south and the eastern mountains through the rest of the
night. Weak surface high pressure builds in on Thursday and expect
a dry and uneventful day. As for temperatures...the warming trend
will continue and highs Thursday afternoon expected to reach into
the mid 70s to mid 80s across mot valley locations.

.LONG TERM (Thursday Night through Wednesday)... Overall pattern 
in the long term will be an strengthening ridge through the rest 
of the week and into the weekend, with a low pressure/front 
expected to swing through at the end of the weekend and into the 
next work week.

Mid-level ridge will continue to build as we wind down the work 
week, and a frontal boundary will get stalled across the Ohio River 
Valley. This will help temperatures to quickly climb into the 80's 
by Friday, with these above normal temperatures expected to continue 
through the rest of the forecast. Not a ton of synoptic forcing 
present across the forecast area with more of the lifting mechanisms 
remaining to our north along the boundary. The warm temperatures may 
be able to spark some convection in the afternoon/evening Thursday 
and Friday. Currently think the GFS is overdoing potential 
convection, so have trended towards the drier NAM/ECMWF with respect 
to PoP chances. 

Better chances for showers and storms come as a frontal boundary 
pushes through at the end of the weekend. This will be the best 
chance for precipitation during the forecast. Timing of the front 
and associated storms will hopefully occur overnight decreasing 
strong to severe storm potential, but will definitely keep an eye 
on this system as it gets closer. Front doesn't really do much to 
temperatures and we should remain mostly in the 80's through the 
first half of next week. Ridging begins to build in behind the 
system leading to drier weather.

.AVIATION...A convective complex will ride along the upper flow 
this afternoon.  As a result...will see clouds increase and lower at 
area TAF sites. The strongest part of the complex should track south 
of the TN/GA border where the best chance of lightning/thunder will 
be. The northern portion of the complex containing scattered showers 
with possibly some embedded thunder should stay south of I-40. 
Therefore...will keep VCSH in the CHA TAF but for now will not 
mention in TRI or TYS. The convection should exit the area this 
evening. With recent scattered rain...patchy fog may form overnight. 
However...coverage should be minimal and will not mention in TAFs. 
With all of this...tonight should see scattered mid level clouds 
move through with dry...VFR conditions.  On Thursday...weak surface 
high pressure should build in for a relatively quiet day with a few 
mid and high clouds and VFR conditions.  As for winds...they should 
be light overnight and remain below 10 KTs on Thursday.

I-40.  Otherwise...we will continue on our warming trend as 
afternoon highs reach into the 70s across most valley locations.

Fog is present again this morning, mostly along/near river valleys
and lakes. The only site being somewhat affected is KTRI, and
they're still VFR with 6SM and FEW-SCT001. Think any non-VFR impacts
there will be very brief as fog should rapidly dissipate over the
next hour or so. Otherwise, the main forecast concern is potential
impacts from convection moving southeast out of Kentucky. Think
VCSH is warranted at KCHA for a few hours after 17z, but that's
about it. Elsewhere, only increasing coverage of VFR ceilings is
expected.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Nighttime microphysics RGB composite imagery on GOES 16 shows 
nicely where fog has developed overnight, largely sticking to 
river valleys across the area. This should dissipate quickly after
sunrise as a dry air mass promotes quick warming and overturning 
of the boundary layer.

For today, clouds will increase from the northwest as a weak
convective complex that started over Missouri yesterday evening
moves in. Infrared satellite imagery is not overly impressive,
nor is radar imagery from between the Paducah and St. Louis NWS 
offices. In other words, this isn't a significant MCS that will
barrel southeast through the region without dissipating. Rather 
this cluster of storms will likely remain ragged in appearance, 
and not offer up a widespread chance of any significant rainfall 
today. Current timing suggests rainfall associated with this 
feature will arrive close to 18z over the plateau and then shift 
southeast across the forecast area during the afternoon. Have PoPs
limited to 35 percent on the high end to account for the 
likelihood that this precipitation is sparse when it arrives, and
only have a few hundredths of rain in for today as well.

Highs today should be a little warmer than yesterday most
everywhere as cloud cover and any rainfall should hold off in
earnest until roughly peak heating this afternoon. For tonight,
rain chances will diminish significantly by early evening, so will
keep the forecast dry for the most part overnight. Do not think it
will be quite as cool tonight as the past couple of nights so went
a little warmer there. Fog also seems a bit uncertain as
radiational conditions won't be quite as ideal. However, suspect
some patchy fog will develop in areas that receive rainfall. This
should be sparse enough to preclude broad brushing patchy fog
across the area however, so left that out of the forecast for the
time being.


.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...

The synoptic outlook for the long term starts with an upper level 
trough over the central east coast that will continue to move 
offshore as a ridge builds over the central Great Plains. A frontal 
boundary looks to set up to our north over the Great Lakes late in 
the week with several shortwaves that will move along the front on 
the eastern side of the ridge. A second longwave trough will move 
onshore on the west coast with a preceding cold front.

A few showers will be possible for the southern counties of the CWA 
on Thursday evening as the first of the shortwaves move though the 
region. The chance for any strong thunderstorms looks to be 
rather limited during this time due to meager MLCAPE around 350 
J/kg and low PW values of under and inch. Deep layer shear will 
also be modest, of around 20 knots or less. Friday morning will 
see another shortwave from the north that will dip far enough 
south to produce a few showers for eastern Tennessee and 
southwestern Virginia. While models aren't in good agreement as to
the placement of the shortwave, decent southwesterly flow through
the day will lead to increasing WAA while soundings indicate an 
increased risk of a few strong to severe thunderstorms with MLCAPE
around 2500 J/kg but low 0-6km shear in the single digits. While 
SHIP values remain around 0.6 for the afternoon, DCAPE looks to 
reach up to 1000 J/kg, so a few stronger cells could produce some 
damaging winds and large hail.

The previously mentions longwave trough of the west coast will 
continue to track eastward through the week, while increasing in 
amplitude over the Rocky's, eventually forming a closed low over 
Colorado by Saturday night. Model inconsistency becomes very high 
this far into the forecast but the cold front from this upper level 
low looks to move into our area sometime between Monday and Tuesday 
next week. This looks to provide the greatest chance for more 
organized convection.

.SHORT TERM (This Evening through Wednesday)...For remainder of 
this afternoon/evening, fair weather cumulus clouds will dissipate
by dusk with clear sky.

For Tonight, dry northwest flow and surface ridging will be the rule 
with good radiational cooling producing another cool night. Some 
patchy steam fog is possible near area lakes and streams early 
Wednesday morning.

For Wednesday, surface ridging moves east allowing for southerly 
winds to return in the boundary layer. A weak wave in the northwest 
flow aloft will move into the Tennessee Valley during the day. 
Isentropic flow along with this wave will spread an area of 
convection southeast from the mid-Mississippi Valley across 
Tennessee. This activity will move into the region during the 
afternoon with enough elevated instability for thunder over 
southeast Tennessee.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday Night through Tuesday)...As the extended 
begins...a short wave will be pushing though the Southern 
Appalachian Region.  There is limited upper level support...the 
850MB jet is around 25 to 35 KTs...CAPE values are generally under 
500J/Kg and PWs are in the neighborhood of an inch.   This should be 
sufficient for some scattered thunderstorms...mainly south but 
overall do not see much potential for strong to severe storms.  As a 
result...expect some ongoing convection generally south of I-40 
Wednesday evening/night.  A few showers will linger into Thursday 
morning...but surface high pressure and weak ridge will develop over 
the area.  This will transition the weather pattern to dry and 
rather quiet conditions for much of Thursday into Thursday night. 

Model consistency decreases late in the period.  The overall trend 
shows a boundary setting up to our north Friday through the weekend. 
Models carry a couple of short waves along it.  Timing of waves and 
the extent they reach southward remains in question...but this 
pattern should provide occasional rounds of scattered showers and 
thunderstorms across the area...mainly over northern locations. 
Then...a cold front is expected to push in around the Monday/Tuesday 
time frame and provide the area with a chance to see a more 
organized line on convection during the early part of the work week.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Upper troughing will hold on across the eastern US during the short 
term period, with upper ridging over the Rockies. At the surface, 
continental high pressure will build into the area from the west 
today and tonight. 

Clouds clung to the Appalachian mountains north of the Smokies 
through the night, and were also persistent over lower elevation 
areas north of the I-40 corridor. Satellite imagery shows that 
clouds have been eroding more quickly over the last hour or two 
however, and much of the area should see mostly sunny conditions 
by mid morning I expect. General continued cyclonic flow aloft 
will help keep afternoon highs below normal today, with temps 
ranging from the mid 60s to around 70. This flow pattern will also
bring one more weak shortwave across the region this afternoon. 
Would not be surprised to see a scattered, flat afternoon CU 
field develop in response to this disturbance and daytime heating,
but expect whatever afternoon cloud cover is present later today 
will rapidly dissipate after we begin to lose sunlight. Thus, the 
combination of clear skies tonight, along with the advection of 
upstream dewpoints in the low to mid 40s into the forecast area, 
point to a cool night tonight. Have continued to advertise lows in
the low 40s in the north, with perhaps mid or upper 40s south of 
I-40. Also added in some patchy fog for late tonight as well. Prime
radiational conditions combined with wet soils and cool 
temperatures seems to be a solid setup for at least some patchy
development.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...

The synoptic pattern at the start of the long term outlook starts 
with an upper level low that continues to move off the northeast 
coast as the longwave trough makes its way offshore. Increased 
ridging over the Rocky mountains will build into the region through 
the week with a surface high currently over the CWA. A minor 
shortwave sits just to the west that will advect over eastern 
Tennessee by Wednesday evening.

Showers associated with the shortwave are expected overnight on 
Wednesday with the greatest chance for precip south of I-40. A few 
lingering showers on Thursday morning before the upper levels dry 
out as high pressure builds into the region as the ridge progresses 
eastward. A second minor shortwave moving along the ridge to the 
north will drop far enough south on Friday for some of the 
northeastern counties to see a few showers and thunderstorms.

An increasing amplitude longwave trough out west will develop a low 
pressure center over the four corners by Saturday that will undergo 
further cyclogenesis as it tracks east across the central Great 
Plains. A greater chance for thunderstorms early next week as a cold 
front originating from the upper level low looks to slow and 
eventually stall of the Appalachians. As the low moves off to the 
northeast, a second upper level low looks to form over the Rocky's 
that will lift the stalled boundary northward. This will lead to 
increased southerly flow before the next cold front moves in near 
the end of the forecast period, bringing another chance for 
convective weather.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
The synoptic pattern this afternoon is highlighted by a longwave 
upper trough passing atop the OH/TN Valleys, moving into the 
Appalachian region.  At the surface, high pressure continues to 
advect into the area beneath confluent flow associated with the 
descending branch of the upper trough.  Sufficient llv moisture in 
the wake of the previous fropa remains trapped west of the mtns, 
which continues to favor sct low stratocu, and possibly a few 
upslope showers tied to the western sloped terrain.  Thus, the vast 
majority of the area will remain dry, with only slight chance pops 
favored along the spine of the Apps.  The combination of nwly flow 
and sky cover will work to keep max temps around 4-6 degrees below 
normal. As for Tuesday, pattern evolution will feature eastward 
advection of both the upper trough and the surface anticyclone which 
should center itself nearly overhead by periods end.   Thus, the 
fcst for Tuesday will remain dry with light nly flow as PGFs lower 
given the proximity of the ridge center.  Highs on Tuesday will once 
again be below normal levels.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...
Northwest flow pattern from Tuesday night through the rest of the 
week will bring some weak systems through the area with broad ridge 
of high pressure over the central states. Temperatures will be cool 
again Tuesday night with mostly clear skies and lows in the 40s to 
near 50. Wednesday afternoon the first of the systems will affect 
the southwest part of the area with a chance of showers and then 
most of the area Wednesday night. Thursday the area dries out as 
ridge to the west builds east. Friday another weak system drops down 
from the northeast with more showers and a chance of thunderstorms 
as the ridge to the west stays strong. Saturday and Sunday more 
chances for showers and storms with more diurnal type convection as 
flow becomes more southwest. Low pressure develops over the plains 
on Saturday as upper trough deepens and moves into the southern 
plains. This will allow a ridge of high pressure along the eastern 
seaboard to strengthen and the southerly flow will increase mainly 
afternoon and evening convection across the forecast area Sunday and 
Monday. Temperatures will warm above normal with building ridge by 
Friday and continue through Monday. Highs will be several degrees 
above normal at the lower elevations in the lower to mid 80s friday, 
then mid and upper 80s Saturday. Sunday and Monday temperatures a 
few degrees cooler with more cloud cover and increased coverage of 
showers.

.DISCUSSION...
Well finally some relief from the recent rains as high pressure
builds across the region beneath the descending branch of the H5 
longwave trough. Overall nwly flow will prevail with sufficient 
llv moisture present for some lower clouds to persist through 
portions of the day. Likewise, moist upsloping along the western 
slopes of the Apps will promote at least minimal chances for 
showers. Temperatures across the region are responding well amidst
partly cloudy skies southward, and mostly cloudy skies northward.
All said, the previous fcst looked pretty good, did increase max 
temps across the board by one degree or so while also tweaking 
pops slightly to align with current radar and 12z guidance. No 
other sig changes needed/made.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Synoptic scale troughing will remain in place across the eastern
US through the short term period. Embedded in the mean trough is a
semi-closed upper low currently seen over the southern 
Indiana/Illinois border this morning on GOES-16 water vapor 
imagery. This feature will rotate eastward through Kentucky in 
the base of the mean trough late this morning. Until it passes 
east of the Appalachians, some light showers could linger in the 
higher terrain of southwest Virginia and northeast Tennessee. 
Radar imagery from KMRX as well as surrounding radars show this 
to be the case, with some weak returns noted in those areas. 
Expect the upper low to shift east of the Appalachians by late 
morning or so, with rain chances coming to an end thereafter.

For today, clouds will be slow to clear across the northern parts
of the forecast area, but should become increasingly scattered in
nature through the morning hours in the south. Cloud cover and
weak cold advection will keep temperatures well below normal this
afternoon. This trend will continue tonight also, with clearing
skies and drier air in place temperatures yielding lows in the low
40s in the northern zones, and only in the upper 40s in the south.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday night)...

Closed low will be situated across the Northeast with NW flow aloft 
across the forecast area on Tuesday. With ridging building in at the 
surface and aloft, expect a mostly clear or partly cloudy day with 
temperatures remaining lower than seasonal normals.

Shortwave energy moving through the NW flow will move southeastward 
toward our forecast area on Wednesday with an associated weak 
surface low. With very little moisture advection ahead of this 
system and minimal synoptic lift, expect any chance/slight chance 
rain shower activity to be light and produce near or less than 0.1" 
QPF. Model guidance is in good agreement with this being a minimally 
impactful system for Wednesday afternoon through early Thursday 
morning.

For Thursday and Friday, ridging begins to build in with surface 
high pressure and ridging aloft. Most areas should remain dry, but 
may have a few diurnally drive showers or thunderstorms mainly 
across the higher elevations. Surface high pressure shifts east by 
the weekend with SW flow bringing in additional low-level moisture 
and increasing chances for diurnally driven thunderstorms, mainly 
across the higher elevations. With the ridging increasing late week 
and into the weekend, expect temperatures to rise through the week 
and be back above normal late week and next weekend.

Late weekend into early next week, guidance is in overall agreement 
for Day 7/8 with an approaching upper level trough and surface low 
bringing additional showers and thunderstorms to the Mississippi 
Valley. The big question will be how far east does this system 
progress or does blocking keep our area mostly dry. The GFS appears 
to be the outlier at this time as the ECMWF and Canadian both keep 
the ridge stronger with strong blocking across the North Atlantic 
and minimize our precipitation chances into early next week. At this 
point, lean toward the ECMWF/Canadian solution keeping us drier 
Sunday night into Monday.

.DISCUSSION...The frontal boundary is finally moving into the
eastern portion of the area, and the showers have diminished over
all but northeast. Once the front clears the eastern mountains it
should leave just a few lingering showers behind as the base of
the upper trough moves across. Current forecast for tonight generally
looks to have a reasonable handle on this, so will only make a 
few tweaks mainly to hourly temps and dew points.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...
An upper low moving through the Midwest will continue sliding east 
into the Great Lakes region through the period, while a pesky 
quasistationary surface frontal boundary slowly gets moving east. 
Currently this front looks to be laid atop portions of east KY and 
Middle TN, expected to advect east through the remainder of the 
day/evening.  With that, ample dry air advection aloft will favor 
steepening lapse rates, which combined with continued moist swly 
flow in the llvs, should promote continued convection this 
afternoon.  Shear will continue to increase as the upper trough and 
associated 60-70kt H5 jetmax approach tonight, however tall/skinny 
cape profiles should yield only a few hundred joules of cape.  Thus, 
think the severe threat is really low at this point, with the 
primary hazard threat tonight being slow moving and possibly 
training convection, which could lead to isolated heavy rainfall 
accumulations and thus increased flash flood threat.  FFGs would 
suggest that the most favorable regions for any flooding concerns 
would be across portions of far east TN and southwest VA/NC given 
recent rainfall.  QPF guidance yields 1-1.5 inches of rainfall for 
some locales in the above noted regions, the highest of those totals 
being across the high terrain, which seems reasonable as pwats 
remain in excess of 1.25 inches (although decreasing). All said, the 
fcst will feature mostly cloudy skies with pops in the slight/chance 
range westward, ramping up to likely/cat levels over the mtns for 
the remainder of the day.

Tonight the front should push east of the mtns allowing for deep 
nwly flow to to prevail, possibly favoring prolonged upslope flow 
induced showers into Monday morning/afternoon along the mtns.  Thus, 
pops will slowly lower from the west overnight (as a few showers 
can't be ruled out behind the front beneath the upper trough axis), 
with only slight/chance pops highlighted by daybreak across the mtns 
of TN/VA. Some patchy fog is expected across the region Monday 
morning given the moist PBL. Beyond that, high pressure will build 
in from the west as the region is consumed by upper level subsidence 
beneath the descending branch of the longwave trough. With that, 
all pops are removed by periods end as skies sct out and 
temperatures remain nearly 6-8 degrees below normal levels. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
The rain will finally exit the Tennessee Valley and Southern 
Appalachians by Monday evening as the slow moving upper level low 
moves into the Northeast and the wrap around showers move into the 
central Appalachians. A cool Northwest flow will replace the wet and 
cloudy conditions from this weekend. Much cooler air mass will allow 
temperatures to fall below normal at night the next couple days with 
lows in the 40s. Tuesday there is good agreement of high pressure at 
the surface and with NW winds and drier air mass cool high 
temperatures in the 60s to lower 70s. From Wednesday on rain chances 
increase. The strong ridge to the west will cause the upper flow 
around it to bring a shortwave rapidly southeast from southern 
Canada Tuesday then into the eastern Tennessee Valley late Wednesday 
into Thursday. ECMWF model moves precipitation out early Thursday 
while GFS keeps moisture in later in the day. Ridging builds in 
again Thursday night and Friday through Saturday but another weak 
system may have enough moisture for showers in the northeast part of 
the area. Sunday a new frontal system will approach from the west. 
Southerly flow out ahead of it to spread showers and a chance of 
storms to parts of the area in the afternoon. Warmer temperatures 
will return Wednesday night through the end of the period with lows 
in the 50s to lower 60s. Highs will be 70s Thursday then lower to 
mid 80s Friday through the Weekend.

.DISCUSSION...
As the upper low across the Plains continues to migrate east,
drier air aloft looks to advect east across the OH/TN Valleys per
latest WV Imagery. At the surface, the old front continues to
slowly shift east across the Plateau and into the Great Valley
this morning. With that, made a few downward tweaks to pops for
the afternoon hours west of I75 where the window continues to
slowly close. Otherwise, an increasing pop gradient from west/east
will feature chance/likely and even categorical pops (across the
mtns) through the remainder of the day as the surface front is
slow to progress eastward. Lapse rates will continue to improve
through the day as well given the aforementioned dry air advection
aloft and surface heating, thus kept chances for thunderstorms in
the fcst as well, with a few strong ones not to be ruled out. As
for any flooding concerns, 12z FFGs would suggest the most
susceptible areas would be across extreme eastern TN, southwest
VA, and portions of southwest NC given recent rains. No other sig
changes needed at this time.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Satellite and sounding observations show an upper-level longwave
trough across the Central CONUS with a 120kt jet streak across the
Ohio Valley and Great Lakes placing strong upper divergence across
the Southern Appalachians. Surface analysis places a surface low
across NE KY with a trailing cold front across Central KY and
Middle TN. This, along with converging low-level flow ahead of 
the front, is resulting in widespread boundary layer convergence 
and numerous rain showers. Expect to see some additional rain 
showers, and potentially a thunderstorm or two, this morning as a 
small shortwave currently near the MS/AL state line continues 
northeast across our area. As this pushes northeast and the 
frontal boundary continues east this afternoon, we may see some 
breaks in the rain mid-morning before more scattered showers, and 
possibly a thunderstorm, develop during the afternoon along and 
east of the front. Instability for thunderstorms is marginal, so 
do not anticipate much of a risk of strong to severe 
thunderstorms. Any thunderstorms that develop could have some 
gusty winds with some downed trees because of the antecedent wet 
conditions. With already saturated ground and a moist airmass 
ahead of the front, expect to have some locally heavy rain and 
localized flooding across eastern parts of the forecast area along
the mountains and in SW NC. By late afternoon and evening, we 
should begin to see a drying trend from west to east as drier, 
post-frontal air advects into the region.

Should have some scattered light rain showers continue overnight 
behind the front as the primary shortwave amplifies the trough 
across the Southern Appalachians. There will also be enough 
boundary layer moisture, along with NW flow orographic lift, to 
continue some light rain across the higher elevations of the 
mountains through the overnight period and early part of Monday.


.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...
An upper trough/semi-closed low will be moving east across 
northern Ohio and the Great Lakes on Monday. This will leave post-
frontal, northwest flow in place across the forecast area Monday 
into Monday night. Will hold on to some 20- 30 percent rain 
chances across the northern plateau, southwest Virginia, and the 
east Tennessee mountains north of the Smokies early Monday. Rain 
chances will decrease through the day as the upper low continues 
to move off to the east and the atmosphere dries out locally.

This northwest flow regime will lead to well below normal 
temperatures on Monday. Some guidance is holding highs down in the 
low 60s for areas in the northern Tennessee valley and southwest 
Virginia. Sided more towards that end of the guidance spectrum, with 
low to mid 60s instead of upper 60s. Below normal temperatures will 
continue into Tuesday, though a tad warmer than Monday thanks to 
clearing skies and weak high pressure building in from the west. Dry 
weather will be seen Tuesday and for much of Wednesday as well. 
However, rain chances return for late Wednesday into Thursday. A 
strong upper ridge will be in place across the central United States 
by late Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning, with upper 
troughing in place across the east and northwest flow from the upper 
midwest across the southern Appalachians. During the day Wednesday a 
shortwave trough will drop southeast from western Ontario across the 
Great Lakes region. The associated surface low will slide from the 
upper midwest down through the Ohio River Valley at the same time, 
with a warm front stretching into our forecast area by Wednesday 
evening. Isentropic analysis on the 300K surface shows modest ascent 
across this warm front as it moves into the region from the 
northwest, resulting in some light rain showers across the forecast 
area during that time. Given this system will be weakening as it 
arrives, limited rain chances to about 40 percent on Wednesday 
night. It seems likely there will be showers, but confidence in how 
widespread they will be is not high enough to go with anything 
higher than 40 percent or so.

After this system moves through, the strong central US ridge will 
shift east and the southern Appalachian region will likely end up in 
a more typical summertime pattern, with surface high pressure over 
the Carolinas and moist Gulf return flow to our west. Thus mostly 
clear/sunny skies seem on tap, with a notable warm up expected to 
round out the period. In fact, widespread highs in the low 80s seems 
very plausible by Friday, with mid 80s possible on Saturday.

.AVIATION...
Generally poor flight conditions expected tonight and the first
half of Sunday with scattered rain showers, and possibly a few
thunderstorms, affecting the TAF sites. MVFR conditions will be
predominant with some tempo IFR conditions during the heavier
periods of rain. The cold front, and the majority of convection,
shifts east late in the day with generally improving conditions 
to MVFR or VFR at all sites. May have some lower cigs or vis again
tomorrow night depending upon the amount of remaining moisture and
the location of the surface front, but current thought is that dry
and cool air advection will mitigate this potential impact and
result in predominantly VFR conditions late in the period.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Sunday night)... 
A wet pattern continues to highlight the weather across the TN 
Valley and Southern Appalachian region today/tonight as deep swly 
flow prevails, and an old quasistationary surface front slowly 
lifts northward as a warm front. With that, pwats in the 1.5-1.7 
inch range combined with ample convergence along the front will 
promote sct/num showers and thunderstorms in close proximity to 
boundary as it sweeps northward. Likewise, moisture and 
instability in the warm sector south of the front will allow for 
shower/thunderstorm redevelopment later this afternoon or early 
evening (after a period of recovery). Some of these warm sector 
storms could take advantage of steepened lapse rates and thus 
allow for deeper strong convection, while one/two severe storms 
with damaging winds being the primary threats cannot be ruled out.
Through the night, guidance favors additional convective 
development in the warm sector across portions of AL/GA, which 
given swly steering flow, should advect said storms into the 
region. Meanwhile, am also expecting sct convection in closest 
proximity to the front as it moves into southeast KY, northeast 
TN, and southwest VA. All that said, the fcst will feature 
likely/cat pops through the vast majority of the 
evening/overnight. 

On Sunday the pattern will finally evolve such that the closed H5 
low diving southeast across the central/northern Plains will favor 
further height falls across the east CONUS.  With that, the old 
pesky front will finally get driven through the region as a cold 
front, relative to the airmass out ahead that is.  Thus, pops will 
remain elevated in the likely/cat range in the morning ahead of the 
fropa, eventually tapering from west/east throughout the day, 
finally falling below likely levels regionwide by late evening. 

Overall regarding hazardous weather, although a few strong (maybe a 
couple severe) storms cannot be ruled out given sufficient warm 
sector instability and 0-6km shear, think the primary threat is 
heavy rainfall and isolated flash flooding. QPE across the area over 
the last 24 hours has been rather high for some locales, especially 
along the US64 corridor where a few gauges have topped the 4 inch 
mark. An additional 1-2 (locally 3) inches cannot be ruled out for 
some areas, most favorable though over the Plateau and Mountain 
regions.  

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...
Cold front will have finally moved to the east of the forecast area 
by Monday morning. Upper level low and deep trough over the Ohio 
Valley and Tennessee Valley Monday morning will bring in a few more 
light showers across the area as it moves east toward the Mid 
Atlantic States. Rainfall amounts fortunately will be very light. 
GFS and ECMWF wetter than NAM for Monday and with NW flow and clouds 
temperatures will be much colder with highs only in the 60s to lower 
70s and only 50s in the higher elevations. Rainfall amounts will be 
light, expecting only a few hundredths. The skies will finally clear 
Monday night and higher pressure with NW flow will allow lows to 
drop into the 40s and upper 30s at the higher elevations. Tuesday 
will be about the same temperatures but with more sun to help dry 
out. Tuesday night and Wednesday staying dry with another cool 
morning and warming temperatures into the 70s as higher pressure 
moves farther east. A weakening system drops southeast with the NW 
flow late Wednesday into Thursday which will force a few showers and 
possible late afternoon and evening storms Wednesday night and 
Thursday before a more significant and warmer ridge of high pressure 
develops over the Tennessee valley Friday and Saturday. Temperatures 
will warm into the upper 70s to lower 80s by next weekend.

A fairly restrictive taf period ahead as low VFR, MVFR, and IFR is
expected. A quasistationary frontal boundary will slowly lift
northward as a warm front this afternoon, with modest convection
expected, thus tafs features shra/vcsh with some tempos for tsra
this afternoon given peak heating. With that, cigs/visb will favor
low VFR/MVFR conditions. Moving on, tonight the boundary will have
lifted northward, however still in the vicinity with a surface
wave to ride along it. Therefore, additional rounds of shra and
possibly tsra are favored overnight, therefore more vcsh/vcts
mentioned amidst MVFR/IFR cigs/visb to round out the taf cycle.
Winds will remains sly in the 6-10kts range today, calming or

.DISCUSSION...
A quasistationary surface boundary continues to meander across
portions of the TN Valley and Southern Appalachians this morning,
generally along the US64 corridor. With that, the upper vort
impulse responsible for previous/ongoing convection will continue
to lift northeast with time this morning, while another builds
westward across the Midsouth. In association with this Midsouth 
H5 wave, a surface wave will develop and track northeast across 
portions of northern MS/AL through the afternoon hours. The 
passage of this wave will favor increasing sly flow, with the 
above noted surface boundary shifting northward into the I40 
corridor. All said, am expecting continued shra/tsra across the 
currently impacted regions of the US64 corridor for the next few 
hours before the surface front moves north. Additional rainfall 
for these areas could lead to isolated flash flooding, especially 
given current ffg ratios, will monitor closely. As the front 
shifts north this afternoon, so to will the most consistent 
coverage of shra/tsra. However, south of the front the atmosphere 
will destabilize favoring increasing depth of convection, which 
could lead to a few strong/severe storms. As for the fcst itself, 
tweaked pops/wx a bit to align with recent coverage and the above 
mentioned fcst trends over the next 12-18 hours. No other changes 
needed/made at this time.

419 AM EDT Sat May 11 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Ridging remains in place across the Western Atlantic and Caribbean
with longwave troughing across the Western and Central CONUS. 
This is placing our area under deep southwest flow aloft. At the 
surface, current observations show a SW-NE oriented stationary 
boundary across northern portions of the forecast area extending 
southwest along the Cumberland Plateau. Numerous to scattered 
convection continues along and ahead of this front enhanced by an
upper-level shortwave disturbance.

As this shortwave moves northeast of the region this morning,
expect to see convection become less numerous and more scattered
in its wake. The boundary layer will remain very moist, so
scattered convection and bkn to ovc clouds will continue through
the day along and south of the front. Saturday afternoon, a 
strong shortwave and closed low will move southeast across the 
Northern Plains amplifying the eastward moving longwave trough. 
This will result in height falls across the forecast area by the 
afternoon hours with an increase in instability. The RAP, NAM, and
GFS all indicate MLCAPE of about 1000-1500 J/Kg during the 
afternoon, primarily south of Interstate 40. Shear will be 
stronger on Saturday than during the past several days. The upper 
jet shifting east and a strengthening LLJ during the afternoon and
evening hours will increase deep layer and low- level shear. RAP 
forecast soundings indicate generally 30 to 35kt of 0-6km shear 
with 0-1km shear between 15 to 20kt. This will support storm 
organization, especially late in the day as shear continues to 
increase, with the main hazard being damaging wind gusts from the 
strongest thunderstorms. Overall, appears to be a marginal day for
a few severe thunderstorms this afternoon across SE TN and SW NC.

As mentioned, the upper-level jet will shift eastward during the
afternoon placing our area in the right-entrance region for
favored upper divergence and lift Saturday evening through the
night. Shortwave energy approaches with continued height falls and
a surface low will strengthen along the stationary front across
Middle TN and Central KY. This will produce strong lift across the
region through Saturday night into Sunday morning with increasing
chances of rain and embedded thunderstorms. With PW values of 1.5
to 1.7 inch Saturday evening and night, periods of heavy rainfall
be likely with localized flooding possible.


.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...
On Sunday, deep southwesterly flow will be in place across the 
southeast, with a cutoff low/deep trough positioned over the 
Nebraska/Minnesota border, and a shortwave disturbance set to move
through Tennessee. As the day wears on, the upper low will shift 
southeast towards central or southern Illinois, before more 
quickly shifting east to Pennsylvania over the following 24 hours 
or so. At the surface, a cold front will shift east through the 
forecast area Sunday, providing a focus for shower and 
thunderstorm activity and possibly introducing some flash flooding
concerns. More on that a little later.

Some notable cooling aloft will occur on Monday as the upper 
low/trough passes east through the Ohio River Valley. Northwesterly 
flow behind this feature will keep clouds across the forecast area, 
and possibly some lingering showers in the higher elevations through 
Monday evening. Dry but below normal weather will continue from late 
Monday through Wednesday before the next weak front arrives late 
Wednesday night. This front continues to look like moisture supply 
will be a problem so will stick with PoPs of 30% or less for now.

Circling back to Sunday's forecast, flash flooding could be a 
concern depending on how rainfall goes today. While overall moisture 
content will be higher on Saturday, with PWAT values unseasonably 
high, Sunday will introduce higher instability and better dynamics 
to the equation. With organized, stronger convection in place, flash 
flooding could become a concern. Again, it will largely depend on 
the primer event in today's rainfall, but it is something worth 
keeping an eye on. For now, will hold off on any Flash Flood Watch 
products.

.DISCUSSION...

Updated to remove the mention of thunder from the forecast the
rest of tonight, as well as decrease pops over the next couple of
hours to account for a slightly slower arrival of the rain
showers. The latest mesoanalysis shows a couple hundred joules of
ML CAPE over the southern valley with near 1000 J/Kg of surface
based CAPE, but satellite, 1-min GLM lightning flash density, and
radar loops have not suggested any thunderstorms embedded in the
rain showers that are now approaching the southern valley. These
showers are the result of a mid level wave and isentropic lift that
will move northeast across the region later tonight through 
tomorrow morning ahead of a slow moving cold front. Thinking that 
showers will slowly expand across the southern valley from now 
through 04Z then gradually expanding elsewhere after 05Z before 
tapering off from west to east in the 10-15Z timeframe. Have 
slight chance to chance pops through 04Z becoming likely in most 
areas by 05Z then slowly cutting back to chance pops after 10Z. 
Also tweaked hourly temps and dew points through the first half of
the night based on current trends. The rest of the forecast is on
track.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
Upper troughing out west combined with ridging over the GOM 
continues to promote deep swly flow aloft across the southeast 
CONUS.  At the surface, a slow moving cold front slides east across 
portions of KY/TN, eventually to move into the TN Valley tonight. 
Out ahead, modest destabilization thanks to ample daytime heating 
will favor iso/sct showers and thunderstorms this afternoon, 
generally with the highest chances across the mountains and plateau. 
Sounding profiles would suggest favorable lapse rates and mid level 
cape for some small hail with the tallest storms, as well as 
downburst winds given inverted V llv profiles.

Meanwhile, a weak upper vort impulse centered over the Lower MS 
Valley will slide northeast, with a weak surface wave to 
develop/advect northeast along the aforementioned surface front 
tonight.  With that, profiles will moisten substantially with pwats 
approaching 1.6-1.7 inches.  Thus, pops will ramp up from the 
southwest overnight tonight, with likely/cat levels favored across 
much of the area by morning. Moving forward, the weak H5 wave will 
advect northeast through late morning, which should allow for some 
clearing and thus heating. Deep layer shear in the 30-40kt range 
combined with this heating/instability should favor convection into 
the afternoon hours, especially along/south of the boundary which 
should be laid in a southwest to northeast orientation across the TN 
Valley.  Thus, SPC has placed these areas in the marginal risk for 
severe thunderstorms with damaging winds and large hail being the 
primary threats.  Lastly, given the presence of the boundary and 
continually moist profiles, any training of cells could yield 
moderate/heavy rainfall and thus isolated flash flooding concerns 
Saturday. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
A wet pattern will continue Saturday night and Sunday then becoming 
cooler and drier as high pressure builds in. Saturday night a moist 
southwesterly flow will continue as stationary front over or near 
the east Tennessee Valley remains close by. Low pressure is expected 
to move along the front with showers and a few storms continuing 
along and ahead of the front through the evening then decreasing 
after midnight as the area of low pressure moves northeast toward 
the central Appalachians. The front will move only slowly east and
not get another push until Sunday as an upper trough which may 
close off moves into the Upper Mississippi Valley towards the 
Great Lakes. Mid level winds will increase to 40-50 knots 
enhancing the deep- layer shear per the Storm Prediction Center 
Outlook. The eastern half of the area could see some strong storms
with possible damaging winds just ahead of the cold front. 
Another inch of rain or more is possible Sunday. With Saturdays 
rainfall isolated flooding may occur in the eastern mountains of 
Tennessee where total rainfall amounts of 3 to 4 inches are 
possible from tonight through Sunday. Highs Sunday will stay 
cooler in the upper 60s to mid 70s due to clouds and rainfall. The
upper low then shifts east into the eastern Great Lakes Monday. 
Lingering showers Sunday night and Monday morning before drier air
moves in. Monday and Tuesday high pressure with much cooler 
temperatures as flow becomes northwest. Below normal temperatures 
in the 60s to lower 70s are expected with lows at night in the 
40s. The upper lows influence finally shifts out of the way by 
Wednesday with warming temperatures back to the 70s through 
Friday. A weak little system in NW flow will bring in a few 
showers Thursday.

National Weather Service Morristown TN
359 AM EDT Fri May 10 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Observations show the NE/SW oriented surface cold front currently
located across West TN and Central KY. This front will continue to
move southeast this morning and become stalled out across the
forecast area this afternoon. With winds becoming parallel to the
front this afternoon, the front will have very little movement as
it remains across the region. There is a lot of uncertainty in 
the amount of instability that will be realized this afternoon. 
NAM forecast soundings show some areas of MLCAPE between 1000-1500
J/Kg ahead of the front this afternoon, but the RAP is much lower
with generally 500 J/Kg or less. The main difference appears to 
be the degree of boundary layer moisture that each model is 
indicating with the RAP noticeably drier than the NAM and GFS. 
Current model initializations have the NAM and GFS more closely 
aligned with current observations, and based on the diurnal trend 
in dew points yesterday, lean more toward the NAM and GFS 
instability parameters for Friday afternoon. Still, there will be 
limited widespread lift with primary jet dynamics and the surface
low far to our north across the Great Lakes and Canada. Current 
thinking is that a few scattered thunderstorms could become 
strong to severe based on the forecast instability, but do not 
expect widespread convection. Any strong to severe convection
would have strong wind gusts and up to Quarter size hail as the
primary hazards based on the forecast instability, marginal 0-6km
shear (20 to 30 kt) for storm organization, and poor low-level 
0-1km shear values (less than 10 kt). Most of the day should be 
dry for most locations. Remained near guidance for max 
temperatures, but they could be a couple degrees higher in spots
that see breaks in cloud cover through the day.

Models are in good agreement with bringing a shortwave northeast
across MS, northern AL, and across East TN. This will result in
good PVA and height falls between 0z and 06z. With this increasing
lift, expect to see an increase in rain showers, and possibly a
few thunderstorms, tonight through daybreak Saturday. With PW
values near the 95th percentile, some locally heavy rainfall is
expected with convection.


.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...
This weekend will be rainy and stormy across the forecast area as
the region lies beneath a persistent southwest flow regime, with 
a good tap on Gulf moisture and a cold front helping to focus 
showers and thunderstorms over the area.

In the upper levels a cutoff low will have established a home off 
the southern California coast by daybreak Saturday morning, with 
another trough diving southeast across the northern plains. By 
Sunday morning the northern plains trough will have also cutoff from 
the polar jet over the upper midwest, while the SoCal cutoff low 
shifts eastward into northern Mexico. Meanwhile at the surface, a 
cold front will have settled into the TN Valley or perhaps as far 
east as the spine of the Appalachians by Saturday morning. With a 
persistent southwesterly flow regime at the mid and upper levels, 
and a quasi-stationary front laid out across the forecast area, rain 
seems inevitable and possibly heavy at that. Models show a nice 
plume of high PWAT air surging northeast into the region on Saturday 
as the first wave of showers and embedded thunderstorms arrive. Will 
have to watch for flooding issues on Saturday as some guidance shows 
PWAT values similar to those you would see in June or July, 
considerably higher than normal values for May. Additionally, model 
sounding show that much of the instability will be located beneath 
the hail growth region, lending itself to more efficient warm rain 
processes and increasing the likelihood of heavy rains. 

The area will likely see a bit of a lull Saturday night before the 
next wave of showers and thunderstorms arrives on Sunday. PWAT 
values are tad lower on Sunday, largely thanks to some mid level 
drying. However instability will be higher and access to Gulf 
moisture doesn't exactly shut off. Thus heavy rains will be possible 
again on Sunday, with the added possibility of a few strong storms. 
Better threats for severe storms will be present east of the 
Appalachians, but would not be surprised to see some strong storms 
in the eastern parts of the CWA.

For Monday onward, the midwest cutoff low will slowly shift east 
with time, finally moving off the northeastern seaboard by Tue 
afternoon. Showers will likely linger in the mountains and southwest 
Virginia until late Monday before moisture becomes scarce enough to 
warrant dismissing rain chances altogether. Monday and Tuesday 
nights will be cool, with lows dipping back into the 40s for most 
locations. Dry weather will also be seen for Tuesday.

Wednesday and Thursday are fairly uncertain at this point, with 
large discrepancies noted between models. Will favor a warming 
trend, with slight chances for rainfall entering the forecast again 
for Wednesday night and Thursday for now.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
As of 2:45pm EDT a line of storms is moving across AL/TN. Storms 
along this line are tapping into a marginal amount of instability, 
generally less than 500 J/kg. But the shear is what's keeping these 
storms stronger as they move across the area. Mesoanalysis shows a 
maxima of around 50 knots of 0-6km shear across Middle Tennessee 
down towards northern Alabama, and 20-30 knots of of 0-1km shear. 
Mid to low level jet across From Eastern Arkansas towards Kentucky 
is helping to bring this shear towards our area. As of this writing 
these storms are continuing to weaken as they head east away from 
the jet and continue to move into a more unfavorable environment. 
However, we can't rule out the possibilty of one of the storms (or a 
segment along a line) increasing in intensity across Southeast 
Tennessee. Biggest threat with any strong storm would be gusty 
straight-line winds...Can't rule out the chance for an isolated 
tornado, but the threat is low. Expect convection to continue 
through the rest of the afternoon hours, but as sunset gets closer 
the coverage of storms should quickly decrease.

Cold front that is trying to push across Middle/Western Tennessee 
begins to slow down overnight as the driving force of the upper 
level trough moves NE of the Great Lakes Region. Overnight we should 
continue to dry out from storms this afternoon and most of the area 
should be precipitation free as we get close to sunrise with no 
mid/upper level lift and the front becoming quasi-stationary. 
Overnight lows will be a few degrees cooler tonight versus last 
night but cloudy skies will help keep temperatures mild. Possibility 
of patchy fog exists over locations that bouts of heavy rain this 
afternoon, but cloudy skies will likely inhibit dense fog formation.

With the front still over the area come Friday morning we will see 
chances of showers and thunderstorms once again on the rise. A 
shortwave will be moving through north of the area bringing some 
synoptic support for storms to fire off. During the earlier parts of 
the day we'll see MLCAPE values of around 1000 J/kg for storms to 
tap into. This time however the shear looks much lower as mid/low 
level winds remain much lighter with the stronger winds off to the 
north with forecast soundings indicating values of around 25 knots 
(0-6km) and 10 knots (0-1km) likely. Biggest threats this day will 
be the possibilty of isolated flooding, especially if a particular 
location gets a round of heavy rain Thursday and Friday. Can't rule 
out isolated strong wind gusts as well, but believe potential 
flooding to be the bigger threat.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
Models continue to agree on a wet period for Friday night through
the weekend, although still differences in the details. The 
frontal boundary will meander a bit for the Friday night through 
Saturday period, but will stay around before finally moving 
through as a cold front Sunday/Sunday night. A couple of short 
waves ejecting out ahead of the main upper trough will enhance 
shower and thunderstorm activity at times, although exact timing 
is still unclear. PW values will be high, in excess of 1.5 inches 
at times, and localized flooding is still a threat. Will keep 
mention of this threat in the HWO. Models have been inconsistent 
on how much low level shear will be present and convective energy 
may be limited depending on cloud cover and coverage of 
precipitation, but still appears to be some threat threat of 
strong to severe storms so will keep this in the HWO as well for 
Saturday. 

There may be a few lingering showers around northern areas on Monday 
as the axis of the upper trough moves across, but drier and cooler 
air will be moving in early in the week.  High pressure will keep 
things dry for Tuesday and Wednesday, then another cold front may be 
moving in by Thursday.  Right now moisture looks limited with this 
front, so will carry only low PoPs for some showers and 
thunderstorms

Line of storms moving across East TN this afternoon/evening will

likely to far north for thunderstorms to make it, but can't
totally rule out a rouge strike of lightning in NE Tennessee this
evening. Once storms move through we may see fog form overnight if
an airport gets decent rain and cooling. But clouds overnight will
try to inhibit fog formation. We'll have a better understanding if
fog will form once storms have moved through the airport.

.DISCUSSION...
For the morning update some changes to PoP portions of the
forecast to try and better reflect the current radar trends.
Slightly increasing precip chances a couple of hours early along
the Cumberland Plateau and southward as showers ahead of the main
line are finally making their way into the forecast area.
Otherwise only a few minor tweaks were made to some hourly
temperature grids. Below is the still valid AFD from the morning
update...

An amplified upper level pattern is in place across the CONUS with 
a deep trough along the western CONUS and a ridge that extends 
from the Carolina Coast northwards into the eastern Great Lakes. 
This puts the ridge axis to the east of the forecast area with 
southwesterly flow aloft. Several shortwave troughs will rotate 
through the longwave trough. Two of these shortwave troughs will 
impact the forecast area this morning and later this afternoon. 
The first is currently moving into the Tennessee River Valley and 
the second back to the southwest near the ARKLATEX. At the 
surface, high pressure extends along the Atlantic Seaboard with a 
surface low centered near the IA/IL line. A cold front extends 
southward from this low into the southern Plains. 

Despite the low-level jet increasing into the 20-35 kt range, some 
locations in sheltered valleys have gone calm. With the rain 
yesterday along the mountains and foothills, expect there will be 
some patchy fog this morning, especially for areas that received 
rainfall yesterday and near area lakes and rivers. Any fog that 
forms this morning will quickly dissipate as southerly winds in 
the 10-15 mph range become established shortly after sunrise. 

The main shortwave trough and area of showers and storms that will 
affect the area is currently located across the ARKLATEX. Models 
have the shortwave ejecting to the northeast into the Tennessee Valley 
by this afternoon. IR satellite imagery and latest trends suggest
that there will be increasing cloud cover today that will limit 
SBCAPE values. The low level jet will increase into the 30-40 kt 
range but models suggest the 40-50 kt jet axis will pass to the 
north and west. Additionally, as noted above, mid-level lapse 
rates are rather weak and even the usually aggressive NAM only 
indicates around 500 J/Kg of SBCAPE across the Plateau later this 
afternoon. Overall, not impressed with the potential for strong to
severe storms. For now, expect maybe a stronger storm or two with
gusty winds and small hail being the main threats with the best 
chance for a strong storm along the Plateau Temperatures will be a
bit cooler today with lower heights moving in, increasing cloud 
cover and precipitation chances. Highs today will be in the upper 
70s to low 80s.

The cold front approaching from the west will begin to slow tonight 
as it takes on more of a NE to SW orientation as the main upper 
level trough ejects to the northeast into the Great Lakes. A 
decrease in coverage is forecast tonight with no real synoptic lift 
with the trough well to the north. However, cannot rule out a few 
scattered showers and maybe a storm or two with some low level 
convergence ahead of the approaching surface boundary. Another mild 
night is forecast with lows in the low to mid 60s.

Current radar imagery indicates a line of showers moving to the 
northeast across Middle TN and N AL. Models are really struggling 
with this area of showers with most indicating that the showers 
should have already dissipated. The precipitation is moving into a 
more stable and drier airmass as the showers move further to the 
northeast. The shortwave trough is also quickly exiting to the 
northeast with the combination of these factors expect a weakening 
trend this morning but will introduce some 20-40 PoPs across 
southwestern portions of the forecast area.

scattered showers and maybe a storm or two with some low level 
convergence ahead of the approaching surface boundary. Another mild 
night is forecast with lows in the low to mid 60s.


.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...

Agreement continues to favor an active weather pattern for our 
region through the weekend along a stationary boundary. A strong 
shortwave will be moving across the eastern Great Lakes on Friday 
with an occluding surface low across Ontario. The better dynamics, 
including the upper jet and LLJ, will remain far north of our 
forecast area on Friday with flow becoming parallel to the 
approaching cold front as it slows down and begins to stall. This 
SW/NE oriented front is expected to be located across our forecast 
area Friday afternoon during peak heating hours. NAM and GFS 
forecast soundings are both showing MLCAPE approaching 2000 J/Kg, 
steep low-level lapse rates, steepening mid-level lapse rates, and 
dry mid-levels. As mentioned, main dynamics remain to the north, so 
shear is relatively weak, especially in the low-levels with the lack 
of a strong LLJ. This will result in deep layer shear between 20 to 
30kt which will at least support organized convection. Low level 0-
1km shear is very marginal, less than 10 kt, and effective SRH less 
than 50 m2s2. This points to at least a low, marginal risk of severe 
thunderstorms on Friday afternoon along and ahead of the front. 
Based on the synoptic setup and forecast severe parameters, the 
primary hazards would be damaging winds and hail with the strongest 
thunderstorms. However, it is important to realize that this setup 
is based on some breaks in cloud cover and strong daytime heating 
ahead of the cold front. If convective debris from earlier activity 
prevents afternoon instability from reaching the nearly 2000 J/Kg 
that models are indicating at this time, the severe threat would be 
greatly limited. In addition, PW values will be near the 90th 
percentile Friday afternoon, so a few locally heavy downpours with 
convection will be possible.

The front will stall across the region on Saturday with convection 
remaining possible along and south of the boundary. The big question 
will be exactly where it stalls. The 0z GFS and 0z ECMWF are in poor 
agreement for Saturday. The ECMWF is more progressive with the 
trough across the center of the country on Saturday afternoon with a 
developing surface low and strengthening SW flow. This would bring 
the stationary front quickly north as a warm front while the GFS is 
slower and drier. Because of these differences, higher uncertainty 
exists to the coverage and timing of precipitation on Saturday. For 
Saturday night, guidance is in better agreement with a shortwave 
dropping south toward the Ohio Valley with a surface low moving 
northeast from the lower Mississippi Valley through the Tennessee 
Valley. The best synoptic lift is expected with this system from 
late Saturday night and during the day on Sunday. The most 
widespread and heaviest precipitation is forecast on Sunday 
resulting in a wet Mother's Day across the area. PW values of 1.5 to 
1.7 inch will be around the 95th percentile. In addition to 
saturated forecast soundings and a warm cloud layer depth between 
10k to 11k ft, it will be a favorable setup for some locally heavy 
rainfall. 

Front moves east of the region by Sunday night with drier air and 
subsidence moving in during the day on Monday. NW flow and residual 
low-level moisture may produce some light upslope rain showers 
across the mountains, but most locations should remain mostly dry on 
Monday. Surface high pressure builds in on Tuesday and Wednesday 
with dry weather across the region. The ECMWF and Canadian show a 
weak system approaching the area Wednesday night, but there is still 
significant uncertainty with timing of this a week from now. With 
cooler NW flow and troughing across the East Coast, temperatures 
should be near or slightly below normal.

.DISCUSSION...
The forecast is generally on track and only a few small tweaks 
will be made to remove PoPs for the rest of the night. As
expected, convection has died with the loss of heating, and those
areas that did receive rain could see some fog, while winds 
staying just above calm in spots should prevent widespread dense 
fog. Will add a mention of patchy fog across the area.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Tomorrow)...
Ridge continues to shift to the east today, and slightly increased 
heights aloft means temperatures remain on track to be just a couple 
of degrees warmer today compared to yesterday. Diurnally driven 
storms are firing across the higher terrain, mostly in North 
Carolina/Virginia. Possibility of a stray storm being able to slide 
down the west side of the mountains, but most of the convection 
today should stay on the east side and once the sun sets storms 
should die down fairly quickly.

Overnight tonight should be a bit warmer compared to last night as 
warmer air is being brought in from the south ahead of the 
approaching front. While this will increase the dew points overnight 
the winds look to slightly increase as well which should limit fog 
development.

During the early daytime hours on Thursday most of the Eastern 
Tennessee Valley should actually remain relatively dry as the front 
tries to makes it's way through Western/Middle Tennessee. Front and 
associated precipitation will begin to move into the Cumberland 
Plateau down towards Chattanooga during the afternoon hours, with 
most of the storms likely not making it into the Eastern Valley 
until the evening hours.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...The period will 
start off rather active, but some drying is expected after the 
weekend. Models in decent agreement overall although there remain 
differences in the details, and forecast confidence is about 
average for this time of year. An approaching cold front will move
into the area from the west and northwest Thursday night before 
stalling out, and this front will stick around through the 
weekend. Timing better rounds of showers/thunderstorms is still 
difficult as there will a couple of mid/upper level short waves 
interacting with the front. PW values are forecast to be in excess
of 1.5 inches during the weekend, and heavy rainfall/localized 
flooding still looks to be a possibilty so will keep the mention 
in the HWO. Will also keep a mention of possible strong to severe 
storms Friday and/or Saturday, although severe threat looks 
limited as cloud cover should help to limit instability.

The front is forecast to move east of the area Sunday night, with 
drier air moving in. A few showers may linger Monday morning 
northeast areas, otherwise it should be precip free through at least 
Tuesday. Enough moisture may return by Wednesday for some isolated 
convection.  Temperatures will be lower Monday behind the front then 
a gradual warming trend is expected Tuesday and Wednesday.

.DISCUSSION...
Minor tweaks made to a few temperature forecasts through early
this afternoon otherwise forecast is still relatively unchanged.
Below is the still valid AFD from this morning...

The upper level ridge axis bisects the forecast area stretching 
northward into the Great Lakes region with a trough to the west 
across the Desert Southwest moving into the southern Plains. At 
the surface, high pressure is centered to the east of the area 
just off the Mid-Atlantic Coast with surface low center near the 
Texas Panhandle. IR satellite imagery and observations indicate 
clear conditions across most of the area early this morning with a
few clouds along the higher elevation along the TN/NC line. 
Additionally, winds are light with decoupling tonight. Due to 
this, temperatures have cooled a bit more than previously forecast
with decent radiational cooling conditions. Therefore, expect 
there could be some patchy fog early this morning with low 
dewpoint depressions and high relative humidity values already 
being observed. Any fog that forms should quickly dissipate after 
sunrise

The ridge axis will slowly shift to the east today with
southwesterly flow aloft forecast by this afternoon. Warm air 
advection will continue at 850 mb with elevated heights aloft. 
This combination will lead to high temperatures being a few 
degrees warmer than yesterday. Most locations will climb into the 
low to mid 80s. Southerly flow in the low levels will lead to 
upslope flow along the NC side of the mountains. This upslope flow
will lead to a few showers/storms later this afternoon. PW values
are a bit higher than yesterday thanks to the low level 
temperatures and moisture advection. PW values will range from the
1.0-1.2 inches this afternoon. These values are near the 60th-
75th percentiles. Due to this, expect more activity will spill 
over into the TN side of the mountains this afternoon and have 
around 20-40 PoPs along the TN/NC line. This activity will once 
again be diurnally driven with lack of any synoptic lifting 
mechanism and should come to an end around sunset. 

Another mild night is forecast tonight as the surface low and cold
front to the west race across the Great Plains. Low level
southerly flow will increase in response to the tightening
pressure gradient and expect winds will remain somewhat elevated
overnight in the 5-15 mph range. Any widespread precipitation
chances with the system approaching from the west will occur in
the long-term forecast period. Overnight lows will be in the 60s
for most locations.

chances with the system approaching from the west will occur in
the long-term forecast period. Overnight lows will be in the 60s
for most locations.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...

The extended continues to appear active through the weekend with a 
frontal boundary across the region. With ridging across the East 
Coast, most of Thursday is expected to be dry and relatively nice 
with an increase in mid to high level cloud cover. Southerly flow 
will provide some downsloping across the foothills with warmer 
temperatures and clearer conditions across these areas and Northeast 
Tennessee for much of Thursday.

On Thursday afternoon, upper-level ridging weakens as PVA from 
shortwaves results in height falls across the Tennessee Valley. A 
stronger northern shortwave will be moving southeast into the Great 
Lakes with a strengthening upper jet and surface low. The trailing 
cold front from this low will move eastward toward our area Thursday 
night and Friday, but will stall out as the surface low becomes 
occluded over Quebec. This will bring periods of unsettled weather 
across our forecast area through Sunday night. However, models have 
been trending with a stronger ridge across the East Coast which 
would result in slower arrival of precipitation late Thursday and 
Thursday night as well as lower PoPs during this time.

Abundant moisture will still be present ahead of the cold front. The 
GFS, NAEFS, and ECMWF continue to show PW values ahead of this 
frontal boundary in the 1.5 to 1.8 inch range which is greater than 
the 90th percentile through the weekend. With warm cloud layer depth 
of near or greater than 10k ft and low CAPE with saturated forecast 
soundings, it continues to look like a good setup for convective 
heavy rainfall and localized flooding concerns. It's not a prolonged 
heavy rain event, but the setup will favor heavy downpours with the 
convection that develops.

Confidence continues to increase in the weekend forecast with good 
agreement among guidance. At this point, Saturday appears to be the 
driest day over the weekend, but will still have some convection 
develop during the afternoon peak heating along and to the south of 
the surface boundary. A strong shortwave moving south from Manitoba 
into the Northern Plains on Saturday will bring a surface low and 
reinforcing cold front toward our area on Sunday. A developing 
surface low will move northeast along the front through the 
Tennessee Valley bringing the chance of heavy rainfall. At this 
time, Sunday continues to look like our wettest day and the day with 
the highest potential for locally heavy rainfall. As the front moves 
southeast of the area on Sunday night and Monday morning, drier air 
and subsidence moves in on Monday afternoon. With troughing across 
the region this weekend as well as abundant cloud cover and 
precipitation, expect temperatures to be mainly near or slightly 
below normal.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)... 

High pressure will continue its grip on the area through 
Wednesday. Only isolated evening convection is expected through 
sundown this evening, but will mostly stay over the NC side of 
the state line. Southerly flow on Wednesday will assist with 
upslope convection over the mountains and maybe the southern 
Plateau during the afternoon.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday Night through Tuesday)... 

Another few periods of mostly quiet weather to begin the long 
term portion of the forecast before a more wet pattern sets up at 
the end of the work week. We'll be on the west side of the ridge 
Wednesday night meaning most locations will remain dry with slight
precipitation along the higher elevations of the mountains. 

Ridge continues to shift to the east on Thursday as shortwave ripple 
rides around the west side of the ridge. This will combine with 
surface low moving across the Great Lakes region and dragging a cold 
front behind it. In addition a strengthening low level jet will 
develop across Western/Middle Tennessee on Thursday. Front will be 
the focus for the best chances of showers and thunderstorms. 
Currently forecast models are holding off the front from moving into 
the Cumberland Plateau until late Thursday afternoon/Thursday 
evening. After the front finally moves into the Eastern Tennessee 
Valley it loses it's driving mechanisms and stalls out in the 
region. This means that it should act as a focus for shower and 
thunderstorm activity through the end of the work week and into the 
weekend. As this system moves through there will be abundant 
moisture to work with forecast PWAT values indicating 1.5+ inches, 
which puts us into the 90th+ percentile, meaning that there will 
likely be abundant rainfall with these storms. MLCAPE of 1000+ J/kg 
on Thursday/Friday means that there will be plenty of energy for 
these storms to tap into. The shear will remain relatively low with 
most locations expected to see less than 30 knots of 0-6km. The 
better severe weather environment will be further to the west closer 
to the stronger low level jet. Can't rule out severe weather either 
of these days, but for now the biggest concern will be heavy rain 
and localized flooding, especially if a certain locations gets 1 or 
2 heavy producing storms to move over the same location.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

The upper level pattern is characterized by a ridge that stretches 
from the Lower Mississippi River Valley northwestward into the Great 
Plains with a trough across the Desert Southwest. Closer to home, 
the flow is rather zonal across the area. At the surface, high 
pressure is centered across the Mid-Atlantic with an SW to NE 
oriented surface boundary stretching from the southern Plains into 
the eastern Great Lakes. PW values currently run from around 0.6-0.8 
inches. These values are near the 25 th percentile for early May. 
Dewpoints are a few degrees lower than the last few nights and do 
not anticipate any widespread fog formation this morning but there 
could be a few areas of patchy fog, especially near area lakes and 
rivers. 

Upper level heights will continue to increase today as the ridge 
builds in from the west. This will lead to highs around 3-5 degrees 
warmer than yesterday. Highs will be in the upper 70s to mid 80s for 
most locations. Most areas will remain dry today but there is a 
small chance for a few isolated to scattered showers/storms across 
the higher elevations along the TN/NC line. Upslope flow will 
develop with the surface high located across the Mid-Atlantic, the 
focus for this upslope will be on the NC side of the mountains, but 
have included 20-30 PoPs for those locations right along the TN/NC 
line later this afternoon. This activity should be diurnally driven 
with precipitation chances coming to an end around sunset. Lee 
cyclogenesis takes place later today into tonight as the trough to 
the west moves across the Rocky Mountains. Winds at 850mb, will 
shift around to the south with strong warm air advection forecast 
tonight. Lows will be mild in the mid 50s to low 60s.


.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...

There will be an active weather pattern during the extended with the 
mid-level ridge axis shifting east on Wednesday afternoon and 
southwest flow advecting a warm, moist airmass across the Tennessee 
Valley. Could have a few showers or thunderstorms on Wednesday 
afternoon, mainly across the higher elevations as well as the 
southern valley where moisture will be highest.

On Thursday afternoon, upper-level ridging weakens further as PVA 
from shortwaves results in height falls across the Tennessee Valley. 
A stronger northern shortwave will be moving southeast into the 
Great Lakes with a strengthening upper jet and surface low. The 
trailing cold front from this low will move eastward toward our area 
Thursday night and Friday, but will stall out as the surface low 
becomes occluded over Quebec. This will bring periods of unsettled 
weather across our forecast area through Sunday night. The GFS, 
NAEFS, and ECMWF show PW values ahead of this frontal boundary in 
the 1.6 to 1.8 inch range which is between the 95th and 99th 
percentile. Confidence in periods of heavy rainfall that may lead to 
localized flooding is increasing late week through the weekend. The 
severe weather threat is low, but with 0-6km shear up to about 30kt 
and MLCAPE ranging from 1000 to 2000 J/Kg on Thursday evening and 
Friday evening, expect some organized convection that could produce 
some stronger wind gusts. The lack of a well-defined, strong LLJ 
with the main surface low and upper-jet located far to the north 
will limit low-level shear and helicity values across our area, and 
will likely limit some of the severe weather potential. Overall, the 
primary weather hazard late week through the weekend continues to be 
heavy rainfall and localized flooding.

Confidence has increased in the weekend forecast as the operational 
GFS has come into better agreement with its ensembles and the ECMWF. 
At this point, Saturday appears to be the driest day over the 
weekend, but will still have some convection develop during the 
afternoon peak heating along and to the south of the surface 
boundary. A strong shortwave moving south from Manitoba into the 
Northern Plains on Saturday will bring a surface low and reinforcing 
cold front. This front will continue southeast on Saturday night and 
approach the Tennessee Valley on Sunday. With the approaching trough 
and surface cold front, widespread lift with rain and thunderstorms 
is expected on Sunday. As this front passes southeast of the area 
Sunday night and Monday, a drying trend is expected to begin the 
next work week. With troughing setting up across the region, 
temperatures will be cooler, near or slightly below normal, this 
upcoming weekend into early next week.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...Overall...expect a rather
quiet and benign short term. Surface high pressure will remain the
dominant weather feature tonight and Tuesday. There will be a
minor short wave riding through the upper flow tonight.
However...as dry air continues to filter in and the influence of
the surface high... the best the wave is expected to do will be so
pull in a scattered band of mid to high level clouds. The lower
dew points will also inhibit fog formation tonight. Any fog that
does develop should be quite localized and patchy. On
Tuesday...weak riding aloft will allow for another dry day with
high temperatures reaching into the lower to mid 80s across many
valley locations. As tonight's weak wave moves east of the
area...models do hint at some isolated convection developing in
the afteroon across higher elevations. However...this activity
appears to be confined to area east of the TN/NC border and and
this time is not expected to affect the local forecast area.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Monday)...
Fairly active pattern Wednesday through Monday with an upper ridge 
over the region for Wednesday with a series of upper troughs moving 
across the eastern half of the nation for Thursday through Monday. 
Models are in fairly good agreement for Thursday and Friday, but 
differ greatly Saturday night and Sunday. The ECMWF has a much 
stronger phasing of northern and southern stream troughs producing a 
stronger system.  Lets get to the particulars.

For Tuesday night and Wednesday, upper ridging will keep most 
location dry except for the higher elevations, such as the far east 
Tennessee Mountains and Plateau. Will continue with a low chance 
afternoon/evening PoPs there. A warm day as southerly winds will be 
increasing as pressure gradients tighten.

For Thursday, upper ridge breaks down with increasing jet dynamics 
and pre-frontal surface trough producing scattered to numerous 
showers and afternoon thunderstorms. Model soundings show increase 
in instability and moisture, but limited threat for severe. Main 
concern will be some locally heavy rains over the southern half of 
the valley where jet dynamics best.

For Friday, frontal boundary will move across the region. High 
chance to likely showers. Instability is limited with mainly showers 
and possibly an embedded thunder.

For Saturday, models begin to differ with the ECMWF hanging front up 
across the Tennessee Valley while the GFS takes the boundary south 
of the area. Will maintain chances of showers and embedded storms.

For Sunday, ECMWF and GFS differ greatly with the ECMWF with a 
stronger phased system. Will continue with high chance to likely 
showers and thunderstorms. Low confidence on how this storm system 
plays out. Drier weather returns for Monday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A mostly clear sky across the forecast area early this morning. 
Some lower clouds remain over the northeast half of the area. 
Temperatures have dropped into the 50s with fog forming this hour 
at several sites across east Tennessee, southwest Virginia and 
southwest North Carolina. High clouds from on-going convection in
eastern OK are streaming from AR into West Tennessee at this hour
and should spread into the forecast area later this morning. This
my reverse fog formation in a few hours but with visibilities 
dropping right now will issue a Special Weather Statement in the 
next hour for patchy dense fog for the next 6 hours or until mid 
morning. High pressure will provide mostly sunny skies after the 
fog burns off but some high cloudiness from convection to the west
may affect the brightness at times today. Warmer temperatures 
will be felt with highs in the upper 70s to lower 80s...about 5 
degrees above normal. Tonight more mostly clear skies as high 
pressure is centered nearly overhead of the southern Appalachians.
Lows tonight should be slightly cooler in the upper 40s to mid 
50s. With drier air mass fog will likely be more localized.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...
Strong mid-level ridging will keep subsidence and very dry air over 
the forecast area on Tuesday with a mostly clear sky. Some models 
are attempting to develop weak convection across the mountains, but 
believe this would be very limited with the amount of dry air 
entrainment any convective updraft would have to overcome. With the 
ridging and clear skies, temperatures should be warm and near 7-10 
degrees above normal. By Wednesday afternoon, ridging is expected to 
weaken and the ridge axis will shift to our east with moist 
southwesterly flow through the low and mid-levels of the atmosphere. 
With higher moisture, expect at least slight chance/chance PoPs 
during the late afternoon hours, especially across the higher 
elevations.

On Thursday, shortwave energy originating from the longwave trough 
across the Western CONUS will lead to PVA and height falls across 
the forecast area. A surface low will also track northeast from the 
Great Plains to the Great Lakes by Thursday night with a trailing 
cold front. The NAEFS and ECMWF show PW values near 1.5 to 1.7 
inches late Thursday, which is near the 95th percentile. While this 
would seem to favor a heavy rain and localized flooding threat, 
there are a few mitigating factors that could limit overall QPF. 
First, the surface low and best forcing is north of the region. In 
addition, the low will be beginning the occlusion process late 
Thursday night with the cold front forward motion slowing. In this 
more weakly forced environment, widespread heavy convection appears 
less likely. The GFS has been consistent with showing convection to 
our south limiting convection further north across our area, and 
this scenario is definitely possible. Regardless, there will be 
enough moisture in the atmosphere for some heavier downpours and at 
least localized flooding with thunderstorms. Furthermore, with the 
surface low and best dynamics north of the area, the overall severe 
threat appears marginal.

Models continue to diverge into the weekend with the GFS taking the 
cold front southeast of our area and keeping us drier with the ECMWF 
and Canadian favoring a wetter pattern as a surface low develops 
over Texas and tracks northeastward across the Tennessee Valley. 
While the GFS remains dry, the GEFS mean is wetter and is more 
similar to the operational ECMWF and Canadian solutions. For this 
reason, will lean toward the GEFS/ECMWF solution for the weekend. As 
troughing develops over the Eastern CONUS, expect temperatures to be 
near or below normal next weekend into the early part of the next 
work week.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast on track this evening. Clouds still holding
in across several areas as we remain under weak northerly flow in
the lower levels. Still some light drizzle/showers ongoing across
the highest peaks of the eastern mountains as upslope flow helps
to squeeze out the last bit of remain moisture. The low levels 
remain semi-saturated through the night and will help to keep 
clouds in for some. Areas that see breaks in the clouds will 
likely see patchy fog with some patchy dense fog also possible.

due to the clouds so made adjustments but don't expect overnight 
lows to change. Also made some hourly POP edits across the

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

The short term synoptic outlook for this afternoon begins with a 
surface low off to the northeast that will continue to track 
offshore. Zonal flow aloft will help to speed the low pressure 
centers departure and lead to less active synoptic weather for the 
early week. Pressure will increase as a weak ridge off to the west 
builds into the southern Appalachians helping to clear out the 
lingering rain by late this afternoon. Saturated atmospheric 
profiles, along with northwesterly flow will lead to some persistent 
showers for the eastern Tennessee mountains due to orographic 
lifting.

Mid level dry air will continue to move in later this afternoon 
which will help to slowly clear out the mid level clouds. Still 
mostly scattered to broken skies expected overnight as the lower 
levels will remain saturated. Given plenty of residual moisture in 
the PBL patchy fog formation is expected across the region early 
tomorrow morning. Skies will clear out on Monday high pressure 
continues to build into the region.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...

The extended will begin 
in a rather quiet weather pattern.  Surface high pressure will be in 
control with a weak ridge building in aloft.  As a result...expect 
dry conditions and warm afternoon highs generally in the 80s for 
Monday and Tuesday.  Wednesday will be a transition day as the 
surface high and upper ridge shift east...allowing the approach of 
the first weather system of the extended.  Ahead of this low 
pressure system...southerly flow will increase low level moisture 
and a minor impulse in the upper flow will produce a chance of 
convection across the region during the Wednesday afternoon/evening 
time frame.  The cold front will push in on Thursday.  At this 
point...deep moisture will be in place and with significant 
additional moisture accompanying the front...expect to see a well 
organized line of thunderstorms capable of producing heavy rainfall. 

Model consistency decreases over the remainder of the extended.  The 
ECMWF has been the more consistent run to run with the idea of 
stalling the frontal boundary over the general area Friday through 
the weekend with a series of short waves riding along the boundary. 
This scenario will keep the MRX CWA in an active weather pattern... 
allowing for at least a chance of convection each day.  The current 
GFS has trended the boundary slightly to our south on Friday then 
brings an area of low pressure into the area for the weekend. 
So...even with the low confidence in details over the last few days 
of the extended...overall the models do trend toward an active 
pattern and will maintain the current forecast idea of basically 
chance to likely convection each period.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Low pressure along a cold front now over east Tennessee slowly
moves east this morning and afternoon and will shift most of the 
rain to the other side of the Appalachians by this afternoon. The
current rainfall was light to moderate with most amounts 0.1 to
0.3 inches in the past hour and some locations reporting over one
inch across the central valley and northern plateau. No
significant flooding is expected and let flash flood watch go as 
hourly rainfall amounts have been low. However some localized high
water in spots over the central valley tonight, especially where
heavier rains fell during the day Saturday. Temperatures have 
been mild overnight in the lower to mid 60s. Some patchy fog has 
reduced visibilities to around 2 to 4 miles where it is raining. 
Another one half inch or so of rainfall is possible for this 
morning and afternoon before the rain moves out. Clouds will 
linger during the day today with clearing in the southwest 
sections this afternoon. All areas will have clearing trend 
tonight with patchy fog forming after midnight. It may become 
dense in places that had significant rainfall Saturday and 
overnight tonight. Temperatures stay cooler today lower to mid 70s
with clouds and northwest winds. Tonight temperatures cool into 
the lower to mid 50s. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...
The extended period begins relatively quiet with surface high 
pressure over the region on Monday and Tuesday. Upper-level ridging 
will increase across the Southeast CONUS on Monday with ridging 
firmly in control and centered to our south on Tuesday. One of the 
main changes in this forecast package was decreasing PoPs on Tuesday 
through Wednesday morning as model consensus keeps the upper and mid-
level ridge axis to our west during this time period with strong 
subsidence capping convective activity. Forecast soundings verify 
this thinking with very dry mid-level air and a pronounced inversion 
between 850mb and 700mb across southern and central portions of the 
CWA. The inversion is weakest across northern sections of the area, 
but the boundary layer is forecast to be too dry to support 
convection.

By Wednesday afternoon, ridge axis shifts eastward with southerly 
flow and increasing low-level moisture returning to the forecast 
area. Longwave troughing will be present across the Western CONUS 
with small shortwaves exiting northeastward across the Mississippi 
and Ohio Valleys. This will increase chances of some showers or 
thunderstorms late Wednesday. By Thursday, models are in good 
agreement with a stronger shortwave and associated surface low 
moving northeast across the Great Plains toward the Great Lakes. As 
ridging weakens and multiple rounds of shortwave energy trek across 
the region, will see increasing PoPs during this time period with 
the highest PoPs forecast as the surface front approaches Thursday 
night into Friday. Heavy rainfall will be possible with PW values 
from the NAEFS and EPS near the 95th percentile across the Tennessee 
Valley. The highest severe weather threat appears to remain west and 
northwest of our area closer to the surface low, but there will be 
enough deep layer shear for thunderstorm organization if enough 
instability is present. CIPS Analog Guidance confirms this thinking 
with the potential for some heavy rain and at least a low risk of 
some strong to severe thunderstorms. Given the setup and the 
climatologically favorable period, should at least continue to 
monitor the potential for strong to severe thunderstorms late week.

Models diverge in how they handle the weekend setup. The GFS favors 
the front stalling to our south while the ECMWF and Canadian keep 
the front closer to our area with continued rainfall potential 
through the weekend. At this point, will continue with the blend and 
highlight the high uncertainty on Day 7-8.

.DISCUSSION...Next round of showers is now moving into our area 
from southwest to northeast. This activity is associated with a 
shortwave trough and area of low pressure that is rotating through
the region. Expect mostly showers but a few isolated storms are 
certainly possible as there is still some weak instability across 
the area, though mainly across the southern TN Valley and 
southwest NC. Isolated pockets of moderate to heavy rain will be 
embedded within the lighter showers so expect brief sudden 
downpours. As far as changes to the actual forecast, just updated
hourly POPs to try and capture the most recent radar/HRRR/RAP 
trends. Also took out likely and chance thunderstorm wording and 
replaced with slight chance as not a lot of instability remains. 
Most other elements were unchanged. Will send out new zones.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

The synoptic outlook today will feature a frontal boundary to the 
northwest with a longwave trough with associated disorganized cold 
front to the west over the eastern Great Plains. The persistent 
Bermuda high in the central Atlantic will move further offshore as 
the trough continues tracking eastward. Weather later today will be 
driven by another minor shortwave moving along the frontal boundary 
towards the northeast along with increasing WAA ahead of the cold 
front.

Mostly showers with a few isolated thunderstorms possible today with 
the greatest potential for severe weather further to the south. 
Still, some decent MLCAPE values for the more southern area of the 
CWA this afternoon and evening along with PW values near the max 
moving average for the region, mean that severe weather is still 
possible. The greatest threats will be from strong winds and heavy 
rain with hail of up to an inch diameter is possible from more 
organized cells. DCAPE values around 800 J/kg could produce 
downburst and outflow boundary winds from deteriorating storms that 
could see gusts up to 60mph. Some localized flooding is also 
possible for any training storms due to the high PW with up to an 
inch of rainfall. Areas of southwestern Virginia in particular could 
see between an inch to two inches of rainfall tonight.

Sunday will see a few lingering showers persisting into the day. 
Veering winds behind the cold front will become predominantly from 
the northwest. A few thunderstorms are possible for the eastern 
mountains in the afternoon due to orographic lifting resulting from 
the aforementioned winds.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

As the extended period begins...a cold front will have recently 
pushed east of the area...surface high pressure will be building 
in and a minor wave will be riding through the upper flow. The air
mass that will be slowly filtering in will be a bit drier and 
cooler and fairly stable. There could potentially be a few 
lingering showers over the far eastern mountains Sunday evening in
response to the exiting front but the short wave moving through 
will have little moisture or lift to work with and its main 
contribution should be a brief increase in clouds. The surface 
high will dominate area weather through Monday...aided but weak 
ridging aloft. By Tuesday the high will be shifting east with the 
ridge aloft dampened down slightly. The GFS continues to indicate 
a short wave moving up through the Carolinas on Tuesday. This 
feature could generate some isolated shower activity over the 
eastern mountains. The rest of the area should remain dry and with
southern flow around the high...warmer air will quickly return. 

Confidence in details becomes quite low through the rest of the 
extended as models continue to diverge.  Overall...we should be 
transitioning into a rather active and unsettle weather pattern for 
the Wednesday through Saturday period.  The GFS appears more 
aggressive and active through the period bringing an area of low 
pressure through late Tuesday night into Wednesday with deep 
moisture and decent lift...then it pulls a cold front through on 
Thursday then additional upper level waves/boundary moves through 
Friday into the weekend.  On the other hand...the ECMWF maintains 
weak ridging over the area on Wednesday then tracks a cold front 
through on Thursday...stalls the boundary over the general area as a 
series of impulses ride through and across the MRX CWA.  So...even 
through confidence is quite low on details as mentioned 
earlier...the overall trend indicates a rather wet pattern and will 
keep a mix of chance and likely POPs in the forecast through the 
later half of the extended.

.DISCUSSION...

Showers and thunderstorms expected through today and into this 
evening as a shortwave makes it's way along the frontal boundary 
moving into the area. Showers will sweep through the CWA from 
southwest to northeast with the greatest chance of severe weather 
late in the afternoon as ongoing WAA streams in from the south 
ahead of the front. Winds will increase later today out of the
south southwest following the surface wave. Some storms will 
become developed enough to produce gusting winds and small hail. 
In addition, lowered the temperature a little for today due to 
the rain and increasing cloud cover.

Low ceiling and visibility will improve in few hours past 12Z at
TRI as dense fog lifts. Otherwise VFR conditions today will 
change as showers and storms will develop in late morning around 
CHA and during the afternoon at TYS and TRI. Could have MVFR in 
strong showers or storms but too early to time development at any 
site this afternoon. VCTS in TAFS from about 19-00Z as best guess
today. However clouds will lower and steady rain will cause MVFR 
conditions before or around sunset. The reduced visibilities and 
ceilings will decrease even more overnight with IFR ceilings 
possible all sites late tonight and into the morning hours Sunday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Skies across the forecast area were partly cloudy early this
morning with mainly high level clouds ahead of a weak cold
front/boundary to the northwest. Temperatures were in the upper
50s to lower 60s with light winds and some patchy fog...especially
in areas where there was rainfall Friday. For today the front will
move slowly east southeast with ample moisture pooling ahead of
it. Precipitable water values reach about 1.60 this afternoon. 
Currrent satellite showing a complex of storms over east central 
MS moving toward the Tennessee Valley and another larger complex 
along the SE Texas coast moving east along the Gulf Coast. These 
features will impact the southeast states later today and into 
tonight producing scattered to numerous showers and storms by late
this morning and continuing this afternoon and evening just ahead
of the cold front. The risk for severe storms is slightly lower 
today as the best instability, moisture and low level shear will 
be across central AL into north GA and the Carolinas later today. 
The forecast area will be on the northern edge. The southern 
Valley, southeast Tennessee mountains and southwest North Carolina
will have the best chance of seeing isolated strong thunderstorms
with damaging winds and hail possibly up to 1 inch diameter. 
Soundings show Cape values up to about 1400 J/KG during the 
afternoon in the southern valley. Locally heavy rainfall is 
possible late this afternoon and evening across the southern half 
of the area and especially the eastern mountains this evening. 
There may be some localized flooding at that especially if storms 
regenerate in the same areas. Highs today should be several 
degrees cooler as clouds increase this morning. Also behind the 
front lows will drop into the 50s with more rainfall overnight. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...
The cold front will be to the south and east of the forecast area
to start the long-term forecast period. Models indicate that 
moisture will remain a bit elevated just behind the front early 
Sunday with PW values in the 0.8-1.0 inch range. These values are 
slightly above the 50th percentile for early May and expect a few 
lingering showers/storms early Sunday. Drier air will eventually 
advect into the area late Sunday morning into the afternoon and 
overall expect most of the forecast area will be dry on Sunday. 
The cold advection behind the front is rather weak with forecast 
highs on Sunday in the 70s for most locations.

Another weak shortwave trough is forecast to move through the area 
late Sunday into Monday but by this time, PW values will be down 
near the 25th percentile for early May. Overall, just expect an 
increase in mid to high clouds Sunday night into Monday morning with 
lows in the 50s for most locations.

A ridge begins to setup across the area late Monday into Tuesday 
with the main jet stream well to the north across the Great Lakes. 
Temperatures will warm during this timeframe with increasing upper 
level heights. Highs on Monday will be in the upper 70s to low 80s 
with mid to upper 80s forecast by Tuesday for most valley locations. 

Start to see some model inconsistencies with timing of the mid-week 
system. The GFS is much quicker and stronger with an upper level 
rough moving in from the west. The GFS shows a surface low 
associated with this system and strong low level southerly flow 
advecting in moisture to the region. With this solution, 
precipitation will return on Wednesday. The ECMWF solution is much 
weaker with the trough and not seeing much reflected at the surface. 
Due to this, the ECMWF indicates that Wednesday will be mostly dry 
with a more robust system approaching on Thursday. For now, have 
chance PoPs for most locations to account for the GFS solution. 
Regardless of timing, the mid to late week period will be more 
active as the ridge axis shifts to the east with southwesterly flow 
aloft. Several shortwave troughs are forecast to traverse the area 
with elevated PoPs features throughout much of the extended
forecast.

.DISCUSSION...
Only made minor updates to hourly temperatures and dewpoints to 
account for latest trends. Water vapor imagery this evening 
indicates low amplitude troughing across the central and southern
plains and large scale ridging across the western Atlantic. A 
weak baroclinic zone is situated across the midsouth and Tennessee
valley. Closer to the MRX forecast area, the radar is mostly 
clear with the exception of the northern valley and southwest 
Virginia where scattered thunderstorms continue to develop and 
move northeast. This area remains in an area of favorable 
instability with ML CAPE values in excess of 1000 J/Kg and near 
surface moisture flux convergence. These areas should continue to 
see a few thunderstorms early this evening before moving out of 
the area and weakening. While these storms should remain below 
severe limits, a few strong storms are possible with pea size 
hail. Otherwise it should be a fairly quite overnight period. 
Upper level clouds continue to stream in from the west associated 
with a weak shortwave across the southern plains. Do have some 
concern for fog development late tonight for areas that picked up 
rainfall today. However, the degree of cloud cover may inhibit fog
formation but did include patchy and areas of fog into the 
forecast. The best locations to see areas of fog would be across 
northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia.

Regarding the severe weather concern for Saturday. Models are in
great agreement regarding the trough to the west to move through
the Tennessee valley and deamplify. A weak and unorganized low 
level boundary will slowly traverse the area and will be the focus
for precipitation. The upper level flow will be fairly weak and 
overall synoptic scale lift should remain limited. Lapse rates 
will also remain weak which will limit the amount of instability. 
The low lapse rates combined with weak shear should keep the 
threat of severe weather at a minimal on Saturday. However, the 
weak boundary and low end instability should be sufficient for 
showers and embedded thunderstorms for much of the area. Point 
soundings indicate a well saturated profile with precipitable 
water values in excess of 1.50 inches which will allow for 
efficient precipitation processes and could lead to localized 
areas of heavy rainfall.

The 00Z TAF cycle will feature VFR conditions through much of
tonight and Saturday before MVFR CIGS move in Saturday afternoon.
Currently the areas of showers and thunderstorms from this
afternoon have moved off toward the NE with mostly high level 
clouds left in its wake. CIGS will gradually lower through the 
overnight period with light winds. Fog potential is possible 
especially over areas that received rainfall today. However, much
uncertainty exists in regards to how much upper level cloud cover
moves in from the west and as a result how much fog will develop.
While low confidence exists, the best locations to see fog would 
be TRI between 09Z and 12Z. A system from the west will approach 
the area Saturday morning with an increase in showers at CHA and 
TYS and TRI by afternoon. Some instability will lead to VCTS at

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...

The upper pattern this afternoon is characterized by the strong 
Bermuda high off the east coast and longwave troughing over the 
western Great Plains with a series of embedded shortwaves. At the 
surface, a cold front slowly moves southward across the lower/mid OH 
Valley, while a surface wave is taking shape across the MidSouth.

Some showers and a few lingering thunderstorms expected for the 
remainder of this afternoon and evening. MLCAPE values of 1.2k to 
1.4k J/kg, low 0-6km shear, and PW values of 1.0 - 1.3in will 
produce mostly showers with a few thunderstorms. Some stronger 
thunderstorms could produce some small hail and brief heavy 
rainfall. Convective activity should decrease considerably later 
this evening and overnight.

The SPC outlook currently for Saturday features a marginal risk 
generally along/north of I40/I81, with a slight risk highlighted 
elsewhere.  There will be an increased risk of severe storms during 
the afternoon through late evening as the aforementioned shortwaves 
traverse the upper flow, however amidst lower MLCAPE values, yet 
with higher shear and PW compared to today. PW values around 1.4 
will be around the 90% average for this time of year, so any strong 
or training storms could be capable of localized flooding.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...

The extended will begin with ongoing convection as a cold front 
pushes across the Southern Appalachian Region. By Saturday 
evening...CAPE values will be slowly decreasing from its late 
afternoon peak of 1000 to 1500 J/KG. The 850MB jet is rather light
at 25 to 35 KTs. Upper dynamics and low level shear values will 
persist into the early evening before slowly decreasing. We will 
remain in an SPC Slight Risk area through the early evening with 
overall severe storm parameters decreasing and the while large 
hail can not to be totally ruled out...the main concern will 
continue to be strong thunderstorm winds. Additionally ...high PW 
values of 1.25 -1.50 inches will aid the generation of locally 
heavy rainfall. Scattered convection will weaken but continue over
the area overnight with a few lingering showers slowly exiting 
from west to east on Sunday. By Sunday evening...flow aloft will 
become zonal and surface high pressure will build in for dry and 
slight cooler conditions. The main storm track will be to our 
north and will see little change in the overall weather pattern 
over the MRX CWA on Monday for a dry day. On Tuesday...a weak 
short wave will track over the Carolinas and may see a few 
isolated showers move over far eastern areas in response. 
Otherwise...expect Tuesday to be mostly a dry and slightly warmer 
day.

The area will then transition into an unsettle weather pattern for 
Tuesday night through the rest of the extended.  There will be a 
series of short waves/frontal boundaries pushing through.  Models do 
show some differences in strength and timing but one should move 
into the area around the late Tuesday night/Wednesday time frame and 
another on Thursday and yet another around Friday.  Overall...each 
of these should bring a line of showers and thunderstorms across the 
area for a rather active end of the work week.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Showers and thunderstorms ended and moved northeast of the area
around midnight with skies clearing. A MCV moving east across 
western KY and western TN towards middle TN early this morning 
was developing scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms 
approaching Nashville. This MCV and surface low will approach the
southern plateau around sunrise and then move east into the
northeast sections of the forecast area by afternoon. Clouds and
rain chances increase from southwest to northeast later this
morning and afternoon. Have highest rain chances northeast during
the day today. The air mass will become most unstable across
northeast sections with some sun in the morning there. Mid level 
lapse rates will be around 6.5 to 7.0 C/KM. A few storms may be
strong to severe northeast with isolated damaging winds and a few
with large hail. Temperatures will be slightly cooler with highs
in the mid 70s to lower 80s. Locally heavy rain will accompany the
convection in western sections this morning and then central and
northeast third this afternoon. Do not expect any significant
flooding with rainfall amounts generally a half inch or less in
storms. Tonight the MCV will have moved northeast and there 
should be a marked decrease in showers and storms after sunset. 
The weak cold front to the west and northwest now along the lower 
Ohio and Mississippi Rivers this morning will be moving closer 
with more showers and storms ahead of low pressure moving out of 
Arkansas early Saturday. The convection ahead of it is not 
expected to reach east Tennessee before morning so have kept pops 
low tonight. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...
To start the long-term forecast period a 90-110 kt 300mb jet will 
stretch from the western Great Lakes into the Northeastern U.S. This 
will put the forecast are in the right entrance region of the jet. 
At 500 mb, a shortwave trough is forecast to move out of the Lower 
Mississippi River Valley into the Tennessee River Valley during the 
day Saturday. In response to the jet at 300mb, the 850 mb jet 
will increase across the forecast area into the 25-40 kts 
depending on model solution. At the surface, a cold front will be 
located to the northwest of the forecast area to start the day on 
Saturday and will drift slowly to the southeast throughout the 
day. Model soundings indicate SBCAPE values ranging from around 
750-1500 J/KG with mid level lapse rates around 6-6.5 degrees 
C/km. The NAM is the most aggressive model with SBCAPE values over
2000 J/Kg but for now think there will be too much cloud cover to
realize these values. With the strong jet to the northeast, 0-6 
km deep layer shear will range from around 40-55 kts and there 
could be a few more organized storms. Due to this, there is 
currently a slight risk across the southeastern half of the 
forecast area for Saturday. Low level 0-1 km SRH values are not 
overly high in the 100-150 m2/s2 range and expect the chances for 
any tornadoes would be very low. For now, thinking the SBCAPE 
values will be on the lower end with the continued cloud cover 
during the day and think most hail should stay under severe 
criteria. The main threat with the storms will be isolated 
damaging wind gusts. In addition to the severe potential, PW 
values will be in the 1.3-1.5 inch range. These values are over 
the 90th percentile for early May and there could be some 
localized flash flooding, especially in areas of poor drainage. 
Models are struggling with the timing of the frontal passage and 
have lingered some chances for thunderstorms into the early 
morning hours on Sunday. 

PoPs will decrease from southwest to northeast throughout the day on 
Sunday as the front exits to the south and east. Dry air will advect 
into the area behind the departing boundary. Not seeing much in the 
way of cold advection behind the boundary with zonal flow aloft for 
Sunday. Expect mostly to partly sunny skies by the end of the day 
Sunday with highs in the 70s for most locations. 

The GFS and ECMWF are both in agreement that a ridge is forecast to 
move into the area to start the work week. Temperatures will rise 
throughout this period with highs in the mid 70s to low 80s on 
Monday and 80s across most the region by Tuesday with dry 
conditions. The ridge will begin to breakdown by the middle of the 
week with rain chances returning Tuesday night into Wednesday.

.DISCUSSION...
The forecast seems to be in good shape tonight. Only made minor 
updates to hourly temperatures and dewpoints based on observations
and trends. Updated PoP's and weather to account for latest radar
trends and hi-resolution model guidance. Latest radar loops shows
scattered convection across the northern valley and southwest 
Virginia. This activity has been aided by low level frontogenetic
forcing along with boundary layer moisture convergence. IR 
satellite has shown a warming trend over the past hour with most 
of this activity likely due to waning buoyancy. However enough 
instability remains with low ML CAPE values (500-1000J/Kg) and 
modest forcing for the current scattered convection to continue 
overnight. However, reduction in lapse rates will likely limit 
convective initiation for the rest of the night. Winds aloft 
remain on the weak side which has limited storm organization and 
kept thunderstorms below severe limits but still cannot rule out a
strong storm or two. 

The MCV and associated surface low to the west which is clearly
seen on satellite will continue to ride along a low level boundary
toward the ENE. This feature will likely remain far enough west to
limit overall convection across the MRX area but felt as though
keeping low end PoPs is the best course of action tonight. 
Otherwise temperatures overnight will be mild with lows in the low
to mid 60's.

Main aviation challenges for the 00Z TAF issuance is timing of
VCTS activity that is forecast at TYS and TRI. Latest visible
satellite imagery shows the cumulus field is waning as we begin 
to lose day time heating. Radar still indicates a few scattered 
thunderstorms near and to the west of TRI. This activity should 
continue to move north of the area over the next 1-2 hours. The 
rest of the night should feature VFR CIGS and light winds. A 
disturbance to the west will move into the region by Friday morning
with VCSH at CHA. Instability will build during the late morning 
and through the afternoon with VCTS at TYS and TRI before clearing
closer to the end of the TAF cycle. Otherwise VFR is forecast

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...Weather becomes a little more 
active each day as we head into the weekend with a relatively 
energetic mean southwest flow in association with long wave 
troughing across Middle America and an already healthy sub 
tropical high parked over the Western Atlantic. In this flow 
pattern, in the short term, a couple of waves of low pressure are 
making their way east northeast out of the Midwest; initially for 
this afternoon and tonight, and then a more well developed wave 
emerges out of the Lower Mississippi Valley for Friday. Some 
instability is present across the forecast area this afternoon, 
with a bit of capping evident in visible satellite and radar 
imagery over the Southern Appalachian region. Apparently, 
orographic lifting is aiding convection on the Cumberland Plateau.
Outflow from this action along with some fresh lift on the 
southern end the initial wave over the Ohio Valley may allow for 
some scattered to widely scattered convection across the viewing 
area this evening. Decreasing buoyancy later tonight leads to a 
decrease in the action while awaiting the arrival of the second 
wave Friday morning. This feature appears to be the best synoptic 
lifting mechanism than we have seen if a few days. Model forecasts
depict a relatively significant upper wave with a nice surface 
reflection. The surface low associated with the wave rides 
steadily east northeast on a path just northwest of the mrx 
forecast area; beginning late tonight in the Lower Ohio Valley, 
with eventual arrival in the Central Appalachians by early Friday 
evening. In this scenario model depiction brings a nice, deep 
moist axis in a moderately unstable environment with just a bit of
0-6km shear (on the order of 20-25 kts) into the forecast area 
from morning into the early afternoon hours. The severe storms 
forecast center has placed Southwest Virginia in a marginal 
category for the possibility of severe thunderstorm development. 
Therefore, a few storms could produce strong wind gusts. Also, wet
bulb zero heights will be around 9k feet, so there could be a bit
of hail with the strongest updrafts. Model depiction shows the 
offending wave slipping east across the Appalachian spine around 
mid afternoon so active weather would be decreasing from west to 
east through the middle part of the day into the later afternoon. 
The temperature scheme looked on track with somewhat muted, 
although still several degrees above normal maxes highs in the 
lower 80s most spots and mild lows in the upper 50s and lower 60s 
north to the middle 60s plateau and south. 

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Thursday)...Synoptic pattern 
starting for the long term outlook begins with the most prominent 
feature being a longwave trough over the central CONUS with a 
strong Bermuda high still in place out in the Atlantic. The 
trailing end of an old cold front originating from a low pressure 
system over New England will have stalled over the Tennessee 
valley. The upper level ridge will start to break down Saturday as
several shortwaves progress along the edge of the elongated cold 
front this weekend.

SPC outlook currently has east Tennesee, southwest Virginia, and 
southwest North Carolina within the marginal category for severe 
weather on Saturday. Strong southwesterly flow ahead of the incoming 
trough will lead to increased thermal and moisture advection which 
will provide increasing theta-e values. An 850mb jet between 35 to 
40kts will set up ahead of the shortwave on Saturday afternoon. 
Model soundings show a fairly unidirectional flow that will limit 
shear.

MLCAPES values around 1700 J/kg for the southern counties with 
decreased values further up the valley. The low level jet along with 
potential of precip loading could produce localized damaging winds. 
PW values of 1.5in is above the 90% average for this time of year so 
any training storms could produce localized flash flooding. Models 
currently indicate higher precip potential for the Cumberland 
Plateau and the northeastern Tennessee mountains. Along with FFG, a 
greater potential for flooding will exist around southwestern 
Virginia. HCAPE of around 350 to 400 J/kg could lead to some hail 
formation for any developing cells, but not expecting anything 
greater than 1/2" sized. Overall, Strong to severe thunderstorms are 
possible Saturday afternoon with the greatest threat being high 
winds and heavy rains.

The convective potential falls away Saturday night with mostly 
showers and a few possible lingering thunderstorms. Mostly showers 
on Sunday, mainly mountains since the main forcing being orographic 
lift. High pressure comes back into control early next week with 
increased ridging Monday through Wednesday. An upper level low over 
southern California looks to undergo increasing cyclogenesis and 
further develop a trough over the southwest. The synoptic pattern 
for next week will increase in amplitude as the ridge over the mid 
Atlantic states builds.

Outlook becomes lower confidence past Wednesday next week, as models 
don't have consensus on the mid week shortwave. GFS brings some 
showers into eastern Tennessee by early Wednesday morning, while the 
Euro holds it back until the afternoon.

.AVIATION...Satellite imagery reveals the wetter lower level 
atmosphere and buoyancy has aided the development of some 
convection on the major terrain features, including the 
Cumberland Plateau and the mountains, along the North Carolina 
border. Widely scattered convective development should gradually 
form later this afternoon in parts of the Great Valley and a 
thunderstorm could impact a terminal. Just applied a vicinity 
thunder group for later this afternoon into the mid evening at cha
and tys. Perhaps the probability will be a little greater at tri 
this evening as the southern end of a weak impulse glides east 
toward the Central Appalachians. Of course, there will be a break 
in the action later in the evening into the early morning hours. 
However, another wave will build into the Great Valley toward 
daybreak with slow progression east on Friday morning. Therefore, 
added a shower early and with a gradual increase in instability 
with the wave, ended the aviation forecast realm with the 
possibility of some thunder.

.DISCUSSION...Current forecast looks rather decent with a little
higher pop for convective development this afternoon into the
evening period. Area soundings show higher moisture content in the
lower levels and higher resolution models reveal best instability
across the Cumberland Plateau; and more specifically, across the 
plateau counties closer to the Kentucky border. Additionally, 
model forecasts hint at enhancement with a weak perturbation in 
the upper level flow riding northeast across this part of the MRX 
forecast area with the possibility of some of this action sliding 
further east this evening across Southwest Virginia and Northeast 
Tennessee. Therefore, will adjust pops a little higher in this 
region. Expect more scattered to widely scattered development will
impact much of the rest of the area, so pops appear to be on 
track. Forecast highs similar to, if not a degree under
yesterday's maxes looks good in the increasingly moist environment
across the Southern Appalachian region.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
High pressure to our east will continue to supply warm and moist
air in the low levels today. With no capping noted in forecast
soundings, convection should develop fairly easily with afternoon
heating, although some dry air entrainment will have to be
overcome. The NAM and GFS are very different with their PoPs
today, as the NAM has backed off considerably and the GFS is in
the likely range. Considering yesterday's activity (more than 
what the NAM depicted) as well as the latest HRRR runs (scattered
coverage), will go with chance PoPs area wide, favoring northern 
sections which may be aided by a midlevel shortwave trough passing
by to our north. Convective indicies also favor NE TN and SW VA 
today. With MLCAPE in the range of 1500-2000 J/kg shown by the 
RAP, some small hail cannot be ruled out, but shear is lacking to 
provide sustained rotating updrafts for large hail. Most activity 
should diminish with sunset, but a slight chance PoP will be kept 
in the Plateau tonight as a low pressure system tracks into SE 
MO/W KY, and showers ahead of it could reach our border by 12Z.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
The extended range fcst period begins Friday with subtropical 
ridge over the far western Atlantic. and a deep nearly full 
latitude trough covering much of the rest of the country. The 
trough was helping to produce deep southwest flow over Mississippi
Valley/OH Valley and as a full latitude trough covers much of the
country. High pressure along the eastern Seaboard was staying 
strong as of this morning. Over the next several days the ridge 
will be weakened as heights fall and an approaching front moves 
out of the Plains and Midwest states. The frontal boundary to the 
northwest this morning appears to washout by Friday and then stall
to the north of the forecast area which will cause more 
convection to develop as temperatures heat up and instability 
rises. A strong shortwave to the west will move into the Tennessee
Valley late Friday and Friday night and continue across the 
region Saturday with the cold front. Marginally strong to severe 
storms will be possible. Also heavy rainfall of around 1 inch 
possible Southwest Virginia and Cumberland Plateau late Saturday. 
Behind the front some lingering showers Sunday. High pressure 
builds in across the eastern Tennessee Valley late Sunday and 
continues Monday and Tuesday with another ridge taking over. 
Temperatures above normal Friday then cooling Saturday with clouds
and showers. Sunday will be the coolest day behind front with 
highs in the upper 60s to mid 70s. This will be short lived as 
ridging takes over and warm temperatures in the 80s by Tuesday. A 
chance of showers and storms back in the forecast Wednesday as 
high starts to shift east and moisture returns back north from the
Gulf.

.DISCUSSION...
0z soundings and surface obs show a low-level confluent boundary
extending from East TN southwestward through central Alabama. A 
50kt upper level jet is located across Middle Tennessee providing
upper- level divergence across NE Alabama and SE TN. In addition,
PVA from a weak shortwave across Mississippi is enhancing lift 
and associated height falls across the Tennessee Valley. Mid-
level height falls have led to increasing lapse rates and 
instability this evening, even as daytime heating was coming to a 
close with MUCAPE jumping from near 1400 J/kg to 2200 J/kg between
21z and 0z across the southern East TN valley near CHA. While 
instability will remain present overnight, expect chances of 
showers and thunderstorms to decrease as PVA weakens and the 
boundary layer stabilizes.

Will see mid-level ridging break down further tomorrow with 
increasing shortwave energy affecting our area. This means 
increased chances of showers and thunderstorms during the 
afternoon, especially across the higher elevations.

continuation of above normal temperatures in a gradually 
moistening air mass in the short term. There are some weak upper 
level waves that help with lift in a modestly buoyant atmosphere 
across the Southern Appalachian region. One of these weak features
has pushed into hills and valleys region this afternoon and is 
generating some isolated convection across Southeast Tennessee and
Southwest North Carolina; mainly over the higher terrain. There 
could be a few more isolated showers or even a thunderstorm this 
evening in the still relatively buoyant atmosphere. Would expect 
much of this action to fade away as the night progresses. However,
went with a little higher pop for a few showers and thunderstorms
on Thursday with a little bit deeper moist axis and a slightly 
more well developed upper feature.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...The extended 
range fcst period kicks off on Thursday evening amidst H5 
subtropical ridging over the western Atlantic, while deep nearly 
full latitude troughing consumes much of the remaining CONUS 
promoting deep swly flow across the MS/OH and TN Valleys. At the 
surface, high pressure across the eastern seaboard (consequent of 
the aforementioned Bermuda ridge) will be continually weakened 
thanks to falling H5 heights and an approaching surface wave/front
out of the Plains/Midwest states.

At fcst initialization, the passage of a weak H5 impulse combined 
with daytime heating could favor ongoing sct convection across the 
Great Valley and Southern Appalachians, generally airmass type 
thunderstorms.  Likewise and further west, convection tied to the 
frontal boundary looks to slowly drift eastward into the 
evening/overnight hours, albeit weakening given loss of daytime 
heating and no sig upper lvl support.  On Friday, guidance favors 
the frontal boundary essentially washing out and stalling somewhere 
across the lower OH valley into the TN Valley region, which combined 
with daytime heating should provide additional focusing for 
convection Friday afternoon.  Meanwhile to the west, a potent 
shortwave looks to work through the mean H5 trough across the 
Southern Plains thereby favoring a region of surface cyclogenesis 
over the MidSouth into Saturday morning.  This wave and it's 
associated front will work east/northeast across the TN Valley and 
Southern Appalachian region on Saturday.  Although timing of 
convection looks to be somewhat early for maximum heating induced 
instability, profiles are sufficiently unstable and moist for deep 
convection.  

Behind the front, a few residual upslope forced showers are 
plausible into Sunday morning before high pressure builds across the 
area from the northwest amidst zonal H5 flow.  Brief nly flow should 
favor cooler temperatures and a slightly drier airmass Sunday into 
Monday before the surface high shifts east favoring veered sly waa 
and upper heights build aloft as another ridge advects in.  By 
Tuesday the pattern should return to more of a summerlike setup with 
deep ridging and perhaps some mtn convection expected.

went with a little higher pop for a few showers and thunderstorms
on Thursday with a little bit deeper moist axis and a slightly 
more well developed upper feature.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...The extended 
range fcst period kicks off on Thursday evening amidst H5 
subtropical ridging over the western Atlantic, while deep nearly 
full latitude troughing consumes much of the remaining CONUS 
promoting deep swly flow across the MS/OH and TN Valleys. At the 
surface, high pressure across the eastern seaboard (consequent of 
the aforementioned Bermuda ridge) will be continually weakened 
thanks to falling H5 heights and an approaching surface wave/front
out of the Plains/Midwest states.

At fcst initialization, the passage of a weak H5 impulse combined 
with daytime heating could favor ongoing sct convection across the 
Great Valley and Southern Appalachians, generally airmass type 
thunderstorms.  Likewise and further west, convection tied to the 
frontal boundary looks to slowly drift eastward into the 
evening/overnight hours, albeit weakening given loss of daytime 
heating and no sig upper lvl support.  On Friday, guidance favors 
the frontal boundary essentially washing out and stalling somewhere 
across the lower OH valley into the TN Valley region, which combined 
with daytime heating should provide additional focusing for 
convection Friday afternoon.  Meanwhile to the west, a potent 
shortwave looks to work through the mean H5 trough across the 
Southern Plains thereby favoring a region of surface cyclogenesis 
over the MidSouth into Saturday morning.  This wave and it's 
associated front will work east/northeast across the TN Valley and 
Southern Appalachian region on Saturday.  Although timing of 
convection looks to be somewhat early for maximum heating induced 
instability, profiles are sufficiently unstable and moist for deep 
convection.  

Behind the front, a few residual upslope forced showers are 
plausible into Sunday morning before high pressure builds across the 
area from the northwest amidst zonal H5 flow.  Brief nly flow should 
favor cooler temperatures and a slightly drier airmass Sunday into 
Monday before the surface high shifts east favoring veered sly waa 
and upper heights build aloft as another ridge advects in.  By 
Tuesday the pattern should return to more of a summerlike setup with 
deep ridging and perhaps some mtn convection expected.

As for any hazardous weather during the period, mostly general 
thunderstorms are favored with small hail, gusty winds, and brief 
heavy rainfall possible.  The best chances for heavy rainfall would 
be on Saturday as the weak fropa occurs with soundings favoring 
pwats in excess of The extended range fcst period kicks off on Thursday evening amidst

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The summer-like pattern of high pressure off the SE Coast and a SW
flow across our area continues today, but with a few small
differences from the past couple days. Surface dewpoints this
morning are starting out higher than yesterday. The capping 
inversion that has suppressed convection will be weaker to nil 
today, which should allow for better chances of some development, 
particularly in the southern sections. However, midlevel dry air 
entrainment will likely limit develoment and coverage. The
forecast will carry a slight chance PoP south of I-40 this
afternoon. Tonight, rain chances will shift to the Plateau and SW
VA as a shortwave trough and frontal boundary tracks across the 
OH Valley region. The GFS is quite bullish on precip overnight but
will stay closer to the lesser coverage depicted by the NAM. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...
The dry pattern will begin to change Thursday as ridging shifts east 
and weak frontal boundary moves into the Ohio and lower Mississippi 
Valleys on Thursday. Weak shortwave energy will move into the 
Tennessee Valley ahead of the front Thursday and Friday for 
increased threat of showers and thunderstorms. Scattered showers and 
a few storms west and widely scattered showers and storms east will 
become more scattered to numerous Friday. The front is expected to 
approach only very slowly as low pressure develops back to the west 
and southwest along the front and move east northeast across the 
Tennessee Valley on Saturday and Saturday night. Finally shifting 
east of the area Sunday. Rainfall amounts are not expected to be 
that significant until Saturday and Saturday night just ahead of the 
front. The front will weaken by Saturday with little threat for 
strong storms. Brief heavy rainfall will be the main concern. 
Temperatures will stay above normal Thursday through Friday and 
decrease Saturday and Sunday as skies will be cloudy with periods of 
showers and some thunderstorms. Highs will lower to back to the 70s 
for highs and 50s for lows. High pressure will build back in for the 
first of the week with warming temperatures once again. Highs will 
be back into the upper 70s to mid 80s Monday and Tuesday.

.DISCUSSION...
We remain in a -PNA pattern with longwave troughing across the
western half of the country and ridging over the Eastern CONUS. A
shortwave trough ejecting out of the base of the longwave is 
assisting with deep convective development across the Southern 
and Central Plains this evening, but strong mid-level ridging and 
surface high pressure are keeping us dry.

High pressure to the east will result in low-level southwest flow
and an increase in boundary layer moisture on Wednesday. While
instability will be on the increase during the afternoon, there
will be limited lift as shortwave energy remains to our west. In 
addition, mid-level ridging remains strong through the day with 
RAP and NAM forecast soundings indicating very dry air between 700
and 500 mb which will hinder deep convective updrafts. For these 
reasons, expect any convection to be limited and primarily across 
the higher elevations of Southeast Tennessee where differential 
heating along the terrain may enhance convergence and provide a 
source for increased mesoscale lift. With this in mind, believe 
CAMs are on track with general location and timing of convection 
on Wednesday afternoon but are overdoing coverage and PoPs. With 
low and mid- level heights nearly identical to today, expect 
temperatures to be very similar with max temperatures in the mid 
80s for most locations. The main limiting factor would be cloud 
cover, and for the most part, expect a mostly clear sky with 
cirrus similar to what was observed today which guidance appears 
to be handling for tomorrow.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...
The short term will feature upper level high pressure anchored just 
off the coast of the Carolinas, with upper troughing over the 
Rockies. This will leave southwesterly flow aloft over eastern 
Tennessee, with a warm southerly flow regime in place at the surface 
and continued above normal temperatures.

Guidance suggests temperatures in the low 60s tonight, with 
afternoon highs in the low to mid 80s again tomorrow. Models 
continue to show the possibility of some isolated showers or 
thunderstorms over the southern Appalachians Wednesday afternoon. 
Have kept a slight chance of thunder in the mountains, from the 
Smokies and points south. Otherwise there's not much going on in the 
short term period. More active weather will be present in the long 
term period.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
The forecast will become increasingly unsettled across the 
Southern Appalachian region into the end of the week as a couple 
weak upper level waves drive northeast from the Lower Mississippi 
Valley through the Eastern Great Lakes. Instability will gradually
increase Thursday into Friday ahead of a slow moving synoptic 
cool frontal boundary. In this environment, a weak outflow 
boundary emanating from widespread convection across the 
Mississippi Valley will build toward the Cumberland Plateau 
Thursday afternoon and evening may produce scattered showers and a
few thunderstorms on this higher terrain with more isolated 
development in the Great Valley. The corridor of deeper moisture 
and greater instability will advance farther east into the 
Appalachian region later Friday into Saturday. This period of the 
forecast will be the most active with increasing southerly 
convergent flow ahead of the synoptic front as healthy short wave 
energy presses east toward the Atlantic Seaboard. Drier westerly 
flow brings quiet, but very mild weather back later Sunday into 
Monday with a period of ridging and a brief return to atmospheric 
stability. There is some agreement with the ecmwf, gfs, and 
canadian models on a little, compact day 7 short wave that emerges
out of the Lower Mississippi Valley for Tuesday into Tuesday 
night so added some small pops for this possibility.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A large high pressure ridge off the Southeast coastline will
continue to provide a summer-like pattern across the TN Valley
today. With a SW low level flow and mostly sunny skies,
temperatures will be well above normal, reaching the mid to upper
80s - a bit warmer than yesterday. A capping inversion will
prevent afternoon convection in most locations, but the models
(particularly the GFS and SREF) show some isolated showers 
popping up in the mountains along the NC border. Will continue to 
have a slight chance PoP in this area as it can't be completely 
ruled out, but convection will likely struggle to develop today. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...
Ridge aloft along the east coast Wednesday will be slow to shift 
east. This will only allow isolated showers and storms to develop 
late Wednesday into Wednesday night. Very warm high temperatures 
continue with highs in the low to mid 80s. Cloud cover will increase 
Wednesday night and Thursday as weak cold front sags southward into 
the Ohio Valley. Temperatures will be slightly cooler Thursday with 
clouds and a chance of showers and storms all areas by late 
afternoon and evening. Highs will still be in the upper 70s to mid 
80s. As front approaches Friday showers become likely during the day 
with heating and increased instability then decreasing at night as 
atmosphere stabilizes. The front will stall and only move slowly 
across the Appalachians through Sunday. Likely rain chances again 
Saturday with slightly lower rain chances Sunday. Sunday night the 
front should finally move to near the east coast with skies finally 
clearing and high pressure moving in from the northwest. Through the 
extended temperatures will stay above normal.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...

A warm front, currently located over the central valley, will have 
lifted north of the CWA by later this evening as low pressure 
strengthens in the plains and a broad southerly flow regime sets up 
across the region locally. With high pressure overhead, expect 
another night of clear skies, save perhaps a few high clouds passing 
by at times. With the surface warm front to our north and higher 
dewpoints in place, some patchy fog could develop tonight. Do not 
believe it will be very widespread at all, likely confined to 
portions of the northern valley and into southwest Virginia where 
temperatures will be cooler and overnight RH the highest.

For tomorrow, another disturbance will be ejecting into the plains 
from the southern Rockies, while upper ridging strengthens overhead 
here in the southeast United States. The result will be a warm, 
summer like pattern, with highs around 5-10 degrees above normal. 
Model soundings for points throughout the forecast area show a 
capped atmosphere tomorrow. Have much of the area rain free, with 
only some scattered afternoon clouds in the forecast. However, 
higher elevation locales will likely be at or just above the 
inversion, so expect to see at the very least some better vertical 
growth to afternoon clouds, but more likely some isolated showers 
and thunderstorm development during the afternoon hours tomorrow. 
Most, if not all, of this will likely remain on the NC side of 
things but would not be surprised if a shower or two is able to 
start on the TN side of the line. Steering flow shows a northeast 
movement so, save some possible outflow boundary development, any 
storms that do form in TN would move into NC fairly quick. Have some 
slight chance PoPs in the forecast from the Smokies to the northeast 
TN mountains tomorrow afternoon, and this should cover it just
fine.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...

Mid level ridge and and low levels winds wrapping around a high off 
the East Coast will continue Tuesday night through the middle of the 
work week. The predominant impact from this ridge will be the 
continued warm temperatures across the area. Temperatures on 
Wednesday and Thursday will continue to be around 10 degrees above 
normal. These very warm temperatures will try and force afternoon 
convection to initiate, but relatively dry soundings indicate that 
coverage of any storms that do develop Tuesday/Wednesday afternoon 
would be limited. Best chances will be along the terrain of the 
Southern Appalachian Mountains.

Low pressure system will try and make a dent in the ridge over the 
second half of the work week and a surface low will try and drag a 
front through the Southeast U.S. Models seem to be slowing down this 
system just a tad over the past few runs, potentially indicating the 
ridge is stronger than previously forecasted or that the incoming 
weather system won't pack as much of a punch. So best chances of 
precipitation are looking more likely during the daytime on Friday. 

Boundary loses it's forward momentum as we head into the weekend 
with the best dynamics of this system having moved off to the 
northeast. This means it is currently forecasted to stall out 
somewhere around the Tennessee Valley. Precipitation chances remain 
somewhat high Friday through most of the weekend as a few weak 
ripples of energy zip along the boundary. These showers and the 
associated cloud coverage will help cool us off a bit keeping 
temperatures near, but still above normal over the weekend.

Precipitation chances decrease as we head into the new work week, 
but they don't completely go away as southerly winds continue to 
draw up moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. A shortwave looks to push 
through the Southeast U.S. just beyond the end of the 7-day forecast.

will help warm temperatures into the lower to mid 80s across much of 
the TN Valley this afternoon. Scattered to broken high clouds this 
morning should be clearing in the afternoon. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...
The extended will begin with strong mid level ridging over the 
southeast U.S. This will generate a more summerlike weather patten
with strong daytime heating and warm southernly flow. As a 
result...will see afternoon temperatures climb well into the 80s 
across most valley locations both Tuesday and Wednesday. With 
strong subsidence and cap...the lower valley terrain will 
experience plenty of sun and dry conditions. However... summerlike
diurnal convection will be possible over higher elevations 
Tuesday and Wednesday. 

The main system of concern will be a low pressure system progged to 
move in late in the work week. With the upper ridge entrenched to 
our east...the models are having difficulty with the timing of the 
front into the area.  Will continue with the thinking of the ridge 
slowly shifting a bit eastward mid week allowing the upper trough to 
begin to nudge in. This will increase low level moisture and provide 
some weak forcing Wendesday night into Thursday. Current model 
trends bring the frontal passage in around the Thursday night/Friday 
time frame. At this point we should have decent moisture in 
place...lift and upper dynamics associated with the front and the 
air mass should destabilize.  This will all add up to a band of 
showers and thunderstorms moving across the area.  With the ridge 
maintaining its position to our east...the frontal boundary is 
expected to stall somewhere around the general area as the next 
system approaches. Models in poor agreement by the end of the period 
but with the boundary in the vicinity and possibly phasing with the 
next low pressure system...will see the potential for scattered 
convection over the region into Saturday and Sunday.

.DISCUSSION...

The cold front is now to the south and east of the forecast area
with dry conditions forecast overnight. PW values are down in the
0.5-0.8 inch range, which are slightly below normal for late
April. In the upper levels, a ridge stretches overhead northwards
into the Great Lakes. Winds will be light overnight with a surface
high to the northeast. Light winds and clear skies will lead to
radiational cooling conditions with lows dropping down into the
mid 40s to mid 50s. Southwesterly winds around 850 mb are already
developing with the high to the east and low developing to the
west. The E-W frontal boundary currently located to the south 
will eventually lift northwards late tonight into the day tomorrow
but is forecast to stay to the south of the forecast area through
the remainder of the night.

Only update to the forecast were some minor adjustments to the
hourly temperature and dewpoint grids.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

The cold front is situated along/east of the I-75/I-81 corridor
this afternoon. It's a weak front, with little in the way of
clouds and only a few locations showing a discernible wind shift.
But there is a notable drop in dewpoints behind the front. The
front should slowly continue to push south and east of our area
tonight as high pressure to our north slides east across the lower
great lakes region.

Skies should clear out tonight as drier air moves in. Winds will
die down as well, and temperatures will respond accordingly. Lows
in the 40s to low 50s are expected tonight. With the influence of
high pressure waning tomorrow, and southerly winds returning
across the region, expect a significant warm up tomorrow. Highs on
Monday should rise into the lower 80s for most areas.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
 
Mid level ridging and low level high pressure off the East Coast 
will continue for through the middle of the work week. These will 
lead to well above average temperatures, with a pattern that is more 
comparable to summer than spring. Soundings and model output 
suggests that there will be enough daytime heating that we possibly 
develop some thunderstorms. Chances will be greatest each 
afternoon/evening along the Southern Appalachian Mountains. But 
there will be a pretty stable conditions and a dry atmosphere that 
make it difficult for storms to be able to develop, especially over 
the valley.

Best chances for widespread showers and thunderstorms will come on 
Thursday/Friday as front moves nearer and shortwave zips across the 
Tennessee Valley. Models still differ on how far/fast to move the 
front through the Southeastern states as we head into the weekend 
leading to a decrease in forecast confidence at the end of the work 
week. Definitely expect storms to occur, but certainty on timing of 
the storms is low. 

Once the front moves through then rain chances start to decrease as 
higher PWAT is pushed away. A few ripples of energy look to possibly 
move through at the end of next weekend, so rain chances won't 
completely be eliminated at this time.

.DISCUSSION...

A cold front was situated just to the west of the Cumberland
Plateau this morning, with a frontal passage noted at Nashville
and areas around the Cookeville vicinity. It has been a slower
progression east/southeast than what models were showing
yesterday, but all indications are that this front will continue
to push into the forecast area later this morning and certainly by
this afternoon. Temperature forecasts are a tad uncertain as the
arrival of the front and post-frontal stratus field will have a
notable effect on highs today. However, with the slower arrival of
the front and a good amount of clearing noted on visible satellite
imagery, decided not to make any notable changes. Kept afternoon 
highs roughly where they were with the overnight shift's early 
morning forecast package. Did go ahead and remove any mention of 
rain for the remainder of this morning however, as the radar is 
clear of any precip returns and has been for some time now across 
the CWA.

Otherwise no changes necessary for the morning update.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A weak cold front will be moving
across the Southern Appalachian Region this morning. With the
frontal passage...a few pockets of mainly light rain and 
sprinkles will be possible and a brief period of gusty winds may 
develop. This front should exit the area by mid morning and should
see improving conditions for the rest of the short term. 
Overall...expect decreasing clouds with dry conditions...highs 
should reach into the upper 60s and 70s across most valley 
locations today. By tonight...weak surface high pressure will be 
in control with zonal flow aloft. This will allow for a rather 
quiet night with a few high clouds moving through...light winds 
and lows generally in the mid 40s to mid 50s range.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)... The dominant feature 
through the early to middle portions of the work week will be a 
low to midlevel high pressure ridge off the SE coast. This will 
provide a warm southerly flow across the TN Valley that will bring
high temps well into the 80s for Monday through Wednesday. Dry 
and stable soundings will make for difficult conditions for 
afternoon convective development. Only the higher terrain along 
the NC border will have a chance of breaking the cap on Tuesday 
and Wednesday afternoons. 

Rain chances start to rise on Thursday as a trough moves east across 
the Plains and the ridge to our east starts to weaken its grip. 
Increasing moisture advection should produce scattered coverage on 
Thursday, although synoptic forcing remains weak. Stronger forcing 
is expected on Friday as a shortwave trough crosses the MS River, so 
PoPs will rise to the likely range. GFS and ECMWF are coming into 
better agreement on this timing, although they differ on the trough 
amplification. With the trough moving to our east, Saturday should 
be dry and cooler with highs in the 70s.

.DISCUSSION...

Two shortwave troughs of note for the overnight period into early
Sunday. One across the eastern Great Lakes and the other across
the western Great Lakes. Radar imagery indicates a few light 
returns showing up across the area extending northward thanks to
the first shortwave trough. The low to mid-levels remain rather 
dry with just a few sporadic reports of rain making it to the 
ground across SE KY, NE TN, and SW VA. The highest amount observed
so far has just been a hundredth. The dry air can be noted on the
00z OHX sounding with a rather impressive layer of dry air below 
600 mb. Expect a break in the radar returns later tonight into 
early tomorrow morning before the next shortwave trough passes to 
the north and cold front moves in from the west. The cold front 
currently stretches from near central IL back to the southwest 
into NE TX. The front is forecast to move into the forecast area 
early Sunday morning. Low-level saturation will increase slightly 
with some low-level convergence but with 850 mb flow more from the
west PW values don't get overly impressive. For now, have still 
stuck with slight chance to low end chance PoPs (20-30%) for early
Sunday. Model soundings even indicate a little bit of elevated 
instability early to mid morning on Sunday ahead of the frontal 
passage with values around 100-200 J/Kg. For now, will hold off on
mentioning thunder in the forecast with the best lift still well 
to the north and the low confidence. Overnight lows tonight will 
be mild in the 50s for most locations.

VFR conditions currently across the terminals. There are a few
returns showing up on radar but the low to mid-levels are fairly 
dry according to model soundings. Additionally, cloud bases are 
around 10-15 kft at most locations. Therefore, expect mostly virga
with the possibility of a few sprinkles over the next few hours. 
A cold front will move into the area near daybreak. Moisture will 
be limited again and have removed VCSH from the forecast due to 
the lack of confidence. Ceilings will lower as the front 
approaches due to low level convergence with the possibility of 
MVFR conditions at TRI between 13-18z. Winds will switch around to
the west behind the front and could gust up to around 20 kts with
the frontal passage.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

Surface low pressure was located over northern Missouri this
afternoon, with an associated cold front extending back to the
southwest across Kansas and parts of Oklahoma. This will shift
east overnight, with the cold front arriving around daybreak give
or take an hour or two. Later this evening some isolated to
scattered rain showers will likely push in from the west. Clouds
are already on the increase, and as the low level jet shifts
eastward into the CWA. Do have some slight chance PoPs in to
account for this, likely around midnight. Then later in the
night/early Sun morning there will be another round of showers
associated with the cold front as it moves through. There isn't
much in the way of moisture to work with here, and forecast PWAT 
values showing values of only about an inch. Behind the front, 
some gusty winds will be seen. They will remain below advisory 
levels, but a few gusts of 15-20 mph may be seen in the Tri-Cities
area especially, with lesser gusts the further south you go.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

Generally zonal flow in the mid/upper levels and southerly flow 
around a high off the East Coast of the United States will combine
to maintain benign/warm weather to end the weekend. The zonal 
flow will transition into a ridging pattern ahead of an 
approaching system. This will help to continue to increase 
temperatures about 10-15 degrees above normal for the first half 
of the work week. Closer to the surface the front that is expected
to stall out around the Southern Tennessee Valley will try and 
push back to the north on Monday. But with no additional influx of
moisture, expect it to remain pretty dry throughout the day. 
Generally a persistent pattern will continue through most of 
Monday/Tuesday.

With these warm temperatures the atmosphere is closer to what we 
typically see in the summer months with scattered convection 
possible on Wednesday. Best chances for precip will be closer to 
the terrain of the Southern Appalachian Mountains, but will 
maintain low end scattered chances throughout the valley. Similar 
situation looks to set up on Thursday, but with more moisture to 
work with and a more unstable environment closer to an approaching
cold front it looks like the coverage of storms will be greater, 
so have bumped up precipitation chances on Thursday evening.

Long range models all indicating that the front from the 
west/northwest will move through sometime around Thursday night 
into Friday. Timing is still a bit different between long term 
models, but right now the highest chances for precipitation look 
to occur during the daytime on Friday. Once the front moves 
through temperatures drop down close to normal.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Surface high pressure in control
today will allow for a quiet and dry day with mostly clear skies
and highs generally in the 70s across most valley locations. Then
Saturday night will see the approach of a weakening cold front.
Models continue to show little moisture associated with the front
and dynamic and lift are rather weak and the air mass should
remain fairly stable. As a result...will keep POPs around 20 and
though a stray rumble of thunder is possible...will see mainly
isolated shower activity moving in during the night.
Additionally...an 850MB jet accompanying the front of 30 to 40 KTs
will generate breezy and gusty winds over the higher elevations. 

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...A cold front will be 
crossing the area on Sunday morning. With moisture being very 
limited along the front, only a slight chance PoP will be 
mentioned Sunday morning. The front will be to our south and east 
by the end of the day, with high pressure over the Great Lakes 
extending over the area Sunday night.

The front pushes back to the north on Monday but with very little 
moisture to work with, no precip is expected. A high pressure ridge 
through the low and midlevels over the western Atlantic will provide 
a very warm pattern for Monday through Thursday, with highs each day 
reaching into the 80s. There may be just enough instability by 
Wednesday to allow for some afternoon convection to develop over the 
mountains and plateau, with perhaps a little better chance of 
showers in the Valley on Thursday. 

The general model concensus is that a shortwave trough will cross 
the Plains and approach our area on Friday, although the details of 
the amplification of this trough differ between the GFS and ECMWF. 
The models may also be weakening the strong Atlantic ridge too 
quickly. The forecast will carry chance PoPs Friday but will 
undercut the likely PoPs of the Superblend.

.AVIATION...The Southern Appalachian Region will be between weather 
systems for much of the TAF period.  This will allow for dry...VFR 
conditions with mostly clear skies tonight and high clouds moving in 
on Saturday.  Winds have decrease across the area but should remain 
slightly elevated tonight.  Saturday afternoon...winds should 
average around 10 KTs.  Saturday night will see the approach of a 
weakening cold front.  As it pushes into the area...expect an 
increase in mid and low level clouds.  Precipitation through 06Z 
should be quite minimal and for now will not mention in TAFs.

updates. Precip has exited northeast TN and southwest VA and have
removed all POPs for the rest of the night. Current hourly temps 
are running several degrees warmer than forecast but believe that 
is because the winds are still breezy. As the winds further lessen
temps will come back in line. Did not change overnight lows. Will

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...

Synoptic low over the Great Lakes region tracking towards the 
northeast with an associated cold front that is moving eastward out 
of our CWA. A few lingering showers this evening for the eastern 
mountains of Tennesee with a possible stray rumble of thunder due to 
ongoing upslope flow from the strong northwesterly winds. The 
ongoing CAA along with subsidence aloft will help to clear out the 
clouds behind the trough as the front moves to the east. The main 
weather of concern for the forecast period will be the high winds. A 
low level jet between 40-45 kts over the area this afternoon, 
combined with a tightening pressure gradient, has produced gusty 
winds for the valley with winds reaching advisory criteria for the 
higher elevations. Currently have a wind advisory out for the 
eastern mountains and foothills until 8:00pm tonight. Winds will 
calm overnight as the 850mb jet transitions to the leeward side of 
the mountains and the pressure gradient loosens. Warmer and drier 
conditions tomorrow due to few clouds and some mild ridging before 
the next system moves in.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...

A shortwave will zip across the the northern US states the second 
half of the weekend and into the work week. This will bring along 
with it a surface low tracking across the Ohio River Valley. 
Forecast soundings indicate that there won't be much Precipitable 
water to work with in this system, and what moisture is there will 
generally be confined to a shallow mid/low level layer with dry air 
above and below the saturated layer. So will continue with low end 
precipitation chances with light QPF amounts in the forecast. Front 
stalls out just south of the area and drier air from the 
west/northwest will help to quickly clear skies out by Sunday 
afternoon. This drier air doesn't pack much of a cooling punch as 
the cooler air never gets a chance to make it's way into the eastern 
Tennessee Valley

Ridging begins to build in from the west for the first half of the 
work week and in response temperatures will soar into the 80's for 
much of the Valley locations. Rain chances begin to increase 
starting on Thursday as a shortwave zips through the plains states 
and drags a cold front along with it. Forecast confidence decreases 
with this system as the long range models differ on how to handle 
the atmosphere ahead of this system, and when to actually push the 
front through. Will continue with slight to moderate rain chances, 
but we should be able to trim them down temporally as this system 
gets closer.

.DISCUSSION...

Frontal boundary moving through the CWA will bring in cooler
temperatures. Adjusted the max temp for today due to increasing
CAA and ongoing cloud cover. Clouds will be clearing out from a 
southwest to northeast progression, so temperatures around Bristol
and southwestern Virginia will be lower than around Chattanooga
due to lingering cloud cover. Winds today will be breezy in the 
valley while reaching advisory criteria for the higher elevations 
for the east Tennessee mountains. Most of the rain looks to be 
finished with some lingering showers for the eastern mountains and
foothills due to orographic lifting.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A low pressure system will
continue to push through and then exit the Southern Appalachian
Region today. The air mass has become rather stable and at best
may see a stray rumble of thunder. The rain should slowly push out
and exit from west to east this morning into early afternoon
followed by clouds decreasing during the afternoon. The main
concern today will be increasing winds. A tightening pressure
gradient and a 30 to 40 KT 850MB jet will generate breezy and
gusty winds across the area. Higher elevations of the East TN
Mountains are expected to see winds reach to advisory criteria and
a Wind Advisory has been issue for today for this area.
However...wind are already beginning to increase and so will begin
the Advisory with the morning package. The rest of the area will
see winds increase but expect gusts to reach around 30 MPH and
remain below advisory criteria. However...will monitor the winds
and re-evaluate if they become stronger that anticipated and in
the mean time will issue an SPS for the strong and gusty winds. By
this evening...most areas will be dry with clearing skies...with
only a few lingering isolated showers possible over far
northwestern locations. Winds will decrease this evening as the
low continue to pull away from the area.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...A low pressure system 
will track across IL/IN/OH late Saturday and Saturday evening, 
bringing a cold front across the area Saturday night. With the low
to midlevel flow ahead of this system being mainly westerly and 
the midlevel shortwave trough bring weakly amplified, the front 
will have very little moisture to work with. Forecast soundings 
show moisture confined above 700 mb, with very dry air below until
Sunday morning, then as the low levels moisten with fropa, the 
mid/upper levels quickly dry. The position of the jet stream well 
to the north will also mean that lift will be weak. So only slight
chance PoPs will be mentioned with the frontal passage Saturday 
night and Sunday morning. 

The front settles to our south on Sunday with the flow aloft 
remaining nearly zonal. With a lack of cold advection behind the 
front and mostly sunny skies, high temps Sunday will still be in the 
70s. A building ridge over the western Atlantic and Gulf will push 
the front back to our north on Monday, but no precip is expected 
with this as moisture remains very limited. The building ridge 
across the Southeast coast and the resulting SW flow across the 
Appalachians will bring a warming trend that will push highs into 
the 80s in most spots for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Superblend 
PoPs appear to high for the pattern and will be undercut these days. 
Models indicate some weakening of the ridge and a Midwest trough 
developing late in the week that may bring a chance of rain to the 
area Thursday, but will keep PoPs in the low chance range as 
confidence is low.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...

A developing upper level low, currently over the east central Great 
Plains, continues to track to the east northeast with an amplifying 
ridge over the east coast states that is trying to remain in place. 
A shortwave is located over the northern Great Plains moving east 
into the Great Lakes region with an old stalled out frontal boundary 
stuck over the Ohio valley. As the upper low in the south moves to 
the northeast, along with the northern shortwave, they look to begin 
to phase overnight eventually forming a greater amplitude longwave 
trough.

Ongoing southerly winds today will aid in increased WAA ahead of the 
incoming front, leading to more saturated lapse rates later this 
evening and overnight. A few scattered showers expected through the 
rest of the day for the southern areas of the CWA. The bulk of the 
precip will arrive later this evening and persist through most of 
the night. Some thunderstorms are possible this afternoon as MLCAPE 
values will hover around 400-600 J/kg according to the NAM, with 
MUCAPE values up to 1500 J/kg. A decent amount of deep layer shear 
between 30-40 kts, will give any thunderstorms some amount of 
organization with associated localized high winds. PW values up to 
1.25in will lead to some heavier rain showers this evening.

A southwest to northeast oriented low level jet between 40-50kts 
ahead of the front will increase surface winds for tonight, but 
doesn't look to reach advisory criteria with the flow parallel to 
the mountain range. The overnight timing of the front doesn't look 
to be good for maximizing most of the convective parameters.
Upper level divergence looking weaker today as opposed to yesterday, 
along with lowered Theta-e and diminishing CAPE into the overnight 
hours. There is some decent positive omega associated with the 
trough along with continued 30-40kt 0-6km shear so thunderstorms are 
possible for the early overnight hours. The front itself looks to 
move through the area early Friday morning, moving over CHA just 
after midnight and looks to be east of TRI after sunrise. 

Winds will become west to northwest after FROPA with increased CAA 
moving into the region behind the front. A tightening pressure 
gradient after FROPA along with an 850mb jet of 35kts will  produce 
windy conditions area wide Friday. The strengthening northwest flow 
Friday along with a saturated airmass to 700mb will produce good 
upslope conditions. Widespread rain showers will continue in the far 
east Tennessee and southwestern Virginia mountains.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...

A few light showers will linger early Friday night around far 
northeast TN and southwest VA from wrap around moisture on the 
backside of the departing upper trough. Kept slight chance pops 
through 03Z before high pressure begins to drop down from the 
northwest the rest of the night. Lows will be chilly with widespread 
low/mid 40's. Went slightly above MAV guidance.

The surface high will shift into the Carolinas Saturday with mid and 
upper level heights rebounding. This combined with the southerly 
return flow will allow temps to rebound into the mid 70's across 
much of the area with upper 70's in the southern valley. Trended a 
couple of degrees above MAV guidance for highs.

The only weather maker over the weekend will be a weakening cold 
front Saturday night into Sunday. Guidance continues to trend drier 
since our region will be on the tail end of a weakening shortwave 
trough and surface low moving through the northern OH Valley. 
Soundings show a couple hundred joules of CAPE, but with such 
limited frontogenetic forcing, only expect to see a broken line of 
very light showers. Have slight chance pops for showers with no 
thunder wording from 00Z Sunday through 18Z. There will be no 
airmass change behind the front, so highs will remain in generally 
the low/mid 70's Sunday afternoon. The weak frontal boundary looks 
to stall W-E along the TN, MS, AL, and GA borders Sunday afternoon 
and night. The latest GFS and ECMWF suggest a few scattered showers 
continuing near the boundary the rest of the afternoon, but with dry 
soundings and no real forcing mechanism, decided to keep all areas 
dry after 18Z Sunday through Sunday night.

As upper level troughing develops in the western U.S. early next 
week, an upper ridge will amplify in the Southeast U.S., reaching 
587 dam by Tuesday, with a strong surface high setting up near 
Bermuda. This will cause the stalled front to lift back north across 
the region Monday bringing the warmest temps of the season so far 
through mid week. The increasingly warm, humid, and unstable 
environment could lead to scattered convection as this front lifts 
through Monday, so have slight chance pops. Profiles look fairly 
capped Monday night through Tuesday night, so kept most areas dry, 
although isolated diurnal convection in the east TN mountains is 
possible, so have chance pops in that area during the day Tuesday.

Confidence is low for the Wednesday and Thursday timeframe. The 
ridge will be slowly breaking down allowing a cold front to approach 
from the west, but the timing is in poor agreement among the models. 
Given the moist and unstable environment, this front will be 
convectively active. Due to the uncertainty on timing and potential 
outflow boundaries ahead of the synoptic front, just ran chance pops 
for showers and storms Wednesday and Thursday.

surface cold front, thus cigs will slowly continue to lower 
throughout the period. Moving into the afternoon, mixing will 
favor increased swly flow with some low end gusting favored at 
CHA/TYS. Cigs will lower to low VFR or MVFR into the 
afternoon/evening hours as CAMs favor intrusion of convection, 
possibly with enough instability for ts. Late in the period 
precipitation chances ramp up further as the front itself moves in,
therefore shra was prevailed amidst MVFR cigs/visb at all sites 
with timing based on CAMs.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
An amplified upper pattern highlights the synoptic setup this 
morning as a closed H5 cyclone moves eastward atop the ArkLaTex 
region, effectively working to suppress the upper ridge anchored 
over the extreme southeast CONUS, while another northern stream 
shortwave moves eastward across the Northern Plains and Upper 
Midwest states.  At the surface, high pressure beneath the 
aforementioned upper ridge continues to hold across the TN Valley 
and Southern Appalachian region (albeit weakening with time), and an 
old frontal axis remains stalled atop the OH Valley region.  

The forecast today/tonight will be highlighted by the intrusion of 
the upper low and its associated/deepening surface low and front. 
Guidance favors increasing moisture through the profile as deep swly 
waa prevails out ahead of these features, which will inherently 
favor increasing precipitation chances as the period evolves. 
Specifically, am expecting iso/sct showers this morning across the 
western tier of the fcst area given proximity to the deepest 
moisture at present time. However as the entire complex shifts east, 
mid lvl lapse rates will steepen a bit, which combined with daytime 
heating will favor at least modest MUCAPE (1-1.5k j/kg) this 
afternoon. With that, iso/sct showers and thunderstorms will be 
possible this afternoon especially along/north of I40 and along/west 
of I75 given further proximity from the upper ridge and any 
associated CIN. Deep layer shear isn't off the charts, however 
respectable at around 30-40kts, therefore some weak organization of 
a few storms cannot be ruled out, but overall think the primary 
threats will be cloud to ground lightning and brief heavy rainfall.  

Moving into the evening/overnight hours, the focus shifts away from 
any prefrontal convection to that associated with the frontal 
intrusion itself.  CAMs favor the front moving east across Middle TN 
around midnight (give or take a hour) with the surface low and 
prefrontal trough out ahead across the Great Valley. Am expecting an 
overall decreasing trend in coverage ahead of these features, 
however ramping back up as they arrive.  Weak upper divergence and a 
40-50kt llj will accompany this second round of convection, however 
instability will be at a premium given nocturnal timing, and 
elevated at that.  Thus, although llv winds look a little better and 
coverage will be greater, think the lack of instability will be a 
significant detraction from deep/organized frontal convection.  That 
said, did include thunder in the forecast for the overnight period 
with a few strong storms packing gusty winds, brief heavy rainfall, 
and cloud to ground lightning not to be ruled out.  

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
Expect to see some ongoing shower activity as we move into the 
extended period. An exiting low pressure system responsible for 
the showers will slowly push east and out of the area during the 
morning to possible early afternoon hours on Friday. At this 
point...the air mass will be rather stable and the upper level 
support will be diminishing. As a result... expect little 
potential for thunder. Additionally...the deep moisture associated
with the system will also have decreased and any additional 
rainfall amount should be minimal...generally less than a quarter 
inch. A stray light shower may linger over far northeastern 
locations Friday evening. Otherwise...behind the system...surface 
high pressure builds in for dry conditions for much of Friday 
night and into Saturday. The next system will move in Saturday 
night into Sunday. Models continue to show this as a weakening 
system with minimal moisture or lift associated with it. As 
such...expect a broken...scattered band of mainly light showers 
moving through. By mid day Sunday...surface high pressure builds 
back in for a return to a dry weather pattern. Model consistency 
remains rather poor for the end of the extended period. A rather 
strong upper ridge is expected to build in for dry and warming 
conditions Monday and Tuesday. However...is looks to be a rather 
dirty ridge as a series of weather disturbance ride along the 
upper flow to our north. This may bring increased clouds into at 
least northern areas while current models trends keep associated 
shower activity to our north. Additionally...model are indicating 
the potential for another system to be approaching the region 
around the Wednesday time frame. Confidence quite low on details 
and timing and for now...will continue with a slight chance/chance
of convection in the forecast.

243 PM EDT Wed Apr 24 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Thursday night)...

The overall synoptic outlook today features a low pressure system 
over southeastern Canada that continues to move eastward with a 
trailing cold front that has since stalled over the Ohio Valley. A 
low over the southern Great Plains tracking east northeast and 
strong ridging over our area will lead to increased WAA as winds 
begin veering more towards the south ahead of the approaching low. 
The low over the southern plains will further develop from ongoing 
cyclogenesis as it moves towards our CWA, eventually phasing with 
the stalled boundary to the north and forming a deep trough. Models 
are currently not in complete agreement as to the track of this low. 
The ECMWF show it remaining more south and tracking eastward, while 
the NAM, SREF, and GFS depict the low continuing towards the 
northeast and overtaking the stalled front to the north. Leaning 
away from the Euro at the moment since it is currently the only one 
in disagreement.

Showers and possible thunderstorms ahead of the front on Thursday 
afternoon for the more northern counties of the CWA and progressing 
southward through the rest of the day as the low pulls the stalled 
front to the south and begins to phase. A low level jet ahead of the 
front will produce some gusty winds on Thursday night, but the setup 
and orientation doesn't look to cause a downsloping wind event as
the winds will be mostly parallel to the mountain range. Some of
the higher elevations could see sustained winds of 20 to 22 mph
for a couple hours early Friday morning. Models indicate some
decent upper level divergence from the incoming upper level trough
of the 300mb jet overnight. Modest theta-e from the ongoing WAA
and the 40 to 50 knot low level jet will help form a broken line
of convection ahead of the front. However, the timing of the line
paired with decreasing MLCAPE values around 300, and 0-6km shear
below 30 knots will lead to any convection being rather
disorganized. A few areas of heavy rain are also possible with PW
values for most of the area between 1.25in to 1.50in.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...

Showers will slowly exit to the east Friday morning as the cold 
front advances east. Timing has slowed compared to past model runs, 
so have likely pops from 12-15Z, then tapering to chance from west 
to east through the rest of the morning and afternoon. Profiles look 
stable, so will leave thunder wording out of the forecast. Highs 
Friday will be 5-10 degrees cooler in the CAA and trough aloft with 
generally low/mid 70's.

The upper level trough will slowly move east Friday night allowing a 
surface ridge to build in from the northwest. Subsidence will lead 
to mainly clear skies, so expect decent radiational cooling with 
widespread low/mid 40's areawide, except low 50's in the southern 
valley. The surface high will shift into the Carolinas Saturday 
allowing heights to rise and return southerly flow. This will bring 
upper 70's back to most of the region with the Chattanooga area 
pushing 80 once again. Went a few degrees above MAV guidance for 
highs Saturday. Should be a great day for outdoor activities.

A northern stream trough moving into the Great Lakes will force a 
weakening cold front across the region Saturday night into Sunday. 
Forcing and moisture ahead of the boundary are limited, and the new 
GFS and ECMWF are even weaker than previous runs. Expect to only see 
a band of scattered, mainly light, showers move through Saturday 
night through Sunday morning, so have chance pops for that period. 
Subsidence behind the weak front should allow some sunshine and 
continued above normal temps Sunday afternoon with no airmass 
change. 

The already warm temps will warm to much above normal levels Monday 
through Wednesday as the pattern strongly amplifies with a deepening 
trough near the west coast and strong ridge developing over the 
Southeast. The classic summertime Bermuda high will set up in this 
pattern and pump very warm and humid air into east TN, southwest VA, 
and southwest NC. The first upper 80's of the season are quite 
possible, especially in the southern valley. Guidance is in poor 
agreement in terms of shower/storm chances. An active frontal 
boundary will wobble back and forth around the Mississippi valley, 
but day to day placement will likely be influenced by convective 
outflows. Have chance to slight chance pops for showers/storms 
Monday tied to a warm front lifting north, but keeping Tuesday and 
Wednesday dry as of now. Went above Superblend for highs and lows 
early next week.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The synoptic pattern this morning is highlighted by southern 
stream deep ridging across the southeast states and a closed upper 
low moving across NW Mexico, which combined with the eastern ridge 
axis is promoting deep swly flow aloft across the TN Valley and 
Southern Appalachians.  As for the northern stream, another closed 
H5 cyclone continues to eject across the Eastern Great Lakes region, 
which has driven a surface cold front into the OH Valley, where it 
has since stalled.  Pattern evolution through the short term will be 
highlighted by the acceleration of the southern stream closed low 
eastward.  As this occurs later this afternoon/evening, rapid 
surface cyclogenesis is progged across the ArkLaTex region as the 
upper low migrates east, effectively working to suppress the eastern 
ridge as well.  Tonight, waa will ramp up therefore favoring 
increasingly saturated profiles into periods ending.  Guidance 
favors some weak vorticity ejecting from the parent cyclone and 
working across the TN Valley overnight tonight, thus did include 
slight chance pops for the western half of the coverage area. Lapse 
rates look rather poor therefore no thunder was mentioned. 
Otherwise, expecting another partly cloudy day with highs in the 
upper 60s to low/mid 70s over the high terrain and upper 70s to 
low/mid 80s in the valley.  

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)... 
Initially...an old stalled boundary will be in place along the 
Ohio Valley and into Kentucky. On Thursday...this feature will act
as a focus for shower activity with possibly a stray rumble of 
thunder as a weak impulse rides through. However...an approaching 
cold front will eventually move in. Models continue to struggle 
with timing of the front but I generally lean towards the main 
band of convection moving in Thursday evening into the overnight 
hours. Models also show differences in details as to how well the 
front and the old boundary will come into phase. At this 
time...the instability is expected to be limited...especially with
late evening and overnight timing. However...decent upper level 
dynamics and a 30 to 40 KT 850MB jet will aid the development of a
line of convection. Though a strong cell can not be ruled 
out...overall do not anticipated strong to severe thunderstorm 
activity as the line moves through. Also...with PWs in the inch to
inch and a half range...locally brief heavy rainfall will be 
possible. The front and associated activity will slowly pull out 
of the Southern Appalachian Region on Friday with dry conditions 
and high pressure building in for Friday night and Saturday. The 
next system will move in Saturday night into Sunday. This system 
appears to be weakening as it approaches with limited moisture and
minimal energy available...generally believe this will generate a
scattered line of showers with some embedded thunderstorm 
activity. Model consistency decreases by the end of the period and
confidence becomes quite low. Models indicate a short wave moving
in around the Tuesday time frame. At the moment this it look 
rather unorganized and for now will keep things in the slight 
chance

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...

An upper level low over the eastern Great Lakes region is currently 
tracking towards the east. A trailing cold front originating from 
the low looks to stall out just north of our CWA by tonight. 
Confidence as to where the stalled front will eventually settle is 
moderate since the models are still in slight disagreement.

Current ridging over the region along with strong southwesterly 
flow, scattered clouds, and deep layer mixing today will cause the 
high temperatures to be a few degrees higher than the seasonal 
average. Mid level moisture advection, associate with the 
southwesterly flow, will bring in increased cloud cover this evening 
leading to higher overnight lows than the previous night.

The stalled boundary will drop southward tomorrow morning increasing 
clouds and causing a few possible showers for southwestern Virginia. 
Wednesday afternoon has a slight chance of a few thunderstorms for 
northeast Tennessee and southwestern Virginia, but confidence is on 
the low side due to model soundings showing low amounts of CAPE.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...

Wednesday night into Thursday, a northern stream upper trough will 
dig into the northern Plains as a separate southern stream trough 
moves through Texas and Louisiana. At the surface, a nearly 
stationary front will be stretched out in the vicinity of Kentucky 
and the Ohio valley. Disturbances riding through the split flow 
along this boundary will bring scattered showers and thunderstorms 
to far northern TN and southwest VA. Very limited ML CAPE and only 
30 kts of 0-6 km shear parallel to the boundary will keep any 
thunderstorms mainly disorganized, and suspect the more widespread 
activity will stay to the north across KY. However, PWAT values of 1 
to 1.25 inches will support brief heavy downpours in locations that 
get under a shower or storm. Have chance to slight chance pops in 
the far north Wednesday night slowly expanding southward into the 
remainder of the region Thursday morning into the afternoon.

As we move into late Thursday afternoon and Thursday night, the 
northern and southern stream troughs will attempt to phase while 
moving eastward through the TN and OH valleys, eventually resulting 
in a long-wave trough over the eastern U.S. for the end of the week. 
This will force a cold front southeastward which will overrun the 
old stationary front and slowly cross the region late Thursday into 
Friday. Coverage of showers/storms with this system is lower 
confidence. The latest NAM, ECMWF, and GFS are faster to bring the 
front toward the plateau Thursday afternoon compared to previous 
runs, but there remains disagreement on how much phasing of the two 
troughs will take place, with the NAM notably showing the energy 
staying separate and passing north and south of our region. Thinking 
that a more phased solution will likely be the outcome, so am 
hedging the forecast toward the GFS and ECMWF with likely pops 
reaching the plateau Thursday afternoon then likely pops all areas 
Thursday night. Severe weather is not anticipated, but a couple of 
stronger cells with locally gusty winds could occur. Shear profiles 
will be unidirectional on the order of 35-40 kts 0-6 Km and 15-20 
kts 0-1 Km Thursday evening into the overnight, but CAPE will 
quickly decrease after the strongest shear moves in overnight. Mid 
level lapse rates are flat at only 5-6 C/Km. These factors should 
result in a band of showers and embedded thunder moving west to east 
Thursday evening and overnight with brief heavy downpours given 
PWATS of 1 to 1.50 inches.

Chance pops for showers will linger in the 12-18Z block Friday as 
the cold front slowly exits to the east. Highs will be a solid 10 
degrees cooler with the trough aloft and CAA pattern, but we will 
see sunshine for the afternoon. Surface high pressure and rising 
heights aloft move in Friday night and Saturday to allow for mainly 
clear skies and a warming trend.

A weak and moisture starved cold front looks to cross the region 
sometime Saturday night or Sunday. Timing remains in poor agreement 
among the models, but this front is tied to a fairly shallow 
northern stream upper trough to our north, so forcing across the TN 
valley will be limited resulting in only widely scattered 
showers/storms. Brought in slight chance to chance pops after 00Z 
Sunday and carried that through the 12-18Z block Sunday morning. 

High pressure Sunday afternoon through Monday will bring dry weather 
and continued warmth as heights quickly rise again. The next system 
will approach from the west Monday night and Tuesday. Timing is 
highly uncertain, so just have slight chance to chance pops covering 
this timeframe.

.DISCUSSION...

Only a few changes for this mornings update. Slower to warm up
in a few areas of east Tennessee as the cooler air from overnight
remains at the surface. Should warm up quickly later in the day 
as the cloud won't build into east Tennessee until later this 
afternoon. Forecast highs for today still look good with most of 
the CWA reaching just into the 80's. Surface winds look to 
increase this afternoon with TYS and TRI reaching over 10mph 
before veering towards the west and calming overnight.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A northern stream wave currently over Lake Michigan will continue 
sliding east and thus push an associated cold front southward into 
the OH Valley, all while deep swly flow in the southern stream lofts 
mid/upr moisture atop the southeast CONUS.  With that, deep ridging 
will prevail across the TN Valley and Southern Appalachian region 
today with partly cloudy skies (by way of mid/high cirrus) keeping 
temperatures in the upper 60s to low/mid 70s across the high terrain 
with upper 70s to lower 80s favored in the valley.  Winds today will 
veer southerly, generally holding in the 5-10mph range.  Tonight the 
aforementioned OH Valley cold front will stall, possibly pushing 
some lower stratus and perhaps a few showers into southwest VA, 
therefore did include higher sky cover and slight chance pops for 
such.  Overnight lows in the 40s across the high terrain and 
mid/upper 50s in the valley are fcst. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...
Models continue to show some disagreement with the position of a 
weakening frontal boundary expected to be stretched somewhere 
along the Ohio Valley early in the extended. A couple of minor 
impulses riding along this boundary could bring a few isolated 
showers to mainly northern locations Wednesday into Thursday. The 
main system of concern this extended will be an approaching cold 
front. This front will eventually move in and will meet up the the
residual boundary as it moves into the Southern Appalachian 
Region Thursday night into Friday. Current models indicate rather 
weak instability associated with the system but decent upper 
dynamics and a 850MB jet of 30 to 40 Kts providing some weak low 
level shear. This should be enough to generate a band of 
widespread showers with scattered embedded thunderstorms. High 
pressure builds in for Friday night into Saturday for a return to 
dry conditions. Confidence become quite low by the end of the 
period but models are indicating the next system moving in around 
the Saturday night/Sunday time frame. At this time...the system 
looks rather weak and for now will only mention isolated to 
scattered thunderstorm potential and will keep Monday dry.

.DISCUSSION...
Observations and WV imagery show the closed low off the New
England coast with an upper-level 500mb ridge axis extending from
the Southern Mississippi Valley northeastward across the eastern 
Great Lakes. A well-defined shortwave across the Upper Mississippi
Valley is moving eastward toward the Great Lakes with a large 
longwave trough across the Desert Southwest. Our area remains 
under the eastern edge of the upper ridge with strong subsidence 
leading to dry weather and a clear sky. Starting to see some
cirrus moving into West and Middle Tennessee, but think they will
be slow to arrive in our area until late tonight or Tuesday.

Current obs continue to show dry air near the surface and dew
points lower than guidance this afternoon during peak heating
hours as drier air aloft mixed out the shallow moisture indicated
in guidance. With the dry air and another clear night, lowered
minimum temperatures for tonight by a degree or two in most spots.

On Tuesday, shortwaves emerging from the 500mb longwave trough 
across the SW CONUS will provide PVA across the area with upper- 
level height falls and increasing mid-level lapse rates. Will see
some additional mid to upper level clouds by the afternoon
associated with this, generally near or above 20k feet. However, 
with surface high pressure and a low-level 850-700mb ridge 
centered to our south, low-level moisture return will be limited.
Raised temperatures generally a degree or two for Tuesday with 
max temperatures expected to be a few degrees warmer as 850mb 
temperatures increase and low-level 850-700mb thickness values are
2-6m greater. The most noticeable warmup compared to today should
be across northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...An upper level trough will 
move east across the Great Lakes while dragging a weak cold front 
from the Plains into the Ohio Valley through the short term. Very 
few clouds will be around tonight, but there will be an increase 
in moisture around 20k feet and higher on Tuesday in association 
with a southern stream long wave trough shifting slowly east from 
the Sonoran Desert into the Texas Big Bend. The cirrus layer 
should be relatively thin, so sunshine will still be abundant on 
Tuesday. The surface is warmer this afternoon from the lengthy 
period of sunshine but radiation in a calm wind, basically clear 
sky environment, should allow temperatures to drop to the upper 
40s and lower 50s by daybreak Tuesday. The beautiful ridge over 
the eastern states will be suppressed just a bit as that Great 
Lakes short wave trough builds east, but it will hold over the 
Southeastern U.S. keeping very nice weather in place across the 
Southern Appalachian region through the day Tuesday. Highs will be
about five to eight degrees above normal in the upper 70s and 
lower 80s.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Monday)...The long term outlook
starts off as a weak ridge continues to move off shore to the 
east. The tail end of a cold front originating from an upper level
low over southeastern Canada stalling out over the Ohio Valley. 
Models aren't in great agreement as to where the stationary front 
will eventually settle. The ECMWF places it over the Central Ohio 
Valley, while the NAM12 and GFS depict it further to the south 
over Kentucky and southwest Virginia. In either case, expect 
temperatures to be a few degrees warmer than the seasonal norm for
mid week while we are stuck in the warmer airmass. Wednesday 
afternoon will be our first chance for some showers over northeast
Tennessee and southwest Virginia as models show a stationary 
front dipping towards the south over our area.

On Thursday a developing low over the American southwest will track 
eastward across TX which will pull the stationary front northward. 
Isentropic lifting will lead to periods of showers over the northern 
portion of the CWA. Models indicate limited instability values with 
CAPEs between 300 to 500 J/kg. A better chance for thunderstorms 
looks to be on Thursday night as the cold front moves through the 
area. Increasing jet dynamics and a frontal boundary will increase 
coverage of showers and possible thunderstorms.

Typical post frontal CAA will lead to cooler and more seasonal 
temperatures for Friday and Saturday with warm, moist southerly flow 
returning on Sunday ahead of another broad trough moving through the 
Great Lakes region. Another round of showers and possible 
thunderstorms for either Sunday or Monday as a frontal boundary 
approaches southwestern Virginia and northern Tennessee.

protective ridging at the surface and aloft. Wind will be light
and variable within the influence of the ridge and clouds almost
non-existent; with the minor exception of a wee bit of thin 
cirrus pushing out ahead of an Upper Midwest trough. Subsidence
within the ridge and an extended period of insolation should help
boost temperatures a good five to six degrees above normal this

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Couldn't really ask for a nicer day than what we have in store on 
Monday.  Heights continue to rise aloft as H5 ridging shifts east 
while surface high pressure dominates across the TN Valley and 
Southern Appalachian region.  Modest radiational cooling this 
morning combined with calm flow and poor mixing of dewpoints 
yesterday afternoon will favor some patchy fog.  Generally in the 
river valleys, mainly along/north of I40 given ample mixing 
yesterday in the lower valley.  Otherwise, light/calm winds are 
expected through much of the day given weak PGFs, while dry profiles 
favor sunny skies.  High temperatures will top out in the mid/upper 
60s across the high terrain, upper 70s to around 80 in the valley. 
Dry profiles will prevail once again tonight keeping skies clear 
with low temperatures being around 5-7 degrees warmer than this 
morning. Dewpoints are progged to improve somewhat as well, 
therefore could be looking at another foggy night tonight into 
Tuesday morning.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...
Ridging continues to be the main influence of the weather for the
first half of the work week with Tuesday looking to be the 
warmest day for the next 7 days with temperatures climbing into 
the 80's in parts of the Tennessee Valley. Temperatures through 
the remainder of this work week and into the weekend will remain 
pretty persistent with daytime highs in the 70's and overnight 
low's in the 50's which is slightly above normal for this time of 
year.

Precipitation chances will enter the forecast for the first time on 
Wednesday as the ridge flattens out from a trough zipping through 
the Great Lakes Region. A frontal boundary will make a run at the 
area during the middle of the week but will lose steam and stall out 
somewhere across the Central Ohio Valley. Depending on where this 
front stalls out we could see some spotty showers during the middle 
of the week.

Better chances for precipitation will have to wait until a low 
pressure system is able to move across the Gulf States during the 
second half of the week. Depending on the track of the low and where 
the remnants of that stalled frontal boundary are, we will likely 
see showers and thunderstorms at some point on Thursday/Friday. 
models are still honing in on the track of the low and the location 
of the frontal boundary, so future forecasts may change the timing 
of the best chances of precipitation.

.DISCUSSION...
Cutoff upper low continues to pester the East Coast with
increasing heights building in from the west. With high pressure 
at the surface and ridging aloft, WV imagery shows subsidence across
the region bringing a clear sky and dry weather tonight. With 
calm winds, should have efficient radiational cooling tonight. 
Additionally, will have the potential of some fog development 
across portions of NE TN and SW VA where dew point depressions are
lower, and this is also where MAV and LAV guidance indicates 
potential for fog development. Elsewhere, the air is very dry and 
believe any fog development, beyond very shallow fog at the 
surface, is unlikely.

With the very dry airmass under the ridge of high pressure, will 
see temperatures warm quickly on Monday. With an 850mb ridge 
building in across the region and a well-mixed boundary layer, 
should see temperatures warm significantly over observed max 
temperatures today. As high pressure and ridging remain over the 
area, a clear and sunny sky is expected.

Made adjustments to hourly grids. Dew points have been lower this
evening across western portions of the CWA. Looking at forecast
soundings, models have been too high with surface dew points 
during peak heating hours as drier air just above the surface
mixed out any near surface moisture that guidance was showing. 
Have seen some recovery since sunset, and have updated Td with 
current obs. In addition, lowered sky cover to reflect the clear 
to mostly clear sky across the entire forecast area with the 
exception of the far Northeastern Tennessee mountains.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...
Stubborn low clouds have hung on though mid afternoon across parts 
of northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia. Weak surface flow is 
not helping scour clouds as broad area of high pressure has moved 
over eastern states behind departing upper low. Temperatures vary 
widely with 60s to lower 70s in the sunny central and southeast and 
only lower to mid 50s cloudy areas including at NWS MRX office. 
For the rest of the afternoon the clouds will continue to erode 
with all areas mostly clear by sunset. Then another cool night 
with lows in the 40s...upper 30s in some of the higher sheltered 
valleys. Patchy fog will likely form across parts of the southern 
valley and more of the northeastern half where limited sun 
occurred today. Highs much warmer Monday in the 70s to around 80 
degrees which will be most noticeable across northeast Tennessee 
and southwest Virginia where clouds have kept temperatures down 
into mid afternoon today.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
Very few changes to this period of the forecast are expected with
models showing above normal temperatures through Thursday 
compliments of a ridge pattern which provides for some decent 
insolation. The early week ridge flattens a tad on Wednesday, as 
an upper level trough shifts from the Great Lakes into the 
Northeastern U.S. A weak frontal boundary will accompany this 
feature into the Central Appalachians on Wednesday. The superblend
concept allowed for the possibility of a shower across the 
northern half of the forecast area in an area of weak convergence 
and weak instability ahead of this boundary. Model forecasts are 
still trending a little more south with the passage of an upper 
low deep in Dixie. The probability of showers and even 
thunderstorms increases Thursday into Thursday night with the 
possibility of phasing of a northern stream upper trough and cold 
front across the northeastern quarter of the nation. Increasing 
moisture advection and convergence with this synoptic feature 
should provide for the highest probability of precipitation in the
seven day forecast. Drier air follows behind this system for the 
weekend with a pleasant springtime warming trend.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Low pressure system that's been the main driver of the weather over 
the past several days is finally making progress in moving off to 
the northeast. Still some lingering showers on the backside of the 
low with weather stations reporting drizzle or light rain. Expect 
showers like this to continue through much of the overnight hours 
with precipitation finally ending shortly after sunrise. 

Temperatures in the higher elevations are still hovering around 
freezing and we could see some additional light snowfall 
accumulations as showers run into the Southern Appalachian 
Mountains. Still looks like locations above 3500 have the best 
chance for this accumulating snowfall. 

As the low pressure system keeps moving to the northeast skies will 
continue to clear out. Skies around Chattanooga are seeing breaks 
in the cloud coverage and expect that trend to continue to the 
northeast through the rest of the night and into tomorrow. These 
clearing skies may allow temperatures to drop close to the dewpoint 
and allow patchy fog to develop. There may be a few very isolated 
locations that see temperatures drop low enough to see frost 
develop, right now the highest threat for frost looks to be along 
the Cumberland Plateau down into the Sequatchie Valley. Based on 
current observations and expected weather conditions closer to 
sunrise it seems like there's not enough of a widespread threat to 
need to issue a frost advisory at this time. Also we may begin to
see patchy fog develop during the early morning hours, but a lot
of this will depend on how fast clouds are able to move out.

With the clearing skies and mid level ridging we're going to warm up 
pretty quickly once the sun comes out. Temperatures are expected 
rise about 10-20 degrees warmer than what we saw on Saturday. 

Rivers levels across the area are continuing downward trend from 
earlier heavy precipitation. The few rivers that we have still in 
minor flood or action stage are forecasted to drop below action 
stage during the day today.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...
The extended range forecast period kicks off on Monday morning 
amidst the departure of a closed H5 cyclone into the Western 
Atlantic, while deep ridging builds across the OH/TN Valleys and 
Southern Appalachian region.  Further west, broad southern stream 
troughing will dominate atop the Four Corners states as a northern 
stream shortwave slides eastward across the Upper Midwest.  At the 
surface, high pressure will prevail over the southeast beneath 
confluent flow aloft downstream of the primary H5 ridge, which will 
also drive sly waa into the MS Valley.  Lastly, a weak surface wave 
beneath the H5 northern stream shortwave will usher a cold front 
eastward into the Central Plains and Upper MS Valley.  

Pattern evolution through midweek will feature continued deep 
ridging over the southeast CONUS while the northern stream H5 
shortwave and consequent surface low slide through the Great Lakes 
with the associated cold front laying nearly zonal across the OH 
Valley.  The southern stream Four Corner trough looks to deepen and 
move east into the ArkLaTex initiating surface cyclogenesis over the 
Lower MS Valley.  All in all, a drier and warmer period is favored 
across east TN and southwest NC/VA through early/mid Wednesday, with 
pops increasing slightly along/north of I40 late on Wednesday given 
uncertain proximity of the OH Valley front (which the GFS pushes 
further southward than the ECMWF).  Temperatures through midweek 
will be around 8-10 degrees above normal levels.

Moving forward into late week, the southeast ridge becomes 
suppressed as the primary southern stream H5 cyclone moves through 
the gulf coast states, all while another northern stream shortwave 
moves through the central/northern Plains into the Great Lakes 
region.  At this range the operational guidance does continue to 
exhibit some minor discontinuities regarding the track/depth of the 
southern cyclone, as well as any phasing with the northern stream 
features.  Nevertheless, increased pops for showers/thunderstorms on 
Thursday and through Friday are warranted as the cold fropa occurs 
to round out the period, clearing the way for dry high pressure on 
Saturday.  Late week Temperatures will cool slightly given ridge 
erosion, additional sky cover, precipitation, and finally the cold 
fropa. Expect levels around or slightly above normal.

.DISCUSSION...
WV imagery and 0z soundings show the large cutoff upper low
centered over the Central Appalachians and surface observations
show a weak surface low located across the Northeast. Showery
convection this afternoon under the upper low has mostly
dissipated with the loss of daytime heating with only scattered residual
showers and drizzle this evening. This upper low is forecast to 
slowly meander eastward and continue to weaken over the next 
24-hours, but it will be slow to do so with it being cutoff from 
the main westerly flow. Upper-level ridging will continue to build
in from the west tonight and Sunday with subsidence across the 
region and clearing from west to east. We may continue to hold 
onto some low clouds across NE TN and SW VA through midday Sunday,
but clouds should decrease through the afternoon as high pressure
continues to build into the region and the upper-low shifts 
further east.

Our area rivers have crested after recent rainfall and continue 
to fall. The Pigeon River has fallen below flood stage, so the 
warning has been allowed to expire. The French Broad is forecast 
to remain in minor flood stage through Sunday morning as water 
levels continue to fall.

Collaborated with neighboring offices about the frost freeze
program. There is not enough confidence for an impactful frost or
freeze to issue any products for these hazards tonight. We will 
have some locations drop near or below freezing, but this will 
predominantly be in our highest elevations at or above 3500 feet.
With the extensive cloud cover for most of the night and near 
saturation close to the surface, currently do not see the 
likelihood of any widespread impactful frost. Clouds will likely 
clear across the Sequatchie Valley and Southern Cumberland Plateau
late tonight which might allow some very patchy frost, but 
forecast coverage is too low for any product at this time.

Made minor adjustments to hourly forecast elements and decreased 
PoPs quicker tonight and Sunday morning.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...
The upper low has moved little since this morning and was still 
bringing light rain showers to the lower elevations and snow showers 
at the highest elevations this afternoon. Winds were southwest 10 to 
20 mph with temperatures at mid afternoon in the mid 40s to near 50 
lower elevations and 30s above about 4000 feet. The upper low will 
only move very slowly north to northeast tonight. The lower clouds 
around it extend west to the Tennessee River west of Nashville and 
cover most of northern AL. Skies will stay mostly cloudy this 
evening and then slowly clear from southwest to northeast after 
midnight. Expect low clouds to hang on in the morning across the 
northeast half of the area. This will affect sunrise services. 
Temperatures will be down around 40 again early Sunday with near 
freezing in the highest elevations. Parts of the southern plateau 
and southwest North Carolina mountains will drop into the 30s with 
clearing on the plateau but not confident enough that enough area 
will have frost to warrant a frost advisory. An additional inch of 
snow also may accumulate in the Smokies about 5000 feet this 
evening. Lowered temperatures a few degrees Sunday as influence of 
upper low still keeps cooler airmass over part of the region Sunday 
morning with lingering clouds. Highs will warm into the mid 50s 
northeast to around 70 at Chattanooga.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...
The extended period of the forecast holds together, in terms of 
model consensus, quite well through Wednesday with some most 
pleasant ridging and associated dry weather. Later in the period, 
forecast uncertainty increases to a degree with differences in how
quickly and how deep a southern stream feature will become as it 
progresses through the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeastern 
U.S. This forecast applies slight through lower chance pops for 
some showers later Wednesday night into Thursday with increasing 
moisture and instability available for the arrival of another 
upper level low across the Deep South later Thursday night into 
Friday. The highest probabilities were forecast for this period 
with decreasing chance of showers into the first half of the 
weekend. It will feel like Spring again with very pleasant highs 
in the 70s and even lower 80s with lows mainly in the 50s.

Closed upper low has moved over eastern KY and the extreme
northeast part of the forecast area. light rain showers are
rotating around it into the northeast and southwest parts of the
forecast area this morning. Only small amounts of precipitation
has fallen in the past 3 to 6 hours with most of it across
northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia. Temperatures at late
morning are in the mid to upper 40s lower elevations but in the
30s higher elevations and around freezing or slightly lower in the
highest mountains above 5000 feet. Newfound Gap at this time is 32
with a trace of snow in the parking lot and the Clingmans Dome 
Web Cam showing more than a trace. Expect snow to continue all day
highest elevations and this evening as shortwave energy rotates 
around upper low into the mountains. Have updated hourly 
temperatures and dew points and have some lowering of temperatures
northeast part in the afternoon as colder air from upper low gets
farther east. Changed precipitation chances somewhat to account
for the rotation of showers around upper low. With daytime 
heating expect a little more significant showers to develop for 
the afternoon. Coverage to vary from chance to likely as the bands
rotate around the upper low. Updated forecast sent.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Low is spinning almost directly over the area early this morning, 
with most of the wrap around precipitation still off to our west 
across Middle Tennessee. As the low begins to move off to the 
northeast this precipitation will eventually move into the Tennessee 
Valley and Cumberland Plateau. Rainfall amounts are still expected 
to be much lighter through the rest of the weekend, with most places 
seeing less than 0.5 inches of additional precipitation.

Heavy rainfall across parts of Eastern Tennessee and Western North 
Carolina have caused rapid rises on some rivers in East Tennessee. 
River gauges are showing that most rivers have crested and forecast 
from the River Forecast Center show that hopefully rivers continue 
to recede through the remainder of the night and into tomorrow.

Coldest day of the forecast will be today with colder air moving in 
from the north/west and mostly cloudy skies keeping todays HIGH 
temperature close to our climatological LOW temperature for this 
time of year. 

These colder temperatures look to drop below freezing in the highest 
elevations of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Spotty weather 
stations in the higher elevations are showing that temperatures are 
remaining a bit warmer than previously anticipated, which will help 
lower accumulating snowfall totals. Still looks like locations with 
elevations above 3500 feet have the best chance to see accumulating 
snowfall. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...
The extended range forecast initializes Sunday morning as the pesky 
upper low responsible for the last few days worth of rainfall finally 
migrates northeast into the Central/Northern Appalachians, and 
ridging builds atop the Plains.  Further west, another upper 
disturbance looks to take shape as broader troughing deepens over 
the Rockies.  At the surface, high pressure will prevail amidst 
rising heights aloft across the southeast states, while a waa regime 
sets up across the Southern Plains and Lower MS Valley.  Moving on, 
overall the pattern will feature deep ridging over East TN and 
Southwest NC/VA through Tuesday into Wednesday.  With that, 
expecting dry conditions for the most part, albeit with the possible 
exception of some mountain top convection on Tuesday (slight 
chances) given modest heating.  Highs will reach nearly two 
categories above normal.

By Wednesday the overall synoptic pattern becomes more interesting 
as split flow surges a northern stream shortwave across the Great 
Lakes and an associated cold front southward toward the OH Valley, 
all while the above noted Rockies upper disturbance deepens to 
nearly a full latitude trough. Although guidance agrees on keeping 
the OH Valley cold front north of the fcst area, there appears to be 
some discontinuities to note.  For example, the ECMWF features 
persistent east coast ridging while the southern stream H5 vortex 
slowly moves east into the Appalachians into/through Friday.  On the 
contrary, the GFS exhibits a less progressive system which could 
possibly phase with the northern stream, all while the southern 
stream upper low remains open as less dynamic across the TN Valley. 
Either way it does look as if the pattern moistens up late in the 
period, before the cold front finally surges into the area Saturday 
morning. Temperatures to round out the period will be slightly 
cooler as the ridge is suppressed, however still nearly 1-2 
categories above normal levels.

.DISCUSSION...

Only a few changes to the POP and Wx grids for this evening as the
number of showers are expected to diminish over the northeastern
section of the CWA for tonight. The upper level low will slowly
process towards the northeast into Kentucky overnight bringing in
cooler air from the northwest behind the cold front. With the 
combination of a saturated air mass limiting evaporative cooling 
and cloudy overnight skies which will limit longwave emissions the
strong CAA behind the front will be the main driver for the lower
temperatures tonight. Overnight lows could be colder than what is
predicted, but have high enough confidence to leave them as is.
Areas of higher elevation will see temperatures drop below
freezing with the rain changing over to snow early tonight, with 
most areas seeing low temperatures in the low 40's. With all the
rain today, a few areas along the Little Pigeon river and French 
Broad have seen a considerable amount of flooding this evening. 
Rivers are expected to crest tonight and slowly recede tomorrow. 
Areas down stream that these rivers feed into can expect to see 
rising water levels.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
A broad area of showers and embedded thunderstorms moved northeast
across the forecast area this morning to mid afternoon. This was
ahead of cold front and low pressure area that was still located
over east Tennessee. Temperatures at mid afternoon were in the mid
50s in the rain to 60s where there has been partial clearing. New
showers and storms were developing along the northern plateau and
central valley with small small hail and gusty winds. These could
become nmarginally severe as they move north. Upper level low that
gets cut off behind the front over northern Mississippi slowly
moves north and northeast tonight into eastern KY by morning. This
brings in much colder temperatures tonight. Temperatures will drop
into the lower 40s lower elevations and 30s higher elevations with
rain changing to snow. The upper low moves slowly east northeast
to mid Alantic states by Saturday night and into PA by Sunday
morning. Shortwave energy rotating around the upper low will keep
shower activity going Saturday and then decrease Saturday night.
Temperatures Saturday will only climb about 10 degrees into the
lower 50s lower elevations and 30s highest elevations. Saturday
night will be slightly cooler with lighter winds and clearing in
the southwest. Snowfall will start to accumulate late tonight 
highest elevations of the Smokies and near Roan Mountain. Most 
locations will only receive an inch or two but Mount LeConte may 
have around 3 to 4 inches by Sunday morning.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
The models are similar during the early part of the extended with
a slow departure of the upper level low followed by a nice period
of ridging in a drier regime. Eventually the low level ridge 
slips far enough east that higher dewpoint air moves back north 
into the Southern Appalachian region. Forecast uncertainty 
increases to some degree in the latter half of the period, with 
the possibility of the passage of a weak upper level disturbance 
across the Ohio Valley along a similarly weak stationary front. It
appears the chance for showers and thunderstorms increases 
Thursday into Friday as another deep trough or upper level low 
moves slowly east across the Lower Mississippi Valley into the 
Southeastern U.S. Temperatures will become comfortable once again 
through much of the long term with highs in the 70s and lows in 
the 50s.

marginally severe hail and isolated strong wind gusts are
possible. Added thunderstorms back into western sections for

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Tomorrow night)...
Storms continue to roll through the Eastern Tennessee Valley. 
Haven't gotten many wind reports from these storms since it's 
occurring overnight, but have seen some power outages and 
observations are all indicating that storms were able produce up to 
around 55mph winds in a few isolated locations. Storms were never 
able to strengthen due to basically zero instability to work with. 
We have not seen any lightning strikes recorded on satellite data 
throughout the night as these storms have moved through. Once we get 
into tomorrow morning we could see a re-intensification of storms, 
but it looks like the better environment and lifting mechanisms 
will be east of the area into North Carolina/Virginia.

What did occur with these storms, and more importantly the strong 
southerly low level jet, is strong winds in the higher terrain of 
the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Wind observation towers in 
several locations have recorded winds of 65mph overnight. So we will 
definitely continue the high wind warning for the mountainous areas 
through the morning at which point the low level jet should move off 
further to the east and taking the strongest winds with it.

Precipitation chances will continue across the area for about the 
next 48 hours until Saturday night. The QPF amounts will decrease as 
the low moves over us and eventually to the north of us decreasing 
PWAT values, so while the rain chances remain pretty high, the 
rainfall amounts should decrease as we progress towards the weekend. 
There's still the chance that a few locations receive several rounds 
of heavy rain leading to isolated flooding, so we will continue to 
monitor that over the next couple of days.

As the low moves over the area colder air will funnel in and drop 
temperatures through most of the day today. Overnight lows will dip 
below freezing in the highest elevations of the Southern Appalachian 
Mountains and we'll likely see snowfall in the tops of the 
mountains. Didn't change the forecast snowfall amounts very much and 
it still looks like accumulating snowfall will hopefully be confined 
to elevations above 3000 feet.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...
The extended range period kicks off on Sunday morning amidst a 
departing H5 cyclone across the Central/Northern Appalachians, 
building heights and thus ridging over the Plains, and another west 
coast upper low moving into the Rockies. At the surface, a 1023mb 
ridge looks to strengthen over the northern GOM (thanks to 
confluence aloft) which will favor return waa across the MS Valley 
Sunday morning.  Pattern evolution through the period will be 
highlighted by persistent ridging across the southeast states as the 
aforementioned plains H5 ridge slides east and the consequent 
surface flow moves off the Carolina coast by midweek.  Meanwhile the 
above noted Rockies H5 cyclone will slowly shift east into the Four 
Corners while a northern stream shortwave slides through the Upper 
Midwest driving a cold front southward into the OH Valley by Tuesday 
night.  For Wednesday, the long range guidance looks to push said OH 
Valley front southward across East TN and Southwest VA/NC. At this 
point the timing would favor an afternoon fropa, which combined with 
prior days return flow, could suggest the possibility for showers 
and thunderstorms.  Guidance tends to diverge a bit at this range 
regarding the eventual placement of the front by periods end as the 
ECMWF stalls the boundary atop the region on Thursday, while the GFS 
takes it just south near the I20 corridor.  Overall the fcst looks 
rather uneventful with chance pops featuring thunderstorms on 
Wednesday, with slight/chance pops for the remainder of the period 
given uncertainty of the frontal push.  Temperatures through the 
period will generally be highlighted by a warming trend with levels 
around 1 category above normal.

.DISCUSSION...

A few minor updates to the forecast the evening. Temperatures have
been slower to drop due to the continued southern winds and
increasing cloud cover. Overnight lows in the low 60's for much 
of the CWA while higher elevations on the Cumberland Plateau will 
drop into the high 50's. The more northeastern portion of 
Tennessee also has been a little drier from the ongoing 
downsloping winds. Some minor adjustments to the overnight winds 
as the high wind event looks to peak later on. Models have been 
indicating a minor chance for severe storms tonight with modest 
Theta-e and decent positive Omega values. Soundings have shown 
high 0-6km shear with very little to no CAPE. This looks to be a 
very marginal event for thunderstorms with the highest potential 
south of I-40, with high straight line winds being the largest
threat. Soundings indicate perceptual water values increasing 
overnight with rainfall amounts of up to an inch for the more 
southern counties.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...

A lot to discuss in the short term period with elevated fire 
weather potential, high winds across the mountains, strong to 
severe thunderstorms, and locally heavy rainfall. The upper levels
this afternoon feature amplified flow across the United States 
with ridging across the eastern seaboard and western Atlantic, 
troughing across the plains, and ridging across the western United
States. At the surface, an area of low pressure was observed 
across the lower Mississippi valley with a cold front extending 
northward across the Ohio valley and into the Great Lakes. 
Increasing southerly flow ahead of the previously mentioned trough
will continue to aid in gusty winds in the lower levels of the 
troposphere. The rest of the afternoon will feature warm 
temperatures, and mostly clear skies. The warmest temperatures 
will likely be located in the valley and closer to the foothills 
where downslope conditions will be most pronounced. The downslope
conditions will also keep dewpoints and RH values lower. RH 
values in the mid to upper 30's will be possible in NE Tennessee 
and SW Virginia. This combined with gusty southerly winds could 
create some elevated fire danger into the late afternoon. An SPS 
has been issued for mainly northeast Tennessee and southwest 
Virginia through 00Z.

The rather strong shortwave trough evident on water vapor across 
central Texas will move northeast overnight and shows signs of
weakening in model guidance. However, further north a potent mid-
level jet maximum will move southward allowing the trough to dig 
southward. With the increasing amplification, heights will fall 
over the southeast. The surface low underneath these height falls
will move northward into the Ohio valley by 06z-09z Friday. A 
cold front attendant this surface low will progress eastward 
through Mississippi and Alabama into the overnight hours. The 
increasing dynamics will allow the low level jet to strengthen 
tonight. Model guidance is in good agreement that 850mb winds 
increase to 45 to 60 knots late tonight and into Friday morning.  
This combined with a south to south-southeast wind direction gives
higher confidence of a mountain wave induced wind event across 
the mountain zones tonight and Friday morning. The current high 
wind warning seems to be in good shape and will keep that as is. 

The next weather hazard to discuss is the potential for strong to
possibly severe thunderstorms late tonight. It is likely that a 
line of strong to possibly severe thunderstorms will be moving 
through Mississippi, Alabama, and southern Tennessee this evening.
As they approach our area, it will likely be moving into a less 
unstable environment, and should be in a weakening state. However,
at least low to marginal instability parameters as indicated by 
100-300 J/kg of most unstable CAPE and +6.0 C/km mid-level lapse 
rates combined with moderate to strong shear parameters should be 
sufficient to carry the marginal chance of strong to severe storms
mainly across southern portions of the forecast area. The main 
threats continue to be damaging winds but a tornado cannot be 
ruled out. Timing of said convection is medium to high confidence.
High-res guidance indicates the line of thunderstorms moving into
far southwest counties of the MRX CWA as early as 03z to 04z and 
will continue to move east overnight. Localized heavy rainfall is
possible as well given the high PW values and efficient warm rain
processes.  

The cold front will push through the area on Friday with likely 
chance PoPs through the day. Some thunderstorms are also possible 
ahead of the front where at least weak instability is still 
present as mid level temperatures decrease. Again a strong to 
severe storm cannot be ruled out across far eastern section of the
area but overall severe weather threat looks low. Daytime highs 
on Friday should be cooler with the amount of cloud cover and rain
with highs in the low to upper 60s. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...

Upper level trough is expected to form a cut off upper low and 
moving over northeast Tennessee into eastern Kentucky Friday night 
and then spin nearly in place to the north of the forecast area 
Saturday and Saturday night. Rain showers will be widespread with 
the upper low. With the cold air aloft freezing levels will drop 
with some accumulating snow in the higher elevations above 4000 feet 
late Friday night and Saturday tapering off Saturday night as the 
system gradually shifts north. Snowfall amounts may reach up to 
about 2 inches at highest elevations. Temperatures will be much 
colder Friday night and Saturday. Lows Saturday in the 40s with 30s 
highest elevations. Saturday highs will be in the upper 40s to lower 
50s. Highest elevations will stay in the 30s. Rainfall amounts will 
be tapering off by Friday evening. Saturday night skies will begin 
to clear from the southwest to northeast with another cold night in 
the upper 30s to the lower 40s.

Sunday as higher pressure builds in behind departing upper level low 
temperatures will warm into the 60s to the lower 70s. Temperatures 
warm more for Monday through Tuesday with highs in the 70s to near 
80. At mid week another trough approaches with a slow moving front. 
A chance of showers and storms each day with increased humidity and 
more cloud cover. An upper low may form behind this system and slow 
its progress for the end of the week.

305 AM EDT Thu Apr 18 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Friday)...The mid/upper level ridge 
will continue to shift east as a trough digs in to our west. This 
trough will form a cutoff upper low to our west/southwest that 
will then slowly progress into our area by Friday. A surface front
will move west to east through our area tonight into Friday. A 
strengthening southerly low level jet will bring increasing 
moisture, and showers will move in tonight and progress across all
of our area by early Friday. Low level shear will increase 
significantly as the precipitation moves in, but right now it 
appears that convective energy will be quite limited. Will include
the possibility of thunder, and given wind fields cannot rule out
some strong to severe storms with damaging winds the primary 
threat. Will continue to mention this threat in the HWO. 

The strong southerly jet (850 winds reach 50 kts or more) will also 
bring the likelihood of mountain wave enhanced winds to the usual 
locations in the TN mountains and foothills.  It appears that 
thermal profiles will be quite favorable for at least several hours 
as well overnight, so Will issue a high wind warning for these areas 
for late today into Friday morning. 

Relative humidity values will dip into the 30s in at least parts of 
the area, especially the northern and perhaps central valley areas 
and up into SW VA. This will combine with gusty winds to increase 
fire danger. Will headline this in the Fire Weather Forecast. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Wednesday)... By Friday night 
the upper level trough will likely have morphed into a cut- off 
low around Middle Tennessee with the surface low expected to be 
around Western Pennsylvania. Precipitation chances will definitely
be present Friday night into Saturday morning but QPF amounts 
should be much lower as PWAT values drop a good bit south and west
of the upper level low. Some of the biggest weather impacts over 
the weekend will be the much cooler temperatures over the weekend.
Friday night and Saturday night low temperatures are expected to 
drop into the low 40's in the Valley and near or below freezing in
the higher elevations of the Southern Appalachian Mountains. With
the lingering precipitation on the backside of the low and the 
sub-freezing temperatures the highest elevations may see 
accumulating snowfall Friday night into Sunday morning. Confidence
is still somewhat low on snowfall amounts, but right now it looks
like snowfall should be generally confined to locations around 
3,000 feet or higher. Depending on how temperatures rebound during
the daytime hours we could see a dusting up to a few of inches of
snow in these higher elevations.

Once the low finally moves off to the northeast and we get out from 
under it's influence skies will clear out and temperatures will warm 
back up above normal starting on Sunday afternoon. Warm weather will 
continue through the remainder of the 7-day forecast. 

Another low/trough will move through the mid-Atlantic around the 
middle of the work week. Models are indicating that this one is a 
bit less powerful, but will still bring widespread rainfall to the 
region. Model differences make the timing of the system difficult at 
this time, but it looks to be a decent chance of rain when it does 
eventually move through.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...

The upper level ridge that has been aiding in our above 
average seasonal temperatures for the past few days will continue to 
slowly move to the east over the next few days. A weak low level jet 
of 40 knots will past quickly through the western area of the CWA 
early tonight. Conditions could reach very close to wind advisory 
criteria but is currently thought to remain just below minimums. 
Deep layer mixing tomorrow will work to keep conditions warm and dry 
with increasing winds for most of the CWA. Increasing warm air 
advection from the south on Thursday will lead to increasing 
potential temperatures values but the lifting mechanism of the 
incoming trough won't arrive until the long term forecast period.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...

The long term period will be a very active one. Thursday night an 
upper trough will be approaching from the west, and will eventually 
become a cutoff low over Alabama and Mississippi by Friday afternoon 
before lifting off to the northeast over the weekend. The associated 
cold front will move through the CWA late Thursday night into Friday 
morning and will bring with it widespread showers, with some 
scattered thunderstorms mixed in across the southern zones. In terms 
of severe weather chances, it's unclear to be blunt. Forecast 
soundings show plenty of shear to work with, but are lacking in the 
instability department, especially for central and northern parts of 
the CWA. The area of concern would be down around Chattanooga where 
there is some surface-based instability after midnight when shear 
values all point towards the potential for severe storms. It will 
likely be a linear convective mode by the time it arrives in our 
forecast area, with the threats largely of the straight line wind 
variety. The threat of tornadoes in the southern valley can't be 
ruled out, but straight line winds seem of more concern at this 
point. 

Ahead of the front, winds will be quite breezy, though mainly in the 
elevated areas. Wind directions across the Appalachians aren't ideal 
for mountain waves, and there's no presence of a strong capping 
inversion over/east of the terrain, nor strong cross-barrier 
pressure gradient either. However, with forecast ridgetop winds 
approaching 50kt, or possibly a little higher, it seems that at 
least a few gusts to high wind territory will be seen. Given the 
onset of anything close to High Wind Warning criteria will be 
tomorrow evening, will allow the evening and overnight shift to get 
a look at one more set of guidance before pulling the trigger on 
whether to go for wind advisory or high wind warning.

Once the front passes, and the now-cutoff upper low begins to lift 
from northern AL/MS into eastern Tennessee, post-frontal showers 
will continue through the day Friday and into Friday night. Of note 
here will be how low freezing levels fall beneath this upper low. 
Not overly concerned about snow amounts here as we are talking about 
mid-April here, but the current thinking is that elevations above 
roughly 3,000 feet could see some snow showers Friday night. Don't 
expect much in the way of accumulations at this time, but would not 
be surprised to see some high elevation spots get an inch or so 
Friday night into Saturday morning.

For the remainder of the period, went with persistence. Model 
agreement trails off as you would expect, with some guidance showing 
a more zonal flow pattern for late Sunday into the first half of 
next week while others continue with an active pattern. Did 
introduce some slight chance PoPs back into the forecast area wide 
by Wednesday as it seems like a system will be approaching at that 
time.

.DISCUSSION...

Forecast looks to be on track for the most part. Soundings
indicate very dry air aloft which is expected to mix down towards
the surface through the day. Adjusted the dewpoints a few degrees
downward to reflect this change with an associated change to 
relative humidity to account for the influx of dry air. Further
drying of the air later this afternoon as winds pick up out of the
south for the southern valley.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...The ridge of high pressure 
aloft over the area will slide to the east during the period, with 
surface high pressure centered to our east and northeast. We will 
see an increase in high clouds, but there will still be quite a bit 
of sunshine today. Temperatures will run above seasonal normals for 
the short term period. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...One more warm day on 
Thursday ahead of an approaching system, with temperatures 
expected to be around 10 degrees above normal and similar to what 
we see later today (Wednesday). Things will quickly change as a 
deep trough and and associated front begin to move into the 
Eastern Tennessee Valley Thursday evening/night. 

Ahead of this system we look to get some weak to moderate 
destabilization with a few hundred J/kg of CAPE to work with, but 
shear will likely be more important to storms as a strong 50+ knot 
jet out of the South moves through with this trough. With this type 
of environment, and the fact that the storms will likely be moving 
through during the nighttime, the biggest threat with these storms 
looks to be strong straight-line winds. The better environment for 
stronger to severe storms is further west across Middle TN into 
Alabama, but if these storms are able to maintain their strength and 
momentum as they move towards the Cumberland Plateau and Eastern 
Tennessee Valley we could see some strong to severe storms. Forecast 
soundings indicate the locations with the best environment to see 
the strongest storms in our area will be in Southeast Tennessee and 
along the Cumberland Plateau.

In addition to storms, the low level jet will be blowing pretty 
strong out of the south Thursday night into Friday. Models continue 
to indicate the direction of the jet is generally southerly to 
southeasterly during the time of the strongest winds. And depending 
on which model you like the core of the jet may contain winds of 50-
70 knots across far Eastern Tennessee. So while not a classic 
Mountain Wave event, it still looks likely that there will be strong 
winds in the higher elevations of the Southern Appalachian Mountains.

As this deep trough begins to swing through towards the East Coast 
of the U.S. it will morph into a cut-off low. This will lead to 
additional precipitation as moisture is wrapping around the low on 
the back side. There will be much colder air on the back side of the 
low with overnight lows Friday and Saturday night dropping into the 
low 40's in the Valley. In the higher elevations of the Southern 
Appalachian Mountains low temperatures look to drop below freezing 
for several hours each night. With precipitation expected to 
continue as the upper level low spins over head we could see some 
springtime snow in the higher elevations. Right now it looks like 
locations generally above 3000 feet have the best chance to dip 
below freezing and see snowfall. So any hikers along the Appalachian 
Trail over the weekend may run across some mid-spring snow on the 
ground over the weekend. Current models are doing an incredibly poor 
job with forecasting how much snow may stick to the ground, so 
forecast confidence in snowfall accumulations at this time is very 
low.

Rain looks to have moved off to the northeast by sunrise on Sunday 
and southerly winds at the surface will once again combine with mid 
level ridging to quickly shoot temperatures back up into the 70's on 
Sunday. Pleasant weather will then continue into the upcoming work 
week. Another trough/low looks to move move through during the 
middle to second half of the upcoming week, but long range model 
timing is still a bit all over the place as of now.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...
A ridge of high pressure both surface and aloft will remain across
the southern Appalachians through Wednesday. Return of southerly
winds will continue to warm conditions Wednesday with temperatures
some 5 to 8 degrees above normal.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
Upper level ridge combined with southerly winds Wednesday night 
will continue to maintain the slightly above seasonal average 
temperatures for mid week. A digging trough over the Great Plains 
will move eastward, aiding in increased moisture and warm air 
advection. Temperatures for Thursday will continue to be a several
degrees above the seasonal averages.

Thursday night will see a cold front associated with the deep trough 
to the west move into the area. Strong upper level divergence from 
the 300mb jet will lead to high winds for the plateau and the 
southern areas of the CWA. High PW and Theta-e values combined with 
positive Omega will lead to heavy rains with some embedded 
thunderstorms. The GFS also shows potential high winds along the 
eastern Smokies and surrounding foothills from a low level 850mb 
jet. This downsloping wind event could see wind gusts up to 50 to 60 
mph.

As the cold front moves through on Friday, the winds will shift from 
predominantly out of the south southeast to the west northwest. 
While most of the convective potential will move to the eastern side 
of the southern Appalachians a stray thunderstorm for northeastern 
Tennessee and southwestern Virgina for the afternoon can't be ruled 
out. Some areas of the valley will see a break in the rain due to a 
rain shadow from the mountains and northerly inflow of cooler air.

The trough will begin to take on a negative tilt Friday night with 
strong divergence aloft before transitioning to a cut off low. A 
TROWAL and deformation zone will develop over the area around the 
newly formed cut off low. The more eastern warm air will be pulled 
around the low and ride up over the wedge of cold air at the surface 
and produce more rain overnight. Combined with the increasing cold 
air advection reducing the temperatures, some areas of higher 
elevation are likely to see snow and higher winds develop for Friday 
night.

The cut off low will persist for much of Saturday with cool, wet, 
windy conditions for most of eastern Tennessee while elevations over 
3000 feet look to remain cold with snow. The main forcing 
mechanism's for the precipitationw will be orographic lift, the 
TROWAL and deformation zone. The Euro shows a break from the rain 
for the more southwestern counties, the GFS and Canadian models 
maintain the precip potential until Saturday night. The low looks 
to finally move off to the northeast by Sunday morning, with 
increased warm air advection from the southwest and higher 
pressure moving in behind it.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Surface high pressure over the 
area will slide east as the mid/upper level ridge builds over the 
region.  After a chilly start, today will be warmer with plenty of 
sunshine. There will be an increase in high clouds overnight, and 
temperatures will be near or a bit above seasonal normals. Relative 
humidity values will dip to around 30 percent across a good portion 
of the area this afternoon and there will be winds of at least 5 to 
10 mph in many locations, so will include a headline mentioning this 
in the fire weather forecast. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)... Mid level ridging and 
southerly winds wrapping around surface high pressure just off the
Carolina coasts will help temperatures climb about 10 degrees 
above normal for this time of year on Wednesday and Thursday. Dew 
points will begin to increase as moisture really begins to move 
into the area Wednesday night into Thursday ahead of our next 
system. 

Deep trough across the midwest United States will swing through 
along with the associated cold front that will be attached to a 
surface low moving through the Great Lakes Region. This weather 
system looks to be the main focus for the forecast bringing along 
with it a chance for strong (to possibly severe) storms and gusty 
winds as the main weather hazards. Precipitation ahead of the front 
may begin to pop up along the Eastern Cumberland Plateau Thursday 
afternoon/evening. Forecast model soundings are hinting that there 
may be enough shear/instability for storms that form ahead of the 
main cold front on Thursday afternoon/evening to become strong, but 
the better chances for thunderstorms will come overnight as the main 
line moves through. If the timing of this system remains on track 
and the bulk of the initial storms occurs overnight Thursday into 
Friday morning, this should hopefully limit severe storms across the 
Eastern Tennessee Valley. Instability looks relatively low, but the 
moderate to high shear available with the low level jet over us 
means that the greatest weather threat looks to be strong straight-
line winds.

The other threat with this system looks to be the potential for 
mountain wave winds Thursday night into Friday. The winds will be a 
little more southerly than a classic mountain wave scenario and the 
there isn't a strong inversion to keep strongest winds close to the 
surface...but with the low level jet of 50+ knots the threat for 
strong winds is very real.

As the cold front passes through the area the deep trough is 
forecasted to morph into a cut-off low, meaning that it will stick 
with us for a bit longer. The low will slowly move northeast across 
the Tennessee Valley towards eastern Great Lakes. The moisture that 
gets wrapped up in this system will be able to linger over the area 
for several days. Have kept precipitation chances in the forecast 
into Sunday morning, but forecast models are having a bit of a 
difficult time with how to handle the track of the low once it 
becomes cut-off. So forecast confidence starting around Saturday 
decreases a good bit. 

Once this low moves out of the area then another quick warm up will 
begin as mid level ridging and low level Warm Air Advection once 
again look to bring temperatures about 5-10 degrees above normal by 
Monday.

Overall the current forecast looked pretty good for the evening
update. Latest guidance seemed to really like the radiational
cooling potential tonight (which looks good) as the models favored
lower min temps in the valleys of Cherokee/Clay counties in
western NC. Thus, after collaboration with GSP, opted to add those
zones to the frost advisory for tonight. Otherwise, no sig changes

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
Main concerns are frost potential across southwest Virginia and
northeast Tennessee Tonight and low afternoon Relative Humidity
Tuesday.

A ridge of high pressure both surface and aloft will be the main
weather features through Tuesday. Dry airmass will allow
temperatures to drop into the middle 30s over much of southwest
Virginia and northeast Tennessee, especially sheltered valleys.
Will issue a frost advisory for those areas.

Dry conditions and warming temperatures will produce low afternoon
relative humidity Tuesday.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...

The upper level ridge axis will begin moving east of the region 
Tuesday night as the surface high sets up over the western Atlantic. 
This will lead to strengthening southwesterly WAA and temps 
returning to much above normal values for the middle of the week. 
The ridging will extend far enough westward into the Tennessee 
valley so that its capping influence keeps our region dry and mostly 
sunny through Wednesday, so warm weather fans will get to enjoy 
spectacular spring weather.

Moisture flux will begin to increase Wednesday night as 
southwesterly 925-700 mb moisture transport winds strengthen. 
Capping at the mid levels will not allow any showers to form, but we 
will see an increase in high to mid level clouds through the night. 
As an upper trough deepens over the middle of the country and its 
parent surface low lifts toward the western Great Lakes during the 
day Thursday, a strong cold front will slowly advance toward our 
region from the west. Strong WAA and moisture transport ahead of 
this system will allow Thursday to be the warmest day of the week 
with highs in the low 80's common, and it will feel humid as dew 
points rise into the low 60's by afternoon, especially in the 
central and southern valley. Forecast soundings show enough capping 
lingering in the mid levels to keep most of the day dry, but as the 
front and height falls move into middle Tennessee late in the 
afternoon, scattered showers and thunderstorms could develop around 
the plateau. Introduced slight chance to chance pops over that area 
after 21Z.

The cold front will slowly cross the region Thursday night with 
widespread showers and thunderstorms expected. Have likely to 
categorical pops in all areas. There continues to be some severe 
weather potential, but the overnight frontal timing should prevent a 
widespread outbreak. The main threat will be damaging straight line 
winds, with the greatest potential in southeast TN and the southern 
plateau. ML CAPES of 150-250 j/kg, strong frontogenetic forcing 
ahead of the front and lifting near the right entrance region of a 
120 kt 300 mb jet streak, 0-6 km shear of 70-85 kts, and 0-1 km 
shear of 30-45 kts should all support a line of thunderstorms with 
strong winds developing around middle TN, then progressing eastward 
across our region during the night. There is a hint of a weak 
surface low or pre-frontal trough around middle TN after 00Z Friday. 
In response to this little feature, forecast soundings do show some 
directional shear with winds in the surface to 925 mb layer backing 
southeasterly in the 00-06Z timeframe with a 60-70 kt southwesterly 
850 mb jet, so supercells embedded in the squall line with isolated 
tornadoes cannot be ruled out around the southern plateau and 
southeast TN. The farther east this squall line propagates, the more 
marginal the severe threat will become as nocturnal cooling 
increases combined with lacking instability, which is why the 
southern plateau and southeast TN have the greatest potential of any 
severe weather.  

The very strong southerly 850 mb winds will create favorable 
conditions for another mountain wave high wind event across the east 
TN mountains and adjacent foothills Thursday night into Friday 
morning.

The cold front will pass east of the region after 12Z Friday with 
the widespread showers exiting during the morning. Have likely pops 
in the morning decreasing to chance for the afternoon. Much cooler 
temps will occur in the CAA. This system will turn into a large cut 
off low in the Ohio valley Friday night and Saturday, so scattered 
showers will continue with below normal temps. Kept chance pops for 
showers Friday night and Saturday with some thunder wording during 
the day Saturday as the cold pocket aloft will result in some 
instability thundershowers developing. Low freezing levels and steep 
lapse rates could cause half inch sized hail with some of the 
showers/storms Saturday afternoon. 

The cut off low should finally move far enough eastward to allow 
ridging to bring dry weather and gradual warming to the region 
Sunday and Monday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Cooler and drier air will be 
working into the area today on gusty west to northwest winds as 
surface high pressure builds in from the west and southwest. The 
mid/upper level trough will be gradually replaced by broad ridging 
aloft during the short term period. Clouds will decrease, with 
plenty of sunshine this afternoon followed by a mostly clear night. 
With the cooler and drier air in place and winds becoming light, we 
may see some patches of frost develop mainly across the northeast as 
well as SW NC.  At this point it does not look significant enough to 
issue a frost advisory, but one could be issued later if forecast
temperatures have to be bumped a bit lower. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...The long term period is 
typically handled similarly for the first few days of the extended
forecast, with divergence of model opinion with progression of 
time. Of course, there are no model problems with the most 
pleasant period of generally dry advection and protective ridging 
on Tuesday and Wednesday. Even Thursday is depicted well with 
increasing warm and moist advection off the Gulf of Mexico in 
advance the approaching and deepening Mid America upper trough. 
Later Thursday night into the weekend, modeling appears to have 
difficulty resolving the deepening upper trough, with differences 
in position and strength of the system's slow moving upper low 
center. The consensus opinion for weather across the Eastern 
United States was to follow the ecmwf with its, slightly more 
northern low position as it lumbers slowly east through the Ohio 
Valley on its way east northeast into the northwestern states by 
late in the weekend. With this scenario in mind, increasing 
moisture ahead of this mid latitude cyclone's cold front, along 
with more buoyant air and a coupled upper jet structure will lead 
to the possibility of strong convection developing across the 
Southern Appalachian region, later Thursday afternoon through 
Thursday night. The cold front moves east of the forecast area 
around 12z Friday, but relatively deep moisture and trailing jet 
energy on the back side of the highly amplified trough will keep 
the chance for some showers Friday and Saturday with a possibility
of some drier and warmer air finally building back into much of 
the region on Sunday.

218 PM EDT Sun Apr 14 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...
The threat of severe storms continues for our area. Surface heating 
has allowed for temperatures to rise into the mid 70s in most of the 
Valley, and will reach upper 70s shortly. The partial clearing of 
clouds has allowed winds to pick up quickly and become gusty, which 
will continue through the afternoon (the Wind Advisory and High 
Wind Warning will be continued). Increasing instability from
heating and abundant shear will make for an environment favorable
for thunderstorms with rotating updrafts. Hi-res models continue 
to indicate development around 19-21Z along the I-75 corridor, 
with discrete supercell storms merging into a line as they move 
east across NE TN and SW VA. Damaging winds continue to pose the 
highest threat due to midlevel dry air and strong winds aloft, 
while marginally severe hail will also be possible. The tornado 
threat remains present as well, as STP values are between 2-4, and
0-1km SRH of 200-300 m2/s2. 

Storms are expected to exit the area to the east around 10 pm, with 
only a few isolated to scattered showers lingering underneath the 
mid/upper level trough axis after that time. A brisk westerly wind 
will bring cold advection that will drop lows tonight into the 40s, 
with 30s in the mountains. A few snowflakes can't be ruled out in 
the highest elevations, but with no accumulation. Clouds overnight 
will gradually erdoe tomorrow morning, and we should have clear 
skies by the end of the day, with highs in the mid 50s north to mid 
60s south.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
Upper level heights will rise Monday night and Tuesday as a ridge
builds across the SE U.S. in response to surface high pressure 
shifting to the Mid Atlantic coast. The axis of the upper ridge 
will slide to the east by Wednesday as the next trough begins to 
take shape in the Plains. The result will be dry weather Monday 
night through Wednesday with mainly clear skies and temps 
rebounding to above normal values again. Stayed close to MAV 
guidance for temps early in the week since a slightly warmer 
forecast seems reasonable given the strong mid April sun and 
rising heights/WAA. Used Superblend guidance temps for the midweek
period.

The above mentioned trough in the Plains will further dig into the 
Mississippi Valley Thursday and Thursday night with a rapidly 
deepening surface low lifting into the upper Midwest. This system 
will pull a strong cold front through our region sometime Thursday 
night into Friday. Timing of the frontal passage is uncertain as 
model guidance has been slowing this system the past few runs. Have 
chance pops for showers and thunderstorms around the plateau 
Thursday afternoon with chance to likely pops areawide Thursday 
night through at least Friday afternoon. There continues to be 
potential for strong to severe convection ahead of this cold front 
late Thursday into Thursday night. Surface to 6 Km bulk shear 
increasing to 55-80 kts, 0-1 Km bulk shear of 35-45 kts, 0-1 Km SRH 
over 300 m2m2, and ML CAPE expected to be at least 120-250 j/kg will 
support damaging winds with the strongest cells. Isolated tornadoes 
could occur, with the greatest threat for this in the southern 
valley where the largest CAPE and shear will come together. Height 
falls will support lowering freezing levels and wet bulb zero 
heights Thursday night, so hail will also be possible in stronger 
updrafts. The SPC continues to have east TN, southwest VA, and 
southwest NC in a 15% severe weather outlook for Day 5, so we will 
continue to mention severe potential in the HWO.  

The low looks increasingly likely to cut off near the Great Lakes 
behind the cold frontal passage for the end of the week into the 
start of next weekend with an upper level trough digging well into 
the TN Valley. This will drop temps a little below normal for a 
change with scattered showers continuing Friday through Saturday, 
then gradually diminishing Saturday night. Have chance pops Friday 
through Saturday then slight chance Saturday night around the east 
TN mountains and southwest VA. Used Superblend temps this period.

Riding at the surface and aloft will return Sunday with dry weather 
and a warming trend.

Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED
National Weather Service Morristown TN
1102 AM EDT Sun Apr 14 2019

.DISCUSSION...
The initial line of storms has weakened considerably as it moves
into the eastern half of our area. Satellite shows clearing skies
over Middle TN that will allow for good surface heating and
destabilization this afternoon, in addition to strong warm
advection with the southerly flow. SBCAPE values are expected to 
rise into the 1500-2000 J/kg range, and perhaps higher than that 
in the southern Valley. This, combined with the dry air aloft and
continued high deep layer shear, will result in another round of
severe storms in the 3 pm to 9 pm time frame. Hi-res models show
redevelopment of storms near the I-75 corridor, taking the form of
supercells that evolve into a line as it moves east across NE TN 
and SW VA. Damaging winds will be the greatest threat due to the 
dry air and strong winds aloft, and potential for bow segments
along the line. LCL heights and 0-1 SRH values also support a 
tornado threat for the whole area, but favoring areas along I-75 
as backing of surface winds may be difficult to achieve in the 
shadow of the mountains in the northern Valley. Hail may also be a
threat given the low WBZ heights, but it appears marginal (dime 
to quarter- size) looking at CAPE profiles in forecast soundings.
Hi-res models are in good agreement that the storms will exit our
area around 10 pm. 

The morning update will adjust PoP/Wx grids based on current radar
trends. Hourly temps will be adjusted based on the expected
clearing, but highs will continue to be forecast in the mid to
upper 70s. The Wind Advisory and High Wind Warning will be
maintained. So far, gusts to near 50 mph have been observed at
Camp Creek, with some 30-40mph gusts elsewhere. This is expected
to increase as clearing arrives and mixing ensues.

.AVIATION...A line of moderate showers along a weakening squall
line is making progress into Southeast Tennessee and will move
across cha by 13z. This line should continue to weaken as it
approaches tys and tri with a few showers around tys around 14z.
A strong flow across the higher terrain may keep any lower
ceilings or rain develop at tri until later in the day when some
strong storms form ahead of a cold front which will build across
the Southern Appalachian region. The stronger storms that develop
along this boundary could create some mvfr or lower ceilings with
mvfr visibility in moderate to heavy rain. At this time, kept
flight weather just above mvfr. This may be adjusted lower in the
next forecast issuance. The front will move east of the final 
terminal (tri) by 02z. However, some mvfr ceilings will probably
fill in the cold air advection pattern behind the front. Also,
there could be a few sprinkles around tri with a lower chance at

451 AM EDT Sun Apr 14 2019

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Very dynamic Spring storm system
will be moving across the forecast area during the period. Model
forecasts not all on the same page with the details of this
system. Generally speaking, the higher resolution models appear to
be handling the complexity of the various components. The nam, 
and to a slightly lesser extent with time, the hrrr look like the
best way to go with a general decreasing strength and timing of
the early day convective episode while capturing a nice look to
the afternoon and evening main event. The initial area of
convection has formed along a pre-frontal trough and is progressing
at a decent pace through the Tennessee Valley of Alabama early 
this morning and will be building onto the Cumberland Plateau 
around 12-14z. While modeling indicates a bit of a weakening trend
with this initial area, there still may be just enough 
instability and some helicity for a weak tornado developing across
This Southern Cumberland Plateau area where there is a tornado 
watch until 9 am cdt. This line may still be associated with some 
rather strong convective wind gusts across Southeast Tennessee 
this morning before weakening with eastward extent into an area of
adiabatic warming and drying across much of the remainder of the 
forecast area. The surface low associated with the Mississippi 
Valley deep upper trough will be driving northeast through the 
Ohio Valley while dragging the powerful cold front through the Mid
south around mid day into the afternoon. This will be where the 
main threat of severe weather will occur with the best likelihood 
of severe thunderstorms impacting Northeast Tennessee and 
Southwest Virginia later this afternoon into the early evening 
hours. Its very interesting because previous model runs (in recent
days) have been showing a high shear but low cape event, but 
looking at the early morning model runs, cape doubles to triples 
in magnitude to a moderate or even high category across Northeast 
Tennessee. Of course, shear will not be a problem with bulk shear 
at around 60-80 kts. Just not convinced capes will rise into the 
1500-2000 j/kg range in this area during the afternoon, 
instability should be more than sufficient as the front moves 
through later today into the evening. The convective line pushes 
east of the forecast area during the mid to late evening hours 
bringing an end to the severe weather threat and heavier rain. 
Some weak trailing upper level energy and relatively deep moisture
build east across mainly the northern half of the forecast area 
behind the front bringing widely scattered showers and even a 
snowflake or two in the higher terrain areas toward daybreak.
Will continue with high wind warning and wind advisory products
for the mountains today.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...Models in decent 
agreement for the overall pattern, although some differences in the 
details.  Forecast confidence is about average for this time of 
year. Drier air will be working in Monday behind the departing 
weekend system, so should see a dry day with decreasing clouds. 
Surface high pressure will drift east across the region and an upper 
ridge will build in and then shift to our east, bringing warm and 
dry conditions for Tuesday and Wednesday. By Thursday a mid/upper 
level low will be digging in to our west, and a cold front will be 
approaching.  We will see showers and thunderstorms moving in 
sometime in the Thursday afternoon/Thursday night time frame, with 
some showers expected to linger into Friday and Saturday behind the 
front as the mid/upper level low/trough moves slowly across the 
region.  It still looks like there is a threat of severe storms in 
the Thursday/Thursday night time frame, so will continue to mention 
this threat in the HWO.

.AVIATION...Strong storm system will move slowly east across the
Great Valley from around sunrise into the mid to late evening
hours. Some showers may impact cha early in the period, but the
convection line currently moving east in the vicinity of the
Mississippi and Alabama state line should progress into the Great
Valley around 12-14z with impact around 15-16z. A secondary line
of convection moving in with the surface cold front is expected to
affect cha and tys around 21-23z and could be at tri by 01z.
Flight weather should drop to an mvfr category with these
convective lines. However, ifr conditions are certainly possible
under the strongest convective cells. As the colder air builds in
behind the front tonight, bkn-ovc mvfr ceilings should prevail.
The other problem for flight operations today will be the strong
southerly surface winds around 15-22kts with gusts well into the
20-30 kt range. Winds shift to the west with similar strength
around 01-04z.

.DISCUSSION...
Overall the near term portion of the forecast looks good. Little
change needed. Now lets get to the severe potential for Sunday as
we have been waiting for the latest guidance to arrive. Most
recent CAMs/NAM continue to suggest a broken line of
showers/storms moving into the region around daybreak on Sunday,
moving quickly east through the late morning hours. Think
instability will be at a premium with this first wave, with the
most unstable regions being along/south of I40. Thus, chances for
widespread severe convection would be confined to those areas, if
at all. As for Sunday afternoon and the advertised secondary round
of convection, guidance continues to favor such along the front.
However, confidence in strength and initialization location
remains up for debate. The NAM would still suggest a broken line
firing across middle TN and the Plateau, moving east through the
late day into the evening. The trend in the CAM guidance however
has been downward favoring less intense convection, and firing
such over the valley instead of the plateau, then moving east. 
All said, still think some severe convection is likely, especially
with the second round given more instability. Damaging winds 
remains the primary threat with some large hail expected, while 
the tornado threat remains low.

309 PM EDT Sat Apr 13 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Sunday night)...
A low-to-midlevel convergence zone/warm front will continue to lift 
northward across our area through the evening. Precip chances should 
drop to slight chance or nothing once it moves across KY/WV by 
midnight. As the southerly flow picks up after midnight, winds in 
the mountains will increase, and some isolated light showers may be 
possible with the advection of warm/moist air aloft. By 12Z the 850 
mb jet reaches 50 -60 kts, so a High Wind Warning will be issued for 
the mountains. Winds aloft will mix down to the Valley as well after 
12Z, so a Wind Advisory will be issued for all other locations. 

The first wave of storms Sunday morning will essentailly be the 
remains of tonight's convection over LA/MS/AL. As these storms 
enounter a more stable environment and become elevated, they will 
likely show a weakening trend as they approach, but will still be 
capable of transfering winds aloft to the surface. This round will 
move through between 12-18Z. 

Behind the first round, advection of drier/cooler air aloft will 
steepen midlevel lapse rates and may allow for partial clearing and 
thus surface heating. SBCAPE values rise to around 2000 J/kg after 
18Z, with LI values near -6. This destabiliztion is expected to help 
reignite convection in the late afternoon as a strong zone of 
frontogenetic forcing arrives from the west around 21Z. Deep shear 
at this time is very strong, supportive of supercells, but near 
surface winds are not strongly backed for high 0-1 SR helicity. 
However, localized backing of winds from terrain features or 
mesolows could present an isolated tornado threat. Low WBZ levels 
will give a marginal hail threat, but the greatest threat is 
expected to be damaging winds due to the dry air and strong winds 
aloft. Unidirectional shear profiles might result in bow segments 
that produce downbursts. The timing of the second round appears to 
be mainly between 21-03Z. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)... 
The weekend severe system will have waned by sunrise Monday, with
light showers lingering over the northern mountains and SW VA in 
the morning. Meanwhile, the next major system will move onto the 
Pacific NW at the same time, and will dig into the southern 
Rockies by Wednesday morning. This will amplify a ridge over our 
area, thus our early week post-frontal cool down will last only 
from Monday morning through Tuesday morning before warmer 
temperatures resume Tues afternoon. Temps will be 5-10 deg above 
normal midweek, thanks to the the warm, moist draw from the Gulf 
ahead of the southern Rockies system. As that system lifts into 
the Missouri Valley near KC MO Thurs morning, frontal convection 
will be impacting western TN and will gradually move through E TN 
SW VA SW NC during Thursday night. Post frontal temps will be near
seasonal norms to end the week, with scattered showers possible 
associated with the departing but sharp upper trough.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Sunday night)...
Early this morning, An inverted trough axis over the Tennesse
valley along with isentropic lift are producing scattered showers.
Instability is very limited and elevated so thunderstorms are not
anticipated.

For Today, some warm air aloft will help cap most convection 
through around midnight. Only some orographic forcing could
produce scattered showers or the far northeast sections. A good
deal of mid-level clouds is expected today. Another warm day is on
tap.

For Tonight, increasing low-level jet will move into the Tennessee
Valley, especially after midnight. Windy conditions will likely
develop over the higher elevations. A wind advisory may be needed
across the higher terrain. The high resolution Convection Allowing
Models (CAMs) show a band of shower and storms moving into the
Plateau between 4 and 7 am. Due to the strong winds just off the
surface, these storms will be capable of producing damaging winds
across southeast Tennessee Sunday morning.

For Sunday, morning convection will move east of the area. Strong
upper trough will move toward the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys during
the day. A 300mb jet of 125-130kts will swing northeast across the
Tennessee Valley into the eastern Great Lakes increasing the upper
forcing. Associated low-level jet will remain across the area
ahead of an approaching strong cold front. Frontal-genetic forcing
from the upper jet dynamics will help organize strong convective
development across middle Tennessee/northern Alabama
northeastward.

Tightening pressure gradient Sunday will likely produce windy
conditions across much of the area, especially the mountains.

Airmass shows a strongly sheared environment with 0-1km shear of
30kts and 0-6km shear of 80-85kts with MLCAPEs of 1000-1500 J/kg
ahead of frontal boundary. Expect initial supercell development
that will race northeast with eventual line forming producing
damaging straight line winds. Favorable LCL heights, shear, and
CAPE to produce isolated tornadoes as well. Low freezing/wet bulb
zero heights and enough available Hail CAPEs to produce large hail
as well. Some hail up to half dollar size possible.

Current timing of second round of severe storms is from 4 to 8 pm
ET. 

Coverage of showers and thunderstorms will diminish by mid to late
evening with orographic showers remaining in the Mountains. The
highest elevations of the Smokies could even see the rain mix with
or change to sleet/snow before ending, generally above 5kft. 

.LONG TERM (Monday through Friday)...Model forecast continue to 
indicate a decent swath of deep moisture and trailing short wave 
lift for Monday; mainly during the morning. Therefore, will keep a 
few sprinkles and clouds around for much of the northern half of the 
viewing area with improving weather into the afternoon and evening. 
A nice, quiet ridge pattern builds in for Tuesday and Wednesday with 
the low level ridge slipping further east into the Western Atlantic 
Wednesday into Wednesday night so pleasant warm air advection will 
be increasing through this period. Another, highly amplified upper 
trough with another deepening low pressure system drags a strong 
cold front back into the forecast area on Friday. This will be an 
unsettled period with an increasing chance for showers and 
thunderstorms Thursday into Friday as a corridor of deep moist 
convection swings across the Southern Appalachian region. It appears 
this system could provide another opportunity for the development of 
strong to severe thunderstorms during this late week period with 
strong wind fields and more than adequate cape. Probability of 
precipitation would be decreasing later in the day Friday into 
Friday night in this scenario.

.DISCUSSION...
Only made minor updates to the current forecast based on hourly
observations and radar/satellite trends. Still expecting a
relatively quite night. A weak front is draped across the
Appalachians with weak low level convergence. This convergence has
allowed a few isolated to scattered showers and a few rumbles of
thunder to develop. Latest mesoanalysis is showing a few hundred
J/kg of MLCAPE across the mountain zones of northeast Tennessee
co-located within a small area of 7.0 C/km 0-3km lapse rates. 
Still cannot rule out a couple of thunderstorms overnight along 
this convergence zone. Otherwise, weak isentropic ascent with 
continued moisture advection should allow scattered showers 
overnight and into the morning hours. Pinpointing where said 
showers will develop is difficult and generally went with a 
CONSShort and RAP blend for PoPs. Temperatures overnight will be 
mild with overnight lows in the 50's to low 60's.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
A front is currently located across the Cumberland Plateau, marked 
by a dewpoint drop and a wind shift. It will be moving slowly into 
the TN Valley in the next few hours, then stall across the area and 
remain nearly stationary overnight. Meanwhile, a midlevel vort max 
is shown by the models to track SW to NE over the area tonight, 
which generates some weak lift for scattered showers in the vicinity 
of the front. The weak low level flow and covergence suggests any 
precip will be light, and although there is weak elevated 
instability, thunderstorms should be few and far between if they 
form at all.  

On Saturday morning the low level southerly flow strengthens 
slightly, which should push the front back to the north and out of 
our area by the end of the day. The forecast will trend PoPs 
downward from south to north through the day as the front lifts 
north as most of the activity should be associated with the frontal 
convergence zone. Forcing should be too weak south of the front for 
much activity there. By the afternoon we should have a deep S-SW 
flow, allowing high temps to reach the upper 70s in most 
locations.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
The extended will begin with the remnants of a frontal boundary 
that has been stretched over the general area on Saturday slowly 
lifting north and out of the area as a warm front. As what's left 
of the boundary moves out...a few showers will persist mainly over
higher terrain. However...the main concern this extended 
continues to be a strong cold front that will move in on Sunday. A
strong 60+KT 850MB jet will move in in advance of the 
front...creating strong...gusty winds over higher elevations and 
good speed shear. These winds will aid the increase of low level 
moisture bringing PWs up to an inch to an inch and a half. 
Additionally...the air mass will destabilize with CAPEs 500 to 
1500 J/Kg. Overall...this potentially could create a line strong 
to severe thunderstorms Sunday afternoon and with the strong winds
aloft...the main threat will be damaging thunderstorm winds. Some
large hail and a isolated tornado also can not be ruled out. 
Current models are trending towards a late morning/early afternoon
convective line and a second late afternoon/evening line. This 
second line is expected to contain the stronger storms. The upper 
low will push through the area Sunday night and provide decreasing
convection going through much of the night. For the most 
part...the system should be out of the Southern Appalachian Region
for a return to dry conditions on Monday with surface high 
pressure building in. 

Weak ridging into Tuesday will keep us in a quiet and dry weather
pattern for another day. Model consistency lowers by the end of 
the period and confidence lowers as well but generally the pattern
looks rather active. Current trend shows a few showers 
potentially moving in on Wednesday in advance of the approaching 
system. The cold front will move in around the Thursday time frame
with the upper low and associated showers lingering over the area
into Friday.

A cold front will be moving into the area this afternoon, then
become stationary tonight. The presence of this front makes for an
uncertain forecast at the terminals, as there will be scattered
showers overnight, which may lower cigs to MVFR. With the highest
chance of showers at TRI, MVFR cigs will be mentioned there
tonight, while TYS and CHA will be forecast to stay VFR. Any rain
showers will be light and should not produce a significant drop in
visibilities. Gusty SW winds this afternoon will shift to a
northerly direction tonight.

.DISCUSSION...
Winds in the mountains have fallen off considerably over the last
few hours, so the warning/advisory has been allowed to expire.
Gusts through the morning will be in the 20-30 mph range ahead of
the approaching cold front, which is located across Middle TN at
the moment. Radar shows a weakening trend to a line of showers
near the front, but showers along a pre-frontal trough across our
area this morning seems to be holding together so far. As it moves
into the NE sections where downslope winds will have an effect.
The cold front will enter the area this afternoon and stall
tonight as it becomes SW to NE oriented, parallel to the flow
aloft.

The update will adjust PoPs and hourly temps to match radar/ob 
trends and latest models.

437 AM EDT Fri Apr 12 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Strong low-level jet across
the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians this morning. Cove
Mountain is reporting gusts between 45-50 mph. Strong southerly 
jet will remain through mid to late morning then diminish in the 
afternoon. Will maintain High Wind Warning and Wind Advisories as 
is.

The strong low-level jet is enhancing the isentropic lift over the
area this morning along with a surface convergence boundary over 
the Plateau. The forcing is increasing an area of scattered
showers and possibly a thunderstorm from southeast Tennessee into
the Plateau. This area of convection will move across most of the
region this morning.

For this Afternoon, models show drier air advecting into the
Plateau and southeast Tennessee, but still moist and unstable
enough over southwest Virginia and northeast Tennessee to produce
scattered storms along frontal boundary. Due to the low Wet Bulb 
Zero and Hail CAPE, isolated strong storm is possible.

For this Evening, a break in the convection is likely as front
moves east and south of the area. By late evening and early 
Saturday morning, low-level jet begins to strengthen with
increasing isentropic lift producing scattered showers and
embedded thunderstorms.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...The weakening frontal 
boundary will stall along the Appalachians on Saturday, and some 
weak upper level energy will ride northeast across the forecast 
area, producing a few showers and possibly thunderstorm or two in 
this warm air advection pattern. The models have been depicting a 
scenario for a few days now that shows drying with strengthening 
downsloping flow into the Great Valley later in the day Saturday 
into the overnight hours, so did a lot of work in the grids to 
detail this scenario in the first 12-24 hours of the long term 
forecast. Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk for 
severe thunderstorms across the entire mrx forecast area on Sunday
due to the strong wind field and modest instability associated 
with the deep late weekend upper trough, which moves from the 
Mississippi Valley to the Appalachians by Sunday evening. 
Precipitation tapers off Sunday night with a dry west northwest 
flow bringing a couple of good weather days Monday and Tuesday. 
The ecmwf and gfs have come into a little better agreement for the
arrival of another upper wave late in the long term period, but 
there is still some uncertainty with this feature's timing. Stayed
with the superblend concept of a chance pop for showers with the 
possibility of an initial weak impulse on Wednesday followed by 
the main long wave system on Thursday that could produce another 
period of convection ahead of the associated surface cold front. 
Except for a much cooler day on Monday behind the strong early 
week front, temperatures should be near normal for most of the 
extended forecast.

.DISCUSSION...

This update includes some minor changes to hourly temperatures 
and dewpoints based on trends, and a slowing of the onset of
precipitation tonight. The upper levels will consist of a ridge
moving east off the eastern US coast with a trough moving in from
the west. The surface reflection will feature an area of low
pressure moving out of the plains and into the Great Lakes. A cold
front attendant this surface low will traverse the area on Friday
with high pressure quickly moving in behind it. An increase in the
waa regime will support increasing chances showers and
thunderstorms late tonight across mainly southern portions of the
forecast area.

The other topic of interest is the enhanced winds across the
mountain zones. The current wind advisory and high wind warning
seems to be in good shape currently. Should start to see an 
increase in winds across these zones in a few hours as the 850mb 
low level jet begins to move into the area. Latest HTX vad wind 
profile seems to indicate the approach of this jet. The enhanced 
winds should begin to subside late Friday morning as the low level
jet begins to move north of the area.

246 PM EDT Thu Apr 11 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
The upper pattern this afternoon is rather amplified as an H5 ridge 
axis sits atop the eastern CONUS and a deep H5 cyclone rolls across 
the Central/Northern Plains into the Upper Midwest states. At the 
surface, a closed 990MB surface low is tracking northeast (nearly 
stacked beneath the aforementioned H5 low), while a cold front 
stretches southward into the Ozarks and Arklatex region. Further 
east, high pressure beneath the upper ridge axis is working in 
concert with the MLC to increase PGFs atop much of the mid MS and 
OH/TN Valleys this afternoon.  The combination of enhanced llv winds 
and deep mixing will continue to present elevated chances for gusty 
winds across the region this afternoon, all amidst increasing 
cloudiness thanks to the sustained/improving waa regime. 
Temperatures will top out nearly two/three cats above normal.

Tonight guidance favors a nearly 50-60kt sely/sly H85 jet traversing 
the fcst area ahead of the approaching prefrontal trough. The 
orientation of this flow combined with profiles favoring a llv 
inversion suggests some potential for mountain wave winds, therefore 
portions of the previous wind advisory were upgraded to a warning. 
Likewise, the advisory and the new warning were extended through 
10AM EDT Friday.  As for precipitation, looks like some light shra 
is possible along the TN/NC line tonight given upslope flow on the 
eastern facing slopes in western NC, all while profiles moisten and 
upper heights fall thanks to the approaching trough/front. 
Fortunately the vast majority of the amplified dynamics will pass by 
to the north adjacent to the stacked system as it ejects over the 
Great Lakes, however lapse rates will be sufficient to support sct 
showers and general thunderstorms.  Thus, pops increase through the 
night from the south/southwest as moisture advects in and sct 
prefrontal convection slides east through middle TN.  The front 
itself will slow and eventually stall atop the region late in the day 
Friday as it becomes unphased with the primary cyclone to the north, 
thus did keep chance pops spread about the area through the day 
tomorrow.  Temperatures on Friday will top out about 8-10 degrees 
cooler than today's highs amidst precip and clouds. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
The surface front will become parallel to the midlevel flow and 
stall across our area on Friday night. Late in the night, the 850-
700 mb backs and strengthens, creating a midlevel SW-NE convergence 
zone that will bring rising rain chances for locations north of the 
front through Saturday morning. Will have an area of likely PoPs and 
a slight chance of thunderstorms (due to elevated instability) 
across the northern Plateau and SW VA during this period. 

The convergence zone and the surface front continue to lift 
northward through Saturday as the southerly flow strengthens in 
response to a low pressure system tracking from TX to AR to MO/IL. 
With southerly 850 mb winds approaching 50 kts, another period of 
strong winds in the mountains may be possible Saturday night. Linear 
convection along the system's cold front is expected to move into 
our area from the west on Sunday. While instability appears weak, 
strong deep layer shear, frontogenetic forcing, and 50+ kt winds 
aloft may present a straight-line wind threat on Sunday. Cold 
frontal passage occurs Sunday evening, but with the upper trough 
passage delayed a few hours behind it, will keep a small PoP going 
Sunday night into Monday morning. 

An amplified pattern across the Conus will bring a building ridge 
that will provide dry and cool conditions on Monday (highs in the 
60s), with temperatures rebounding into the 70s for Tuesday as the 
ridge axis moves to our east. Models develop another system over the 
Plains on Wednesday, although there is disagreement on the timing of 
impacts on our area with this system. For now, will keep PoPs in the 
chance range for Wednesday and Thursday. There could be some 
potential for severe storms with this system given the amplification 
of the mid/upper trough.

Overall no sig changes in the pattern evolution via the latest
guidance. Still expecting the warm front to remain lifted north 
of the region allowing for sustained sly waa. Llv winds will 
continue to ramp up as previously fcst thanks to increased PGFs 
from the approaching system from the west, thus favoring
increasing gusts this afternoon/tonight. As for the fcst itself, 
did tweak max temps up a degree/two and reran hourly diurnals as 
previous trends were quite a bit behind. Skies will remain partly 
cloudy this morning, yet gradually increasing in coverage with 
time as the moisture axis approaches. Lastly, populated dewpoints
with latest consshort which lined up best with recent obs, all in
an effort to refine the RH fcst for the fire wx folks. Still 
looking like min RHs should stay in the low/mid 30s at a minimum,
with the lowest of those values across southwest VA.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Model forecasts depict another
largely dry short term period as an amplified upper trough and
associated frontal system approach the Southern Appalachian
region. More ridging is expected today with gradually increasing
low level moisture advection. The strengthening pressure gradient
between low level reflection of the ridge over the Middle Atlantic
Coast and the deepening Plains low will result in a gusty
southerly wind across the forecast area today. Insolation will
only have to compete with a broken cirrus layer and with the
strong warm air advection, high temperatures will again reach the
upper 70s and lower 80s. Applied a wind advisory for the higher
terrain along the Tennessee and North Carolina border for tonight
due to the ever tightening gradient in pressure ahead of the deep
Mid America low. A weakening frontal boundary will build toward
the Cumberland Plateau by daybreak Friday and both the gfs and nam
depict increasing moisture convergence ahead of the boundary along
with some weak instability for a few showers and possibly a
thunderstorm toward sunrise. A very mild night is in store due to
increasing moisture with the front and warm air advection through
the overnight hours. 

.LONG TERM (Friday through Thursday)...By Friday morning, a 
mature mid latitude cyclone will be positioned over southern 
Minnesota, with an associated cold front stretching south from 
Michigan into middle Tennesse. The cold front will move in from 
the northwest during the day Friday but will stall out somewhere 
across eastern Tennessee or northern Alabama/Georgia by Friday 
night as upper support moves off to the northeast past the Great 
Lakes and mid/upper level flow becomes parallel to the surface 
boundary. Gradient flow across the region will be basically at 
it's peak Friday morning, with breezy conditions at the lower 
elevations and likely some advisory level winds still taking place
in the mountains. Pressure gradients will By Friday morning, a

elevations and likely some advisory level winds still taking place
in the mountains. Pressure gradients will relax as the day wears 
on however, with winds subsiding accordingly. On the rainfall side
of things, showers appear likely during the first half of the 
day, especially over the plateau nearer to the front. But expect a
general decrease in coverage of rainfall as the day wears on and 
upper support lifts away to the north. Did include a slight chance
of thunder as model soundings show some elevated instability. But
do not expect any severe weather with this system.

For Saturday the stalled front will be a focus for continued shower 
activity as the next system gains strength in west Texas, and 
resultant isentropic ascent over the frontal increases. There should 
be a lull in rain chances Friday night into Saturday morning, but 
expect at least some scattered coverage during the day Saturday. As 
the Texas system moves east it will have a greater impact for our 
area as the upper trough is more amplified and the jet is in a 
better position to support convection on Sunday afternoon, and 
possibly a severe threat. Chances look considerably better to the 
southwest of our CWA for severe weather, but there could be a short 
window on Sunday morning where some storms with damaging winds could 
be seen. Will continue to monitor things for now and keep a mention 
of it in the HWO.

Passage of the cold front and upper trough on Sunday will bring a 
sizable drop in temperatures for Monday, with lows in the 40s and 
highs in the 60s. A building ridge will provide dry weather for the 
first part of next week, then another system developing over the 
Plains will bring a deep southerly flow regime back to the area by 
midweek, with increasing chances Wednesday into Thursday.relax as
the day wears on however, with winds subsiding accordingly. On 
the rainfall side of things, showers appear likely during the 
first half of the day, especially over the plateau nearer to the 
front. But expect a general decrease in coverage of rainfall as 
the day wears on and upper support lifts away to the north. Did 
include a slight chance of thunder as model soundings show some 
elevated instability. But do not expect any severe weather with 
this system.

For Saturday the stalled front will be a focus for continued shower 
activity as the next system gains strength in west Texas, and 
resultant isentropic ascent over the frontal increases. There should 
be a lull in rain chances Friday night into Saturday morning, but 
expect at least some scattered coverage during the day Saturday. As

.DISCUSSION...

Increased ridging just to the west ahead of a trough over the
eastern Rockies that is expected to continuing digging over the 
next 24 hours. The increasing amplitude will lead to a very deep
upper level low pressure center that will track northeast and into
the Great Lakes region. Calm winds under the ridge will eventually
veer to the south and increase to slight gusts overnight.
Temperatures will drop slightly overnight but remain in the low
60's to high 50's. Adjusted temperatures slightly due to
radiational cooling and lowered dewpoints a little since winds
have stayed calm with less northeasterly flow from earlier today.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Overall the weather across the TN Valley and Southern Appalachian 
region remains rather nice as H5 heights continue to rise amidst an 
approaching ridge, and cool/dry nly llv flow prevails behind an old 
cold front which is currently laid atop northcentral MS/AL/GA. 
Meanwhile, another weak secondary cold front is slowly shifting 
southward across the OH Valley along the southern periphery of a 
surface anticyclone. Out west, a Four Corners H5 cyclone continues 
to deepen leading to lee cyclogenesis across portions of the 
Southern Plains.  

As for the fcst, wly/nwly flow aloft will favor advection of 
mid/high clouds (downstream of the aforementioned system) across the 
TN Valley and Southern Appalachians through the remains of the day. 
Otherwise, am expecting mostly sunny conditions with light nly flow 
and temperatures around a category above normal.  Overnight any nly 
flow will calm as the above noted surface ridge shifts east beneath 
the H5 ridge axis.  Thus, am expecting partly cloudy skies tonight 
(generally patches of mid/high clouds) amidst above normal lows and 
little (if any) fog given the dryness of the BL. 

On Thursday the overall pattern shifts somewhat as the deep ridging 
slides east of the Appalachians allowing for return sly waa across 
the deep south.  With that, expecting slightly higher humidity with 
increasing low/mid level cloudiness.  As the overall pressure 
gradient increases thanks to the advancing system to the west, llv 
flow will ramp up with gusts across the high terrain Thursday 
afternoon upward of 30-40mph at times.  Likewise, ample mixing 
across the remainder of the region is expected to favor some 20-
30mph gusts.  At this time a wind advisory does not look necessary 
therefore will just highlight in the HWO.  Temperatures on Thursday 
will once again top out nearly two categories above normal.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
This period will be an active one with several systems tracking 
across the eastern US. The first will be the potent storm system 
that is currently over the Great Plains. This system will be 
tracking slowly NE through the upper MS Valley and into Canada by 
Friday night. The trailing cold front is expected to initiate 
storms in AR/West TN Thursday afternoon, but the lifting of 
dynamic forcing with the system to the Great Lakes and overnight 
timing will result in weakening convection as the front approaches
our area. Ahead of it, southerly low level winds will be quite 
strong in the mountains Thursday night, on the order of 50 kts at 
850 mb. This may necessitate a Wind Advisory with later forecast 
issuances. Although gusts may approach 60 mph at times, confidence
is not high enough to go with a High Wind Watch at this time. 

The front becomes parallel to the SW-NE midlevel flow and becomes 
nearly stationary over our area on Saturday. Forcing and moisture 
advection during this period are weak, but the presence of the front 
and an increasingly backed 850 mb wind may be enough for scattered 
light showers in the area. The next storm system will be positioned 
farther south than the last one, tracking from TX to the Mid MS 
Valley to the Great Lakes over the weekend. This one could have a 
greater impact for our area as the upper trough is more amplified 
and the jet is in a better position to support convection on Sunday 
afternoon, and possibly a severe threat. A mention of this potential 
will be added to the HWO. 

Passage of the cold front and upper trough will bring a sizable 
drop in temperatures for Monday, with lows in the 40s and highs in
the 60s. A building ridge will provide dry weather Monday and 
Tuesday, then another system developing over the Plains will bring
a deep southerly flow and increasing moisture on Wednesday. 
Details are too uncertain this far out for specifics, but the 
amplification and positive tilt of the upper trough as shown by 
the GFS and ECMWF will warrant a close watch of the severe weather
potential over the next few days.

an old cold front has become stationary across portions or 
northcentral MS/AL/GA, while a secondary weak reinforcing cold 
front approaches from the OH Valley region amidst building high 
pressure. As for the fcst closer to home, things looked pretty 
good relative to the previous fcst. That said, did bump up max 
temps a degree or so this afternoon given current trends. Also 
tweaked winds slightly by way of minor increases across the 
central/lower valley where some sites are reporting 8-10kts of nly
flow. Otherwise, no sig changes needed for this update. Enjoy

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...The forecast area will enjoy a 
benign period of weather today as the early week system fades away
off the Atlantic Coast while a deep, slow moving low pressure 
system develops over the Plains. A ridge will be in place over the
Southern Appalachian region between these two systems providing 
for nearly full sunshine today. Strengthening Spring sunshine will
boost high temperatures to the lower and middle 70s north to the 
upper 70s across the south. Quiet weather continues tonight with a
strengthening pressure gradient ahead of the big Plains low. The 
weak low level mixing in this pattern will keep lows several 
degrees above normal in the middle and upper 50s across much of 
the region with upper 40s to around 50 degrees across Southwest 
Virginia and Northeast Tennessee. 

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Wednesday)...The long term forecast 
period is shaping up to be a busy, and interesting period. We 
start the period with a very strong system deepening over the 
plains, and high pressure along the northeastern seaboard. This 
feature will lift to the north/northeast Thursday into Friday, 
with the associated cold front moving into eastern Tennessee 
during the day Friday. Meanwhile, the next system will dive south 
through Arizona into northern Mexico on Friday before ejecting 
east across Texas Saturday into Sunday.

As mentioned in previous discussions, moisture return for this 
Friday cold front will be fairly limited, with perhaps the better 
return flow coming off the Atlantic near the Carolina coast. East to 
southeasterly flow across the Carolinas and into the southern 
Appalachian Thursday night into Friday will produce some upslope 
precipitation across the southern Appalachians. This is likely to 
put much of our CWA into a rain shield until rainfall associated 
with the incoming cold front arrives during the day Friday. Do have 
some chance PoPs along the TN border, but wouldn't expect much 
outside of that until maybe daybreak Friday. Also of note Thursday 
night will be strengthening gradient flow at the surface and aloft, 
perhaps enough to warrant concern for some mountain wave activity. 
One limiting factor here would be the lack of a strong inversion 
above mountain top levels since, by that time, we will be squarely 
in the warm sector of this storm. However, model soundings from 
Asheville NC indicate there may be enough of a capping inversion 
late Thursday night into Friday morning to produce some good 
downslope winds. Cross section analysis shows decently strong 
downward omega in the western foothills of the Appalachians. 
Additionally, H85 flow will strengthen to around 50-60kt, and will 
be favorably aligned out of the S-SE. If nothing else, suspect the 
higher terrain will see pretty windy conditions Thursday night. 

Models have come into better agreement for how widespread rainfall 
will be on Friday with the cold front. High resolution models like 
the NAM12 indicate that precipitation will be more on the scattered 
side of things than widespread, which makes sense given the overall 
lack of moisture. Still, showers and perhaps some embedded 
thunderstorms will be widespread enough to warrant pretty high PoPs 
for Friday. A tenth to a quarter of an inch of rain seems 
reasonable, with the best QPF residing mainly near the northern 
plateau counties.

For Friday night into Saturday the surface cold front will stall out 
to the south of us. However the mid level front will remain overhead 
as the next system ejects into Texas and southerly low and mid level 
flow strengthen along the central Gulf states and up towards 
Tennessee. Therefore will keep at least some slight chance to chance 
PoPs going through that period as some nocturnal convection along 
the H85 front is likely to occur from middle Tennesee eastward into 
our CWA. There may be a bit of a lull in rain chances late Saturday 
as a warm front lifts north of us and we get back into another warm 
sector. However the next cold front arrives early Sunday so the 
break will be short. Will carry categorical PoPs for the day Sunday, 
with a chance of thunder mentioned as well. I will say that Sunday 
poses an interesting scenario with regard to potential severe 
storms. The threat right now looks to be to our south into the 
Georgia area. However if timing slows, or the track of the surface 
low shifts a little north, then conditions could become favorable 
for some severe storms in the southern valley. Will continue to 
monitor, but at this point in time there's a marginal threat at
best.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...

A southern stream trough will continue to progress eastward this 
afternoon and overnight as upper level ridging develops to the 
west. At the surface, an area of low pressure located across 
southern Alabama will continue to move eastward as high pressure 
moves out of the northern plains. Temperatures this afternoon are 
in the upper 60s to low 70s with partly cloudy skies. Visible 
satellite imagery continues to show mostly diurnally driven 
cumulus across a large portion of the area with better vertical 
development located across the Smoky Mountains and southern 
Tennessee where an axis of low to mid level convergence exists. 
Overall lift seems weak across our area, but an isolated 
thunderstorm or two could be possible across far southeast 
Tennessee, and western North Carolina. Otherwise, high pressure at
the surface will bring drier weather conditions through tonight 
with lows in the mid 40s to low 50s. 

On Wednesday, the upper levels become more amplified as a trough 
digs across the Rockies. This will allow for sharper ridging to 
develop while high pressure at the surface extends across the 
Great Lakes, and Ohio valley. The above features will translate to
tranquil weather conditions and slightly warmer temperatures with
mid to upper 70s area wide and a few 80 degree locations 
possible.


.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...


A number of features to discuss for the long term outlook. 
Temperatures look to remain fairly constant through the week and 
over the weekend along a seasonal diurnal curve. The only exception 
will come early next week as cooler and drier air moves in behind 
two back to back low pressure systems that are expected to bring 
showers and a few embedded thunderstorms for Friday and Sunday. With 
the advection of this more continental air mass on Monday, 
temperatures early next week look to be in the low to mid 60's while 
most of this week will stay in the low to mid 70's.

Mostly high pressure for the mid week with increasing ridging for 
late Thursday and into Friday ahead of the next incoming cold front. 
A deep upper level low in the Great Plains will track towards the 
east northeast and into the Great Lakes region by Friday morning. The 
cold front originating from the aforementioned low will impact eastern 
Tennessee by Thursday night with some pre frontal showers and some 
possible embedded thunderstorms. This front will move out by Friday 
night but the GFS and Euro models are currently not in agreement as 
to any residual moisture or orientation of the tail end of the 
front. The Euro shows the trailing edge stalling out and becoming 
more stationary over the Smokey mountains. Current thinking is that 
the southerly warm air advection won't be strong enough to account 
for the amount of moisture shown by the Euro, so am inclined to lean 
more towards the GFS.

A brief period of weak ridging early on Saturday ahead of the next 
low pressure system that will move northeastward out of the American 
southwest. Another difference between the models here as the Euro 
brings in the warm front earlier than the GFS as it shows the 
trailing edge of the previous cold front quickly becoming stationary 
and transitioning to a warm frontal boundary on Saturday. The strong 
southerly flow depicted in the Euro shows widespread showers ahead 
of the warm front Saturday afternoon, while the GFS shows weaker 
warm air advection from the south and holds the front back until 
Saturday night. Am inclined again to lean towards the GFS model in 
this instance as the frontal orientation and the inflow amount of 
moisture from the advection of warm air from the south looks more 
reasonable.

weather as an upper level low drifts slowly east from Alabama this
morning into Georgia by early evening. Some spotty light rain and
drizzle and fog is limiting visibility to mainly mvfr category at
tys and tri, and a little lower at cha. Ceilings are quite low
across the southern valley where flight category is as low as
lifr. Gradual warming and mixing will allow for improvement to vfr
by mid day. The low vfr layer may remain broken into late
afternoon before dissipating entirely as a drier northerly flow
fills in behind the departing low.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A northern stream upper trough 
will be making its way east through the day while it drags the 
more active southern stream feature slowly toward the Southeast 
Atlantic Coast. Some deep moisture is available for lifting in 
association with the stacked Southeastern states low pressure 
system and sufficient cape will allow for enough buoyancy for the 
development of a few thunderstorms. Much of the threat for a rain 
shower will have ended across most of the forecast area by early 
afternoon, as the trough axis builds closer to the Appalachian 
spine. The northerly flow developing on the back side of the 
system brings increasingly drier and less buoyant air through the 
afternoon hours across much of the northwestern two thirds of the 
forecast area. Forecast highs are on track to reach the lower and 
middle 70s again today. A drier low level airmass, clearing skies 
aloft, and a light northerly surface flow will result in low 
temperatures mainly in the 40s tonight. 

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...The primary concerns for 
the long term period will be a cold front moving through the 
region on Friday, and another system slated to arrive sometime 
late in the weekend.

Regarding the Friday system, slowed the onset of precipitation down 
a bit though possibly not enough. Current forecast has some chance 
pops beginning during the early morning hours on Friday, mainly over 
the mountains and perhaps the southern plateau as return flow begins 
in earnest. Have serious concerns about how quickly precipitation 
will begin in this return flow pattern as the current system along 
the central Gulf coast will shove higher moisture content well out 
into the Gulf Of Mexico. There is a bit of a wedge pattern in place 
Thursday with a surface high just off the New York coastline, which 
would yield easterly flow off the Atlantic and into the Carolinas. 
This may yield some upslope precipitation on the NC/SC side of the 
Appalachians but have to wonder whether that would give any rain on 
our side since we'd be in the rain shadow. Further west, the 
moisture tap for the Friday system will come from the western Gulf 
essentially so that's not exactly ideal for a lot of rain into the 
plateau area either. In any case, the cold front will move into the 
CWA sometime on Friday and will bring with it widespread showers and 
likely some embedded thunderstorms. Hard to go too heavy handed with 
thunder chances given thermal profiles, so just included slight 
chance of thunder with overall higher rain chances.

The cold front will clears the area Friday night, though how far to 
the south is in question. The next system will be ejecting out of 
southern New Mexico and into the southern plains and Texas on 
Saturday. Differences in how quickly this happens, and how strong 
the response is in developing southerly flow off the central Gulf 
states mean the Friday cold front either stalls over the southern 
part of our CWA, or stalls out in Alabama and Georgia. The main 
difference here will be with respect to how quickly rain moves back 
into the region on Saturday or Saturday night. The ECMWF is far 
quicker with the development of additional rain, showing widespread 
showers by midday Saturday whereas the GFS shows a more distinct 
break due to a more southerly stalling of the Friday front. 
Generally favored the GFS solution here as I think the drier 
handling of the Friday system seems more realistic, and thus a more 
pronounced break between the Friday and late weekend systems will be 
seen. As a result, featured a slower onset of showers Saturday 
afternoon, with categorical PoPs for Sunday Day 5. Rain looks to 
push out of the area by the start of the work week.

As far as temperatures go, some relief will be seen at night, 
especially Friday night and Sunday night where a shot of 
significantly cooler/drier continental air will be seen. Daytime 
temperatures will continue to run warm through the weekend before 
cooling off firmly into 60s for early next week.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...

An upper level low and parent southern stream shortwave trough will 
rotate eastward through MS and AL this evening through tonight. A 
cold front associated with a northern stream trough will drop south 
into northern parts of the valley in the 06-12Z timeframe. The most 
organized showers and thunderstorms likely already occurred earlier 
today, but a warm and humid airmass will continue across east TN, 
southwest VA, and southwest NC ahead of this system. Lift associated 
with the upper low and cold front will continue to promote periods 
of showers and isolated thunderstorms through the night. Soundings 
suggest a gradual lowering of the freezing level through the night 
with LI's of -3 to -7 and 500-1200 J/KG of ML CAPE as colder air 
aloft filters into the region. The highest of this instability will 
remain in the central and southern valley where any stronger cells 
could continue to produce locally heavy rain, gusty winds, and small 
hail through at least 03Z, although this will be very isolated. Hi-
Res CAMS show many differences in convective coverage overnight, but 
consensus is that the coverage should be the most widespread before 
06Z, then becoming more isolated the rest of the night. Due to the 
lower confidence in coverage, decided to keep chance pops for 
showers/storms through 08Z then taper to slight chance the rest of 
the night in the north. Clouds and continued warm, humid airmass 
will keep lows above normal tonight with mid 50's to near 60 
expected. Went slightly above the MET/MAV blend for low temps. 

The shortwave trough and upper low will continue to rotate southeast 
Tuesday with the cold front slowly settling further south across the 
region. The cold pool aloft underneath this system will build 
afternoon ML CAPES above 500 J/KG with 1000-1500 J/Kg at the surface 
as daytime heating takes place, so scattered showers and 
thunderstorms should develop again from mid morning through mid 
afternoon. The best potential for this will be from the southern 
valley through southeast NC in closer proximity to the front and 
upper low. Could see small hail with the thunderstorms tomorrow 
with freezing levels down to roughly 10,500 ft. Have carried 
chance pops for showers/storms in the morning and afternoon from 
the southern plateau across the southern valley into southwest 
NC, but keeping the forecast mostly dry farther north as drier, 
more stable air filters in. Another pleasantly warm day is on tap 
with low/mid 70's across much of the region. Stayed close to MET 
guidance for high temps.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...

The short wave to the east will continue to make it's way out of the 
region at the start of the long term outlook. Conditions look to be 
more calm and dry for most of Tuesday night and Wednesday as an 
upper level ridge moves in behind the trough. The higher pressure 
will lead to warm and pleasant conditions for the mid week.

The next weather system to impact our area will most likely move in 
by late Thursday. A low pressure center over the central Great 
Plains will track to the east northeast into the Great Lakes region 
by late Thursday. An associated cold front originating from the low 
will sweep across eastern Tennessee by Thursday evening with mostly 
showers and a few possible thunderstorms overnight. Strong southerly 
flow ahead of the front will account for a number of prefrontal 
showers. A fair amount of continued warm air advection will aid the 
ongoing showers for most of the day on Friday.

As the front moves eastward and the low pressure center continues to 
track into the Great Lakes, a strong pressure gradient behind the 
front will produce some decent winds across the area for Friday 
night. While winds could have some considerable gusts for the 
eastern mountains, the orientation will be predominantly from the 
southwest, so no downsloping wind event is expected at the moment. A 
brief period of high pressure on Saturday as winds calm and 
temperatures warm from the continued southerly flow before a second 
developing short wave event moves up from the southwest Saturday 
night. This system looks to bring another round of rain with 
possible thunderstorms to the area for most of Sunday and into 
Sunday night.

.DISCUSSION...Increased pops the remainder of the morning
expanding from the southern and central valley at the current hour
through the rest of northeast TN and southwest VA by 16Z. Have
likely showers with a slight chance of thunderstorms expanding 
during this time, and still expect widespread showers for the

0-1 Km bulk shear has been up to 30 kts with 0-1 Km SRH around
150-200 m2s2 and 0-3 Km SRH around 300 m2s2. ML CAPE has been
about 250-500 J/Kg. Recent radar has suggested a downward trend in
this activity over the past hour, but a widespread area of showers
and embedded thunder will continue to move northeast into the
region. SPC Day 1 Convective outlook has a Slight Risk in the
southern valley, so could continue to see isolated severe storms
through the afternoon with strong winds being the main threat.

The 12z TAF period will be a difficult one, with multiple rounds
of showers and thunderstorms affecting most terminals, especially
KCHA which will be closer to the upper low that is responsible 
for convection. Timing in significant breaks will be difficult,
but have tried to show a break beginning late this morning before
next wave of convection arrives in earnest late this afternoon and
evening. KCHA is likely to see several hours of VCSH/VCTS this

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

A quasi-closed low was located over far northeast Texas early this 
morning, with some connections to a northern stream trough moving 
through the Great Lakes noted in water vapor imagery. This system 
will slowly work east across the Arkansas/Louisiana border today, 
enhancing shower and thunderstorm potential across our forecast area 
as it does so.

Locally, skies were mostly clear early this morning in the wake of 
convection from last evening. Some patchy fog has formed in some 
places as a result of these clear skies, but with more high clouds 
moving in from the southwest ahead of the next round of showers and 
thunderstorms, this should either hold at current areal coverage or 
dissipate.

Speaking of the next round of convection, regional radar imagery 
showed a line of storms arcing from far northeastern Mississippi,
to the south-southeast to between Tuscaloosa and Birmingham, and 
finally down to the far western end of the Florida panhandle as of
07z. High res guidance suggests that the more widespread 
convection on northeast MS and central AL will likely continue to 
shift northeast through middle Tenn and towards the 
Kentucky/Virginia line, following roughly along the axis of the 
low level jet. Some scattered shower activity will likely exist 
further east/southeast into the Cumberland plateau and TN valley 
areas. This initial round of showers should lift north of the CWA 
by mid/late morning, with yet another batch of showers and 
thunderstorms likely moving in late this afternoon and into the 
evening hours once the atmosphere recovers from morning showers 
and cloud cover and destabilizes again. The forecast will reflect 
a lowering in rain chances late this morning and into the early 
afternoon hours, before increasing again later today, but will 
maintain at least some 20-30 percent rain chances at all times due
to uncertainty in areal coverage and timing. Much like yesterday,
clouds should break up quite a bit in the afternoon hours. Places
that see sufficient sunshine will likely warm into the low or 
perhaps mid 70s. Expect the coolest areas will be in the western 
valley and plateau regions where cloud cover is likely to be most 
prevalent. For tonight, with the upper low drawing closer to our 
southern counties, it is difficult to say exactly how much 
convection will dissipate. Diurnal trends will certainly result in
a lessening of coverage, but plenty of guidance indicates there 
will be some nocturnal convection so will keep decent rain chances
going overnight as well.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...

At the start of the period the shortwave trough axis will be 
bisecting East Tennessee. It will be more progressive than previous 
model runs therefore the rainfall will exit the forecast area rather 
quickly. Showers and thunderstorms are expected mainly during the 
morning hours gradually ending from west to east through the day. By 
Tuesday night dry conditions will prevail as shortwave ridging 
begins to build. The ridge will stay in control bringing pleasant 
temperatures and more dry weather through Wednesday night and most 
of Thursday. 

The strengthening low over the Central Plains will begin to 
translate towards the Great Lakes Region on Thursday. As a result, 
the trailing cold front will march across Tennessee and Thursday 
night and Friday. Strong southerly flow ahead of this front will 
bring warmer temperatures and increasing low level moisture to the 
forecast area. Showers will be on the increase late Thursday 
afternoon through Thursday night. Showers are expected ahead and 
along the frontal boundary which will extend across Middle TN by 
midnight Thursday. The rain will move from west to east again and 
exit the forecast area by Friday night. 

A short lived high centered over Missouri will build into the area. 
Southwest flow aloft and another shortwave ejecting out of Texas 
will cause another fetch of low level moisture to overspread the 
area on Saturday night. As a result several more rounds of showers 
and expected through Sunday.

Main concern for the 06z TAF package is timing of incoming
convection today. Expect there to be an initial wave of SHRA and
possible embedded TSRA moving in from the southwest to KCHA around
daybreak, and arriving at KTYS and KTRI 2-3 hrs later. This should
be followed by a lull in activity before the next, more widespread
round of showers arrives later in the day around 19z or so at KCHA
and towards 23z at KTRI. Otherwise, flight categories should be
mainly low-end VFR levels, with dips into MVFR territory as
showers move through terminals. Winds will be less than 10kt, but
could experience some stronger gusts into the 15-20kt range with 
showers.

.Short Term (Tonight through Tuesday)...

Warm frontal boundary is lifting northeast across northeast 
Tennessee and southwest Virginia with airmass along and south of the 
boundary destabilizing. MLCAPEs have increased to 1000+ J/Kg across 
southeast Tennessee with Hail CAPEs between 200-400 J/kg. DCAPEs 
approaching 600 J/Kg south as well. There is marginal shear with 0-6 
km around 40kts. 

Main limiting factor is forcing as warm front lifts north of the 
area. Terrain will likely produce widely scattered/scattered storms. 
Also, line of storms over northern Mississippi may lift east 
northeast toward the Plateau and souheast Tennessee this evening. 
The main concern being marginal hail and strong and gusty winds. PWs 
of 1.3+ inches south will also have the potential of locally heavy 
rains.

For tonight and Monday, models are in dis-agreement in jet forcing 
will move into the area. The GFS pulls showers and embedded 
thunderstorms before daybreak Monday while the NAM is little later. 
Will increase chance of storms for Monday morning with CAPES around 
1000 J/kg with PWs increasing to 1.4 to 1.6 inches. Main concern 
with this area of convection will be heavy rains with potential of 
localized flash flooding.

For Monday night, jet dynamics lifts out of the Tennessee Valley 
with decreasing coverage of showers and embedded storms.  For 
Tuesday. upper trough moves across the Gulf Coast states with a 
boundary still hung up across far east Tennessee. Large differences 
in how much low-level moisture remains over the area with the NAM 
with higher dewpoints and instability. Will maintain chance of 
showers and thunderstorms Tuesday but confidence is low due to 
differences in boundary layer moisture availability.

.Long Term (Tuesday night through Sunday)...

Models in better agreement to start the period regarding the 
movement of the low pressure system away from the region. The ECMWF 
and GFS have consistently shown more of an open wave where the 
northern and southern streams better phase allowing a longwave 
trough to lift to the east, and the 12Z NAM has finally caught onto 
this idea. Have opted to keep slight chance pops in southeast TN and 
southwest NC through 03Z Wednesday. The rest of east TN and 
southwest VA will be dry all of Tuesday night. Used MET/MAV blend 
for lows with generally mid 40's/low 50's expected. 

Surface high pressure will finally build in Wednesday. Upper level 
heights will be rebounding quickly, so a beautifully warm day is 
expected with highs reaching the low/mid 70's and lots of sunshine 
by afternoon.  

Models in agreement that large scale ridging will return to the 
eastern U.S. Wednesday night and Thursday as a negatively tilted 500 
mb trough moves into the Plains and induces intense surface 
cyclogenesis that lifts toward the Great Lakes. This will further 
warm our already above normal temps as WAA strengthens across the TN 
valley keeping temps much above normal through the end of the week. 
Maintained a dry forecast Wednesday night and Thursday and went 
slightly above Superblend for temps. 

A strong cold front behind this system will cross late Thursday 
night through Friday morning. Brought in likely pops on the Plateau 
Thursday night with chance pops in the rest of the region. Friday 
will be wet at least through mid day with a steady light to moderate 
rain. Have likely to categorical pops areawide through the morning 
then chance in the afternoon. Not much in the way of instability 
will be drawn into the region with only a couple hundred joules of 
CAPE expected, and the better dynamics rapidly shift to the north, 
so have not included any thunder with this system. Early rainfall 
estimates from WPC indicate anywhere from a few tenths to one half 
inches of rain from this late week system, so heavy rainfall amounts 
are not expected. 

A big surface high will build down from the north Friday night and 
Saturday with much cooler and drier air. Temps will actually be 
below normal at this time.

The next system will move in Saturday night and Sunday with chance 
pops for showers returning.

.DISCUSSION...
An area of showers across northeast Tennessee and southwest
Virginia will move northeast and diminish this morning. The main
area of convection is currently across west Tennessee. These
storms are weakening but satellite and radar does show a Mesoscale
Convective Vortex (MCV) associated with it. This MCV will move
across the region this afternoon and evening increasing coverage
and intensity of the storms. 

The latest NAM soundings show MLCAPEs of 1000-1500 J/kg north to
2000+ J/Kg across the southern valley. Hail CAPEs and WBZ heights suggest
isolated stronger storms could produce up to quarter inch. Enough
boundary layer winds and thermodynamic (DCAPEs of 500-700 J/kg) to
produce strong gusty winds. Also, PWs increasing this afternoon to
1.2 to 1.4 inches producing a threat of locally heavy rains.

Given the above, isolated strong to possible severe storms by mid
to late afternoon into the evening hours.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Confidence is not high in today's forecast, especially with regard
to how convection during the afternoon and evening hours will 
unfold. But I'll come back to this in a moment.

First, the area will lie beneath weak upper ridging for much of
the day as a southern stream disturbance ejects northeast from
Texas and interacts with a northern stream shortwave trough 
moving through the central plains today. At the surface, a warm
front is currently moving north into the forecast area from the
southwest. This feature should continue to lift north through the
morning hours. Guidance, even high resolution CAMs, continue to
show at least scattered showers and thunderstorms accompanying
this front as it lifts through the CWA this morning. Current radar
imagery does not currently instill a lot of confidence in this, 
however the main focus for rainfall along this warm front would be
from roughly daybreak through mid/late morning, so there is still
time for this to change. The forecast reflects this and also 
shows a lull in precipitation from late morning into the early 
afternoon hours from south to north.

Regarding this afternoon and tonight, there are indicators that 
support either fairly widespread convection, or very little, 
depending on what guidance you look at. Pattern wise, there 
doesn't seem to be much of a trigger for storms today, with upper 
ridging (albeit with some gradual height falls as the trough 
approaches) overhead and synoptic forcing well to our west. Given 
the pattern and also what the latest CAM guidance is showing, 
lowered PoPs for the afternoon and evening to account for the 
likelihood of less convective activity later today. The forecast 
may still be too optimistic with respect to rain chances however. 
All of this being said, regardless of which guidance set you look 
at, instability and shear values all support the idea of low-end 
organized convection. The most likely areas to see stronger storms
would be the plateau areas on the western side of the CWA, with 
hail and perhaps some damaging winds being the primary threat.


.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...

Uncertainty right off the bat as models have a tough time 
agreeing on a solution in terms of the speed of the northern 
stream trough. The NAM continues with a closed low feature (likely
the remnants of the current convection over northern 
Mexico)centered over Louisiana Monday afternoon. However, the NAM 
keeps the northern stream trough rather progressive - and keeps 
both systems separate. The GFS joins the southern and northern 
stream troughs. Despite which one is correct, showers and 
thunderstorms will occur during the day Monday where marginal 
instability will be over the area. Anticipate the heaviest rain to
occur on Monday afternoon. Chances for showers and thunderstorms 
persist into Monday night as the trough axis shifts south and 
east. 

Tuesday, remnant showers will be possible mainly south of I-40 as 
this system shifts farther east. The total rainfall from Monday 
through Tuesday will range from 1 to 1.5 inches.

Dry conditions prevail as broad high pressure builds over the 
central U.S. through Wednesday night. A powerful storm system will 
eject out of Colorado Wednesday night and track into the Great Lakes 
Region on Thursday. The trailing cold front will march east across 
Tennessee Thursday evening and Friday. Showers will increase from 
west to east Thursday night and through much of Friday. By Friday 
night the front will have moved into the Carolinas taking the 
precipitation with it. In its wake, slightly cooler and drier air 
will be place on Saturday.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...
Nice evening in store, then a warm front will lift northward 
through the area late tonight through Sunday morning, spreading 
scattered showers northward with it. Thinking we will get somewhat
of a break during the day, and then a particularly bouyant air 
mass will ensue with diurnal heating, such that some tstms may be
triggered over the higher elevations. SPC has a marginal risk of 
severe thunderstorms over the Plateau Sunday as a result.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)...
A moist and unstable airmass will be in place to start the 
period. The biggest question is whether there will be any ongoing 
convection. If any storms are ongoing or do develop, the main 
threats will be large hail and isolated damaging wind gusts. Hail 
CAPES remain elevated into the evening hours with plenty of CAPE 
within the hail growth zone. There is a chance that activity 
located back to our west and northwest may produce some outflow 
boundaries that move into the Northern Cumberland Plateau and 
Northern Valley during the evening that initiates some convection.
POPS start increasing late in the night and through the day on 
Monday, as an area of low pressure rotates across MS/AL/GA from 
west to east. The incoming low has another warm front which will 
be located north of the area during the day on Monday. This front 
interacts with a weak, trailing, cold front associated with the 
low up across New England and both boundaries end up in a west-to-
east orientation just to our north. This boundary, plus the 
vicinity of the low, will provide plenty of lift to generate 
showers and storms through the day therefore allowing Monday to be
our highest POP day of the long term.

With the low positioned to our southwest, abundant moisture from the 
Gulf gets advected into our area. Soundings show PW values ranging 
from 1.25 to 1.5 inches by Monday afternoon, which is maxed out for 
this time of year climatologically. This will allow for potentially 
heavy rainfall. WPC is currently highlighting a marginal risk for 
excessive rainfall. Also, there could be a few strong storms, with 
the main threats being small hail and isolated damaging winds.

There is quite a bit of disagreement on the position of the low by 
Tuesday. The GFS has it directly to our south, the ECMWF has it off 
to our southeast, and the NAM shows it still back to our southwest. 
The position of the low will directly affect our POPS through the 
day on Tuesday so not very confident on Tuesday's forecast as of 
now. The good news is that Tuesday night into Wednesday the low 
moves out and brief ridging builds back in through Thursday, which 
is the only dry days of the long term. By Thursday night/Friday a 
cold front is approaching from the west and will bring us another 
shot of rain and storms. The front moves off to our east Friday 
night and Saturday looks dry with zonal flow in place.

Temps through the long term will be above normal for both highs and 
lows, anywhere from 5 to 15 degrees above normal.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Zonal 500mb flow is noted over the region this morning, with a
compact 850mb low and associated surface low to our east just off
the NC coast, and the next system slated to affect our forecast 
area currently ejecting northeast from the Texas panhandle. Upper
ridging will begin to build overhead later today as the TX system
ejects northeast into the southern plains and downstream height
rises are seen in response. Later this evening and overnight a
warm front to our south will begin to move north towards/into the
CWA as southerly flow strengthens in response to the developing
plains system. Will maintain a dry forecast for much of the
period, but rain chances will increase late tonight and into the
long term period.

Temperatures are forecast to rise into the low 70s for lower 
elevations in southwest VA and northeast TN and into the mid to 
upper 70s for the central and southern valley today. This could 
be a little optimistic however, as there will be plenty of clouds
to contend with through the day. Forecast temperatures yesterday 
were a little on the high side, and despite guidance supporting 
these warm temps in the 70s today I could see a similar scenario 
playing out once again if clouds fail to dissipate as expected.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...

A warm front will be lifting north at the start of this period. 
Southwesterly flow aloft in association with the trough over the 
southern plains will bring several shortwaves across the forecast 
area. The first wave will occur Sunday morning over the southern 
TN Valley and spread northward. There may be several hours before 
another round of showers and thunderstorms rolls across the 
Plateau and into the TN Valley later in the afternoon/early 
evening. SPC has the Plateau in a marginal risk this afternoon 
where some storms will approach severe limits due to the best 
instability/shear. 

Shower and thunderstorm chances persist into Sunday night as a 
southern stream low meanders over the ArkLaTex region. This sets 
up for rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches from Monday through 
Tuesday. Rainfall will end from west to east on the backside of 
the low early Tuesday evening. 

Dry conditions prevail on Wednesday and Wednesday night as 
shortwave ridging occurs ahead of the next vigorous storm system 
over the Plains. Showers and thunderstorms will occur Thursday 
night as a strong front moves through the region. Rain will 
quickly come to an end early Friday morning and the front sweeps 
into Virginia and the Carolinas.

Daytime temperatures will generally be in the 70s Sunday through 
Thursday and overnight lows will generally be in the 50s. Cooler 
temperatures can be expected on Friday.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...There may be a stray
lingering sprinkle over far northern and eastern locations early
this evening as the remnants of a short wave continues to pull
away from the area. Also with the recent rainfall...expect patchy
fog to form across the region towards morning. Otherwise...it
should be a rather quiet and uneventful short term. Flow aloft
will begin fairly zonal with weak ridging developing during the
day Saturday. Weak surface high pressure will also influence area
weather. A frontal boundary south of the TN boarder will slowly be
moving northward during the period but associated showers should
stray south of the area throughout the short term. As a result of
all of this...expect dry conditions with temperatures mild and
above normal. Highs on Saturday are expected to reach into the 70s
across most valley locations.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Friday)...A fairly active long term 
period with several rounds of thunderstorms/rain chances possible 
along with more clouds than sun. The only silver lining is that 
temperatures will be above average for both highs and lows with highs 
generally in the 70s and lows in the 50s.  

Saturday night a low pressure center is swinging through the Plains 
and toward the Great Lakes Region while an associated warm front 
extends down into the MS/AL/GA. This warm front lifts northward 
through our area overnight into Sunday morning, providing focus for 
some showers and storms. On Sunday we are firmly in the warm sector 
so the biggest question will be where will the forcing come from to 
initiate any thunderstorms. The best forcing is off to our west and 
northwest, back across Western TN/KY. The airmass over our area will 
be quite unstable with 1000 to 1500 J/kg MLCAPE in place and a good 
amount of hail cape. So if storms do develop, the biggest threats 
would be isolated damaging winds and large hail. Shear is weak with 
30kts at 0-3km so don't expect any well organized storms, but more 
organized than garden variety pulse storms. A few severe 
thunderstorms are possible. The SPC is highlighting a slight risk 
just to our west, so we will continue to monitor the evolution of 
this system.

On Sunday night into Monday another area of low pressure is moving 
out of the ARK-LA-TEX region in association with the active southern 
stream jet. This low will bring another warm front through our area 
which will be focus for more showers and storms. Monday through 
Tuesday the low rotates across our area and will give us the best 
chance of POPs through the period. Plenty of lift, moisture, and 
instability will be present during this time so expect on and off 
rounds of showers and thunderstorms.

Conditions dry out Wednesday through Thursday. However, Thursday 
night through Friday another front rolls in and brings another shot 
of showers and storms with clearing conditions by Friday afternoon 
with cooler temperatures behind the front.

.DISCUSSION...Thursday night's system continues to pull away from 
the area today.  As a result...a few pockets of sprinkles/drizzle 
will linger over the area through the rest of the morning.  Then...a 
minor lobe of energy trailing behind the exiting system will slide 
through. This feature should be enough to keep low to mid clouds in 
place today and could potentially generate a few isolated light 
showers this afternoon.  Made a couple of minor tweaks to POPs for 
the afternoon and will remove morning wording...otherwise...all 
looks good for the morning update.

.AVIATION...

Showers should become rather sparse through the morning. Have some
TEMPO conditions in earl to account for ongoing rainfall, but
converage should become low enough to not carry any -SHRA or -RA
at any terminals past mid morning. IFR and LIFR conditions are
present this morning but expect that a gradual increase to VFR
levels by early afternoon should occur. Some indications that a
return of fog and low ceilings is on tap for tonight, but with
lack of prime radiational conditions or upper high pressure,
wasn't confident enough to include at KCHA or KTYS. Did trend
downwards again at KTRI however.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

A shortwave trough is moving east through middle Tennessee early 
this morning, and is forecast to be along the North Carolina 
coastline by the mid to early afternoon hours later today. Showers 
are fairly widespread across the forecast area ahead of this feature 
early this morning. Expect this trend to continue through the 
daybreak time frame, with a gradual lessening in coverage expected 
thereafter. PoPs reflect a downward trend from the plateau eastward 
after daybreak, with the highest chances lingering in the mountains 
through later today. Model soundings show some very weak instability 
in the H85 to roughly H7 layer later this afternoon. Guidance yields 
some spotty QPF in the afternoon as a result. Kept some slight 
chance PoPs in for the valley and plateau areas through the 
afternoon to account for this, but again I expect much of the 
rainfall after midday to be limited mainly to the higher terrain.

Temperatures are forecast to get into the upper 60s to around 70 
today. There will be plenty of low clouds around today so this could 
be a little warm, but it should be close to what occurs.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...

Warm southerly flow will increase across our region Saturday as mid 
to upper level heights begin to rise and a 1022 mb surface high sets 
up over the western Atlantic. Projected soundings are quite dry 
through the column through the day, so mostly sunny skies are 
expected, and with the WAA pattern, this will lead to very warm 
temps. Expect widespread highs in the mid 70's and even a few spots 
around 80 in the southern valley. Went slightly above MAV guidance 
for Saturday's highs. 

The pattern will amplify Saturday night and Sunday with an upper 
level ridge axis developing over the eastern U.S. as troughing and 
lee cyclogenesis take shape in the Plains and western half of the 
Midwest. This will cause a warm front to lift northeast across the 
region late Saturday night into Sunday morning. Soundings show the 
profile becoming increasingly moist and unstable during this time as 
southwesterly warm and moist advection increases in response to the 
tightening southwesterly gradient flow. At least scattered 
showers will accompany the passage of this warm front, so have 
chance pops Saturday night through Sunday morning. Lows Saturday 
night will be mild with mid 50's in most areas and around 60 in 
the southern valley. Again went slightly above MAV guidance for 
lows.

A lull in the activity will occur from mid morning through early 
afternoon Sunday with increasing sunshine. Expect a quick rise in 
temps with highs reaching the mid 70's to low 80's, and the moist 
southerly flow will result in dew points rising into the low 60's. 
This will lead to building instability through the afternoon with 
scattered areas of convection. Thinking that ML CAPE values will be 
1500-2000 J/Kg on the plateau and southern valley Sunday afternoon 
with less in the remainder of the region. Lapse rates will be steep 
in the afternoon too with 700-500 mb and 850-500 mb LR progged to be 
7.0-7.5 C/Km. Deep layer shear is not particularly strong though 
with 30-35 kt 0-6 Km bulk shear. However, low level shear looks 
better with around 20 kt 0-1 Km shear and helicity values of 120-
150, especially in the southern valley. PWAT values look to be 
around 1.25 inches. With all of this being said, think that 
convection will be in the form of scattered multi-cell clusters. The 
forcing from the synoptic cold front will be well to the west 
Sunday, so the coverage of storms will not be widespread. The best 
chance for convection will be from the Plateau through the southern 
valley and along the far east TN mountains where differential 
heating boundaries often help to initiate some convection. The above 
mentioned steep mid level lapse rates and high PWAT values could 
lead to locally heavy rain and hail in the strongest cores. Pockets 
of damaging wind could also occur. Widespread severe weather is not 
anticipated, but the low level wind shear is just strong enough to 
keep whatever clusters of storms that do develop fairly organized. 
Movement of the convection will be to the northeast, so some cells 
could make their way into the valley. With the southwesterly flow 
pattern, some training could take place as well leading to areas of 
heavy rain. As mentioned, convective coverage will not be 
widespread, and there could be some capping associated with the 
ridge axis, so greatest coverage will likely stay close to the 
Plateau in the afternoon. Have chance pops Sunday afternoon at this 
time for the plateau and southern valley with slight chance 
elsewhere. Staying close to MAV numbers for highs Sunday. 

Coverage of showers will increase Sunday night as height falls 
associated with the approaching trough axis induce better lift. 
Diurnal timing is unfavorable, but enough elevated CAPE will remain 
to keep thunder in the forecast, so have likely pops for 
showers/storms Sunday night. No severe weather is expected. Lows 
will remain mild again. 

The actual trough and associated cold front will cross the region 
the first half of Monday. There will be significant cloud cover, but 
with instability still present, have likely to categorical pops for 
showers and thunderstorms with highs still reaching the lower 70's. 
Used Superblend for Monday's temps. Showers will linger Monday night 
into Tuesday as the trough axis remains overhead and both the ECMWF 
and GFS hint at a secondary low moving northeast through the region. 
Have likely pops for showers Monday night and chance Tuesday. Model 
plan views hold onto some CAPE through Tuesday, so used shower 
wording Monday night then put thunder back in Tuesday in the heating 
of the day. Mild temps will continue with lows in the 50's Monday 
night and highs low/mid 70's for Tuesday, and once again stayed 
close to Superblend.

Dry weather will finally return Tuesday night and Wednesday as the 
trough axis moves east and surface high builds in from the north. 
This will yield a drier and slightly cooler airmass, although the 
main difference will be cooler nights with daytime highs still 
expected to be in the low/mid 70's under a mostly sunny sky.   

Another trough and lee cyclone will develop in the Plains Wednesday 
night with increasingly warm and moist advection into our area. An 
associated fast moving cold front should pass through Thursday or 
Thursday night. The ECMWF is slower and deeper with this system than 
the GFS. At this time, have slight chance pops Thursday and chance 
pops Thursday night into Friday. Warm temps will continue in this 
late week period as there will not be any strong airmass changes.

.DISCUSSION...
Some light rain is finally beginning to spread over the southern
plateau and parts of the southern Tennessee Valley this evening.
Temperatures have stayed in the mild lower to mid 60s across the
region. Dew points are slowly rising but rh values still only 35
to 40 percent at 900 pm EDT. Forcing still expected to strengthen
overnight and with weak elevated instability there could be a few
thunderstorms across the southern third of the forecast area late
tonight and early Friday morning. Rainfall amounts were lowered
tonight but locally 0.75 to around 1 inch possible overnight. The
southern third will likely receive the highest totals. Mild low 
temperatures tonight in the lower to mid 50s. Slowed the spread of
rain into the area slightly based on current radar trends. Entire
area should have some rain though by early morning.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
Rain will begin to spread into the area from the west over the next 
few hours ahead of an approaching low pressure system. Low levels 
are initially dry and will dissipate precip initially, but as 
forcing strengthens - associated with strong upper divergence and 
low level moisture advection and convergence - rain rates will be 
moderate. Instability is lacking but the forecast soundings do show 
weak elevated instability overnight in the southern half, and so a 
slight chance of thunderstorms will continue with categorical PoPs. 
Rain amounts between a half inch and one inch are expected, with 
southern sections on the higher end of that range. Rain chances will 
diminsh Friday morning with the passage of the mid/upper level 
trough axis, but with the surface to 850 mb low remaining over KY, 
low level moisture lingers through the afternoon to give mostly 
cloudy skies. Forecast high temps will be lowered from the previous 
forecast for Friday, with highs in the 60s to around 70.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
Quasi-zonal upper level flow will persist through the day on 
Saturday with high pressure moving into the Mid-atlantic. The 
result will be a dry and warm Saturday with high temperatures in 
the upper 70s to near 80. The upper levels will begin to amplify 
Saturday afternoon into Saturday night with a developing trough to
the west. The increase in upper level ridging will again give way
to a dry forecast for Saturday night with milder temperatures. 
Lows Saturday night will likely stay in the low to upper 50s. 
Troughing across the southern and central plains will lead to lee 
cyclogenesis with a strengthening surface pressure gradient and 
increased southerly flow. A warm front will begin to lift north 
Sunday morning with slight chances of rain showers. Increased 
lapse rates and most unstable CAPE values would support chances of
thunderstorms as well. Once the warm front moves north of the 
area, a lull in activity is expected. 

The atmosphere on Sunday afternoon will become increasingly unstable 
characterized by surface dewpoints in the low 60's.  Such moisture 
and warm air advection will lead to an increase in lower 
tropospheric instability.  Still some questions in regards to how 
much precipitation develops as the best lift will likely be located 
further west.  Will leave slight chance to chance PoPs of thunder 
for now as enough instability would exist for multicellular 
convection.  Still not expecting any strong to severe storms as mid 
level flow and overall shear remains weak. Temperatures on Sunday 
will be warm with most locations seeing highs in the upper 70s to 
near 80.  An area of low pressure will move north from the Texas 
coast Sunday night into Monday.  Upper level lift will begin to 
increase with the approaching upper level disturbance with height 
falls, and an increase in vorticity advection.  This will lead to an 
increase in precipitation chances through Monday, with thunder also 
possible with elevated instability above 850mb. Highs on Monday will 
be a few degrees cooler given the degree of sky cover and 
precipitation, but still in the low to mid 70's.  

The upper level trough will begin to move over the region Monday 
night into Tuesday.  At the surface, an area of low pressure will 
move through the MRX area with increased convergence near this low. 
As a result of increased convergence, likely chances of 
precipitation are expected with thunder also likely.  Temperatures 
will again be near to above average through Tuesday with highs in 
the upper 60s to low 70s.   Rain chances will come to an end on 
Tuesday night into Wednesday as the upper level troughs shifts 
southeast.  High pressure at the surface will build into the Great 
Lakes with northerly winds at the surface.  A much drier airmass 
will advect into the area with near to above average temperatures 
expected through the period.

Models show another large upper level trough and deep area of 
surface low pressure developing out of the Rockies Wednesday.  A 
sharp cold front will move through the central and southern plains 
Wednesday night into Thursday.  The area will remain dry through 
this time, with an increase in temperatures and moisture.

410 AM EDT Thu Apr 4 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Friday)...

Temperatures have been much milder overnight compared to 24 hours 
ago thanks to WAA and some high level cirrus. Soundings show 
southerly surface to 850 mb winds increasing the rest of the night 
into this morning as the WAA further strengthens ahead of a 
shortwave trough approaching from the west. This will allow most 
areas to stay in the 40's through dawn. Slightly tweaked hourly 
temps and lows for the rest of the night. 

Much warmer air surging into the region ahead of the above mentioned 
shortwave will yield a very warm day. Mostly sunny skies this 
morning through early afternoon combined with strong WAA will boost 
highs into the low/mid 70's across the entire valley and southwest 
NC with upper 60's to near 70 in southwest VA. Went with the warmer 
MET guidance for highs since the WAA and strengthening April sun 
angle should allow the warmer temps to occur. Clouds will increase 
from west to east by mid afternoon. Isentropic lift will cause 
showers to first develop out towards the plateau around 21Z with the 
coverage increasing through the evening. Hi-Res models and projected 
soundings show nearly non-existent CAPE this afternoon or evening, 
so kept the wording as rain showers, and did not mention any 
thunder. Have chance to slight chance pops around the plateau at 21Z 
with chance to likely on the plateau by 00Z and chance to slight 
chance further east at that time.

The shortwave and associated low pressure system will pass just 
north of the region tonight dragging a weak cold front through in 
the 06-12Z time frame. Have likely to categorical pops expanding 
across the entire region through the night then tapering to chance 
in western areas after 11Z. A couple hundred joules of elevated CAPE 
will develop at CHA tonight, so added a slight chance of thunder for 
the southern valley and southern plateau. The rest of the region 
will remain rain showers. Cloud cover and continued warm airmass in 
place will allow for a mild night tonight with many places remaining 
in the 50's. Again used the warmer MET numbers for tonight's lows.

As this system moves east Friday, showers will slowly exit from west 
to east. Have likely pops continuing in far northeast TN and 
southwest VA through 17Z and chance elsewhere. An inverted trough at 
the surface hanging back west into the region could maintain a few 
showers through the afternoon, so kept chance to slight chance pops. 
This system does not draw in much of an airmass change, so sided 
with warmer MAV guidance bringing highs into the low 70's in many 
areas.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...

As the minor shortwave begins to move out of the CWA at the start of 
the long range outlook, the region looks to be introduced to a more 
zonal pattern for Friday night with a developing trough over the 
Rockies. This developing system will move eastward quickly and begin 
to influence eastern Tennessee by early Sunday morning. A mid level 
ridge over our area for Friday night and Saturday will help to 
suppress any possible precipitation as soundings show a decent 
capping inversion. A small potential for thunderstorms late 
afternoon on Saturday should the inversion break, even with very 
modest CAPE values.

South westerly surface flow through the weekend will aid in keeping 
temperatures warm and are predicted to be several degrees above the 
seasonal averages for the weekend, further aiding in afternoon 
convection. This warm air advection, along with increased moisture 
surging up from the south will begin to produce widespread rain 
showers ahead of the incoming front on Saturday night.

RAP soundings are showing a fair amount of potential instability for 
Sunday afternoon, although weak 0-6km shear values. This indicates 
that we should mostly see multi-cells of pulse convection with non-
rotating updrafts. That said, CAPE values are high enough, 
particularly in the more southern areas of the CWA, that severe 
storms can't be entirely ruled out at this point.

The period of potential thunderstorms also looks to extend beyond 
the weekend. As the GFS and Euro models are becoming more in 
agreement, they show an area of developing low pressure over the 
Great Plains. This area of cyclogenesis will form a weak semi-
baroclinic low pressure center that will slowly track eastward. The 
slow movement of the deepening low will lead to an extended period 
of showers and thunderstorms for the first few days of next week.

that moves into the Southern Appalachian at the end of the
forecast period. As the surface pressure gradient strengthens
ahead of the system, the southerly flow will bump up to around
12-15 knots from mid day into the afternoon hours.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Surface high pressure across the Carolinas and Georgia today will be 
shifting offshore through tonight, and provide a warm southerly low 
level flow tomorrow that will boost high temperatures into the 70s. 
Cirrus clouds will increase tonight as a weak shortwave ridge passes 
over the area. Midlevel height falls and increasing divergence aloft 
ahead of an approaching trough/jet streak will bring additional 
broken to overcast cloud cover and a chance of showers late 
tomorrow. The low level air mass remains fairly dry until tomorrow 
night, so coverage of showers in the 20-00Z time frame should be 
mainly isolated to scattered with light QPF amounts. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
Multiple chances of showers and thunderstorms along with continued 
warmer temperatures are expected through the long term period. 
Thursday night, an upper level shortwave will approach the Tennessee 
valley with a south to southwest flow aloft. The reflection at the 
surface will be an area of weak low pressure shifting northeast into 
the Great Lakes region by Friday morning. Southerly low to mid level 
flow will transport moisture northward during this time allowing for 
showers and thunderstorms Thursday night into Friday morning. 
Gradual weakening of this shortwave and increasing heights in its 
wake should lead to an overall decrease in coverage of showers 
during the day on Friday. Winds may become gusty across the mountain 
zones Friday morning as low level flow becomes more south oriented. 
While we are not looking at a mountain wave event, a 30-40 knot low 
level jet with at least a moderately strong pressure gradient 
induced across the mountains supports the mention of stronger winds. 
Temperatures Friday will continue to be warm as warm air advection 
dominates with daytime highs in the upper 60s to low 70s. 

Zonal flow then becomes dominate by Friday night ahead of a 
developing system to the west.  Lows Friday night should continue to 
be mild with low to mid 50's expected area wide.  Low to mid level 
winds begin to back to the southwest considerably over the weekend 
ahead of a deepening shortwave trough across the southern plains. 
Moisture will stream northward along with an increase in warm air 
advection.  Weak to moderate isentropic ascent along the 300K 
surface supports slight chance to chances PoPs of showers during the 
day on Saturday, however widespread precipitation is not expected on 
Saturday.  Temperatures are forecast to rise into the low to upper 
70's across most locations.  The surface fields becomes somewhat 
complex Saturday into Sunday.  Lee cyclogenesis supports an area of 
low pressure to develop across the central plains Saturday before 
two surface lows branch off.  This is supported by both the GFS and 
ECMWF and to a lesser extend the Canadian.  The northern low will 
likely eject north rather quickly associated with a quick moving 
shortwave.  An area of low pressure across the southern plains 
likely supported by the deeper shortwave across the southern plains 
will become the dominate circulation for influence on our sensible 
weather over the end of the weekend and into next week.  

A weak baroclinic zone will extend from the Great Lakes southward 
into the southern plains on Sunday.  A weak warm front lifting north 
Sunday morning will likely support precipitation along this 
boundary.  Point forecast soundings indicate several hundred joules 
of CAPE using a most unstable parcel trace.  This elevated 
instability would indicate chances of thunderstorms to accompany 
this lifting boundary as well.  Once the front lifts, the area will 
become embedded into the warm sector airmass.  After a lull in the 
afternoon, precipitation will move back into the area Sunday 
afternoon and evening.  A lot of questions still remain in regards 
to instability and overall shear, but models have been persistent in 
showing increased instability parameters. While shear looks to 
remain on the weak side, the co-location of instability, and weak 
shear would support chances of multi-cellular convection as well. 
Will carry chance to likely PoPs Sunday afternoon through Sunday 
evening. Temperatures Sunday and Sunday night will continue to be 
above normal values.  

The long range becomes less uncertain in how it handles low level 
features, and the precipitation field.  Chance PoPs will need to be 
carried during this period for now.  Again, near to above normal 
temperatures are expected during this period.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

High pressure at the surface and aloft will continue establishing
itself over the region the rest of the night. Skies have become 
mainly clear under the subsidence, and with the light winds and 
cool airmass already in place, this has allowed temps to fall into
the low/mid 30's in many areas, colder than what previous 
guidance had. Lowered temps the remainder of the night to account 
for the colder trend. Patchy frost will continue through about 13Z
from the central valley through southwest VA. Fairly large dew 
point depressions at several sites have limited the coverage of 
the frost compared to what it could be with such cold temps.

Temps will quickly rebound today. Mid to upper level heights will 
rise today and tonight as the surface high slowly shifts eastward in 
response to a trough developing in the Plains. This will gradually 
turn the flow more southerly and allow WAA to begin setting the 
stage for a warmer day and milder night tonight. Look for widespread 
60's across the region this afternoon with a chance at 70 in the 
southern valley under mostly sunny skies. Overnight lows will stay 
in the low/mid 40's in most areas. High level cirrus will develop 
across the region tonight as the shortwave trough approaches AR and 
west TN and the ridge strengthens over the Mid Atlantic causing WAA 
to increase, but no precip is expected as low to mid level soundings 
remain dry and forcing remains too far west. Leaned toward the MAV 
guidance for temps through the period since it is warmer and believe 
that warmer temps will be achieved in this pattern.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...

The long term period looks to be punctuated by an increase in 
temperatures and more spring like showers and storms from a few 
frontal boundary's that look to impact eastern Tennessee over the 
next week. Winds will be predominantly out of the south, leading to 
increased moisture and warming temperatures. A low pressure system 
out in the mid Great Plains will track eastward as the high pressure 
ridge moves off shore by Thursday evening. While a few initial light 
showers are possible ahead of the front, the bulk of the rain is 
expected Thursday night from this first weather event. Current NAM 
model soundings show very little CAPE for Friday so no thunderstorms 
are expected from this system. Overnight surface winds on Thursday 
look to be predominantly from the southeast as the front moves in, 
leading to downsloping winds with gusts of up to 25 mph for the 
eastern mountains and foothills.

Conditions look to be drier on Friday night into Saturday with a few 
possible lingering showers. Mostly zonal flow over Friday night will 
lead to some slight ridging over the area as another mid level 
trough out in the Great Plains starts to dig over the Texas 
panhandle. The ridge, adding to the persistent southerly surface 
winds, will lead to increasing temperatures over the weekend that 
are expected to reach several degrees above the seasonal averages 
for the weekend. Confidence is still rather low on the timing of the 
weekend frontal boundary and intensity of the associated storms. 
Higher confidence on the chances of afternoon thunderstorms for both 
Saturday and Sunday however. While most storms for Sunday are 
expected to remain below severe criteria, the possibility of a few 
severe storms can't be ruled out. Models are even further from 
agreement for early next week after the weekend front moves out. The 
GFS shows the low pressure center driving the front moves to the 
south and become baroclinic, while the Euro keeps the center to the 
north while the trough digs slightly to the south. While this 
particular event is still very far out, multiple rounds of showers 
and thunderstorms are expected for early next week.

.DISCUSSION...The current forecast is generally on track for a
quiet overnight period. However, there will be some adjustments
necessary with the high based sc layer dissipating quickly after
sunset, along with increasing dry advection. Will also complete 
some minor temperature and dewpoint modifications in the short 
term. The low temperature forecast is still on track for cooling 
into the 30s most of the area so will keep this concept in place. 
There could be enough decoupling with some decent radiation for 
the formation of some frost across Southwest Virginia and 
Northeast Tennessee.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...Heights will rise behind 
the exiting mid/upper level trough. Surface high pressure will 
build in and then the center will slide off to our east and 
southeast. Clouds will exit tonight leaving a mainly clear sky, 
then we will see an increase in high clouds on Wednesday. With the
mainly clear sky tonight and light winds, expect some patchy 
frost to develop mainly in the northern valley and possibly some 
outlying areas further south. Right now it does not look 
widespread enough for any Frost Advisory. Temperatures on 
Wednesday will climb to around normal for this time of year.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...The main story 
in the long term period will be the increasing temperatures and 
increase in chances of showers and thunderstorms. Quasi-zonal flow
Wednesday night will begin to back toward the southwest ahead of 
an upper level disturbance moving out of the central plains. At 
the surface, an area of low pressure will move across Oklahoma 
during the day Thursday with high pressure shifting east across 
the western Atlantic. This will result in an increase in the 
surface pressure gradient with an increasing southeast to south 
surface flow. The result will be increasing temperatures during 
the day Thursday with highs likely reaching the upper 60's to low 
70's across the area. The increased flow will also act to 
transport moisture into the region Thursday into Thursday night. 
As a result, an increase in showers from west to east seems 
likely. Some elevated instability will likely exist for 
thunderstorms so did include this into the forecast. Lows Thursday
night should be mild with low to mid 50's common. 

Friday, the surface wave begins to break down and lift northward 
along the front draped across the Mississippi river valley.  Upper 
level heights begin to build behind the exiting trough with a mainly 
dry forecast for Friday night through Saturday with only light 
precipitation being possible across the higher terrain. Temperatures 
will continue to remain near to slightly above average.    

The weekend period remains low confidence as models show several 
different scenarios.  While low confidence exists on timing and 
location of features, there remains at least moderate confidence 
that a storm system will approach from the west with increasing 
southerly flow, and an increase in showers and thunderstorms 
expected.  Temperatures during this period will likely be near to 
above average given the strength of low level warm air advection. 
Attention then turns toward the late weekend period and in the first 
few days of next week. Confidence increases slightly in regards to 
the upper level pattern showing a cutoff low developing across the 
central plains.  Several rounds of showers and thunderstorms seem 
possible during this period as well.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

An upper level shortwave will continue to rotate across the 
Tennessee Valley the rest of the night through early today. Latest 
projected soundings from the NAM12 show mid level moistening 
through early this morning at CHA and TYS, but drier air still 
looks to remain below 850 mb. This should limit the shower 
production to isolated light showers or sprinkles, with the best 
chances confined to the southern and central valley. Recent radar 
returns have not been reaching the ground. Introduced slight 
chance pops through 13Z across the central/southern valley, but 
think all rain chances will be done by mid morning. This short 
wave will bring increased mid level cloudiness through mid 
morning, but skies will become mostly sunny by late morning 
through the afternoon as subsidence develops behind the departing 
disturbance. Low temps early this morning will stay several 
degrees warmer than yesterday morning due to the clouds and weak 
WAA ahead of the short wave. Expect upper 30's/low 40's across the
central/southern valley and southwest NC with mid 30's across 
extreme northeast TN into southwest VA. This could yield some 
patchy frost in the northeast, but not widespread enough for any 
advisories this morning.

Upper level heights will begin to rise this afternoon through 
tonight with surface high pressure building in from the west, but NW 
flow continuing aloft will maintain below normal temps. Look for 
highs to remain cool this afternoon with low/mid 50's across 
southwest VA and northeast TN and upper 50's to near 60 from the 
central valley through southwest NC. The surface high will become 
centered over east TN by late tonight. This will lead to mostly 
clear skies. Good radiational cooling tonight will lead to patchy 
frost in parts of northeast TN and southwest VA. Leaned toward the 
MET guidance for temps today and tonight because it is slightly 
cooler which makes sense in the NW flow pattern.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...

A moderating temperature trend will feature to start the long-term 
forecast period. Upper level heights will be increasing as an upper 
level trough departs to the northeast. In the low levels, the ridge 
will shift out over the Carolina coast. Southerly flow around this 
high will lead to warm air and moisture advection. Sunny skies with 
PW values in the 0.4-0.6 inch range will also aid in temperatures 
rising quickly on Wednesday. Highs on Wednesday will be closer to 
average ranging from the mid 60s to low 70s. Lee cyclogenesis will 
occur on Wednesday into Wednesday night as the next approaching 
upper level trough moves out of the Inter-Mountain West into the 
Rocky Mountains. Warm advection will continue into Wednesday night 
and Thursday morning with lows much warmer than the last few nights 
with most locations in the 40s. Therefore, do not expect any 
frost/freeze issues in the extended portion of the forecast. 

Clouds will increase across the area from west to east on Thursday 
as the surface low and cold front to the west moves across the Great 
Plains. Despite the cloud cover, temperatures will climb into the 
upper 60s to low 70s for most locations with continued warm air 
advection. The upper level trough moves into the Tennessee River 
Valley late Thursday into early Friday. Models indicate two warm 
fronts one to the north stretching E-W across the Ohio River Valley 
and another to the south stretching E-W across the Gulf Coast 
states. This warm front is forecast to stay to the south of the area 
and precipitation chances will be highest across southern portions 
of the forecast area. PW values will increase into the 0.7-1.1 inch 
range Thursday night into Friday. Some elevated instability will be 
possible across southern portions of the area and have included 
thunder in the forecast during this timeframe. The cold front and 
upper level trough will move through the area on Friday with a dry 
forecast Friday afternoon into Saturday morning. The cold air 
advection behind the front is not overly impressive/short-lived and 
do not expect much of a temperature changed behind the departing 
surface boundary. An upper level ridge will build over the region 
late Friday into Saturday and have fairly high confidence that this 
period will be dry. Overnight lows Friday night into Saturday 
morning will be mild and will range from the upper 40s to mid 50s 
for most locations. 

Longer range models begin to diverge a good bit over the upcoming 
weekend into early next week. The long range models all indicate 
that the ridge axis will quickly shift to the east. The ridge should 
be the main influence on Saturday with the forecast area transitions 
quickly back into the warm air advection regime. The GFS indicates a 
decent coverage of warm air advection shower/storms with the 
ECMWF/Canadian keeping conditions rather dry. For now, have only 
gone with a slight chance for a few shower/storms but would expect 
most areas stay dry on Saturday with highs in the 70s for most 
locations. 

Later in the weekend and into early next week, both models indicate 
several southwesterly troughs moving across the area. Each of these 
should bring in the chances for widespread showers and storms. PoPs 
remain elevated in the extended portion of the forecast. The GFS is 
much more progressive with a frontal passage on Monday, while the 
ECMWF closes off a low to the west and is much slower with the 
frontal passage more towards Tuesday/Wednesday.

.DISCUSSION...

No notable changes for the evening update. Satellite imagery shows
a clear slot over the central part of the CWA, situated between 
high clouds over the northern counties and those associated with 
the approaching shortwave that are streaming in from the 
southwest. Previous shift included some patchy frost in the north 
with the thinking that the boundary layer would decouple and clear
skies would allow temperatures to drop fast enough to approach 
the freezing mark by late tonight. This still seems plausible, if
not probable, so have made no changes in that regard. The only 
other forecast item of note would be with regard to PoPs during 
the pre- dawn hours tomorrow morning. Latest guidance suggests 
that rainfall seems very unlikely. Previous shift had some slight
chance Pops over the southern plateau/valley, which seems
reasonable. There is a significant low level dry layer to overcome
so while some spotty light rain does seem a distinct possibility,
it should be rather sparse and not amount to much more than a
hundredth or two.

.AVIATION...

An incoming shortwave will eventually yield OVC050-080 decks at 
all terminals after roughly 06z-10z tonight, becoming BKN after 
16z and eventually scattering out after the 00z TAF period ends. 
Will not include mention of rain at this time, as there is a 
notable amount of dry air to overcome and guidance only indicates 
widely scattered -SHRA for areas south of I-40.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...An approaching mid/upper level 
short wave trough will move across the area later tonight and early 
Tuesday.  Moisture will increase, but lower levels will be slow to 
moisten up and lift is expected to be weak, so while a few patches 
of light precip cannot be ruled out, right now the chance of 
measurable precip looks to be lower than slight chance over most 
of the area. Will just include a slight chance for showers in the 
southwest part of the area for a few hours shortly after midnight.
Temperatures tonight will drop to near freezing across portions 
of the northern valley/SW VA, but with the increasing cloud cover 
do not expect widespread frost so no frost advisory will be issued
for now. However, if cloud cover is delayed there may be a need 
for a frost advisory or even a freeze warning in these areas as it
looks like it will be close. Clouds will decrease Tuesday behind 
the short wave but temperatures will continue to run below 
seasonal normals.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...With the exit of the
short wave earlier in the week, high pressure looks to move back
into the region. While temperatures will remain somewhat low for 
Tuesday night, most areas of the forecast area will see 
significant warming through the day. Overnight lows for Tuesday 
could reach the freezing point in some areas, perticularly for the
higher elevations. Some areas of the valley could see pooling of 
cooler air that will lead to potential formation of patchy fog for
the early morning hours. Winds on Wednesday will gradually shift 
more towards the south by the evening, bringing in more warm moist
air from the south, further aiding the increasing temperatures.

The next low pressure system will begin to influence the area late 
in the week with building clouds and slightly higher winds. Most of 
the higher winds ahead of the incoming cold front are expected for 
the more southwestern counties of eastern Tennessee with some gusts 
reaching up to 15 mph. An extended period of on and off rain showers 
will linger for the end of the week, but most of the rain should 
clear out by late Friday night. Some clearing skies late on Saturday 
but most of the extended period looks to be remain relatively 
cloudy. Due to the extensive cloud cover and predomenantly southerly 
winds, temperatues should remain warm for most of the forecast.

The next major system will move in quickly afterward with a warm 
front surging north into the area Saturday night. This will lead to 
higher temperatures than the seasonal average for early next week. 
Some of the more southern counties could see temperatures up into 
the high 70's or even 80 is possible. The showers and storms 
assosiated with the next cold front will move into the area by 
Sunday morning with the potential for some thunderstorms for most of 
the day. A transition over to mostly rain is expected overnight on 
Sunday through Monday, but can't rule out the possibility of the 
occasional thunderstorm.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Already seeing most locations below freezing early this morning with 
a widespread freeze anticipated before sunrise. At 4 AM, 
temperatures range from the mid 20s to mid 30s under mostly clear
skies. Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis 
indicates a trough across the northeast U.S. with another 
shortwave trough moving out of the Desert Southwest into the 
southern Plains. There is also a shortwave ridge ahead of this 
trough that extends across the Lower and Mid-Mississippi River 
Valley. In the low levels, the surface high is located just to the
north of the forecast area across the Ohio River Valley. Due to 
this, there is still some decent low level cold advection with 
northerly winds currently ranging from around 5-10 mph. Winds 
should continue to subside this morning with the pressure gradient
relaxing give away to more radiational cooling conditions. 
Temperatures this morning will start off in the mid 20s in the low
30s for most locations.

The shortwave ridge will move over the area today with increasing 
heights aloft. Mostly sunny skies are forecast with PW values 
ranging from around 0.2-0.3 inches. These values are around the 10th 
percentile for early April. Therefore, do not expect any 
precipitation today. With the dry atmosphere in place, RH values 
will drop down into the 20-30% range this afternoon. High 
temperatures should be a couple of degrees warmer today with most 
locations in the 50s. The upper level trough to the west will move 
into the Tennessee River Valley later tonight. Model soundings 
indicate an increase of upper level and mid level moisture with this 
system. PW values will climb into the 0.3-0.5 inch range, these 
values are only around the 25th percentile for early April. Models 
indicate that 850mb winds will shift around to the south for a very 
brief period of time ahead of the upper trough. Model soundings 
indicate that the low levels will remain rather dry and have only 
included a slight chance of precipitation tonight across southwest
North Carolina where low-level moisture will be a bit higher. It
could even be cold enough for a few snowflakes to mix in but do
not expect any impacts. Elsewhere, just expect an increase in
cloud cover later tonight. Overnight lows will be colder than
normal again ranging from the low 30s to low 40s. Do not expect
any widespread fog formation tonight with the increasing cloud
cover and large low level dewpoint depressions.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...

We start the period with a shortwave passing through the southern
stream. Though this system still passes to our south, soundings 
show a moist mid and upper level profile across our area as it 
swings through. However, the lower levels are quite dry and 
therefore not confident on precip reaching the ground. Went ahead 
and removed all POPs for Tuesday but wouldn't be shocked if some 
light drizzle made it's way to the surface across some areas. If 
this occurs it will be short-lived as the system quickly pulls off
to our east by Tuesday afternoon. The biggest impact from this 
system will be clouds but clearing is expected by afternoon. Highs
will be in the low to upper 50s. Some patchy frost possible 
across areas north of I-40 on Tuesday night as lows will be in the
mid to upper 30s.

Wednesday through Thursday still features brief ridging building 
back in, which allows for dry and warming conditions. By Thursday 
highs are back into to the upper 60s to low 70s. Thursday night into 
Friday a shortwave and associated area of low pressure will move 
into the area from out the central Great Plains. By the time the 
system moves into our area the wave is much flatter and open. So as 
it stands, this system doesn't look too impressive. At this point 
the main impacts will be rain showers, along with gusty winds across 
the high terrain due to 30 to 40 kts of southerly 850 mb flow. This 
system exits Friday afternoon and clearing begins. This system isn't 
connected with the northern jet so there won't be a push of cold air 
behind it. In fact, riding quickly build back in and highs for the 
weekend are in the mid to upper 70s, which is around 8 to 12 degrees 
above normal. A potentially stronger system moves in Sunday/Sunday 
night and could bring a few storms to the area.

.DISCUSSION...

The current forecast is in great shape tonight with no updates
planned. High pressure settling into the Ohio valley will bring
more tranquil weather conditions to the area tonight. Still 
expect northerly winds around 5 to 10 mph. High level clouds 
continue to pass overhead mainly across southern portions of the 
forecast area. Lows tonight should dip into the middle 20's to 
near freezing, thus the ongoing freeze warning remains in effect 
through 13Z.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

The previous cold front continues to progress eastward as 
cool, dry air associated with higher pressure moves into the region 
behind it. Gusting winds from the north will lessen by tonight as 
the pressure gradient loosens and moves off the east coast, leading 
to more upper level zonal flow by tomorrow morning. The combination 
of northerly winds and cool, dry air will lead to overnight 
temperatures for tonight that will drop below freezing for most of 
the area. A freeze warning will be in effect overnight until Monday 
morning.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...

Although the brunt of the opening system will be well south of us
as advertised, models have a bit more of an open shortwave trough
crossing TN from west to east, and that may be able to tap enough
of the moisture field to the south and squeeze out some light 
rain showers in our area. Don't be surprised if light rain occurs 
especially in the southern areas late Monday night. All models 
except GFS end it there, but GFS places patchy light rain over the
northern areas Tuesday afternoon. We will hold off on that right 
now, but some northern mountain precip will be added to Tues to 
match up a bit with GSP. Even with the passage of this system, 
mild temps will continue.

Next system rolls out of the Rockies Wednesday, with a moistening 
Gulf fetch for us. Temps will return to 70s in the Valley, and the 
system will spread showers into our area beginning Thurs afternoon, 
peaking on Thursday night/Friday morning before moving out to the 
east. 

Then ridging resumes, as yet another system heads into west TX 
Saturday. Temps may be flirting with 80 next weekend for the central 
and southern Valley.

.DISCUSSION...
Quick update to issue a wind advisory for the remainder of this
evening through early morning. Increasing 850mb jet will produce
windy conditions across the Mountains and breezy conditions
elsewhere.

Line of showers and thunderstorms over middle Tennessee will
continue move quickly east northeast. Airmass will be quite a bit
less unstable over our area. Still expect showers and some
thunderstorms with limited instability but strong upper dynamics.
Due to the 50-60kts 850mb jet, main concern will be the potential
of strong to possible damaging winds. Main area of concern is
along and west of interstate 75.

Line of convection will quickly move through by early Sunday
morning with return of dry conditions soon just before/after 
sunrise.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...A strong cold front will swing 
through tonight as a mid/upper level trough moves into our area. 
There will be widespread showers ahead of and near the front, and 
although convective energy will be waning as it moves into our area 
some thunderstorms can be expected as well.  Wind shear will be 
significant, but with the limited convective energy it still appears 
best chance for any strong to severe storms will be western portions 
of the area especially along and near the plateau.  Will mention 
this threat in the HWO.  The precipitation will not linger long, and 
should move out of western portions of the area later tonight and 
eastern portions early Sunday.  Strong cold advection may bring 
temps down quickly enough for the rain showers to end as a few snow 
flakes over the higher mountain peaks, but no significant 
accumulation is expected even over the highest elevations.  Winds 
will be gusty from the southwest ahead of the front, then 
transitioning to the northwest/north behind the front. Clouds will 
decrease Sunday giving way to a sunny/mostly sunny sky.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday Night through Saturday)...Other than the Monday 
morning freeze, a quiet pattern greets us as the extended period 
opens. The formerly-known-as Tuesday event will track too far south 
to impact us with precip, so it has been removed. This means that 
midweek ridging will allow us to reach the 70s in parts of the 
Valley from Wednesday through Saturday. But the southerly winds that 
will prompt that warm-up will also draw up Gulf moisture ahead of 
the next worthwhile shortwave trough that will roll past the MS 
Valley Thursday and bring us showery weather from late Thursday 
through Friday night. There will be no post-frontal cool down, 
however, as the next trough moves into the southern plains Saturday, 
quickly ridging us once again. Precip from this second event will 
probably hold off until next Sunday at least.

Looking ahead, the 6-10 day and 8-14 day outlooks are showing decent 
signals for an expectation of warmer than average temperatures.(Sunday

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate a 
weak shortwave trough currently moving into the Tennessee River 
Valley, another trough near the southern Plains, and a third to the 
north near the western Great Lakes. Model forecast soundings 
indicate that the low levels are still rather dry with PW values in 
the 0.6-0.8 inch range. These values are slightly above the 50th 
percentile for late March. For now, do not expect anything more than 
an increase in mid level clouds with this first trough. A mild night 
is currently ongoing with temperatures early this morning in the 50s 
for most areas. At the surface, high pressure extends along the 
eastern Seaboard and a cold front to the north and west. Low level 
warm air and moisture advection continue across the forecast area 
ahead of the cold front. 

The shortwave trough currently across the southern Plains will 
continue eastward into the Mid-Mississippi River Valley later today. 
The cold front will then begin to make some steady progress to the south 
and east. The pressure gradient will increase between the surface
low to the west and the surface high to the east. Southwesterly 
winds will increase later this morning with some gusts up to 
around 25-35 mph possible at times today. A shortwave ridge will 
actually move over the area late this morning into the early 
afternoon as the first trough passes to the east. This could 
produce some periods of mostly sunny to partly cloudy conditions 
and with strong warm air advection, expect high temperatures will 
climb into the low to mid 70s in most locations. 

The front will race into the area later this evening as the 
positively tilted trough continues eastward. PW values will increase 
into the 1.0-1.2 inch range along the front. Widespread precipitation 
is forecast later this evening into early Sunday with the frontal 
passage. Instability will be waining during the evening hours with 
the loss of daytime heating. Deep layer and low-level shear is 
sufficient for some severe storms associated with the frontal 
passage but the lack on instability will be the main limiting 
factor. Expect there could be a few stronger storms possible across 
extreme southwestern portions of the forecast area (for example 
Marion/Sequatchie counties) where instability will be a bit higher 
later this evening. Rainfall will be heavy at times with the 
frontal passage and storm totals will range from around half an 
inch to an inch for most locations.

Noticeably colder air will advect in behind the departing system late 
Saturday night into Sunday morning. In fact, a few snow showers will 
be possible in the higher elevations of the Smoky Mountains early
Sunday morning before the moisture exits but do not anticipate any
accumulations at this time. Lows Sunday morning will be in the mid
30s to low 40s. Strong dry air and cold air advection will lead to
PW values dropping down into the 0.1-0.2 inch range on Sunday.
Despite the mostly sunny skies on Sunday, high temperatures will
only rise into the 50s with the strong cold advection. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...

Main focus of the period is the below freezing temperatures that 
are expected across the forecast area Sunday night into Monday 
morning. Sub-freezing temps are due to the northerly cold air 
advection coming in behind the departed cold front. Lows will 
range from the mid 20s to near freezing for most places, which is 
10 to 12 degrees below normal. A freeze watch will likely be 
needed with the next forecast issuance.

Under the influence of high pressure and northerly flow, expect 
plenty of sunshine and below normal temperatures on Monday. Highs 
will be in the low to mid 50s, around 8 to 10 degrees below normal. 
As high pressure migrates to our east the flow becomes southerly by 
Monday night. This will allow temperatures to not be as cold as 
Sunday night. Lows on Monday night will be in the lower to upper 
30s. 

On Tuesday a shortwave trough and associated area of low pressure 
will pass to our south. Model have been trending further south with 
the low track so it looks like our forecast area will see minimal 
impacts. Currently, only have POPs in for the extreme eastern areas, 
right along the foothills and eastern mountains. Clouds and POPs 
decrease by Tuesday afternoon as the low races off the coast of the 
Carolinas. Wednesday through Thursday feature high pressure building 
back into the area with warming temperatures due to southerly flow 
and rising heights. By Thursday afternoon a shortwave trough is 
moving through the central Plains and will bring us our next chance 
of precip from Thursday night through Friday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
Remnant outflow boundaries and showers from storms last night 
across Middle Tennessee are still lingering around the area this 
afternoon. Reflectivities on radar are very weak and with the dry 
air near the surface most likely these showers won't be able to 
produce precipitation at the surface. But these boundaries look 
to have increased the gradient across parts of the eastern 
Tennessee Valley. This is causing winds to jump up to around 10 
mph with some weather stations recording gusts up aground 20 mph. 
Direction of the winds is generally westerly to southerly when 
they get breezy, depending on the direction of the boundary 
they're near. Winds should die down as the sun sets this evening. 

Frontal boundary will be pushing into Western Tennessee/Kentucky
tomorrow afternoon. This will cause an increase in the pressure
gradient across the area and winds will increase out of the
southwest in response. Winds look to remain below advisory level,
but it will be a bit of a breezy day on Saturday. Rain may creep
into the eastern Cumberland Plateau Saturday afternoon, but the
bulk of the precipitation will stay out of the eastern Tennessee
Valley until Saturday night.

.Long Term (Saturday Night through Friday)...
Period opens with deep longwave trough over the eastern U.S. 
driving a cold front and accompanying band of showers/isolated 
tstms through the area. Cooler temperatures will be ushered in for
Sunday-Tuesday, with valley highs mostly in the 50s after the 
pleasant 70s tomorrow. 

A shortwave trough will move through TX Monday and begin to spin up 
some cyclogenesis in the northern Gulf. The latest 12Z long range 
models are keeping most of the precip chances with this developing 
system to our south and east, but we will hang on to low pops in our 
southern and eastern areas for now, keeping with surrounding 
offices. By Wednesday, this system will begin racing up the east 
coast offshore while dry ridging resumes over the southern 
Appalachians.

A fast shortwave will move onto the west coast Tuesday and race 
across the Rockies, inducing return flow into the southern Plains on 
wednesday and initiating a late week warm-up for us locally. This 
system will bring us more chances of showers from Thurs night 
through Friday.

Kentucky have maintained their strength a bit longer than previous
high resolution models indicated. Still looks like they will
mostly evaporate as the move onto the Cumberland Plateau and into

of the forecast is still on track with only very minor changes
being made.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Low level high pressure to the southeast is bringing in 
warm air and moisture advection to the forecast area. In 
the upper levels, flow is rather zonal with a jet streak 
to the north across the Great Lakes. At the surface, there 
is a cold front to the north and west across the Great Lakes 
stretching to the southwest into the southern Plains. The 
atmosphere is rather dry currently with PW values in the 
0.4-0.6 inch range. These values are around the 25th-40th 
percentile for late March. Temperatures will start out in 
the 40s across most of the area this morning with a few 
passing mid to high clouds. 

Continued warm air advection with the low level ridge to the 
southeast and cold front to the northwest will push high 
temperatures this afternoon up into the mid 60s to low 70s.
Moisture will also be on the rise today with PW climbing into the
0.7-1.0 inch range. Flow aloft will also be a bit more
southwesterly today as a ridge amplifies near the Carolina Coast.
Models indicate a few weak shortwaves moving across the region
today. The upper level and mid-level flow will remain parallel to
the surface boundary and do not expect much movement today with
the forecast area staying well in the warm sector. Clouds will
increase this afternoon in association with a few weak mid-level
impulses. Have a very small mention of precipitation for portions
of the northern Cumberland Plateau and southwest Virginia but most
areas will remain dry. A mild night is forecast tonight with
continued low level southerly flow and increasing cloud cover.
Lows will range from the low to mid 50s with dry conditions
overnight.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...

Positively tilted longwave trough swinging into the area to start
the period. Most of the day should be dry with clouds slowly 
increasing from west to east. The main focus during the daytime 
hours will be gusty winds. Deep mixing and dry air in the lower 
levels, notated by the inverted v soundings, will allow for gusty 
winds down at the surface. 850mb flow is out of the southwest 
through the day. This pattern may result in some downsloping but 
not the classic setup needed. By late afternoon/early evening 
850mb flow ramps up to 30 to 40 kts and remains out of the 
southwest. Saturday night the cold front associated with the 
trough is bearing down on Western/Middle TN and approaching 
quickly. The arrival time of showers, and a few storms, will be 
somewhere between 7 and 10 PM. Soundings show very little 
instability some not too concerned with storms at the moment. The 
main threats will be gusty winds and some moderate rain here and 
there, half an inch up to three quarters of an inch is possible 
with lesser amounts along the foothills of the eastern mountains.

Showers exit quickly Sunday morning as the front exits to our east, 
then clearing conditions ensue. Northwesterly flow behind the front 
will bring colder air with highs on reaching the upper 40s to mid 
50s, which is 10 to 12 degrees below normal. Clearing may be slow 
for areas east of I-75 as northwest flow pools moisture up against 
the foothills. Clouds finally clear and Sunday night will be the 
coldest of the period with lows in the upper 20s to lower 30s, which 
is 8 to 10 degrees below normal. A freeze watch will eventually be 
needed for much of the area, as we get a little closer to the event. 

Monday is clear but on the cool side as we remain under northerly 
flow due to high pressure to our west. Monday night into Tuesday a 
system passes to our south but could bring some clouds and light 
rain into the area, depending on the track of the low. Conditions 
clear quickly though as this feature will be off the coast of the 
Carolinas by Tuesday afternoon/evening. High pressure sets up behind 
this system and keeps us under northerly flow for Wednesday but with 
warmer temps as  heights begin to rise. Highs close to normal by 
Wednesday. High pressure moves to our east by thursday returning us 
to southerly flow and increasing moisture with increasing chances of 
rain late in the day as a shortwave approaches from the west.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...

Tranquil weather is on tap for short term period as the region 
lies beneath zonal upper level flow and remains entrenched in a 
warm southwesterly surface flow regime. The beginnings of change 
will encroach on the area late tomorrow however as a shortwave
trough moves east along the TN/KY border during the day. A surface
cold front currently residing from southeast Colorado, northeast
to Wisconsin, should make some southward movement over the next 24
hours as upper troughing continues to shift east away from the
coast of Carolinas and surface high pressure from the southern
Appalachians up the mid-Atlantic seaboard weakens. However, with
lack of strong northerly flow aloft, it is doubtful the front will
make much headway to the south, likely still residing in the Ohio
River Valley by tomorrow evening. Thus, favored a continued dry
forecast for much of the area, with only a slight chance of rain
mentioned in the northern plateau counties for later tomorrow
afternoon. The more notable change comes in the long term period,
as noted below.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
 
Warmer temperatures will continue on Friday/Saturday as mid level 
ridging combines with southerly flow near the surface to bring 
temperatures about 5-10 degrees above normal for this time of year. 
First and best chance of precipitation for this 7-day forecast 
begins on Friday night into Saturday morning as a mid level trough 
over the Great Lakes Region and the associated front begin to move 
across the eastern half of the United States. Surface low along the 
front will slide across the Northern Ohio River Valley Saturday. The 
southerly winds at the surface and orientation of the front will 
keep rain chances confined to the Cumberland Plateau and westward 
Friday into Saturday morning. Front gets an eastward push Saturday 
night into Sunday...There looks to be enough dynamics with this 
system to warrant the mention of thunderstorm chances, with the 
highest chances being along the Cumberland Plateau and western 
Tennessee Valley Saturday night, but the low instability parameters 
suggest that most places will see just rain showers. 

Front will have pushed through the area by Sunday night and 
temperatures will drop about 20 degrees in response. Coldest night 
of the week will be Sunday night as lows drop into the 30's across 
the area and below freezing along the Cumberland Plateau into SW 
Virginia. 

Quiet weather is expected until Tuesday when a shortwave zips across 
the Southeastern United States. models have begun to trend a bit 
further north with this system bringing in more moisture and QPF 
into the Eastern Tennessee Valley the first half of next week. Have 
slightly increased precipitation chances Monday night into Tuesday, 
but confidence is still somewhat low at this time as model run-to-
run consistency isn't quite there yet with this shortwave.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Another quiet short term
period ahead. High pressure to our south will control our weather
through the period. Minor height rises and slightly stronger 
southwesterly 850 mb flow will help to warm surface temps even 
more compared to yesterday. Most areas will be in the mid 60s to 
near 70 by this afternoon, which is actually 3 to 5 degrees above 
normal. Later this afternoon additional high clouds approach from 
the northwest but the majority of the day will feature a good 
amount of sun. 

Our area of high pressure shifts a little further to the southeast 
overnight as a wave of energy moves into the Rockies and central 
Great Plains. High shifting eastward allows additional mid/high 
clouds to move in from the northwest. The southwesterly flow and 
high clouds will allow for overnight temps to be quite mild. Temps 
will only dip down into the low to mid 40s, which is around 3 to 5 
degrees above normal. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...Friday will feature mild 
temperatures as high pressure over the Southeast shifts to the 
western Atlantic and a deep SW flow ensues. A midlevel shortwave 
trough will bring increasing high and midlevel clouds through the 
day, but dry air below will prevent any chance of precip. Highs 
will reach the upper 60s to lower 70s. 

Rain chances start to increase Saturday as we will be positioned in 
the warm sector of a developing low pressure system over the Great 
Lakes and OH Valley region. A few isolated showers may be possible 
Friday night/Saturday, but Saturday night will be the period of the 
best forcing associated with frontogenetic forcing and the upper jet 
streak. Although forcing is good, instability continues to look very 
weak, and will continue to forecast just a slight chance of 
thunderstorms, limited to the Plateau and Southern Valley areas. 
Models have some slight timing differences but the front should be 
east of our area by 12Z Sunday morning, with cold advection keeping 
daytime highs only in the 50s.

Models continue to show a southern stream shortwave trough crossing 
the region on Monday night/Tuesday, but details on the northward 
extent of precip continue to be uncertain. There is still 
considerable spread in the GEFS members regarding precip amounts and 
timing of any rain chances. With high uncertainty, will maintain 
the stays quo for this period, and continue the mention of slight
chance PoPs that favor the southern half.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...

The short term period will feature an upper trough exiting the
southeast coast later this evening, as well as a trough over the 
Pacific Northwest, and a broad, large trough over the eastern half
of Canada. In between these features will be zonal upper flow 
from the lower Mississippi River eastward towards the southern 
Appalachian region. 

At the surface, high pressure will begin to weaken over the region
as the parent high shifts off the New England coast over the next
24 hours. Southerly flow will resume across the forecast area, but
only in weak fashion. With zonal flow aloft, southerly flow at the
surface, and an overall lack of clouds, tomorrow should be a few
degrees warmer. A weak mid level disturbance will move across 
Kentucky during the day tomorrow which will likely result in some 
increase in high clouds, but that should be about it so a dry 
forecast is expected.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...

For Thursday night through Friday night, generally zonal flow over 
the southern half of the nation and surface ridging from the 
Carolinas into the southeast United States will produce mostly dry 
conditions and unseasonably warm conditions over the area.

For Saturday, an upper trough will swing east southeast from the 
Plains states toward the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys. This wave will 
increase the dynamics along a frontal boundary over the Ohio and 
Tennessee Valleys. Increasing coverage and intensity of showers and 
thunderstorms will develop over the lower and middle Mississippi 
Valley. This system will increase the southwesterly flow over the 
area with breezy/windy conditions and mainly dry conditions.

For Saturday night into the Sunday, a frontal boundary will sweep 
across the area. The best jet dynamics with this system will move 
north of the southern Appalachians, but plenty of fronto-genetic 
forcing to produce widespread showers. Instability looks limited 
since deep Gulf moisture fails to move northward. Thus only embedded 
thunder anticipated.

For Sunday night and Monday, surface and upper riding with dry and 
cooler conditions.

For Tuesday, another upper trough will move across the Tennessee 
Valley into the southern Appalachians. Models show a good deal of 
differences on the affects from this wave. The best cyclogenesis 
occurs well south of the area limiting precipitation in the southern 
Appalachians.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Not a whole lot going on
during the short term period and it's setting up to be quite 
nice. We will be dealing with some lingering low clouds early this
morning across portions of the central and southern valley but 
these should erode quickly, giving way to mostly sunny skies. 
These low clouds were from the showers and storms that developed 
across NC yesterday evening. The clouds then advected westward 
into our area under weak easterly flow in the lower levels.

Ridging builds in from the southwest through the day and heights 
rise, allowing temperatures to warm up into the upper 50s and low 
60s which is near normal. Calm and pleasant conditions expected 
tonight with clear skies and warmer low temperatures with lows in 
the upper 30s to near 40 which are also near normal.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...Little change was
needed to the forecast during this period. Thursday and Friday 
will be really nice early spring days, with plenty of sunshine and
temperatures warming into the upper 60s Thursday and lower 70s 
Friday. A strong mid/upper level ridge to our south will keep weak
disturbances in the flow to our north both days.

The ridge will give way to an approaching trough on Friday night and 
Saturday. Clouds will increase Friday night with a chance of rain 
arriving in the warm advection pattern in the warm sector on 
Saturday. Lift associated with the cold front will bring likely to 
categorical PoPs on Saturday evening. The best lift remains to our 
north, as has been the trend for the past few model runs, so the 
highest PoPs will be in our northern sections. Instability continues 
to look weak - enough for a slight chance of thunder to be 
mentioned, but not enough for a severe threat. Fropa late Saturday 
night will bring a sharp drop in temperatures, with highs on Sunday 
only in the 50s. 

Models are showing a split flow pattern for Monday and Tuesday, with 
a southern stream negatively-tilted shortwave trough crossing the 
Southeast states. But they differ in the northward surge of moisture 
and lift. The ECMWF keeps moisture and lift well to our south, with 
the GFS being a little farther north. The GEFS members appear split 
50/50 about producing any rain in our area. With this uncertainty, 
will maintain the status quo of a dry forecast.

.DISCUSSION...

Radar imagery indicates a couple of isolated showers across
portions of SW NC. There is an inverted trough that extends from
Florida northwards into the southern Appalchians. This inverted
trough is leading to increased low-level convergence across SW NC
and expect a few isolated to scattered showers will continue over
the next couple of hours. Elsewhere, skies are mostly clear with 
PW values currently down in the 0.2-0.4 inch range. Model 
soundings indicate that the low-levels will remain dry with winds 
just above the surface in the 10-15 mph range. Due to this, do not
expect any fog or frost overnight. Lows will drop down into the 
30s for most areas with a freeze expected for northeast Tennessee 
and southwest Virginia.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...
A rather quiet afternoon underway across the TN Valley and Southern 
Appalachians as the upper pattern is highlighted by a dry closed H5 
low moving southeast across southern/middle TN and northern MS/AL. 
At the surface, a region of high pressure slowly slides east across 
the northern OH Valley and Great Lakes, funneling dry/cool nly flow 
into the east TN and southwest VA/NC.  With that, a weak llv 
inversion has worked to lock moisture in across the region favoring 
prolonged (but eroding) low stratus, generally bisecting the 
forecast area from southwest/northeast.  Pattern evolution through 
the remainder of the day/evening will feature continued erosion of 
the llv inversion and thus llv stratus, all while the aforementioned 
H5 wave slides further southeast across northern AL/GA, clipping 
southeast TN and southwest NC.  Guidance favors the possibility of 
some weak convection across these areas as lapse rates steepen and a 
region of upper divergence associated with the left exit region of 
an H3 jetmax traverses the area.  This should be short lived, and 
confined to extreme southeast TN and southwest NC, thus pops are 
allowed to slowly ramp to chance levels, dropping off to non 
mentionable shortly after midnight.  That said, am expecting 
residual low stratus to prevail atop much of the area along/south of 
I40, thus overnight lows will be warmest there, generally right at 
normal while a few degrees below normal northward.  As for 
Wednesday, the above noted H5 low will have slid southward across 
north FL making way for rising heights aloft thanks to a building 
ridge axis to the west.  At the surface cool/dry high pressure will 
dominate, albeit amidst slowly developing return flow.  All in all, 
expect mostly sunny skies and temperatures a few degrees warmer than 
than today.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
Dry weather will continue across the forecast area Wednesday night 
through the day Thursday as the region lies beneath upper ridging 
with surface high pressure to our east. Changes arrive Friday into 
Saturday though. 

Shortwave energy dropping south from Canada into the northern plains 
will likely phase with energy ejecting out of the central Rockies on 
Friday, forming a deep trough across the eastern CONUS by Saturday 
and driving a strong cold front through the forecast area late 
Saturday and Saturday night. Strengthening southwest flow may result 
in some light showers over the higher terrain of the plateau and 
southern TN mountains on Friday, but suspect that this will be dry 
so I continued with a dry forecast. Rainfall chances increase 
significantly on Saturday as the front approaches. Also left in some 
mention of thunder during the afternoon and evening hours Saturday.

Behind the front we will get a nice push of continental air, with 
high pressure diving south through the plains. After highs in the 
upper 60s to lower 70s on Saturday, temps will drop nearly 20 
degrees on Sunday with highs reaching only into the 50s. Expect to 
see lows in the 30s Sunday night. Temperatures will moderate some 
into early next week, but will still be notably cooler than
normal.

VFR/MVFR conditions expected during this taf cycle. Llv moisture
trapped beneath a weak inversion continues to promote low stratus
affecting all sites. This is expected to erode with time this
afternoon, thus all terminals will experience rises from MVFR to
VFR. Later tonight another shortwave will move across the region
favoring additional llv cloud development. This round is expected
to produce only low VFR cigs, which will lift by late morning
Wednesday. Winds will remain light/moderate and nly through

.DISCUSSION...
A weak H5 shortwave continues to approach the region from the
Midsouth this morning, while surface ridging builds across the 
OH/TN valleys. Modest llv moisture left in the wake of last nights
shortwave/frontal passage remains trapped beneath a weak llv 
inversion. Fortunately, developing nly flow will work to advect 
said moisture southward out of the Valley through the day while
the weak inversion slowly erodes as well, thus still expecting 
skies to sct out for the most part. The only caveat likely being 
across portions of the southeast TN and southwest NC mtns where 
the aforementioned Midsouth shortwave is progged to promote 
iso/sct showers this afternoon. As for the fcst, tweaked sky/pop 
and temps to align with recent ob/sat trends as well as latest 
near term guidance. No other sig changes needed/made at this time.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...We start the period with a 
shortwave off to our southeast with drier air trying to move in 
from the north. Low level moisture will linger across the areas 
though. This is a common occurrence when the flow is out of the 
north as moisture pools up along the foothills and is slow to 
exit. Due to upslope flow, weak orographic lift will help to 
squeeze out a few very light showers across the eastern mountains 
through late morning. We then lose the upslope component as the 
winds turn more northerly, which should end any lingering showers 
by early afternoon. Previous forecast also mentioned some light 
snow early this morning but it doesn't appear that the moisture 
will make it up into the dendritic growth zone according to latest
soundings. NAM soundings only show moisture up to around 
-1 degree celsius. Therefore, removed any mention of snow from 
grids and replaced with light, liquid, showers.

With the drier air moving in, clouds will slowly thin from northwest 
to southeast but the foothills and mountains may remain cloudy 
through most of the day. This afternoon another shortwave dives in 
from the northwest and passes to our south. It will pass far enough 
south that most areas won't be affected. However, southwest NC 
and Polk County will see chance and slight chance POPs through 
the afternoon along with increased cloud cover. 

So overall, a dry day in store for most with winds out of the north 
with slowly clearing conditions. Highs will be in the lower to upper 
50s, which is 5 to 7 degrees below normal.

Tonight, clouds continue to clear as we become further removed from 
the system to our southeast. Light northerly flow continues and lows 
will be in the lower to upper 30s, which is near normal to a few 
degrees below normal.



.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...The rest of the week will 
feature high pressure across the Southeast region that will 
provide dry conditions and mild temperatures. Sunny to mostly 
sunny skies can be expected Wednesday through Friday, with a 
warming trend as the high moves east, culminating with highs in 
the lower 70s for most of the TN Valley on Saturday.

Clouds will be increasing Saturday with a strengthening southerly 
flow ahead of an approaching cold front, which will move through on 
Saturday night. The best forcing with the front and upper trough 
will be to our north, and the overnight timing will limit 
instability. Still, with good model agreement on timing and a well 
amplified upper trough, likely PoPs with a slight chance of t'storms 
will continue to be mentioned. A much colder air mass will build in 
behind the front on Sunday, with highs only in the 50s. 

Confidence is low for Day 7 and beyond as the models diverge in 
their solutions. The GFS shows a split flow with a southern stream 
trough bringing quite a bit of rainfall on Monday and Tuesday, but 
many GEFS members and the ECMWF remain dry. For now, will maintain 
the dry forecast for Monday until models show better agreement.

moving out of that area, so adjusted the back edge timing of 
chance/slight chance slightly faster. Inputed current temps and
dew points in order to improve the hourly curve through 06Z, but
low temps look to be on track with low/mid 40's across the valley
and a few upper 30's in southwest VA and on the plateau. Patchy
dense fog will affect northeast TN and southwest VA at times this
evening through the overnight. Winds increasing after 05Z combined
with drier air in the CAA may help to decrease the areal extent 
of the fog later tonight.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
The upper pattern this afternoon is highlighted by an approaching H5 
shortwave embedded within the large longwave placed atop the 
central/eastern CONUS, while a 90-100kt H3 jet rounds the base of 
said trough.  At the surface, a cold front tied to an OH Valley 
surface low is slowly advecting east into the Cumberland Plateau 
this afternoon, with weak/modest convection initiating due to surface 
frontal convergence, as well as the aforementioned upper vort and 
the left exit region of the H3 jetmax enhancing divergence aloft. 
That said, surface obs are indicative of only weak instability as 
the warm front is just now moving into the lower valley/plateau as 
dewpoints remain in the low/mid 50s at best.  Profiles exhibit 
unidirectional flow with little if any speed/directional shearing, 
as well as fairly low fz levels of approx 8-9kft.  Thus, favorable 
multicell convection within a broken line has initiated across the 
lower plateau, and will continue to advect east with time this 
afternoon. Some further destabilization is possible as the Nam 
favors mucapes around 800-900j/kg, which may me a bit of a stretch. 
All said, pops will remain in likely/cat levels through the 
remainder of the day with a few strong storms closer to the US64 
corridor possible.  With any stronger convection, think the primary 
threat would be small hail, brief heavy rainfall, and cloud to 
ground lightning. Otherwise, expecting light/moderate showers with 
perhaps a few rumbles of thunder along/north of I40.

Moving on, the front will sweep through the remainder of the fcst 
area tonight, with some residual moisture banked against the 
Southern Appalachians amidst the developing nwly flow.  With that, 
expecting prolonged light shra along the spine of the mtns, perhaps 
with some changeover to snow at the highest elevations above 4500ft 
or so given caa, no accumulations expected.  As for tomorrow, should 
be a fairly quiet day as cold advective nly/nwly flow prevails. Did 
leave some low confidence pops in for the southern mtns given 
proximity to the slowly departing H5 wave.  Otherwise, expect mostly 
sunny (northward) to partly cloudy (southward) skies and 
temperatures a few degrees below normal.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...
A quite longterm period with ridging expected to dominate through 
the week before a storm system moves through during the weekend with 
increasing chances of showers and possibly thunderstorms.  A exiting 
shortwave Tuesday night will bring northwest flow aloft through. 
Wednesday. The surface fields show high pressure moving off the 
Great Lakes into the northeast with northerly flow.  This flow will 
usher in much drier air with lower dewpoints.  Wednesdays highs 
should top out in the upper 50's to mid 60's, with lows in the 30's 
to near 40. 

Upper level ridging will dominate toward the late week with much 
drier and warmer weather conditions.  A trough will move onshore the 
Pacific northwest and into the intermountain west with lee 
cyclogenesis developing Thursday.  This lower pressure to the west, 
and high pressure off the New England coast will create a south and 
east flow advecting a warmer and moist airmass.  Highs Thursday and 
Friday will be warmer with highs in the 60's to near 70.  Overnight 
lows Thursday night and Friday night are forecast to be in the 
middle 40's to low 50's.

Upper level pattern becomes less uncertain toward the weekend, but 
confidence is becoming higher that the trough to the west will move 
into the central and northern plains with lowering heights across 
the region.  At the surface, an area of low pressure and associated 
cold front will move east Saturday into Sunday, however confidence 
on timing is still rather low.  Sunday, confidence drops off further 
as models differ on how they handle the trough across the Ohio and 
Tennessee valley, but for now will carry mostly slight chance to 
chance PoPs. Temperatures during this period will likely be near 
normal.

.DISCUSSION...
A cold front continues to slide east across west/middle TN this
morning, while prefrontal shra induced by modest jet coupling and
thus upper divergence slides east across the Great Valley and
Southern Appalachians. At this time, dewpoints remain in the
30s/40s throughout the region, therefore conditions remain fairly
stable. Looking westward, dewpoints are higher, albeit not by 
much, generally low/mid 50s just ahead of the cold front. Cam 
guidance continues to favor a region of increased instability 
across portions of the lower valley/plateau this afternoon, which
seems plausible as low/mid level lapse rates improve. Given this,
little directional/speed shear, and low freezing levels, still 
think some sct thunderstorm activity (mainly along/south of I40) 
is plausible with the primary threat being some small (sub severe)
hail. As for the fcst itself, did tweak pops a bit to line up 
with recent radar/CAM trends. No other sig changes needed/made at 
this time.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A closed mid/upper level low over the Mid MS Valley this morning 
will be transitioning to an open wave as it tracks E-SE through the 
OH Valley today. A line of showers currently crossing srn KY and 
Middle TN in an area of warm advection ahead of the system is 
projected to reach our Plateau counties this morning, around 10-12Z. 
It will be moving into a drier and more stable air mass, so the 
current lightning activity should be diminishing as it moves east. 

Later today, mainly after 18Z, we will have strengthening forcing 
aloft as a jet streak across E KY and WV provides upper divergence. 
Instability will be increasing as well but still remain fairly weak, 
with MLCAPE values in the range of only 400-700 J/kg in our southern 
half. The forcing and weak instability should be enough for a chance 
of thunderstorms, but the severe threat looks low. Some small hail 
may be possible due to the low freezing levels around 7-8 kft, but 
shear appears too weak and CAPE profiles too narrow for a large hail 
threat. The surface cold front is rather diffuse but appears to move 
through in the evening, with rain chances dropping off from west to 
east through tonight as winds through the column shift to N-NW and 
usher in dry air aloft.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...
A more tranquil pattern until the weekend. 

For Tuesday...another upper trough will move southeast into the 
Tennessee Valley and Gulf Coast states. This wave will produce an 
inverted surface trough over the spine of the Appalachians. Moisture 
is limited due to previous stronger short-wave, but enough boundary 
layer moisture combined with upslope flow into the western Carolina 
to produce 20-30 percetn coverage of showers near the Carolina 
border.

For Tuesday night through Thursday night...the main weather features 
will be surface ridging into the Appalachians and upper ridging. 
Some increase in high/mid level clouds possible for Thursday, but 
overall, dry with plenty of sunshine with low afternoon relative 
humidity (RHs in the 30s anticipated, possibly 20s). A gradual 
warming trend is also expected.

For Friday...surface ridge moves allowing for return of southerly 
flow and slowly increasing moisture. However, no upper forcing and 
moisture/instability not enough to produce orographic showers.

For Saturday...upper trough moves into the Mississippi Valley late 
in the day with frontal boundary approaching the area. Increasing 
showers and possibly thunderstorms late. Degree of Gulf moisture 
return and instability is a big question.

For Saturday night and Sunday morning, main upper forcing moves 
through along with frontal boundary. Again, confidence is low on 
amount of moisture and instability return.

bone dry low level air mass, is just about east of the forecast
area. Will reduce pops back down below fifteen percent as this
feature is complete. The main event is expected during the

system. Model forecasts keep the threat for showers and even a few
thunderstorms going well into the later afternoon hours. Was going
to tweak min temps back a degree in a couple spots, but the
advancing thicker mid deck with the trough should allow for some
re-radiation of today's insolation. Will do the typical adjustment
of the temperature and dewpoint curve in the shorter term.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Monday night)...

A mild pattern will continue tonight as WAA persists ahead of an 
upper short wave and surface low approaching from the NW. A few 
initial showers late this afternoon through this evening associated 
with a weak vort max will exit by 03Z. The rest of the night will 
stay dry and mild. Projected soundings show deep layer warm and 
moist advection through the night with a 20-30 kt southwesterly 850-
700 mb jet. The mid levels are quite saturated, so expected skies to 
remain mostly cloudy through the night. The cloud cover combined 
with the WAA will keep lows in the upper 40's/mid 50's with the 
coolest temps confined to far northeast TN and southwest VA.

The above mentioned short wave will cross the region Monday with a 
weak surface low tracking roughly from KY to VA. Models have 
struggled with the exact placement and track of this low the past 
couple of days with the ECMWF being the most consistent. The 
consensus is for the low to mainly track just north of the TN/KY 
line dragging a cold front across our region late morning through 
mid afternoon. The 12Z GFS and NAM are in better agreement on this 
timing and track which is what the ECMWF has suggested the past few 
runs. 

Showers and thunderstorms will accompany this frontal passage. The 
SPC keeps east TN, southwest VA, and southwest NC in general 
thunder, however, a few strong storms cannot be entirely ruled out. 
Soundings are saturated through the morning, so there will be 
significant cloud cover and scattered showers in the warm sector 
holding temps several degrees lower than Sunday. The morning showers 
appear tied to a pre-frontal trough associated with weakening 
upstream convection. If storms can redevelop in the early afternoon, 
0-6 km unidirectional shear of 40-45 kts, 0-1 km shear around 20 
kts, mid level lapse rates above 7 C/km, PWAT values increasing to 
around 1 inch, and low wet bulb zero heights of 7000-8000 ft could 
allow for hail and strong winds with any more organized cells. CAPE 
values will only reach a few hundred j/kg which will limit the 
strength and coverage of the stronger storms, so there may be quite 
a few cells with small, pea sized hail and gusty winds instead of 
severe sized hail. Additionally, the NAM has persistently showed low 
level winds veering to westerly early in the day which will limit 
convergence needed for a widespread line to develop in the afternoon 
behind the morning showers. Added showers and thunderstorms to the 
grids Monday with chance pops in the morning increasing to likely 
after 15Z. 

Overall, we think that there will be fairly widespread
showers with embedded thunder from mid morning through the 
afternoon, but only a few are likely to become stronger with small
hail and wind gusts over 40 mph being the main threats. The
greatest chance for a stronger storm will be along and south of
I-40 in the 17-22Z timeframe.

The cold front will move east of the region Monday night with chance 
pops for scattered showers lingering in eastern areas through 06Z 
Tuesday. Lows Monday night will be much cooler in the CAA pattern as 
another deep trough carves out across the eastern U.S.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...

Tuesday the shortwave trough will begin to move off the east coast 
while an additional shortwave moves toward the Tennessee valley.  At 
the surface, high pressure moves out of the Great Lakes into the 
Ohio valley.  Northerly low level flow will keep thermal profiles 
cooler with cold air advection.  Highs on Tuesday will likely stay 
in the 50's which is much cooler then previous daytime highs.  A 
weak pressure trough along the Smokies will likely aid in light 
precipitation along the higher terrain. Otherwise, dry air and 
subsidence should bring partly cloudy skies to the rest of the 
forecast area.  

Wednesday through Friday will be under the influence of upper level 
ridging and height rises.  Surface high pressure will move eastward 
with time and will begin to bring lower tropospheric flow toward the 
southeast.  This will advect a warmer airmass with increasing 
temperatures.  Highs Wednesday through Thursday will likely top out 
in the low to mid 60's, with upper 60's to near 70 by Friday.  Lows 
Wednesday night and thursday night will be in the low to mid 40's.  

The upper level ridge will begin to break down by the weekend with 
an upper level trough diving out of the Rockies.  This will bring 
southwest flow aloft and an increase in mid to upper level moisture. 
 Models begin to diverge with time over the weekend in respect to 
the strength of the trough and surface reflection.  It is likely 
that surface pressure falls, and developing cyclogenesis will occur 
east of the Rockies Thursday into Friday with a frontal boundary 
attendant this low. The latest GFS shows a more progressive front 
which is in better agreement with the EURO. Thus while confidence in 
this period is low, will keep low end PoPs over the weekend. 
Temperatures will likely be near to above average for the weekend.

70's still expected across the east TN valley and southwest NC and
mid/upper 60's across southwest VA. Increased cloud cover the rest
of the morning into the afternoon to account for a thick mid to
high level cloud deck arriving from the west. The latest HRRR,
NAM, and SREF show isolated light showers developing around the
plateau after 20Z associated with a weak vort max. Recent radar
loops show these showers developing in west and middle TN, so
added slight chance pops in the plateau region from 20-23Z. The
rest of the forecast remains on track.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A closed low pressure system over the Plains this morning will be 
tracking east to the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley region and 
transitioning to an open wave through today and tonight. Through 
most of today, we will have borken high clouds ahead of the 
approaching system, with the low and midlevels remaining quite dry. 
For fire weather interests, afternoon RH will once again be quite 
low, in the 20-30% range for most spots, with winds from the SW 
around 10 mph. 

A slight chance of showers arrives late today and this evening due 
to a weak shortwave trough ahead of the main system. The NAM 
generates some pretty good lift in the mid/upper levels after 00Z 
across our northern sections, but it is an outlier, plus with the 
dry air that must be overcome, will keep PoPs in the slight chance 
range with light QPF. Rain chances increase late in the period along 
the Cumberland Plateau as the main surface low tracks into Middle 
TN/Central KY. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)... 
The main weather feature will be a short-wave and associated 
frontal boundary moving across the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys 
southeast into the southeast United States on Monday. Models 
continue to have fairly significant differences on the jet 
structure/forcing and potential instability with this wave.

The ECMWF remains the more aggressive with greater forcing and 
instability with the NAM/GFS the weakest over the area and better 
convective potential south. SPC favors the NAM/GFS solution with the 
marginal risk south of the area. If instability aligns with the more 
aggressive ECMWF, hail will be the main concern over the Plateau, 
southeast half of Tennessee, and southwest North Carolina as WBZ 
will be low with favorable Hail CAPE. Strong straight lines may also 
be a concern as wave rides southeast along a frontal boundary.

For Monday night/Tuesday, this wave moves east/southeast of the 
region with showers ending. Models do show a weak inverted trough 
near the spine of the Appalachians keeping chances of showers there.

For Wednesday through Friday, ridging both surface and aloft will 
produce dry conditions. Low afternoon relative humidty will be a 
concern for Wednesday and Thursday.

For Saturday, another frontal boundary will move across the 
Tennessee Valley. Increasing southerly winds ahead of the front and 
possible jet dynamics will set the stage for showers and 
thunderstorms.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...
Dew points have remained very dry this afternoon with many lower 
elevation areas staying in the low to mid 20's. A few AWOS sites 
have had upper teens. Luckily winds have been very light underneath 
the surface high with generally 3 to 8 knot north to northeast flow. 
Subsidence from this high has aided in these lower dew points even 
though the source region upstream had higher dew points this 
morning. 

Heights will begin to rise tonight as an H5 trough develops in the 
Plains with a surface low moving in that vicinity. This system will 
move eastward on Sunday while higher heights hold over the TN valley 
as the surface high settles off the mid Atlantic coast. This pattern 
will yield WAA across east TN, southwest VA, and southwest NC 
beginning tonight and lasting through Sunday.

Expect low temps tonight to average a couple of degrees warmer than 
last night. A 10-20 kt southwesterly 850-700 mb jet will begin to 
transport warmer and more moist air into the region after 06Z, and 
projected soundings from the latest NAM12 show some mid level 
moisening as the night goes on which should result in mid to high 
level clouds increasing. These factors will lead to the milder night 
with no frost concerns. Stayed close to MAV guidance for lows. 

Warm, moist advection will continue Sunday with midlevel RH 
increasing through the day. This will lead to partly sunny to mostly 
cloudy skies, but a warm day is in store with mid to upper 60's in 
much of the valley and some low 70's likely near CHA. A 50+ knot 300 
mb jet streak moving overhead late in the afternoon or early in the 
evening could generate scattered showers well ahead of the synoptic 
cold front, so introduced slight chance pops between 21Z Sunday and 
00Z Monday. Leaned toward the slightly warmer MAV guidance for highs.


.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...
The long range period will feature a disturbance Monday with 
showers and thunderstorms, while the mid to late week features 
increased temperatures and dry weather. Sunday night, a 
disturbance will traverse the area. Models are not in great 
agreement in how this system progress with the NAM indicating the 
lead shortwave across the Ohio valley leading a secondary wave 
moving through the Southeast. The EURO indicates a more phased 
system with one shortwave trough as it moves through the Tennessee
valley. The GFS is aligned more with the EURO with one shortwave.
This will likely have implications on timing of the frontal 
passage and best coverage of showers and thunderstorms on Monday. 
The surface reflection features an area of low pressure across the
Ohio valley that will move into southern Appalachians by Monday 
night. 

A cold front attendant this surface low will move through the area 
on Monday, although as mentioned above, timing is still uncertain. 
This front will likely begin to wash out as it makes its passage 
through the area limiting convergence along the front.  The warm 
sector airmass characterized by moisture and instability, albeit 
weak, will lead to widespread coverage of shower activity early on 
Monday. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are possible along the 
front where weak instability exists.  A couple of limiting factors 
for widespread coverage of thunderstorms is the mid-level flow 
displaced further south, and weak frontal convergence.  Will be 
watching the Monday system closely for any changes, as some small 
hail could occur in any stronger storms as wetbulb zero heights are 
low, in the 6 to 7 kft range. However confidence is low in organized 
severe weather.

Rain will end from west to east Monday night into Tuesday with the 
exit of the shortwave trough and cold front.  Northwest flow aloft 
should provide at least some lift in the form of orographically 
enhanced flow to provide a focus for continued precipitation chances 
for the higher terrain along the plateau, and Smoky Mountains. 
Surface high pressure will build into the Ohio valley Tuesday 
providing a northerly surface flow.  This should keep conditions 
cooler Monday night and Tuesday with highs on Tuesday in the 50's.
 
The main story for the mid to late week period is the increase in 
temperatures. Upper level heights will be on the rise with high 
pressure located off shore the mid-Atlantic providing a southerly 
fetch near the surface and lower troposphere.  Drier weather with 
highs in the 60's to near 70 degrees are likely with lows in the 40 
to 50's. Another system will begin to approach the area by Friday 
and Saturday. Details are still very uncertain in regards to the 
synoptic pattern but it seems an amplification in the upper levels 
will provide a deep trough across the western US, with ridging 
across the East. For now decided to follow a CMC and EURO blend as 
these seem to be in better agreement. Later forecasts will refine 
these large scale uncertainties.

.DISCUSSION...Updated forecast to input recently observed
temperatures and dew points in order to obtain a better hourly
curve through the afternoon. Upstream dew points across KY, IL,
and IN are not quite as low as previous guidance suggested with
generally mid 20's. Trajectories show this airmass continuing to 
advect into our region through the afternoon as northwest flow 
aloft continues on the backside of the departing longwave trough, 
and the surface high settles overhead. Believe dew points will 
stay in the mid 20's in lower elevations, but dew points will be 
lower and lower at higher elevations. Due to subsidence aloft, 
highest elevations are showing dew points in the single digits, 
but Temps are cooler up at those elevations. This results in RH 
values around 25% during the afternoon in the lower elevations as 
temperatures warm into the upper 50's to low 60's, and RH values 
in the teens in the highest mountains. The one factor that reduces
fire danger compared to yesterday is winds are only expected to 
be 5 to 10 knots. The only other change was to slightly increase 
cloud cover across the southern plateau and southern valley this 
morning into the afternoon due to thin cirrus that has been 
streaming in from the west. The rest of the forecast remains on 
track.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Winds have stayed up overnight, which has prevented temps from 
falling as expected. Thus the Frost Advisory for the southern TN 
Valley does not appear close to panning out, so it will be 
cancelled.

Surface high pressure and ridging aloft will continue to build over 
the area today, providing sunny skies and lighter winds than 
yesterday. With afternoon highs in the 60s for most locations, we 
will see afternoon RH values in the 20s. With winds expected to be 
less than 10 mph, no Fire Danger Statement is needed but will 
highlight the low RH in the Fire Weather Forecast product. High to 
midlevel cloud cover will begin to increase tonight as the mid/upper 
ridge axis moves to our east.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)... 
Main system of interest is a short-wave moving across the Ohio 
and Tennessee Valleys on Monday. Timing of this system and 
position of low pressure are crucial with significant differences 
between models. There is a potential of strong to severe weather 
for Tennessee and southwest North Carolina but most align closer 
to the ECMWF solution. Lets get to the particulars.

For Sunday, surface ridging will be east of the Appalachians with 
return southerly flow beginning to pull moisture back into the 
Tennessee Valley. Some residual showers will move into the area, but 
lift is weak so only widely scattered.

For Sunday night and Monday, increasing jet dynamics and isentropic 
lift will produce an area of showers that will move into the region 
by early Monday morning. This area will move east with a break in 
the convection possible before increasing destabilizion and incoming 
frontal boundary produces another round of showers and thunderstorms.
Again, models differ on the degree on instability but freezing 
heights will once again be low. Will need to monitor Monday 
afternoon for the potential of severe weather.

For Monday night/early Tuesday morning, short-wave will move east of 
the area along with shower activity. The GFS does suggest the 
potential of upslope into the western Carolinas that could produce 
some showers Tuesday but confidence low.

For Wednesday and Thursday, ridging both surface and aloft will 
produce dry conditions with a warming trend. Some return moisture 
for Friday producing a slight chance of showers, but overall dry and 
warm.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
The enhanced fire danger across the southern valley and southwest NC 
will quickly subside early this evening as the 15-25 knot wind gusts 
being seen this afternoon die down and RH values increase. 

Despite temperatures running a little below normal, very nice early 
spring weather is expected in the short term. As an H5 trough in the 
eastern U.S. slowly retreats to the east, surface high pressure of 
Canadian origin will continue to build into east TN, southwest VA, 
and southwest NC from the northwest tonight. This will allow winds 
to diminish rapidly after sunset, and with the subsidence bringing 
clear skies, it will be a good radiational cooling night. Widespread 
lows in the upper 20's are a good bet across the Plateau, northern 
valley, northeast TN, and southwest VA with low to mid 30's across 
the central and southern valley and southwest NC. Leaned toward the 
MET guidance for lows. The frost/freeze program started last weekend 
across the southern valley counties, so issued a Frost Advisory for 
these areas from 07 through 13Z. Added the widespread frost mention 
to the grids for these areas too. 

The surface high will be nearly overhead Saturday, so expect a 
beautiful start to the weekend with mainly sunny skies and light 
winds. The flow aloft will still be NW, but highs will rebound after 
the cold morning into the mid to upper 50's across northeast TN and 
southwest VA with upper 50's to low 60's farther south. The 
increasing late March sun angle combined with nearly full insulation 
will make it feel pleasant outside. Used the slightly cooler MET 
guidance for highs.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
The longterm period will feature one system of interest on Monday
with the chance of showers and thunderstorms. Otherwise, a 
warming trend is expected mid to late week. Saturday night, the 
upper level pattern will feature broad troughing across eastern 
Canada and New England while a closed low will be located across 
the central plains. Further upstream, near zonal flow is forecast 
across the Southwest United States. The surface reflection 
features an area of low pressure lee of the Rockies across Kansas 
and Oklahoma, and high pressure across the Ohio valley and mid-
Atlantic. 

Sunday, the 500mb low will begin to become absorbed in the cyclonic 
flow across the Midwest while the upper level flow across the 
southern and central plains flattens.  Upstream, a large cyclone 
will begin to move closer to the Pacific Northwest.  This upper 
level configuration supports west to southwest flow aloft across the 
southeast Sunday into Sunday night.  At the surface, the area of low 
pressure will begin to fill as it progresses eastward into the 
Midwest.  An associated cold front will extend south of this surface 
low through Arkansas, and into eastern Texas.  The surface high will 
continue to move offshore providing a southern trajectory with Gulf 
of Mexico origins.  This will advect a warm and moist airmass into 
the region.  Area point soundings indicate a well mixed atmosphere 
Sunday afternoon with surface temperatures possibly warming into the 
mid to upper 60's.  Lack of forcing, and inversion aloft will keep 
any convection at bay, leading to a dry forecast for Sunday.

By Monday, models begin to diverge in placement of low pressure 
feature, and time of arrival with the frontal zone. However, what is 
in better agreement is the shortwave trough at this point, embedded 
in cyclonic flow, will traverse the Ohio and Tennessee valley Monday 
with the associated low pressure. This low will track just to the 
north of the forecast area. Southerly flow ahead of the front will 
support a warm sector airmass advecting into the area characterized 
by surface dewpoints in the low to mid 50's.  This overall warm air 
advection pattern across the warm sector will result in an increase 
in shower and thunderstorm activity across most of the area. Point 
forecast soundings show limited CAPE profiles with better 
instability south of the forecast area where greater boundary layer 
moisture resides. Overall kinematics and shear look weak at this 
time, with 0-6km shear generally less than 40 knots. Further given 
the westerly wind component, a downstream pressure trough develops 
lee of the Smokies that will inhibit some of the convergence 
associated with the primary frontal boundary. This is common in 
these situations and limits overall severe thunderstorm threat. Went 
with slight chance to chance thunder across most of the forecast 
area to account for the limited instability and lift, but it seems 
that widespread thunderstorms seem unlikely at this time.  Given the 
uncertainties, have left out the mention of strong to severe wording 
in the HWO, but will keep watching over the weekend.  

The cold front shifts eastward by Tuesday with rain ending from west 
to east.  Residual moisture left over along the mountains along with 
orographically induced lift from northwest flow aloft presents 
chances of precipitation into Tuesday before much drier air moves 
in.  Highs Tuesday will reach the mid to upper 50's in a weak cold 
air advection pattern. The coldest night of the extended looks to be 
on Tuesday night with temperatures in the low 30's to near 40 
degrees. The mid week features upper level height rises Tuesday 
night through Friday associated with an amplified pattern with 
stronger troughing across southeast Canada. This results in 
increasing temperatures through the week with drier weather.  Highs 
Wednesday and Thursday will reach the mid to upper 60's while lows 
only in the low 40's to low 50's.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The primary concerns for the short term are winds and relative
humidity. Winds will be gusty today as high pressure builds in
from the west and a low tracks north along the Mid-Atlantic coast.
In this NW flow regime the strongest winds tend to be to our east
in NC, and winds in the NE TN mountains today are expected to be 
close to but just below Advisory criteria, with sustained winds of
15-25 mph and gusts of 30-40 mph. 

Afternoon min RH values are expected to be in the 30-40% range 
for most of the area, with southern sections dropping to 25-30% as
there will be less cloud cover there. This along with gusty winds
will create some fire weather concerns this afternoon. Will 
coordinate with forestry personel this morning to assess the need 
for a Fire Danger Statement. 

Cloud cover across much of the area will be decreasing through the
morning, mainly from south to north. With mostly sunny skies, the
southern half should be able to reach high temps in the lower to
mid 60s, with broken to overcast clouds in the north hangning in 
until the afternoon, and keeping highs in the 50s. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...
Main system of interest through the extended period is a short-
wave moving across the Ohio/Tennnessee Valleys Sunday night 
through Monday night. The GFS and ECMWF are continuing to align 
with a potential severe weather event, especially for the southern
half of the Tennessee Valley. No for the particulars.

For Saturday and Saturday night, ridging both surface aloft will 
produce dry conditions. Increasing high and mid level clouds by 
early Sunday morning. Main concern will be the continued low 
afternoon relative humidity with readings dropping into the 20s and 
30s.

For Sunday, surface ridge has moved east of the Appalachians with 
some return southerly flow producing isentropic lift maily over the 
Plateau areas. Scattered showers are anticipated. A milder day is on
tap as well. 

For Sunday night and Monday, A short-wave will move into the Ohio 
and Tennessee Valleys with jet dynamics placing the region under 
divergence aloft. The jet structure will enhance fronto-genetic 
forcing along an approaching frontal boundary for Monday. Increasing 
southerly boundary layer jet will pull moisture back into the 
Tennessee valley helping to increase CAPEs to 500-1000 J/Kg. 
Increasing shear ahead of the wave along with the instability could 
set the stage for strong to severe storms. Will continue to 
highlight this potential in the Hazardous Weather Outlook.

For Monday night and Tuesday morning, short-wave and boundary moves 
east and southeast of the area with showers coming to and end.

For Tuesday night through Thursday, strong surface and upper ridging 
will return the dry conditions. Low afternoon relative humidity will 
once again be a concern. Cool mid-week, but warmer temperatures 
expected by the end of the week.

.DISCUSSION...
Evening update adjusted temperatures in several spots across the
area. Some places, generally I-40 and north, got heavier bands of
rain (and even some small hail) and has lead to temps running
somewhat cool. Temperatures in the higher elevations have dropped
just below freezing and some of the rain will have transitioned
into snow. Still expected accumulations to be light, but locations
above 4000 feet may see an inch or so of snowfall. Overnight lows
are were only slightly adjusted to account for where rainfall
occurred earlier this evening.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...Colder air will be pushing in 
overnight as the axis of the short wave upper trough and the cold 
front exit to the east. There will continue to be some showers in 
the cold advection especially in upslope areas, and over the higher 
terrain there will be some snow showers especially first part of 
tonight.  Still looks like some light snow accumulations can be 
expected across the highest terrain, especially at elevations above 
4000 feet.  Will continue the SPS talking about this.  Clouds will 
be decreasing from southwest to northeast during the period, but the 
clearing trend is expected to be slow. Winds will be gusty from the 
west and northwest on Friday, especially in the eastern mountains. 
However, it looks to be borderline for a wind advisory in these 
higher elevation areas so will not issue one at this time. Will 
mention in HWO.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...The Spring season
is definitely here as temperatures look to be on a roller 
coaster ride for the long-term. We begin Friday night with surface
high pressure sliding down from the northwest as an H5 trough 
lingers over the eastern U.S. downstream of an H5 ridge building 
in the Plains. This will lead to dry but chilly conditions Friday 
night and Saturday with below normal temperatures across our 
entire region. Despite the cool temperatures, subsidence 
underneath the high should lead to mostly sunny skies Saturday, 
and the increasing late March sun angle will make for a pretty 
nice day. The surface high and H5 trough will shift eastward 
Saturday night as the large ridge moves from the Plains into the 
Tennessee and Ohio Valleys. This will set up a WAA pattern, and by
Sunday, the surface high will be over the western Atlantic with 
the H5 ridge over the eastern U.S. and developing H5 trough and 
surface low in the Plains. This will lead to much milder 
conditions on Sunday with temps rising above normal thanks to the 
WAA bringing air up from the Gulf coast region. The cold front 
associated with the system in the Plains and Midwest should remain
to our west on Sunday leading to another mainly dry day except 
for some widely scattered showers. Only have slight chance pops 
Sunday afternoon.

This will be the system of interest in the long-term period. Recent 
runs of the GFS and ECMWF have come into better agreement that this 
system will phase with a vortex in southeast Canada by Monday with 
at least a moderately strong surface low moving across the Ohio 
valley dragging a strong cold front across east TN, southwest VA, 
and southwest NC by Monday night. After this fropa, another deep 
upper level trough will carve out across the eastern U.S. sending 
temps back to below normal.

For the details of this system, the low tracking north and west of 
our region and the entrance region of an upper jet streak close to 
the Tennessee Valley will likely bring enough moisture, instability, 
and lift for convection Monday into Monday night ahead of the cold 
fropa. Severe storms are a possibility, but the details of the 
amount of instability and shear available still need to be worked 
out. The ECMWF and GFS show several hundred j/kg of surface based 
CAPE and 20-30 kts of west to southwesterly 0-1 km AGL shear Monday 
afternoon and evening, so the low level wind field will be strong. A 
30 kt west-southwesterly low level jet should transport 1 to 1.5 
inch PWAT values into our area during this time as well. For now 
just added thunder to the grids Monday into Monday night with chance 
pops Monday morning becoming likely Monday afternoon through the 
first half of the night decreasing to chance or slight chance toward 
Tuesday morning. 

Cooler and drier Tuesday as upper trough and surface high build into 
the region. Could see a snow shower or flurry in the highest 
elevations of northeast TN and southwest VA early in the morning 
before the high fully builds in. The trough and surface high will 
shift east Wednesday allowing for another warming trend as mid and 
upper riding amplifies over the eastern U.S. downstream of another 
developing system in the Plains. The ridge and WAA will further 
strengthen ahead of this system on Thursday with temps rising above 
normal. For now have kept Thursday dry until models come into better 
agreement on the passage of the next cold front.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Friday)...

An interesting short-term forecast with two short-waves moving
across the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians today and
early Friday. 

First wave is currently over northern Alabama/ 
southern middle Tennessee. This wave does have upper level jet
energy/dynamics producing divergence aloft over the area. Main
limitation is moisture. Surface ridging into the Gulf has greatly
limited moisture return. This short-wave will have little effect
over the region.

More significant short-wave upper trough will move from the
southern Great Lakes into the central/southern Appalachians by
this afternoon and night. Plenty of cold air aloft is associated
with this upper trough with freezing levels dropping to 4kft or
lower. Upper jet will pull into southwest Virginia/northeast
Tennessee this afternoon producing dynamics for scattered to
widespread showers. Greatest coverage will be generally along and
north of interstate 40. Would not be surprised of isolated thunder
as well. Given the low freezing heights and sufficient Hail CAPE,
some pea size hail/graupel is possible with the stronger updrafts.

The tightening pressure gradient associated with the second
short-wave will produce gusty winds this afternoon and evening,
especially near showers.

Temperature profile also support rain changing to snow/sleet over
the highest elevations, generally at or above 4kft. The highest
mountains, such as the Smoky and Roane, could see 1 to 2 inches.
Highway 441 could become snow/ice covered late today and
overnight. Will include in Hazaroudous Weather Outlook and Special
Weather Statement.

Drier air will move back into the region from southwest to
northeast Tonight through Friday allowing for a return of
decreasing clouds. Pressure gradients will remain tight enough
Friday to produce breezy conditions, especially over the far east
Tennessee Mountains.

.LONG TERM...(Friday Night through Wednesday Night)...
The extended fcst period tips off on Friday evening amidst nwly flow 
across the TN Valley and Southern Appalachians, all while H5 heights 
look to rise from the west as a full latitude ridge axis amplifies 
and advects east across the Plains.  At the surface, cold high 
pressure will be diving southward atop the Midwest, eventually into 
the OH/TN Valleys Friday night.  At fcst initialization, any 
previous nw flow induced precipitation should have ceased leading 
into a dry but cool weekend.  A back door cold front looks to surge 
into the region overnight into Saturday ahead of the aforementioned 
sprawling surface high, which anchors itself over the OH Valley by 
midday Saturday.  

Meanwhile, models continue to favor lee cyclogenesis over KS/OK, 
which should induce a zone of baroclinicity over the Lower MS 
Valley.  Further pattern evolution into Sunday will feature a 
transitioning of the OH Valley surface anticyclone atop the 
Appalachians, setting up over the western Atlantic offshore of the 
Carolina coast allowing for a reopening of the GOM and thus waa 
across the southeast states.  From that point forward, the focus 
shifts to the Plains H5 cyclone and it's eventual evolution/track 
across the Central/East CONUS. Guidance has been a bit divergent in 
days past, but things seem to be coming a little more clear as now 
the ECMWF/GFS favor a phasing of this H5 cyclone with the northern 
stream flow around a large upper vortex over Canada.  This vortex 
will deepen and migrate southward, engulfing much of the Eastern 
half of the country in upper troughing to start the work week. The 
00Z runs of the GFS/ECMWF now both favor an open upper low and 
surface wave traversing eastward atop IN/OH Sunday night into Monday 
with a cold fropa sweeping across the TN Valley and into the 
Southern Appalachians mid/late day Monday. These solutions could 
present a convectively active Monday to Monday night period, with 
storm modes and hazards being dependent on further details that 
aren't yet clear.  Stay Tuned!

Otherwise, some residual moisture could be left behind post fropa 
into Tuesday amidst nwly caa, thus a brief period of RA/SN showers 
looks plausible (SN mainly at the highest elevations).  To round out 
the fcst period, another reinforcing cold front is progged to move 
into the region Tuesday into Wednesday, with a sprawling cold/dry 
high pressure airmass to accompany.  This should keep conditions 
cool/dry through midweek next week.  Temperatures through the period 
will be quite variable given a series of cold fropas, generally 
starting out slightly below normal Saturday, warming to above normal 
for Sunday/Monday amidst strengthening waa, then falling back to 
below normal Tuesday and Wednesday behind the primary cold fropa.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...The short term period will 
start off dry, but clouds will be increasing tonight and some 
showers will be moving in later tonight as a mid/upper level trough 
and a surface cold front approach.  This system will sweep across 
the area on Thursday, along with numerous showers especially north. 
Moisture will be limited so precip will be on the light side. 
Biggest concern will be the low freezing levels which should allow 
for some wintry precip to mix in over mainly higher elevation areas. 
There will likely even be some light snow accumulations over some of 
the higher mountain peaks mainly above 4000 feet, and will continue 
to mention this in the HWO. In addition, there will be some limited 
convective energy available, so some stronger showers may bring some 
pea size hail even in valley locations Thursday due to the low 
freezing levels.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday Night through Wednesday)...An upper trough
and associated short wave will be exiting the Southern 
Appalachian Region Thursday evening. A few showers will linger 
over the area into the overnight hours...slowly ending over valley
locations. However...as the trough moves east...flow aloft will 
become northwesterly and generate some residual upslope precip 
late Thursday night into Friday morning over the East TN 
Mountains. With below freezing temperatures expected over the 
higher elevations... overnight rain showers will transition to a 
mix of sleet and snow. At this point moisture will become quite 
limited and any snow accumulations should remain light...generally
less than an inch. By mid day Friday...high pressure will be 
building in across the area and dry conditions and near seasonal 
temperatures will dominate through the weekend. 

The main system of concern this extended will move in around the 
Monday time frame.  Models continue to have poor agreement on 
details of this system.  The GFS is faster and moves the system 
through Sunday night into Monday as more as an open trough.  The 
ECMWF is slower and generally brings the system in Monday night into 
Tuesday.  This model basically cuts the upper low off and brings 
through a cold front with a more unstable air mass and a better 
chance for a line of convection. Confidence rather low on these 
details and for now will trend the forecast towards a compromise 
between the two models.  Models continue to diverge for Wednesday. 
The GFS wants to move the system out for generally dry conditions. 
The slower ECMWF bringing the upper low through for a continue 
active pattern on Wednesday. With low confidence...will introduce 
some low POPs over northern areas as a compromise.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Thursday Night)...
A ridge of high pressure will remain across the southern
Appalachians and southeast United States producing another dry and
mild day. Main concern will remain the low afternoon relative
humidity. 

For Tonight, A short-wave trough will move into the Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys with upper jet structure enhancing the forcing
over the area. Main limitation will be boundary layer moisture
initially as surface ridging will keep Gulf moisture south of the
area.

For Thursday and Thursday night, upper trough will continue to
deepen over the central and southern Appalachians with freezing
levels dropping to 3-4kft. The strongest upper forcing will be
generally along and north of interstate 40 which is closer to
proximity of the upper low. Enough moisture gets wrapped into the
low with low-level CAPES increasing to 100-300 J/Kg. Enough
instability to produce widespread showers with the threat of pea
size hail with the stronger showers due to the low freezing
heights.

Also, the vertical temperature profile will be cold enough to
include a mixture of snow, sleet, and freezing rain over the
highest elevations of the far east Tennessee and southwest
Virginia Mountains, generally at or above 4kft. Light snow and ice
accumulations are expected, so highway 441 may become slick.

Orographic lift will kick in during the day Thursday and
especially Thursday night/Friday morning. This will keep a wintry
mix going for the favored northwest flow areas.

Even though Spring officially starts today, Thursday through
Friday will feel more like winter, especially over the higher
terrain.

.LONG TERM...(Friday Through Tuesday Night)...
The extended range fcst period kicks off on Friday morning amidst 
moist nwly flow across the Southern Appalachians behind a departing 
trough and associated cold front. Critical thicknesses amongst deep 
caa should favor falling snow levels supportive of light snow/sleet 
across portions of the east TN and southwest VA high terrain, likely 
already ongoing at fcst initialization.  By Friday afternoon/evening 
moisture levels tend to taper, thus any residual precipitation 
should cease.  Not expecting any significant snowfall accums, 
generally less than an inch.

Moving into Saturday, H5 heights will rise as a nearly full latitude 
ridge axis builds across the Plains, and advects east with time.  At 
the surface, cold/dry high pressure will slide southeast through the 
Midwest into the OH/TN Valley, setting up atop the Central 
Appalachians by Saturday evening.  However that will be short lived 
as the ridge continues sliding east over the Carolinas by Sunday 
morning.  Meanwhile, southern stream lee cyclogenesis looks to 
commence/amplify over KS yielding a zone of baroclinicity across the 
Plains and MS Valley, all while a deep northern stream upper vortex 
slides southward across Central Canada.  

Although still with some minor timing differences, guidance tends to 
agree on a wet pattern to start the new work week. Generally it 
looks as if the broad region of surface high pressure will slide 
further east over the western Atlantic allowing for the return of a 
waa regime across the Southeast CONUS.  Meanwhile according to the 
GFS, the two aforementioned cyclones (northern/southern streams) 
phase and drive a cold front across the region Monday into Tuesday. 
On the other hand, the ECMWF doesn't favor any phasing and promotes 
a stronger positively tilted upper trough to sweep through the 
region Tuesday afternoon.  Details such as potential instability and 
shear remain unclear, but think chances for a convectively active 
fropa are modest, especially with the ECMWF solution. Behind the 
fropa into midweek, conditions look cold and dry.

Dropped overnight lows by a degree or two for most areas as hourly
temperatures were falling faster than forecast. Previous forecasts
dewpoints were also too high. Believe this is the reason temps 
are falling faster, because of the drier air in place. Otherwise,
not going much going on through the rest of the night. Overnight

Fairly simple TAFs for the 00z package. VFR conditions will

exception there would be some BKN060 ceilings at KTYS due to smoke
from a prescribed burn to the south near the NC/TN line. Will keep
some BKN060 cigs in there for a few hours to account for this but
would expect those will dissipate before 06z. Otherwise, high

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...

Slightly warmer temperatures, drier air and light winds are expected 
through the short term outlook. Mostly zonal flow is propelling a 
700mb ridge into the region that will continue to increase the 
current high pressure for tonight and tomorrow. A surface low 
pressure center over the central Great Plains will move in behind 
the ridge near the end of the short term outlook. A weak frontal 
boundary associated with the low looks to bring some light showers 
near the middle of the week.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...

The overall weather pattern will be in transition early in the 
period with surface high pressure shifting east of the area 
allowing a weak short wave riding along the upper flow to move in.
A narrow band of deep moisture accompanying the wave will 
combined with weak lift to generate a scattered band of showers 
that will move through the Southern Appalachian Region late 
Wednesday night into Thursday. Due to the limited moisture and the
relative movement of the feature...precip amount should be fairly
light. A few showers may linger over the east TN mountains into 
Thursday night as the wave pulls away from the area but 
overall...will see high pressure begin to build in for dry 
conditions and fairly seasonal temperatures Friday through the 
weekend. The next system of concern...a cold front...will move in 
around the Sunday night/Monday time frame. Models show some 
differences in details with the system but overall it will bring a
wide...deep layer of moisture with sufficient upper level 
dynamics to support widespread showers. Weak instability is also 
expected to develop over the area for at least a slight chance of 
thunderstorms on Monday...mainly south. The frontal boundary is 
expected to continue to affect the area and keep a chance of 
showers in place over the region into Tuesday.

change is for the raising of the dewpoint by a few degrees as we
aren't as dry this morning as originally thought. The rest of the

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A ridge of high pressure will produce dry and cool conditions
through tonight. Main concern will be the low afternoon relative
humidity. Have included this concern in the Fire Weather Forecast.
Will continue freeze warning for the southern plateau and valley
through mid-morning. Temperatures have dropped to the lower 30s
across much of the area. 

For tonight, a few locations will drop to near freezing in the
same areas, but not widespread enough to issue another freezing
warning. Dry conditions will limit any frost development.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday Night)...
The extended range fcst period tips off on Wednesday morning amidst 
a fairly active H5 pattern highlighted by a potent shortwave 
advancing eastward across the Central Plains into the Mid MS and 
Lower OH Valleys, while zonal flow prevails out ahead over the 
East/Southeast CONUS.  At the surface, high pressure prevails over 
the Eastern Seaboard in lee of the Appalachians, beneath weak 
confluent flow aloft.  Pattern evolution through the extended range 
will feature the aforementioned shortwave traversing the OH/TN 
Valleys Wendesday night, while the left exit region of an upper 
jetmax moves along the I10 corridor region of GA/FL promoting 
surface cyclogenesis along the Carolina coastline. By midday 
Thursday, the primary shortwave axis should be crossing the 
Appalachians setting up deep nwly flow atop the region, while the 
East Coast Cyclone races north toward New England.  As for impacts 
associated with this wave across the TN Valley and Southern 
Appalachians, profiles ahead of the system suggest a rather dry 
airmass given minimal preceding return flow. However, the wave 
itself does look to advect modest midlevel moisture into the region 
on Wendesday night, sufficient to support showers.  Likewise, on 
Thursday amidst the developing nwly flow, cannot rule out some 
residual focusing of light precipitation along the favored upslope 
regions, possibly with a few light snow showers at the highest 
elevations of east TN and southwest VA into Friday morning as snow 
levels fall, before all precipitation moves out.  

Beyond that moving into Friday, sharp and nearly full latitude H5 
ridging sets up across the Central CONUS, while the Eastern CONUS 
trough slowly shifts east.  Rising heights into Saturday will be 
accompanied by another region of dry high pressure advecting 
southward across the OH Valley into Central/Southern Appalachians. 
On Sunday the upper ridge begins to deamplify as troughing deepens 
and moves east setting up a zone of baroclinicity over the Plains 
and MS Valley, as well as a return to weak sly waa across the 
southeast. At this range guidance tends to diverge a bit with regard 
to the details, but it looks like a deepening H5 low will initiate 
surface cyclogenesis across the Midsouth in that late Sunday to 
early Monday timeframe, with a potent frontal passage and associated 
convection to traverse across the TN Valley Monday evening into 
Tuesday.

As for temperatures throughout the period, expecting at or below 
normal levels to dominate through the remainder of the work week. As 
the aforementioned upper ridge builds into the region on Saturday 
and weak waa initiates on Sunday, moderation should commence allowing 
temperatures to return to and exceed normal levels by periods end.

.DISCUSSION...Updated to slightly increase cloud cover across 
much of east TN and southwest NC. Satellite trends all evening 
have shown high level clouds streaming in from the southwest 
associated with some overrunning moisture north of the cold 
frontal boundary that pushed south of the region this morning. 
These clouds will clear out after 06Z as surface high pressure 
drops into the region from the northwest. The clearing skies and 
winds turning light and variable under the high will lead to good 
radiational cooling through the early morning hours with 
widespread lows in the mid 20's to low 30's still expected. 
Continued the Freeze Warning across the southern valley and

from the low 40s to mid 50s. Dewpoints this afternoon are in the 
teens and 20s with RH values currently around 20-40%. 

Ideal radiational cooling conditions are forecast tonight as high 
pressure settles into the area. Light winds, clear skies, high 
pressure, and low dewpoints will all combine to allow temperatures to 
drop rather quickly after sunset. Lows across the area will drop 
down into the mid 20s to low 30s. Given that the frost program is 
active across the lower valley/plateau, opted to issue a Freeze 
Warning for tonight. 

PW values will remain low on Tuesday, generally below a quarter of 
an inch. The dry airmass will warm rather quickly after sunrise. The 
cold air advection will weaken but the surface high remains centered 
over the Ohio River Valley on Tuesday. Highs should be a bit warmer 
with temperatures topping out in the 50s across most locations.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...

The long term will begin in a rather quiet weather pattern with 
surface high pressure in control and flow aloft fairly zonal. This
will allow for dry conditions and warmer air moving in for 
Tuesday night and Wednesday. The high will shift east of the area 
Wednesday night...allowing an area of low pressure to push in. 
This low will increase clouds Wednesday evening and then spread 
scattered light rain showers across the area late Wednesday night 
into Thursday. Low level moisture will be in place but the system 
should move through fairly quickly limiting precip amounts. The 
system will exit the area Thursday afternoon with only a few 
showers lingering over far eastern mountains late in the day. High
pressure builds in during the night Thursday...ushering in a 
return to dry conditions for Friday through the weekend. Another 
system will move in around the Sunday night/Monday time 
frame...bringing in another round of showers and potentially some 
embedded thunder for the end of the extended period.

The cold front is now to the south and east of the forecast area
with cold and dry air advection expected for today. PW values
across the area are below a quarter of an inch with sunny skies.
Dewpoints are down in the 20s and have adjusted things down
slightly with RH values dropping into the 25-35 % range later this
afternoon. Despite the cold air advection behind the boundary, the
ample supply of sunshine will allow temperatures to warm into the
mid 40s to mid 50s for most locations.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A passing H5 shortwave and associated weak surface wave continues to 
advect east across the Central Appalachians this morning, pushing a 
weak frontal axis into the TN Valley and Southern Appalachians.  Not 
much in the way of impacts with this fropa given the depth of 
dryness in the profiles, however it will work to keep nocturnal nwly 
winds slightly elevated.  Otherwise, high pressure will move in 
behind the wave across the OH/TN Valleys and the Appalachians 
through the remainder of the day beneath quasizonal nwly H5 flow. 
All in all, should be a fairly nice day across the region with 
mostly sunny skies favored for most locales, while some llv fair wx 
cu is possible during peak heating. Temperatures today will top out 
nearly 8-10 degrees below normal.  Additionally, ample mixing this 
afternoon should allow dewpoints to fall off nicely, thus RH in the 
20s/30s across much of the area is favored. Moving into the 
overnight, little if any sky cover will favor modest radiational 
cooling.  This combined with weak surface flow consequent of the 
aforementioned surface anticyclone will allow for temperatures to 
fall into upper 20s to lower 30s regionwide. Given that the frost 
program is active across the lower valley/plateau, opted to issue a 
Freeze Watch for tonight, which will likely be upgraded to a Warning 
on the day shift. Lastly, also added in patchy frost where dewpoint 
depressions were low enough, and winds were weakest. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...
Surface high pressure centered generally over Kentucky will 
provide near calm winds and abundant sunshine across the forecast 
area. Temperatures will start off very cold but gradually warm 
into the 50s through the day. Dry weather will persist into 
Wednesday as we await the next shortwave trough. Wednesday will 
generally be a carbon copy of Tuesday's weather but a few degrees 
warmer all around. 

Farther west the surface front and southern/northern stream troughs 
merge by Wednesday evening. The NAM forecast soundings are generally 
more moist in the low and mid levels particularly south of I-40 
while the GFS indicates only a small moist layer in the low levels. 
Generally, the NAM handles moisture better and given the strength of 
the shortwave - have favored the southern Tennessee Valley for 
chance PoPs along with the TN/VA mountains where additional upslope 
should squeeze out measurable precipitation through Thursday 
afternoon.

By Thursday night light northerly winds will cause another day of 
temperatures generally rising from the 30s to near 40 to the 50s and 
60s as drier air settles back into the forecast area. A high 
amplified pattern sets up quickly as another potent trough digs over 
the Intermountain West. The resulting ridge will help pump up our 
temperatures in strong southerly flow. Consequently, rising low 
level moisture will also increase through Saturday night. While it 
is still at the end of the forecast period, it is worth noting that 
showers and thunderstorms will be possible on Sunday 
afternoon/evening.

.DISCUSSION...Not many changes to the forecast as quiet weather
continues. A weak cold front will cross in the 09-12Z timeframe
resulting in the light westerly winds veering to a more north to
northwesterly direction. This front remains moisture starved, so
only some mid to high clouds are expected with its passage across
southwest VA, northeast TN, and the East TN mountains. Actually reduced
sky cover in those areas from now through 06Z based on satellite
showing a thinning trend upstream. Adjusted hourly temps and dew
points to account for current observations, but the previous low
temperature forecast remains on track with upper 20's to low 30's
across southwest VA, northeast TN, and the plateau, and low to
mid 30's elsewhere. The only other change was to slightly decrease
winds for the rest of the evening since many sites are already
reporting calm winds.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

In the upper levels, there is a rather broad upper level trough 
across the Eastern CONUS. At the low levels, there is a cold front 
located to the north and west of the forecast area. The atmosphere 
is rather dry with PW values currently around a quarter of an inch 
with mostly sunny skies. Temperatures have warmed rather quickly 
today with the dry atmosphere in place. The cold front will move 
across the forecast area later this evening into the overnight hours 
as a a shortwave trough rotates from the western Great Lakes into 
the Ohio River Valley. The cold air advection behind the front is 
rather impressive with 850 mb temperatures dropping down into the -8 
to -5 degrees Celsius range across northeast Tennessee and southwest 
Virginia. Some of the models indicate enough moisture with the 
trough passing to the north for a few flurries/sprinkles across the 
higher elevations of southwest Virginia and northeast Tennessee. 
Lows tonight will drop below freezing for most of the area except 
for the southern valley. Winds behind the boundary should remain 
elevated enough to prevent any widespread frost formation. Monday 
will be another sunny but cooler day behind the frontal boundary. 
Highs will only top out in the upper 40s to low 50s.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...

High pressure in place to our west to start the period on Monday 
night. A shortwave will have moved through earlier in the day. 
Behind this wave, some cold air will settle into the area 
overnight. Monday night lows will be the coldest of the period 
with temps down into the upper 20s to lower 30s. If the trends 
hold, a freeze warning may eventually be needed for the southern 
valley areas that have been activated in the frost/freeze program.

High pressure remains in place to our west through Tuesday which 
keeps us in northerly flow. This allows the airmass to stay dry with 
continued below normal temps. Winds will be light during the day 
with RH values in the low to mid 30s. Highs will be in the low to 
mid 50s with clear skies. By Tuesday night a shortwave trough is 
swinging down into the central plains and begins to displace the 
area of high pressure to our west. Wednesday should be mostly dry 
during the day but increasing clouds are expected as the system 
draws closer. Models in decent agreement that precip doesn't arrive 
until the overnight hours and exits through the day on Thursday. 
Highs on Wednesday will be slightly warmer as we transition from a 
weak northerly flow to a more westerly flow in the lower levels. 
Highs will be in the low to upper 50s. 

The negatively tilted trough swings into the region on Wednesday 
night. Moisture isn't abundant but there is plenty of lift to 
produce some light showers as the system swings through. The 
vorticity is quite strong due to the orientation of structure of the 
trough. Strong vorticity combined with the polar and southern stream 
jet phasing together as it swings through will provide good lift. 
Again though, moisture is on the weaker side so showers will be 
light and scattered in nature. The shortwave moves off to our east 
during the afternoon on Thursday but some light showers may remain 
on the backside of the system if there is enough moisture. POPs 
during the Wednesday night through Thursday timeframe will be on the 
low end.

Ridging builds back into the area from the west on Thursday night 
and Friday and conditions improve. Ridging further builds into the 
area through the rest of the period with gradually warming 
temperatures. By the weekend, temps are back closer to normal with 
highs in the low to mid 60s and overnight lows in the low to mid 
40s. Our next system begins to move into the area on Sunday night.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Broad H5 troughing continues to prevail across much of the 
east/central CONUS this morning, while sfc high pressure holds atop 
the TN valley and Southern Appalachians.  Upstream across the Upper 
Midwest a shortwave impulse continues to deepen, leading to weak but 
strengthening sfc cyclogenesis.  This wave looks to dive southeast 
across the OH Valley and into the Central Appalachians tonight 
yielding increasing cloudiness, and perhaps a few snow flurries 
across portions of southwest VA and the higher peaks/ridgetops of 
the east TN mtns.  Otherwise, today looks rather uneventful with the 
aforementioned high pressure to dominate.  With that, profiles favor 
deep mixing which could yield some light gusty winds this afternoon, 
generally 15-20mph at best.  Highs today will top out a few degrees 
below normal, with overnight lows doing much the same.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...
At the start of this forecast period, the forecast area will be 
in the wake of a shortwave that will continue to translate across 
Virginia and North Carolina. Surface high pressure, cooler 
overnight low temperatures and precipitation free days can be 
expected through Wednesday. 

Overnight lows on Tuesday will likely be freezing across the entire 
forecast area. Those with sensitive outdoor plants should make plans 
now. It will be only slightly warmer on Wednesday morning but close 
to the freezing mark. 

Meanwhile, farther west the next weather maker for our area will 
dive across the Central Plains Tuesday night. Another shortwave 
dives out of the northern Plains and phases together the southern 
stream shortwave. The associated cold front will gradually move 
across tennessee on Wednesday night and into Thursday. The best 
chances for measurable rainfall for southwest Virginia, southwest 
North Carolina and East Tennessee will be Wednesday night and 
Thursday. Some lingering showers will be possible early Thursday 
evening depending on how quickly the front pushes eastward. 

Temperatures are expected to be slightly below seasonal normals but 
appears that a warm up will commence for a short period over the 
upcoming weekend as southerly flow and upper level ridging build 
into the area.

324 PM EDT Sat Mar 16 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...A quiet short term is in 
store. Quasi-zonal flow remains across the area with weak northerly 
flow at the surface due to surface high pressure to our west. This 
combined with clear skies and calming winds will lead to another 
cold night with temperatures ranging from the upper 20s to lower 
30s. These temperatures are roughly 5 degrees below normal

Freezing temperatures still look borderline for the southern valley 
areas that have been activated in the frost/freeze program. Some of 
these areas will dip down to 31/32 degrees but only for an hour or 
two toward sunrise. Therefore, will not issue any products at this 
time. The evening shift will monitor temperatures trends and can 
make adjustments if needed. There also might be some patchy frost 
but not very confident because the temp/dewpoint depression are 
quite high at around 8 to 10 degrees.

The quasi-zonal flow remains in place tomorrow. The only real 
difference is that skies will be more clear and high pressure across 
the desert southwest/plains region will nudge ever so slightly 
eastward. This should allow highs to be 3 to 5 degrees warmer. Highs 
will be in the low to upper 50s, which is near normal to a few 
degrees below normal. The last item of note will be the low RHs 
again tomorrow. The airmass will remain dry. This combined with the 
slightly warmer temperatures will yield RH values in the upper 20s 
to low 30s for tomorrow afternoon. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...This period will be
under a relatively quiet upper longwave trough, with a few 
shortwaves in the flow but little moisture to work with. At the 
beginning of this period on Sunday evening, surface high pressure 
will be building in, with an upper shortwave skirting the 
northeast sections of the area. Airmass looks too dry for any 
precip with this shortwave--might be some upslope clouds, but 
doesn't look like much else. 

By Monday night/Tuesday morning the surface high should be on top of 
the area, making a good setting for radiational cooling and 
widespread freezing temps.  Then by Wednesday as the high slides 
east, the an anemic return flow sets up with a westerly component 
that brings little if any workable low level moisture.  For 
Wednesday night and Thursday a shortwave races through with lift and 
elevated moisture that will warrant "chance" POPs, but very light 
QPF. Also, looks like the timing will not favor any frozen precip 
for this shortwave. Looks like a complete turnaround from the soggy 
patterns of the past many weeks. By late in the period, a shortwave 
ridge is expected to build in, with the warmest temps of the whole 
seven days.

.DISCUSSION...Very little change to the previous forecast. Biggest
change was to bump up highs this afternoon by one degree for most
areas. Also made some slight adjustments to lower dewpoints based
on current obs.High clouds are streaming across from southwest to
northeast but the bulk of the clouds are just to our south. We 
will continue to see northerly flow down at the surface behind the
departed trough. This will help to keep our temps on the cool 
side today but we should also see a good amount of sunshine to 
help warm us up into the low to mid 50s. These highs will be 
around 8 degrees below normal. Will send out new zones

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The upper pattern this morning is highlighted by a passing upper 
trough axis across the Appalachians, while quasizonal flow sets up 
atop the TN Valley between said trough and a broad region of H5 
ridging over the Southern GOM.  At the surface, a dry cold front 
continues to advect through east TN and southwest VA/NC ahead of an 
approaching region of high pressure.  With that, PGFs remain 
somewhat elevated along/behind the boundary, which will promote 
sustained low end gusting of winds through late morning.  Otherwise, 
a jetmax associated with the passing shortwave embedded within the 
longwave trough continues to slide east this morning, which combined 
with enhanced llv moisture has favored development/advection of low 
stratus.  Said sky cover is expected to erode toward daybreak, 
leading into a partly cloudy to mostly sunny day for the region. 
Likewise, abundant insolation will favor modest diurnal warming with 
max temperatures topping out a few degree below normal thanks to the 
cold fropa.  

Mostly clear skies and light/calm winds combined with 
the cool high pressure airmass will set the stage for a cold night 
tonight.  Temperatures across the region will fall into the 
mid/upper 20s over southwest VA and the northern valley/plateau, 
with slightly warmer low/mid 30s favored southward across southwest 
NC and the southern valley/plateau.  As of today the front/freeze 
program has been activated across the southern valley/plateau, thus 
a freeze warning may be needed tonight for these areas.  Given that 
fcst min temperatures are currently borderline, will defer to the 
day shift for any freeze warning issuance.  Otherwise, some patchy 
frost cannot be ruled out for outlying areas as well.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday night)...
The extended begins with upper-level troughing across the eastern 
half of the country and surface high pressure across the Tennessee 
Valley. A strong shortwave will dive southeast from the Northern 
Plains to the Ohio Valley during the day on Sunday with a 
strengthening W-E oriented upper jet across the Central 
Appalachians. Concurrently, a surface low will move across the Ohio 
Valley toward the Mid-Atlantic with a trailing cold front. Ahead of 
this front, boundary layer winds will shift from the NW to the W 
allowing some neutral or slight WAA Sunday afternoon near 850mb. 
With poor moisture return ahead of this system, expect little, if 
any, precipitation associated with the front on Sunday evening. The 
front will quickly pass through the region early Sunday night with 
winds shifting back to the NW allowing CAA across the Southern 
Appalachians and Tennessee Valley. The NW winds will produce 
orographic lift across the western slopes of the Appalachians and 
may produce some very light precipitation with any remaining 
moisture across higher elevations of northeast Tennessee and 
southwest Virginia. With temperatures forecast to be cold enough to 
support frozen precipitation across the higher elevations, may have 
some light snow showers or flurries. Forecast soundings show the 
post-frontal saturated layer to be between about -3C and -8C, so 
this will limit dendrite potential and lead to some rime ice issues 
across the higher terrain. Overall, with very little moisture to 
work with, expect little to no snow accumulation even across the 
highest peaks. With longwave troughing and mainly neutral or CAA, 
temperatures are expected to be about 5 degrees below normal Sunday.

CAA continues on Monday as dry NW/NNW flow dominates the weather 
pattern. The good news is that clear skies and late March sunshine 
is expected which can help warm things up, or at least counteract 
the strong CAA, this time of year. Temperatures will be near 10 
degrees below normal. Surface high pressure centers over the area on 
Monday night and Tuesday morning with very cold temperatures 
forecast. Expect widespread frost and freeze issues, especially 
where the growing season is near its beginning across the southern 
valley.

Trough shifts east on Tuesday with zonal flow developing across the 
region ahead of the next system. Numerical model guidance continues 
to have difficulties with run to run consistency with how to handle 
the shortwave energy, but are in general agreement with the overall 
pattern. A shortwave trough will drop south from the Northern Plains 
toward the Tennessee Valley with a strengthening upper jet across 
the Tennessee Valley. A surface low and trailing cold front is 
predicted to move across the Mid-Mississippi Valley eastward toward 
the Southern Appalachians on Wednesday afternoon as it becomes 
occluded. As mentioned previously, there are run to run consistency 
issues with guidance, so uncertainty is still high with regard to 
the shortwave strength and phasing which will impact the strength 
and timing of this system. This front moves east on Thursday with 
high pressure moving in from the west. Upper-level ridging is 
forecast to develop across the Central CONUS and build eastward on 
Friday which appears to start a warming trend at the end of the 
period. Overall, the extended period is mainly dry which will help 
the entire area continue to recover from recent anomalous rainfall.

This deck and the surface pressure gradient should help keep some

appears to be on track for the overnight as surface winds relax
with the weakening pressure gradient.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...Drier air is currently in 
place behind a departed cold front that is just to our east. A 
shortwave rotating through the upper trough is located back to our
northwest. We are on the southern extent of this shortwave and 
impacts will be minimal. The bulk of the moisture associated with 
this wave is up across the Ohio River Valley and northward. 
Current visible satellite shows the clouds associated with this 
wave reaching as far south as southern middle TN. These clouds 
will continue to move eastward into our area this evening and 
overnight with the greatest amount of cloud cover affecting areas 
along and north of I-40. The other impact this wave will have is 
another shot of cold air. Overnight lows will dip down into the 
low to mid 30 for most, which is a few degrees below normal. The 
spring frost/freeze program has been activated for the southern TN
valley but temps will be borderline tonight so no plans to issue 
a freeze warning. Winds will remain gusty overnight due to the 
tight pressure gradient associated with the upper trough. Winds 
will settle down some across the southern valley later tonight but
remain gusty through most of the night across northeast TN, 
southwest VA, and the higher terrain.

As the trough lifts northeast overnight clouds will slowly clear 
from southwest to northeast. Northeastern areas should be mostly 
clear by later tomorrow morning. This allows for plenty of sunshine 
on Saturday. Highs will be a little colder with northwest flow in 
place and temps will be in the low to mid 50s, which is around 8 
degrees below normal.


.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...We continue with a
relatively calm, but cool pattern as we enter the work week. A 
mostly dry front will push through Sunday night into Monday 
helping to keep temperatures below normal. There may be enough 
moisture along this front that a sprinkle of drizzle or a few snow
flurries may occur in Southwest Virginia, but at this time 
widespread rain/snow showers are not expected and QPF amounts 
would be very low. 

Behind this front colder air will continue to flow out of the 
north/northwest, but with the sunnier skies temperatures will remain 
relatively consistent for the first half of next week. The coldest 
night of the forecast will come on Monday night/Tuesday morning as 
temperatures at or below freezing across most of the Eastern 
Tennessee Valley. 

Models continue to indicate that a mid-week shortwave moving across 
the area. Still disagreement with the exact timing of this system, 
so confidence is still somewhat low at this time. Currently looks as 
if temperatures should remain warm enough that we would see all rain 
from this system, except maybe in the highest elevations where there 
may be a brief switch-over to wintry weather early Thursday morning.

Ridging begins to build in towards the weekend leading to a quick 
warming into the 50-60's by Friday.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast on track this morning with just a few
minor adjustments to line up with latest trends. Initial cold 
front remains draped across our eastern mountains. The precip 
associated with this front will continue to slowly move off to 
the east and out of the area over the next few hours. Tweaked 
hourly POPs to try and time the exit of the precip.

Drier air is moving in behind the front as seen on vis/ir
satellite imagery. It looks areas along and west of I-75 will see
more sunshine than originally thought. This makes for a tough
temperatures forecast for today. Initially you would think less
clouds means warmer temps but a secondary shot of cold air is 
trying to move in that is associated with a shortwave located 
back to our northwest. For now, will not alter high temps as it's 
hard to say which will have the bigger impact, the colder air or 
mid- March solar radiation. Will watch temperatures closely and 
adjust if needed. Additional clouds move in later this afternoon 
with the shortwave.

Will send out updated zones to account for POPs and sky cover
changes.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The upper pattern this morning is highlighted by a sharp ridge over 
the Western Atlantic, while a deep trough with embedded shortwave 
impulses dominates over the Plains and MS/OH Valleys.  At the 
surface, the first of two cold fronts continues to work eastward 
across Middle TN this morning, while a second reinforcing front 
moves through Upper Midwest.  Currently, prefrontal convection 
prevails across east TN and southwest VA/NC in association with a 
region of divergence aloft beneath the rear entrance region of an 
upper jet.  This feature (and the consequent convection) will 
continue advecting east/northeast through morning, thus current pops 
trends favor a maxima of likely/categorical levels moving across the 
high terrain by daybreak, then tapering below mentionable levels. 

Behind the initial front, profiles will dry out as abundant mid 
level moisture advects east, and drier/cooler high pressure attempts 
to nose in from the west.  Thus the fcst through much of the day 
will feature only partly cloudy skies and temperatures generally in 
the upper 50s to lower 60s.  Profiles also support ample mixing 
today, which combined with modest llv flow upward of around 40kts, 
could yield a windy day at the surface with gusts in the 30-35mph 
range possible. These levels are just below advisory criteria, 
therefore no advisory is planned at this time.  Lastly, the 
aforementioned secondary reinforcing front will approach the region 
beneath/behind a shortwave impulse that will pass across the OH 
Valley into the Central Appalachians by late evening.  With that, 
guidance favors a surge of H85 moisture from the northwest, 
therefore the overnight forecast will feature increasing cloudiness 
and falling temperatures as the dry cold front moves through the 
region into Saturday morning. Expect morning lows on Saturday in the 
low/mid 30s, perhaps in the upper 20s across the higher terrain.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday night)...
Behind the departing cold front, CAA continues on Saturday with 
boundary layer winds from the N/NW. Upper-level troughing remains 
over the eastern half of the country through the weekend with high 
pressure shifting east over our area Saturday night. This will 
result in a clear sky and calm winds making Saturday night and 
Sunday morning our coldest night of the weekend with a widespread 
freeze across the area. Based on climate normals, our median last 
freeze for CHA is March 31, for TYS is April 4, and for TRI is April 
19, so it's not abnormal to be dealing with these cold temperatures 
in mid to late March. As high pressure shifts to the east on Sunday, 
some weak WAA will occur during the afternoon with temperatures a 
few degrees warmer than on Saturday. Temperatures will be about 10 
degrees below normal through the weekend with the troughing pattern 
and predominant northerly flow.

A strong shortwave will rotate through the longwave trough on Sunday 
night diving south through the Great Lakes toward the Central 
Appalachians. This will deepen the upper-level trough and bring a 
fast moving surface low southeastward across the Ohio Valley toward 
the Atlantic Coast. A trailing cold front will result in a 
reinforcing shot of cold air as 850mb winds shift to the NW at 15 to 
25 kt behind the front early Monday morning. With flow from the W 
ahead of the front, very little moisture return is expected, so do 
not expect widespread precipitation. Do expect we could have some 
orographically enhanced precipitation across the mountains of 
northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia as the upslope flow helps 
to maximize any remaining available moisture. It will be cold enough 
to support some light snow showers or flurries in these higher 
elevations Monday morning, but moisture is so limited that little to 
no accumulation would be expected, even across the highest peaks.

Northerly flow continues on Monday and Tuesday with temperatures 
again close to 10 degrees below normal as longwave troughing 
dominates the Eastern CONUS weather pattern. High pressure at the 
surface will keep us dry and will settle over the area on Tuesday 
night into Wednesday morning bringing another clear, calm, and cold 
night. Widespread frost/freeze potential will exist again on both 
Monday night and Tuesday night. CIPS analog guidance shows above a 
90% chance of minimum temperatures below 32 deg F across most of the 
forecast area early next week. Numerical model guidance is in good 
agreement through Tuesday night/Wednesday. 

Model guidance diverges on Thursday in how the GFS and ECMWF handle 
shortwave energy transiting the longwave trough. The ECMWF is much 
more progressive and deeper with the longwave trough compared to the 
GFS, and the Canadian is an outlier with a deep upper low. However, 
both continue to show a weak system affecting the region on 
Wednesday night through Thursday. Ridging across the Central CONUS 
begins to build eastward into our area toward the end of the week.

So far this evening the best surface instability has been limited
to areas south of the Tennessee border, in Alabama and now 
Georgia. High resolution guidance indicated that some better,
albeit weak, instability would exist for a short period this
evening further west of the showers that moved through earlier.
This seems to have been realized, with some increase in shower
coverage and intensity over the plateau in the last hour or so.
That being said, there remains a dearth of lightning strike 
detections, even in the west, so concerns for strong to severe
convection is low at this point. Otherwise winds have subsided
over the plateau, with only meager gusts being noted from time to
time. Have cancelled the wind advisory there as a result. Will
hold onto the one in the mountains as some strong gusts are still
being seen at the higher elevations. Do not believe it will rise
to advisory level, but another gusty day is on tap for the area
tomorrow as well.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
Storms with supercell structure have been increasing across N AL
and Middle TN over the past hour. The short term models indicate
that the environmental shear and instability will remain 
supportive of supercells, and the RAP shows strengthening 
mesoscale forcing as storms move into our area. 

The period of the greatest severe threat will be between 7 pm and
midnight. Damaging winds with be the main threat with the storms,
and tornadoes will also be possible given the high shear and low 
LCL environment. The Plateau and southern TN Valley will be the 
areas of greatest concern for tornadoes. The eastern half of the 
area will still have a threat of straight line winds but storms 
should generally be weakening after moving past Knoxville, which 
should occur around 10 pm to midnight. 

The eastward progress of the cold front begins to slow late
tonight, and the models show the front hanging up along the
mountains tomorrow morning as the mid/upper flow parallels the
front. Will keep a chance of showers along the eastern border
through the morning, then end all rain chances in the afternoon as
a more amplified upper trough approaches and pushes the front
east. 

The Wind Advisory will be extended to 03Z in the Plateau, and
until 06Z in the Smokies. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
Cooler weather will be in place over the weekend after the front 
has passed through the area. Temperatures will run about 10 
degrees cooler on Saturday compared to Friday. Temperatures will 
remain below average as mid level flow remains zonal to slightly 
"troughy" (that's probably not a real word). 

GFS continues to insist that a weak clipper system will zip across 
north of the Tennessee Valley Monday. Currently it is the only model 
consistently showing this. Will keep an eye out for this, but with 
the GFS being the outlier, and even then with moisture expected to 
be meager and it barely showing QPF in our area, will leave 
mentionable precipitation chances out of the forecast for now. If 
this system did materialize, Northeast Tennessee and Southwest 
Virginia would have the highest chance to see precipitation from it. 

Better chances for precipitation will come during the second half of 
the week, around Thursday. Models are in very poor agreement with 
this system, so confidence is very low at this time. Both GFS and 
ECMWF show a trough swinging through the area, but the GFS kicks 
through a much stronger one while the ECMWF wants to keep a broader 
and weaker one, and keep the Eastern Tennessee Valley Dry. Will have 
low end chances of precipitation in the forecast, but the forecast 
may likely change as models hopefully get into better agreement.

Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED
National Weather Service Morristown TN
1041 AM EDT Thu Mar 14 2019

.DISCUSSION...
A few changes will be made to the forecast with the morning
update. Temperatures so far have been riding a little faster than
forecast, and with the latest guidance coming in warmer, will bump
up the high temps slightly, mainly in the northern Valley areas
that will be under the influence of downslope winds off the
mountains. This will bring highs into the mid 70s in some spots
from Morristown to Tri-Cities. 

The current Wind Advisory will not be changed. So far we have seen
gusts into the low 30s mph in the Cumberland Plateau and near the
mountains. The main concern that will need to be monitored will be
if gusts will warrant an expansion of the Advisory into the 
Valley, as TYS often gusts higher than surrounding sites in this 
type of SW flow regime, and is currently gusting to 33 mph.

The severe weather threat for this evening continues. High shear 
(0-6 km around 60 kt), high helicity (0-1 km around 380 m2/s2), 
and low LCL heights (around 1000 ft) will present a threat of 
supercells with damaging wind gusts and a potential for 
tornadoes, mainly for the Plateau and southern TN Valley. MLCAPE 
shown by the RAP is actually quite high for this type of 
environment and this time of year, in the range of 800-1100 J/kg 
in southern and western sections. For the timing of storms, the 
12Z NAM seems to be coming in faster than the 06Z run, and closer 
but still slightly slower than the HRRR and RAP. We are expecting 
a window for the severe threat between 7 pm and 2 am.

413 AM EDT Thu Mar 14 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A large upper trough is located across the Central CONUS this
morning with a stacked, occluded surface low. A cold front 
extends north to south near the Mississippi River. As the 
vertically stacked low shifts NE toward the Great Lakes, the cold 
front will shift slowly eastward during the day. The LLJ will 
strengthen during the day with S/SSW 850mb winds near 50 kt across
the area. As the boundary layer mixes out in the afternoon and 
the warm front shifts northward, expect to see breezy conditions 
across the entire area. Wind Advisory criteria wind gusts above 40
mph will be expected across the higher elevations of the 
mountains and higher elevations of the Cumberland Plateau, so 
expanded the advisory in these areas. Surface winds from the S/SE 
will lead to upslope conditions across the southern Cumberland 
Plateau with increased convergence and showery activity possible 
through the day. In contrast, downslope flow will prevail across 
the foothills and central and northern valley locations which will
keep dry weather, more sunshine, and warmer temperatures across 
these locations. For this reason, bumped up temperatures between 
TYS and TRI to reflect the effects of the downslope flow. Weak PVA
and stronger WAA between the surface and the boundary layer 
during the afternoon will result in upper-level height falls and 
increased instability by evening as the front approaches.

Tonight, the cold front will be the focus for likely convection 
and will approach western portions of the CWA after 0z. We will be
in an area of diffluence aloft associated with a 300mb jet streak
across the Ohio Valley. With the majority of lift focused 
directly along the frontal boundary, expect a narrow band of rain 
and thunderstorms along this axis. Numerical model guidance shows 
increasing surface based instability between 0z and 6z as positive
equivalent potential temperature advection occurs, and this 
places the majority of surface based instability generally along 
and west of a line from Claiborne, Union, Knox, and Sevier 
Counties. NAM and GFS forecast soundings both show 200 to 500 J/kg
of MLCAPE during this time period. In addition, the LLJ remains 
strong with 850mb winds near 50 kt. Deep layer flow above the 
boundary layer is mainly unidirectional from about 240 deg which 
will intersect the frontal boundary at about 30 deg. These factors will
favor primarily QLCS convection. With the strong LLJ, wind shear 
is very strong. Forecast soundings show: 1) effective storm layer 
shear at 50 to 60 kt; 2) effective inflow layer shear of 40 to 50 
kt; 3) 0-1km shear of about 40 kt; and 4) effective SRH of 300 to 
400 m2s2. These values, combined with the QLCS favored storm mode,
mean damaging winds will be the primary threat from strong to 
severe thunderstorms between 0z and 6z Friday. However, because of
the strong low-level shear and surface based instability, cannot 
rule out a tornado or two within the line across the western parts
of the CWA. Because of the weak instability, hail does not appear
to be a main threat. This forecast matches up very closely with 
CIPS analog guidance which shows the potential for damaging winds,
and a much lower chance of tornadoes, across the western and 
southern parts of the forecast area based on similar past events.
The main mitigating factor will be the low instability, and if 
surface based instability does not increase as forecast, the 
severe threat will be much lower. As for the heavy rain potential, PW
values will increase to 1.3 to 1.5 inches ahead of the front with
the moist S/SW flow which is bewteen the 95th to 99th percentile 
of climatology. Because of the limited duration of potential 
heavy rainfall, any flash flood threat is marginal.

As fropa occurs between to 6z-10z, rain chances diminish as we 
approach 12z Friday. Some showers may continue across the eastern 
mountains and foothills before ending Friday morning.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...
A few lingering showers can be expected especially eastern 
portions of the area on Friday with the exiting cold front, then 
drier and colder air will be pushing in as surface high pressure 
builds in from the west and northwest. The remainder of the period
for Saturday through Wednesday looks to be mainly dry with 
temperatures running below seasonal normals for the entire period.
Models, especially the GFS, have been trying to bring the 
possibility of isolated to scattered light showers/snow showers to
the area at some point with some weak short wave energy, but even
the GFS has trended drier so for now will go with a precip free 
forecast for the period other than the aforementioned Friday 
morning showers.

.AVIATION...
Complex flight weather is expected over the TAF period. One of the
main issues will be strong winds aloft which will provide some
LLWS this morning at CHA. During the morning and early afternoon,
all TAF sites will see increasing winds from the S/SSW. While 
LLWS is not expected during the day, winds will increase in 
magnitude with height and be near 50 kt at 5000 feet near all
sites.

Downslope winds will keep TYS and TRI cigs at VFR through the
period, but upslope flow, combined with increasing low-level
moisture, will lower cigs to MVFR at CHA this morning. CHA could
see some temporary cigs near or below 2000 ft, but confidence is 
too low to include in the TAF.

A line of rain and thunderstorms will move eastward late in the

.DISCUSSION...

Overall the forecast was in good shape, but did make some
adjustments. The main changes were to increase winds a little bit
across the higher terrain, mainly with regard to wind gusts. 
Previous thoughts on the overall setup for high winds still holds 
true. That is there isn't a strong cold wedge east of the 
Appalachians, cross-barrier flow isn't non-existent but it's not 
great either, and the H85 wind fields typically interrogated for 
such events do not show overly impressive values. That said, I 
feel there is enough of a mountain wave signature, and high enough
winds in the low levels, to warrant an advisory. Current thinking
is that gusts to around 50 mph will be seen at the typical windy 
spots like Cove Mountain, etc. Camp Creek is already gusting into 
the 35 mph range, so this also lends some confidence to the 
forecast. In other words, it will be windy, but not exceptionally 
so. Look for advisory level winds to begin showing up within a few
hours after midnight, and likely continue off and on through much
of the day tomorrow. The remainder of the forecast was in good
shape and no adjustments were necessary.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Thursday)...
Surface high pressure is now east of us, allowing southerly return 
flow to start.  Deep low pressure in the Plains and its associated 
cold front will be heading eastward, continuing to increase our low 
level southerly flow. Winds might be advisory level on the plateau 
and up through parts of the valley Thursday as southwest winds 
increase, but looks like glancing blow as fastest low level jet goes 
to NNE with its core staying west of us.  Will hold off issuing 
advisory for now. Chances of showers will be increasing as well, 
with chances for storms later on Thursday afternoon for western 
areas.  Best precip chances will be into the next period.  

Dewpoints  slow to recover this afternoon, partly based on the fact 
that return flow is sluggish to get started in the mid and upper 
valley.  Have trimmed back dewpoints for the remainder of the 
afternoon, but they should catch up once winds start up again.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
Showers and thunderstorms will be knocking on the door of the 
Eastern Tennessee Valley Thursday night. There will be a few weather 
items of note as this system continues to move through the area 
Thursday evening into Friday. Thunderstorms will likely be ongoing 
across Middle Tennessee and try to move into the Valley Thursday 
evening/night. CAPE values will be very meager, but the low level 
jet coming out of the south/southwest along this system will help 
bring in high 0-6km shear values of 40-50+ knots. Timing of this 
system is not very good for strong storm development as it tries to 
come through after the sun has set. But if strong enough storms are 
able to form further west of the area they could remain together 
long enough to pose a marginal risk of damaging winds along the 
Cumberland Plateau and western portions of the Valley. 

Models are still in some disagreement on when the band of 
precipitation along and ahead of the front will move through. NAM is 
the most sluggish with this precip and leaves areas of NE 
Tennessee/SW Virginia pretty dry into Friday morning. Some hints in 
the models that the influence of downsloping winds will be stronger 
than previously forecasted, so have bumped down PoPs a bit in 
locations that typically see the downsloping influence the 
strongest. 

The previously mentioned low level jet will also bring strong winds 
to the higher elevations Thursday into Thursday night. While the 
wind direction is not exactly perpendicular to the Southern 
Appalachian Mountains the strong winds of in the low level jet of 
40+ knots will lead to high winds regardless. Will hold off on a 
high wind watch as the orientation of the winds aren't ideal for a 
high wind warning, but it's very possible that we may see wind 
advisory winds in the higher elevations into the foothills Thursday 
into Thursday night.

After this system exits the area on Friday we'll see dry conditions 
through the rest of the weekend. GFS wants to bring through a ripple 
of moisture/energy Sunday into Monday across NE Tennessee/SW 
Virginia. But it's currently an outlier, so will keep low end PoP 
chances for now, but confidence is low in this for now. 

Quiet weather will continue through the rest of the forecast with 
another low/trough expected to move across the Eastern half of the 
United States during the second half of the work week.

Surface return flow has begun, with dewpoints starting to climb,
but a little behind in recovery this morning, so tweaked hourly 
dewpoints for next couple of hours to show this. Otherwise
forecast is on track. Looking ahead at any wind threat next couple
of periods--forecast still certainly increasing winds tomorrow,
but with surface low so far north, low level winds stay pretty
veered, and not setting up for classic mountain wave event, so not
considering High Wind Watch for mountains and foothills for
tomorrow, etc. Might warrant wind advisory for some parts of the 
area, but will monitor for that possibility for later.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A large upper level trough is currently over the Southwest with
ridging across the East Coast. A surface low will quickly
strengthen across the Southern and Central Plains due to strong
PVA and upper level mass divergence. This trough and surface low
will shift eastward on Wednesday placing our area under southwest
flow and WAA aloft during the afternoon. Weak PVA associated with
a 500 mb shortwave across the Tennessee Valley and WAA between 
700 to 500 mb is resulting in some lift and conditional 
instability aloft this morning providing the mid-level clouds;
however, dry air at the surface is preventing any precipitation. 
In the wake of the shortwave, some weak NVA and shortwave ridging 
will provide a break in some cloud cloud cover during the
afternoon. With 850 mb WAA and temperatures 2 to 4 deg C warmer 
than Tuesday, expect high temperatures to be generally 5 to 9 
deg F warmer on Wednesday. With SE flow near 925 to 850 mb of 
about 10 to 15 kt during the afternoon, also expect some downslope
warming across the foothills and NE TN and SW VA with locally 
higher temperatures.

Southwest winds continue to increase in response to the tightening
pressure gradient tonight. This will continue to advect warmer 
and more moist air across the region. Lift will increase as PVA 
and low-level WAA provide for some weak lift and slight chance 
PoPs across western portions of the forecast area late tonight.
Anything precipitation that makes it to the surface would be 
expected to be light. Increasing boundary layer S/SE flow will 
keep much of the foothills and central and northern valley dry 
with downslope winds, but upslope winds along the southern plateau
will increase chances for rain showers and fog as we approach 
Thursday morning.


.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...
Models continue to be in decent agreement overall although there 
are some differences in the details, and forecast confidence is 
close to average for this time of year. A cold front will swing 
through the area Thursday night and should be exiting early 
Friday. Models have trended a bit slower with this system, but 
still expect some showers to enter at least western portions of 
the area Thursday, with showers and thunderstorms expected area 
wide Thursday night. While convective energy will be limited, the 
low level shear will be quite impressive and a few storms may be 
strong to severe, especially south and west portions of the area. 
Will mention this threat in the HWO. Locally heavy rainfall may 
cause localized flooding as well. In addition, there continues to 
be some potential for mountain wave enhancement of the winds 
Thursday into at least the first part of Thursday night as the 
southerly low level jet strengthens. Confidence not high enough to
issue a high wind watch at this point since wind directions looks
borderline, but definitely will keep mention in the HWO. 

After any lingering showers move out Friday, colder and drier air 
will push in and much of the remainder of the long term period will 
be dry with below normal temperatures. There is a possibility that 
some short wave energy will bring a few showers or snow showers to 
the area at some point although timing is uncertain. Right now 
Sunday night looks the most likely time frame for any precipitation, 
so will include slight chance PoPs to account for this.

Overall good flight weather tonight at all sites with VFR
conditions and light winds. Southerly winds increase on Wednesday
afternoon, especially at CHA, with occasional stronger gusts. 
Wind shear may also be a concern at CHA near the end of the period
as winds increase quickly with height by about 30 to 35 kt from 
the surface to 2000 ft. In addition, cigs will lower and approach
MVFR at CHA by the end of the period. TYS and TRI will remain VFR
longer as downslope winds keep the low-levels drier at both 
sites.

.DISCUSSION...

Very little to speak of as far as changes to the standing forecast
tonight. Lowered dewpoints a few degrees across the region since
they have been running a little lower than what was being 
forecasted, due to a combination of the high pressure air mass 
and the subsequent lack of advection of moist air from the south.
All other aspects of the forecast look to be on track, with 
little change expected from the stable high pressure.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Wednesday)...
Benign weather will continue the rest of today and through
tomorrow across the area. Increased mid level ridging, light 
southerly winds are both helping to bring temperatures up a few
degrees warmer than yesterday. High level clouds are moving across
the area, but they are pretty shallow so aren't doing much to keep
back the warmer temperatures. 

Conditions won't change much overnight as with the exception for
some additional mid level moisture moving in from the west leading
to a slight increase in mid-level cloud coverage and helping 
temperatures stay warmer than last night and generally above 
freezing across the East Tennessee Valley. 

During the daytime hours tomorrow conditions will continue to
remain persistent. Temperatures will increase a bit as mid level
ridging slightly strengthens and stronger winds move out of the
south ahead of an approaching system. Temperatures are expected to
be a few degrees above normal for this time of year.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
The main forecast item of note in the long term will be the incoming 
front for Thursday into Friday. Otherwise the long term period is 
shaping up to be a decent one, with cooler than normal temperatures 
but a nice dry period expected to round out the Friday - Monday time 
period. Actually, though beyond the scope of our 7 day forecast, dry 
weather may actually persist through much of next week which would 
be a welcome sight for those still dealing with high water.

Jumping back to Thursday, a cold front will be approaching from the 
west late in the day. Wednesday night and Thursday morning should be 
dry for most everyone, but rain chances will slowly ramp up through 
the the day Thu as the front approaches from the west. By the time 
this feature is moving through middle Tennessee however, upper and 
mid level flow will become parallel to the frontal boundary, leading 
to a slowing forward speed. The significance of this revolves around 
thunderstorm activity along/ahead of the front. This slower speed 
may lead to shower and thunderstorm activity not arriving until 
Thursday night. There will be some elevated instability so will keep 
a slight chance of thunder in the forecast Thursday evening and 
Thursday night. But the later arrival time of convection will likely 
mean that surface-based won't be as much of a concern. Instability 
is limited to begin with so the main concern would be for the ample 
amount of shear available to be utilized in producing damaging 
winds. In any case the main area of concern for any storms will be 
in the south and west, primarily south of areas like Bledsoe over to 
McMinn county. Will stick with the previous shift's wording in the 
HWO regarding the storm potential.

The other item of note with Thursday's front is downsloping winds 
ahead of the system. Temperatures should warm considerably on 
Thursday, with highs likely reaching into the low 70s for many 
valley locations due to this flow. Does not look like a prime 
mountain wave setup due primarily to low level wind fields not being 
quite perpendicular to the terrain, so do not have high winds 
extending down into the foothills area. But enough mixing and 
downslope flow should be present to warm things up nicely in the 
valley, as well as produce some high winds in the elevated terrain. 
Again, will continue with the same wording in the HWO that the 
overnight shift added in.

By Friday morning the front is east of the Appalachians. Clouds will 
be a little slow to clear out as the main trough axis will not swing 
through until Saturday. There may even be a few showers lingering 
around in the mountains into Saturday morning, but overall dry 
weather will be setting in from Friday through the end of the 
period. After a warm Thursday, cooler than normal temperatures will 
be ensue, but still expect highs in the 50s to near 60 by the end of 
the period.

.DISCUSSION...
Morning update to adjust a few hourly temperatures a degree 
cooler across parts of the area, cold air advection seems to be a 
tad stronger this morning. Forecast discussion from this morning 
is still very relevant and informative, so will re-post it 
below...

Surface high pressure will shift eastward over the area today with
upper-level ridging increasing from the west with NVA across the
Southern Appalachians. This will produce subsidence with very dry
air aloft. Weak CAA continues for much of the day across NE TN and
SW VA with neutral temperature advection across southern portions
of the forecast area. Because of this, went near MOS guidance for
temperatures across southern areas with max temperatures slightly
below MOS guidance across NE TN and SW VA. A few to scattered high
clouds will be possible, but overall, expect mostly sunny
conditions through the day. In addition, with warming 
temperatures and low dew points, RH will be on the low side, but 
the good news is that winds will be light with the surface high 
across the area.

Positive potential temperature advection begins tonight between
700mb and 500mb with 500 mb PVA increasing from the SW. This will
produce weak isentropic ascent across the region with weak omega.
In general, this means an increase in cloud cover tonight from SW
to NE, but no precipitation is expected because of the very dry 
layer between the surface to 700mb. Went above MOS guidance for 
temperatures across southern sections because of the increase in 
mid to high level clouds which is more in-line with raw model 
guidance. Went with colder temperatures near MOS guidance across 
NE TN and SW VA where it is expected to remain mostly clear longer
into the night. Light surface winds begin to shift to the S/SW.

Models in decent agreement overall, and forecast confidence is a

be dry, but a cold front will swing through the region Thursday 
night. Expect showers and thunderstorms ahead of this system. 
While convective energy will be limited, the low level shear will 
be impressive and a few storms may be strong to severe, especially
south and west portions of the area. Will mention this threat in 
the HWO. In addition, there appears to be some potential for 
mountain wave enhancement of the winds again on Thursday into 
early Thursday night as the southerly low level jet strengthens, 
so will mention the possibilty of strong winds in the HWO. There 
may be a lingering shower Friday morning behind the front, but 
drier and cooler air will be moving in for the weekend as surface 
high pressure builds into the region. We should be precip free for
the Saturday through Monday period.

Some areas of fog will be possible tonight, especially near TYS
and CHA where rain was observed earlier today. Already have seen 
some brief MVFR vis at TYS, and expect this to occur at CHA with 
dewpoint depressions ranging from 0 to 3 at 5z. However, with 
some mid to high level clouds, this could mitigate the overall fog
threat and leads to higher uncertainty regarding fog formation. 
Still, went with prevailing MVFR fog at TYS and CHA. Believe the 
potential exists for some brief IFR fog at both sites, but 
confidence is too low to include in the TAF. As fog dissipates 
during the morning hours, flight conditions improve to VFR at all 
sites with only high clouds and light winds through the remainder

.DISCUSSION...
Overall looking at a fairly quiet night across the TN Valley and
Southern Appalachian region as upper heights rise and surface high
pressure advects eastward across the OH Valley. Partly cloudy
skies continue to prevail amidst mid/high clouds streaming aloft 
in association with a departing H5 jetmax. Temperatures remain 
fairly steady beneath said sky cover with mid/upper 40s being 
dominant. 00Z NAM continues to focus low condensation pressure 
deficits across portions of the valley tonight, generally 
along/east of I75, which coincides well with earlier 
precipitation maxima. Thus, wouldn't be suprised to see some 
patchy fog for these areas by mid morning. This was added to fcst,
albeit with only marginal confidence given reliance on scting of 
present sky cover and subsequent cooling to close up those TDDs. 
Otherwise, no sig changes needed/made with this late evening 
update.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...A few pockets of light rain or
sprinkles may linger along the TN/GA border during the late
afternoon/early evening. This is in response to a weak impulse
riding along an old frontal boundary positioned south of the TN
border. This activity will end during the evening as the boundary
slowly settles southward. Otherwise...through the night and into
Tuesday...surface high pressure will move across the area. As a
result...expect decreasing clouds...seasonal temperatures and dry
conditions through the rest of the short term. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday Night through Monday)...The low-level ridge 
axis will shift to the east of the Appalachians to start the long-
term forecast period with warm air advection ahead of the next 
approaching upper level trough. Overnight low temperatures will 
range from the mid 30s across southwest Virginia and northeast 
Tennessee to mid to upper 40s south of I-40. Upper level heights 
will continue to increase Tuesday night into Wednesday in response
to the negatively tilted trough digging into the southern Plains.
Strong warm advection will continue into the day on Wednesday 
with a warm front to the south of the area. WIth the upper level 
ridge axis across the Appalachians and strong warm advection, 
highs will climb into the mid to upper 60s. 

Wednesday night into Thursday, the upper and mid level ridge shift 
to the east with southwesterly flow aloft. Moisture advection will 
increase across the area with PW values climbing into the 1.0-1.2 
inch range. These values are above the 90th percentile for early to 
mid-March. Precipitation chances will increase from southwest to 
northeast. Winds will also increase Wednesday night into Thursday as 
the pressure gradient tightens between the surface low to the west 
and high to the east. A wind advisory will become necessary during 
this timeframe for at least the mountains if not most of the valley. 
Winds at 850mb, will increase into the 40-60 kt range on Thursday. 
The system on Thursday looks very similar to the one this past 
Saturday. The warm front struggles to move northwards into the area 
with colder air and high pressure to the east of the mountains. Due 
to this, not seeing much in the way of instability moving into the 
forecast area. The low-layer and deep-layer shear is more than 
sufficient for strong to severe storms but not expecting much 
without the warm sector moving in. For now, will not mention strong 
or severe storms in the HWO but could see it being added if forecast 
models shift the front further north. For now, the warm sector 
becomes pinched off just to the south of the area with rain and 
elevated thunderstorms. Rainfall amounts look to range from around 
0.75-1.5 inches which could contribute to some localized flooding 
issues in areas of poor drainage. 

There will be noticeably cooler air behind the front with decent 
cold air advection forecast Friday into Saturday. Drier weather 
will arrive Friday afternoon into Saturday. Highs on Friday will 
range be in the upper 50s to low 60s with lows Friday night into 
Saturday morning in the 30s. The weekend for now, looks sunny and 
cool with highs both day in the 50s.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Some weak short wave energy will 
slide by to our south today.  Will see quite a few high/mid clouds 
today, but lower levels will be rather dry and while expect to see 
significant radar returns do not expect much precipitation to reach 
the surface.  Will introduce slight chance PoPs to southern areas 
where best chance for some light rain to reach the surface exists. 
Clouds will decrease later today and tonight will be mostly clear 
overall with just some limited high clouds around. Temperatures will 
be fairly close to seasonal normals. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...High pressure at the 
surface and aloft will bring a quiet pattern to the forecast area 
Tuesday and Wednesday. Slowly warming temperatures Tuesday through
Thursday. Moisture increases Wednesday as strong system develops 
over the plains states. Showers will move in Wednesday night but 
strong southeast winds will keep most of the northeast part of the
area dry until Thursday morning. A wind advisory will likely be 
needed Wednesday night/Thursday morning for the eastern mountains 
and foothills. Instability ahead of the front will help develop 
Thunderstorms Thursday afternoon and evening. The front is 
expected to move through only very slowly Thursday night into 
Friday. Rainfall may also be heavy Thursday night across the 
southern third of the area. High pressure will build in Friday 
night and continue through the weekend with no rainfall. 
Temperatures cooler behind front Friday and then several degrees 
below normal on the weekend. Highs in the mid 40s to mid 50s and 
lows in the upper 20s and 30s.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

Low pressure system to the north will continue to track to the 
northeast with an associated pressure gradient that will influence 
the forecast area for a few hours into the afternoon. As the low 
continues to track to the northeast the pressure gradient will 
loosen by this evening leading to calmer winds overnight. Warm, dry 
air from the southwest will continue to move into the area from the 
southwest flow. An upper level ridge over the great plains will 
track eastward, keeping us under a dome of high pressure for the
next few days. A very slight chance of showers for the most 
southern counties of eastern Tennessee on Monday, but models 
indicate dry, low level air, so any chance of precipitation will 
be minimal.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...

Continued quiet weather pattern early in the extended with 
surface high to our north and zonal flow aloft transitioning to a 
ridge of high pressure. This will keep the area dry and 
temperatures near to slightly above normal levels through 
Wednesday. The main system of concern will approach the area 
Wednesday night as a round of showers move in in advance of a 
strong cold front. The main band of convection will push through 
Thursday/Thursday evening. Weak instability accompanying the front
will allow for the potential of a few thunderstorms embedded in 
the convection. Additionally...a strong 850MB jet will move 
through as well and will result in strong...gusty winds over the 
high elevations. The showers will linger into Friday as the front 
slowly exits the area. The associated upper low will rotate 
through to our north Friday night into Saturday. Wrap around 
moisture and lift from this feature will keep a few isolated 
showers over mainly northern locations and the higher eastern 
mountains. However...most should be dry by mid day Saturday and 
into Sunday as high pressure builds in behind the exiting system.

Mostly VFR conditions expected for the forecast period today. A
few higher winds early this afternoon from the tight pressure
gradient, but should calm by the evening as the northern low
pressure system moves out of the area. High level ceilings with a
scattered mid deck that will fill in after sunset tonight. Due to
both continued southwesterly flow and the overnight diurnal

.DISCUSSION...

A much warmer and drier air mass is moving into the forecast area
behind last nights frontal boundary. Strong southwesterly flow 
today will lead to much of the changing weather. Temperatures look
to be on track, if not a little bit warmer than previously 
thought, and the drier air will help to eliminate the lower level 
clouds. Some stronger winds for the valley are also expected later
this afternoon, with some areas seeing sustained wind speeds of 
about 10 mph for a few hours. TRI cities, while currently seeing
some lingering fog from this morning due to some light southerly
wind, will see the fog lift mid morning.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...The weak cold front moving 
through the region will exit our area to the east today.  May be a 
lingering shower early over eastern areas, but most areas will be 
dry for the entire short term period as surface high pressure to our 
northwest builds in.  The lower clouds will exit, but there will be 
an increase in high clouds during the period.  However, still should 
be considerable sunshine today with above normal temperatures.  The 
high wind warning will be allowed to expire as mountain wave 
enhancement is ending.   

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)... Quiet pattern to start 
extended forecast period with high pressure moving toward the 
Tennessee Valley and centered to the northwest Monday. Upper level
flow is zonal Monday then ridging aloft ahead of upper level low 
that spins off the southwest US coast brings warmer temperatures 
at mid week. The deep trough associated with this upper low moves 
into the south central states Wednesday. As the system deepens and
the parent deep surface low moves into the northern plains A warm
front is expected to develop across the eastern Tennessee Valley 
bringing up warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. A chance of 
thunderstorms Thursday and Thursday night ahead the cold front. 
Temperatures will be much above normal in the upper 60s to lower 
70s. Also a heavy rain threat Thursday night and early Friday 
ahead of the front. Friday and Saturday temperatures will be 
cooler with highs Saturday only in the upper 40s to lower 50s and 
a slight chance of showers.

.DISCUSSION...Quick update to replace wind advisory across a few
of the mountain zones with a high wind warning. Guidance continues
to suggest that the highest peaks will see gusts in the 60 to 65
mph range as a very strong 850mb jet will be in place this
evening. Also made some updates to hourly POPs to match up with
latest HRRR and RUC trends. Made some adjustments to hourly temps
as well, kept temperatures elevated longer overnight due to the
strong jet in place. Warmed temps along the foothills as current
obs are showing evidence of downsloping winds. GKT came in at 70
degrees with the 5 PM observation. Rest of the forecast still
looks on track. 

Instability gradient remains to our southwest, across northern
Alabama, so any storms approaching our area should weaken as they
draw closer. Having said that, shear is still quite impressive and
a few strong to possibly severe storms aren't out of the question
for areas such as Marion, Sequatchie, and Hamilton county as they
are the closest to the instability gradient. We have already
observed a few strong/severe storms approach the aforementioned
areas from out of the Huntsville area and weaken significantly by
the time they get to the TN/AL/GA line.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

A shallow layer of saturated air persists over much of the southern 
region of the forecast area with a dry layer aloft. This is keeping 
the low clouds in place as a wedge of cold air over the eastern 
mountains is preventing the warm front to our south from progressing 
northward. This is also leading to less isentropic lifting over the 
valley than originally thought so rain has been less prevalent 
today. With the cold front out to the west continuing to track 
eastward, a slightly more unstable airmass will move in later this 
afternoon to help lift the ceilings across much of the southern 
counties of the forecast area.

As the frontal boundary moves into eastern Tennessee, the winds will 
pick up a bit in the valley, while a decent downsloping event is 
expected for the Smokey mountains and eastern foothills. While not 
the traditional setup for this kind of event, models are indicating 
overnight wind gusts of up to 55 mph or more. Some areas of the 
Cumberland plateau could also see close to wind advisory criteria, 
although the high wind event will be mostly be restricted to the 
eastern mountains. With the onset of the front, some areas could see 
periods of heavy precipitation and the occasional thunderstorm is 
possible with local rain totals of up to an inch. Current CAPE 
values are too low for any severe thunderstorms and most of the 
severe weather should stay to the west of the Cumberland plateau. 
Temperatures tomorrow will be pleasant despite the passage of the 
cold front due to lack of any decent cold air advection and 
increased INSOLATION from the clearing skies.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

The extended will begin in a rather quiet and tranquil weather 
pattern. Surface high pressure tracking through and centered to 
our north will be the dominant weather feature. Flow aloft will 
begin fairly zonal and slowing shift towards a ridge. This will 
allow Sunday night through Tuesday to remain dry with seasonal to 
a bit above normal high temperatures. Wednesday will be a 
transition day with a warm front approaching the area. Associated 
light showers will move in Wednesday night as low level moisture 
increases and weak lift develops over the region. The cold front 
will push in on Thursday. This will bring of line of convection 
across the Southern Appalachian Region Thursday afternoon and 
evening. The air mass should become at least weakly unstable for a
chance of a few thunderstorms. The frontal boundary will continue
to affect local weather into Friday with continued scattered 
showers. As the system slowly pulls away from the area Friday 
night into Saturday...wrap around light precip could linger over 
far northern locations and over upslope areas of the east TN 
mountains.

.AVIATION...

While conditions have stubbornly remained IFR or LIFR for both 
CHA and TYS all morning, the fog is expected to lift over the next
few hours as the warm front to the south moves slightly more 
northward. Confidence is marginal as to the timing of the fog 
lifting, as it was originally thought it would have lifted over an
hour ago. A shallow layer of very saturated air is in place over 
both CHA and TYS with dry air aloft, which is keeping the moisture
locked in place.

With the incoming cold front to the west, we will move a slightly 
more unstable environment by this afternoon with showers moving in
for the early evening. Conditions are expected to become 
predominantly MVFR overnight with a few brief possible periods of 
IFR from any stronger showers on station. A few thunderstorms for 
both CHA and TYS are possible from the initial onset of the front,

are expected.

Another rainy day today with low ceilings and morning fog for some
areas. While the fog will lift later this morning, the low clouds
will remain in place for most of the day for the more southern and
central regions of the forecast area. Temperatures will rise
throughout the day from the warm air advection as the warm front
sitting to the south continues to progress northward. The
resulting southwesterly flow will bring increased moisture into
eastern Tennessee, with high resulting dewpoints than previously
forecasted. Winds for the valley will remain light and variable
for most of the day, with wind speeds picking up later this
afternoon and overnight. While not the perfect set up, some high
downsloping winds for the mountains and foothills in far eastern
Tennessee can be expected later today.

showers around today, especially southern half, but these should be 
isolated to scattered for the most part.  Later in the day showers 
can be expected to increase ahead of the cold front across western 
areas, with a band of convection moving across the entire area 
overnight.  Enough elevated instability is expected to keep thunder 
in the forecast this afternoon into tonight, although the convective 
energy will be limited. With the strong low level jet, will also 
need to keep the mention of a few strong to severe storms in the HWO 
although the overall threat of severe weather still looks limited. 
There also appears to be potential for some mountain wave 
enhancement to the wind in the usual spots along the usual higher 
elevation/foothills areas of the E TN mountains this afternoon into 
tonight.  While showing some potential, model soundings do not look 
ideal for mountain waves at the moment, so will just go with a wind 
advisory for now. However, minor changes in vertical profiles of 
temp/wind may lead to a need to upgrade at least parts of the wind 
advisory to a warning later. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)... A cold front will be 
moving through the extreme eastern and northeastern section of the
forecast area with showers bringing the last few hours of 
rainfall. The mild temperatures early Sunday...upper 40s to mid 
50s will give the area an early start to warmer temperatures. 
Clouds are expected to decrease rapidly and winds stay southwest 
until late in the day when they switch to the west then northwest 
at night. Bumped highs a couple more degrees up as guidance is 
showing upper 60s northeast to lower to mid 70s in the central and
southern valley. Highs may still be a little cool. Cold air 
advection with this high pressure area does not really affect 
temperatures until Sunday evening. High pressure centered in the 
Plains states will move over the Ohio and Tennessee valleys Sunday
night and continue over this region Monday and Tuesday. Skies 
will be mostly clear to partly cloudy. Lows early Monday through 
Wednesday will stay near normal in the 30s to mid 40s. Highs will 
also stay near to slightly above normal as the upper flow is zonal
for the Monday to tuesday time frame and then slight ridging 
Wednesday. Another strong system develops over the Plains states 
similar to the system departing early Sunday on Wednesday. Winds 
shift to the south and southeast then increase ahead of this 
system. Another couple inches of rain is possible with a chance 
for thunderstorms Thursday and Thursday night. Much warmer lows 
Thursday and Friday with clouds and rain and continued mild highs 
mostly in the 60s.

.DISCUSSION...Very little change to the current forecast. E-W
stationary boundary still just south of the forecast area and
remains the area of focus for more moderate showers and a few 
storms. Lighter showers continue northward of the boundary across 
much of the forecast area. These lighter showers are associated 
with the weaker isentropic lift. Still believe coverage will 
decrease over night but light scattered showers will remain, 
especially along and south of I-40. Biggest change to forecast was
to add in areas of fog through the rest of the night and into 
tomorrow morning as many obervation sites across the forecast 
area continue to report fog. All other forecast elements look 
good. Will send out new zones for fog wording.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday Night)...

Numerous showers across the southern Appalchians early this 
afternoon with an E-W stationary surface boundary located just to 
the south of the area. In the upper levels, there is a weak trough 
and jet streak moving through the Appalachians currently with a more 
amplified ridge back to the west stretching from the Lower 
Mississippi River Valley northwards into the western Great Lakes. 
Models also indicate a slight surge in the low level jet across the 
area currently with 850 mb winds around 30-35 kts. Low level 
isentropic lift to the north of the boundary is also adding to the 
lift to produce numerous showers across the region. Also have the 
chance for a few rumbles of thunder this afternoon for the southern 
tier of counties or so with MUCAPE values around 250-500 J/Kg. 
Temperatures have slowly warmed today with the blanket of cloud 
cover but with the warm advection, highs are expected to range from 
the low 40s to low 50s later this afternoon. 

For tonight, the axis of rainfall shifts further to the south and 
expect best chances will be south of I-40 closer to the surface 
boundary. Low level isentropic ascent will persist but as the trough 
and jet exit to the east, model soundings indicate that the upper 
level and mid-levels begin to dry out. Expect coverage will begin to 
decrease overnight but with the saturation in low levels have added 
fog and drizzle to the forecast. The upper level ridge will move in 
overnight also leading to lower precip chances with higher heights 
aloft. Temperatures will begin to warm late tonight into early 
Saturday as the upper level ridge axis moves to the east of the area 
and the front lifts northwards. Low temperatures will range from the 
upper 30s to upper 40s. 

On Saturday, a negatively tilted upper level trough moves into the 
Mid-Mississippi River Valley. Southwesterly flow will increase ahead 
of this approaching system as moisture advects northward with PW 
values climbing into the 1.0-1.3 inch range. The best lift and 
moisture looks to arrive later in the day and have cut back PoPs a 
good bit Saturday morning. Surface high pressure to the northeast 
will lead to a wedge on the eastern side of the mountains. This 
wedge will hinder the warm fronts progression to the north and east. 
The evolution of the warm sector will be key to if any strong to 
severe storms develop across the area. Some of the models indicate 
that the warm sector moves into the area late in the afternoon with 
maybe a few strong to marginally severe storms possible late 
tomorrow afternoon into the evening hours. Other models want to keep 
this boundary along and just to the south of the area and pinch off 
the warm sector as the cold front moves in from the west. In this 
scenario, would not expect much in the way of strong to severe 
storms. The timing of the frontal passage is also not overly 
favorable for strong to severe storms. For now, will keep the 
mention in the HWO but regardless, it looks like a low end threat. 
Storm total rainfall amounts will not be too high only around half 
an inch to one and half inches. These values are fairly low but with 
the record rainfall in February, there could be a few areas of 
localized flooding, especially in areas of poor drainage. 

Southerly winds will increase ahead of the approaching system late 
Saturday into Sunday morning and have issued a High Wind Watch for 
the Smoky Mountain. The setup favors a mountain wave type event with 
strong winds across the higher elevations and foothills. May need to 
extend or upgrade the watch during later forecast issuances. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...

A few showers will linger over the area...especially over eastern
locations...Saturday evening as an ongoing weather system pulls 
out of the area. Surface high pressure builds in on Sunday with 
zonal flow aloft slowly moving into weak ridging early into the 
work week. This will result in a fairly quiet weather pattern with
dry conditions and seasonal to warm temperatures Sunday through 
Tuesday. A warm front will lift through the area on Wednesday. The
main lift and moisture with this feature should stay to our west 
but expect enough over the area for at least isolated showers. The
associated cold front will move in around the Thursday/Friday 
time frame...and bring in our best chance of showers and even a 
few thunderstorms for the extended period.

.DISCUSSION...

Widespread precipitation across the southern Appalachians with a
E-W stationary boundary located just to the south of the forecast
area. Warm air advection and isentropic ascent are leading to the
lift bringing in the precipitation to the region. There is a
winter weather advisory for portions of southwest Virginia and
extreme northeast Tennessee. Temperatures in the advisory area are
warming above freezing with Wise, VA up to 36 degrees at last 
hour reporting light snow. The 12z upper air sounding at KOHX had 
a 850mb temperature of 5 degrees with a westerly winds of around 
35-40 kts. Therefore, expect temperatures in the low levels will 
continue to warm throughout the morning with all liquid 
precipitation by Noon. The temperatures at NewFound Gap is still 
below freezing and did increase snowfall amounts slightly there to
around an inch. Regardless, the strong warm advection will win 
out today and impacts should be minimal. Under a solid blanket of
cloud cover and widespread precipitation, highs will range from 
the low 40s to low 50s. Precipitation amounts today will average 
around half an inch but could be as highs as an inch for the 
southern tier of counties. Model soundings indicate some decent 
lapse rates above the frontal inversion for southern portions of 
the area. MUCAPE near Chattanooga is around 250-500 J/Kg and 
expect there could a few rumbles of thunder and will add this to 
the forecast as well.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...A warm frontal boundary to our 
south will move slowly north as some weak short wave energy 
traverses the area today.  We will see precipitation across the 
area, and the bulk of it will be rain.  The difficult part of the 
forecast is precip type across northern areas and some of the higher 
peaks of the Smoky Mtns.  Will see some sleet mixing in at the onset 
even into parts of the central valley as moistening brings temps 
aloft down closer to the wet bulb temp, but expect that to be brief. 
Further north and in some of the higher peaks, expect some snow at 
the onset which should gradually mix with and chance to sleet/rain 
before changing to all rain.  Some light snow accumulations can be 
expected mainly across parts of SW VA and parts of the NE TN 
mountains.  Will include a short Winter Weather Advisory for those 
areas for the morning hours for up to two inches, with the higher 
amounts mainly in the higher elevations. Some light rain/drizzle 
will linger across the area tonight, especially southern areas. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)... A wet day Saturday 
over the weekend as a warm front lifts northward from Georgia and 
a deepening low pressure area over Kansas moves northeast into the
Great Lakes states Saturday night while dragging a cold front 
through the eastern Tennessee Valley. Expect much warmer 
temperatures Saturday with warm front and strong southwest winds 
ahead of the front. Highs will be spring-like mostly 60s and could
even reach near 70 extreme southern valley. Lift and instability 
increase dramatically during the day Saturday. However the 
shortwave ahead of the front and strong mid level flow shifts to 
the north away from the low level moisture in the southeast per 
Day 2 SPC outlook. Strong to severe thunderstorms that develop to 
the west in Middle Tennessee will be on the decrease during the 
evening but still could produce isolated damage over southeast 
Tennessee and the Cumberland Plateau. Locally heavy rainfall ahead
of the front could produce a brief period of localized flooding. 
The warm southwest flow will keep lows in the mild mid 40s to mid 
50s. With the front east of the region Sunday and colder air 
lagging several hours behind the front highs will be several 
degrees warmer Sunday, in the mid 60s to near 70. High pressure 
settling over the forecast area Sunday and cold upper level low, 
then trough over northeast Canada will allow mild and dry 
temperatures to continue Monday and Tuesday. Upper level ridging 
over the southeast states is helped by closed upper level low that
moves into Southern California and northern Mexico Monday. 
Tuesday night the upper level ridging begins to shift east. This 
new system in California moves into the southern Rockies Tuesday 
and then central Plains states Wednesday becomes quite wound up. 
Another threat for showers and storms will be possible Wednesday 
night into Thursday as a cold front moves through.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast mostly on track with a few minor adjustments
made. We've had light radar returns over the area for the past 
several hours but still nothing reaching the ground as the airmass
in the lowest levels is still very dry. Light precip in the form 
of rain/snow will begin first up across southwest Virginia and 
extreme northeast TN. This is because the airmass is a bit more 
saturated up that way due to the colder temperatures. Elsewhere, 
dewpoints still in the upper teens to lower 20s with temps in the 
low to mid 40s so it will be a while before precip reaches the 
ground. 

The current special weather statement still looks good as light 
snow is still expected later tonight across some of our northern 
areas, once the airmass further moistens. Impacts still expected 
to be minimal due to the short window of time that the snowfall is
expected to occur in, along with the light QPF. 

Other updates were to tweak hourly temps and dewpoints. Also made
some minor changes to POPs to match up with latest HRRR and RUC
which show the better chances of precip not occurring until 
between 09z and 12z. Will send out new zones.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...

The strong jet to our north, in combination with an upper level 
ridge currently developing over the Rockies, will help to displace 
the dome of high pressure to the southeast. Clouds will continue to 
build and lower out in front of an approaching front that will bring 
another rain event to the area late Thursday night and continue into 
Friday. Overnight lows will drop below freezing again for some of 
the more northern areas of the region as well as areas of higher 
elevation. Strong southwesterly flow resulting from the frontal 
boundary will advect into the region bringing warmer temperatures 
and help to saturate the low level dry air. Some areas of 
northeastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia could see some snow 
early Friday morning, but with the combination of rising 
temperatures and ongoing rain any accumulation will be minimal. Rain 
totals for Friday are expected to be around a quarter inch for the 
northern half of the forecast area, and just over half an inch for 
the southern half.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...

The tail end of a departing short wave may keep a few showers 
going across the forecast area Friday night, with decreasing 
probability from north to south, as the associated front shifts 
southeast into The Carolinas and Georgia. However, the chance for 
showers will be increasing again through the day Saturday, with 
the greatest chance Saturday night when enough instability and 
synoptic scale lift will be present for the possibility of some 
thunderstorms. At this point, instability is not impressive and 
the threat for any severe thunderstorm development remains low. 
There still may be a few storms that could utilize expected strong
gradient winds in association with the approaching system. It 
appears that the cold front moves through the forecast area ending
the rain by daybreak Sunday. Another nice period of ridging 
allows for a couple days of dry weather Monday and Tuesday. More 
Spring showers and even a thunderstorm or two will be back in the 
forecast with increasing probability Wednesday into Thursday, when
another strong frontal system is expected to move across the 
Southern Appalachian region. The weekend will be relatively mild, 
but colder air will build back into the area on Monday and 
Tuesday, followed by a nice warming southerly flow as the next 
storm system approaches.

predicted for this morning, but the rest of the day still look to
be on track if not a degree or two warmer. Also increased the 
dewpoints by a few degrees to better align with the obs, as it 
looks like the air will become more saturated than previously 
thought. Some warm moist southwesterly flow will be advecting 
into the region later today as a result from an upper level ridge
located over the southern Great Plains that is progressing 
eastward. One notable observation this morning are some echo
returns located over southwestern Virginia although no precip is
expected due to fairly dry air in the lower levels. Expect clouds
to continue building through the afternoon as a weak cold front
brings rain to the region tonight.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Friday)...
Another cold morning today across the southern Appalachians and
east Tennessee Valley. Temperatures are in the lower 20s to around
30 across the region. Some high and mid level clouds are spreading
over the area from the northwest early this morning. Surface high
pressure now overhead shifts to the east coast by this evening. 
The cloud cover will gradually thicken and lower as a weak cold 
front approaches late today. Rain will develop late tonight along 
the front with temperatures slowly warming. A little light 
freezing or frozen precipitation possible late tonight before 
temperatures warm above freezing. Friday temperatures should be 
close to todays lower 40s across the higher elevations ...but up 
to lower 50s lower elevations. Rainfall Friday should average 
about 0.5 to 1 inch with the heaviest in southeast Tennessee.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
On Friday night the region will lie beneath low amplitude 
cyclonic upper flow, with increasing heights just to our west in 
response to a strong system ejecting from the southern Rockies 
into the plains. Surface features across the eastern US during 
this time will include the center of a roughly 1030mb sfc high 
pressure center exiting the Atlantic coastline somewhere between 
DC and New York, as well as a quasi stationary frontal boundary 
anchored along the leading edge of a wedge front near the southern
end of the Appalachians, likely immediately south of our forecast
area. Despite the relative increase in upper heights nearby, low 
and mid level isentropic ascent across the previously mentioned 
boundary will be in place locally, with fairly high chances for 
widespread rain south of the I-40 corridor where upglide will be 
maximized. Expect a few rumbles of thunder to occur through the 
late Friday evening time frame as well, as model soundings show 
some meager elevated instability. How far north the rain will make
it/linger during the overnight hours Friday night into Saturday 
morning is somewhat uncertain since lift is maximized near the 
Georgia border. Have PoPs generally decreasing across the northern
tier counties to account for this, but will leave in some 20-30 
PoPs overnight into Saturday morning since guidance doesn't signal
a slam dunk dry period up there.

On Saturday the strong southern Rockies disturbance ejects into the 
central to southern plains. Associated cyclogenesis will take place 
over the central plains, with a deepening surface low rapidly 
shifting from central Kansas around daybreak Saturday to the Great 
Lakes region by Sunday morning. Locally the aforementioned 
stationary boundary to our south will be pulled north during the 
afternoon and evening hours. Widespread showers will develop along 
this boundary as it shifts north during the day Saturday but the 
best rain chances will be Saturday evening/night as the cold front 
approaches from the west. The question remains, what if any severe 
threat will exist in our CWA. Instability and diurnal trends look to 
be the limiting factors for any severe threat locally. That being 
said, there is plenty of shear to work with. Should instability be 
stronger than forecast, I could easily see a scenario where storms 
area able to bring to the surface some strong winds aloft. Forecast 
soundings for Chattanooga show 55-60kt within 3k ft AGL by midnight 
Saturday night for instance. The main area of concern would be the 
southern plateau and TN valley areas. There are still some details, 
most notably timing and what the effects of/how widespread daytime 
convection will be, to iron out before getting overly excited about 
any severe storms in eastern TN. One last thing to mention about Sat 
night and early Sun morning would be winds at higher elevations. 
Guidance is insistent on strong low level winds during that time 
frame. Cross-barrier flow no longer looks ideal for mountain wave 
activity, but gusts at higher elevations could easily rise into the 
50-60 mph range. 

Moving on, Sunday looks to be a nice day. We should see the cold 
front push east of the mountains by daybreak or shortly thereafter. 
Some lingering showers may still be present in the southern TN 
mountains or western NC counties. But much of the area looks to be 
dry. Not only will it be dry, but the influx of dry air will lead to 
a substantial mixed layer on Sunday. That and the lack of strong 
cold air advection should allow the forecast area to warm well into 
the 60s. 

For Sunday night onward confidence is low. Models diverge quickly 
after Sunday morning with respect to the evolution of the upper 
level pattern. Indications are that Monday and Tuesday will be dry, 
and do have some chance PoPs to wind out the period on Wednesday. 
But overall confidence is rather low on how things will unfold.

.DISCUSSION...
Observations show a mostly clear sky and light winds as high
pressure centers over the region tonight. This will bring another
night of very cold temperatures with lows in the 20s for most
locations. High pressure shifts eastward on Thursday with 
southerly flow returning. This will result in some isentropic lift
near 600 to 700 mb Thursday afternoon with some additional mid to
high level clouds. With dry air through the boundary layer, we 
remain dry until Friday. Forecast is on track with no major
updates planned.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Quite weather will continue today as mid level northwest flow and
surface ridging combine to keep temperatures below normal. One
more night of sub freezing temperatures across the area tonight
with lows expected to dip into the 20's and the teens in the
higher elevation. Increasing moisture from the northwest will
begin to move in overnight into tomorrow causing an increase in
cloud coverage. Most locations will remain mostly sunny tomorrow,
but clouds could limit overnight lows and highs tomorrow
afternoon.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
The start of the long term period will see zonal upper level flow
across most of the eastern United States, with a weak disturbance
across the northern plains, and midwest. Further upstream, weak 
ridging is forecast across the Rockies. The weak disturbance 
should induce weak lee cyclogenesis east of the Rockies with an 
area of low pressure moving across the south and central plains 
Friday. This will strengthen southerly flow and warm air 
advection. As a result of weak overrunning, showers are likely to 
develop along the low level front. Some of the initial 
precipitation could fall in the form of rain/snow or sleet before 
the low levels warm above freezing. Sufficient moisture in the 
column as indicated by pwats upwards of 1.2 to 1.3 inches, along 
with deep layer theta-e advection will allow for periods of 
precipitation, with some heavy at times. The limiting factor will 
be the lower freezing level heights, which could limit warm rain 
processes. 

The lifting warm front will set up a warm sector air mass across the 
forecast area Saturday evening as upper level heights respond to 
deepening of a trough across the west.  As a result, better 
amplification of upper level heights will bring upper level ridging 
on Friday night and Saturday morning.  However, continuing 
isentropic ascent with reduced condensation pressure deficits should 
at least be sufficient for scattered showers across the area 
saturday morning.  The lead shortwave will begin to deepen and take 
on a negative tilt Saturday morning with strong cyclogenesis taking 
place lee of the Rockies.  This results in increased amplification 
and southerly flow.  The surface low deepens as it progresses 
through the midwest indicative of the strength of thermal advection. 
 A cold front associated with this low will move through the 
Midsouth as early as Saturday afternoon and reach the MRX CWA late 
Saturday night.  Precipitation is expected along this front with 
thunderstorms a good possibility at this time.  Severe weather 
potential is to low to mention at this time.  This mornings guidance 
really shunts the better instability further south as a result of 
the occlusion process, and timing of the front.  However, deep layer 
lift will be quite strong across most of the area which should 
result in at least elevated thunderstorms.  The degree of moisture 
and deep layer ascent should also present chances of heavy rainfall 
as well.  Will highlight these in the HWO, but changes to this period 
of the forecast are possible as conditions further west will have 
large implications on the forecast across this area.  

Another hazard to mention is higher winds across the higher 
elevations.  This will result from a strong low level jet nearing 60 
knots.  There are some model disagreements in wind direction, which 
is common this far out.  The GFS has a better southerly flow 
component with the EURO showing a more parallel mountain flow.  Not 
too confident on mountain waves, however it seems reasonable that 
strong winds could be found across the higher elevations.  This will 
also be highlighted in the HWO. Precipitation will begin to exit the 
area Sunday with a much drier airmass moving in.  Surface high 
pressure drops south into the Great Lakes and Ohio valley Sunday 
into Tuesday with high amplification in upper level heights with 
riding across the east, and deep layer troughing across the west. 
This will result in a much drier air mass. Wednesday, continued 
amplified upper flow could lead to a large disturbance beginning to 
impact the region. For now too many synoptic scale differences exist 
to have much confidence on any one solution.  For now will leave 
chance PoPs in the forecast.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
In the near term, an area of scattered snow showers/flurries is
moving across Wise, Lee, and Russell counties of southwest
Virginia. This area of snow is poorly handled by models, but is
due to relatively steep low-level lapse rates (low level
instability) and boundary layer moisture. Snow accumulations of
1/2 to 1 inch are possible, especially across High Knob. Have
issued a SPS to account for expected impacts of snow/ice covered
roadways. This area of snow will move east of the area soon after
daybreak.

Wind chills of 0 to -10 will continue over the higher terrain of
the far east Tennessee Mountains. Will continue advisory through
mid-morning.

For the remainder of Today and Tonight, dry northwest/west flow
and surface ridging will be the main weather features. Dry and
unseasonably cold conditions will remain. Very dry afternoon
relative humdity can be anticipated today and Thursday.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...
Dry conditions will be seen on Thursday as the region lies beneath 
zonal upper flow aloft, weak ridging in the mid levels, and a dry 
high pressure center at the surface. Temperatures will remain below 
normal on Thursday as well thanks largely to another cold night to 
round out the short term period. With only a modest increase in 
cloud cover during the day Thursday, and substantial dry air in 
place, we should drop back down into the 30s most everywhere 
Thursday night. Meanwhile a disturbance will be approaching from the 
west late Thursday night into Friday morning. Model soundings show 
sufficient moistening to support precipitation reaching the ground 
by a few hours after midnight Thu. They also show wetbulb zero 
heights near the surface for a few hours after precip onset, 
suggesting that at least some degree of mixed precip will be seen. 
Will continue to show just a mix of rain/snow for late Thu night 
through around daybreak Fri. Some sleet or freezing rain could occur 
too, but given the uncertainties with whether precipitation will 
arrive soon enough to take advantage of the colder temperatures, and 
the subsequent duration of any mixed precipitation, decided to keep 
it simple. Additionally, it is unlikely any notable accumulations 
will occur so impacts should be minimal in that regard.

Temps rise above freezing quickly on Friday ending any talk of 
frozen precip. Rain also expands on Friday morning, with a chance of 
thunder entering the forecast by mid morning as ascent across a warm 
frontal boundary in the region is enough for parcels to take 
advantage of elevated instability. Per model soundings any thunder 
should mostly be confined to the first half of the day, as PoPs and 
elevated instability both decrease in the afternoon and evening 
hours. Though on a downward trend, do have some PoPs continuing 
during the overnight hours Friday night (mainly in the south). Would 
not be surprised to see a distinct lack of rainfall though as upper 
heights build overhead in response to the strong system entering the 
plains on Saturday. 

A negatively tilted upper trough will shift across the southern 
plains and into the Ozarks during the day Saturday. Convection will 
develop ahead of the associated cold front as it shifts east across 
the southern states during the afternoon and evening hours. Expect 
storms to move in from the west during the evening hours. Low level 
jet influence could provide some degree of downslope winds ahead of 
the convection Saturday evening, though directionally speaking 
conditions won't be ideal. However the combination of strong winds 
at ridge top levels, strong gradient flow across the region, and 
convective mixing with storms, will likely produce windy conditions 
across the CWA Saturday evening and Saturday night. As far as severe 
chances go locally, details are a bit uncertain at this time. There 
appears to be at least a mentionable chance of damaging winds if for 
nothing else than some storms being able to mix down very strong low 
level winds. But beyond that it is difficult to say at this time.

Dry weather with very warm temperatures, highs approaching 70 in 
some cases, will round out the weekend, followed by a return to more 
normal temperatures by Monday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...
An amplified upper trough highlights the synoptic pattern across the 
East/Central CONUS this afternoon, while a shortwave impulse moves 
through the mean flow aloft.  High pressure at the surface continues 
to reinforce cool/dry conditions favoring RH in the 20s/30s. Winds 
remain slightly elevated as well given enhanced PGFs across the 
region. Should be a fairly quiet short term period outside of a few 
minor things.  Am expecting the aforementioned shortwave to cross 
the Central Appalachians tonight bringing along enough moisture to 
increase low/mid clouds, and perhaps a few flurries across the 
higher elevations of TN/VA. Likewise, winds will remain gusty at 
these same higher elevations, which combined with temperatures in 
the teens and single digits will yield wind chill values in the 0 to 
minus 15 range.  Thus the current wind chill advisory will remain as 
is. Otherwise, not much change for Wednesday as the overall pattern 
remains intact.  However, the surface ridge center does look to 
advect eastward to some degree favoring weaker PGFs and thus weaker 
winds.  Temperatures will remain nearly 20 degrees below normal 
amidst sunny skies.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
Have noticed the models struggling a bit with frontal 
positioning, timing, strength, and location of greatest lift 
during the past seven to ten days as the winter season continues 
to battle with the slowly emerging spring season. Therefore, 
forecast certainty will be a little diminished; mainly later in 
the period. Initially, dry advection and short wave ridging should
be able to hold off any inclement weather for one more day prior 
to the first late week system. This feature will be a rather weak 
and moisture starved upper level wave that will bring a few light 
showers to the region later Thursday night into Friday. There may 
be a few light snow showers mainly in the mountains across 
Southwest Virginia and along much of the Tennessee and North 
Carolina border. Details in terms of how fast warm air advection 
builds in ahead of the Friday feature are limited at this time, 
but as warm and moist air builds in over the top of the below 
freezing near surface air mass, there may be enough moisture for 
the production of around half an inch to possibly one inch of snow
in the highest peaks. The warmer air advances into the region 
quickly Friday morning changing this precipitation into light 
rain. There should be a break in the action Friday night into 
Saturday morning however, a stronger system is expected to build 
into the region later in the day Saturday through Sunday morning. 
The best chance of rain appears to be Saturday evening when there 
may be enough instability for the possibility of the development 
of thunderstorms ahead of the system cold front. The front clears 
the region with drier air moving in from west to east during the 
day Sunday. As previously stated, model uncertainty is at its 
highest in these last couple days of the forecast. Therefore, kept
Monday and Tuesday dry and uneventful while awaiting the possible
arrival of the next upper level wave. Temperatures start off a 
little chilly to start the extended period with highs only in the 
40s and 50s followed by a milder weekend and beginning to the work
week featuring highs in the 50s and 60s.

335 AM EST Tue Mar 5 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Main concern for the short-
term is the very cold wind chills for tonight and Wednesday
morning. Tightening pressure gradients will produce breezy
westerly winds this afternoon into the night. Wind chills between
5 and 15 below zero are expected for the far east Tennessee
Mountains where a wind chill advisory has been issued.

Dry west/northwest flow aloft and ridge of high pressure
continuing to build into the Tennessee Valley and southern
Appalachians will be the main weather features. Currently a weak
system is pulling some high/mid level clouds across the area. This
area of clouds will move east of the region soon after daybreak.

For tonight, a short-wave will move into the east Great
Lakes/central Appalachians. Some cloud cover from this wave will
move into the southwest Virginia, but dry conditions will prevail.
Again, main concern will be tightening pressure gradients,
especially over the mountains, where dangerous wind chills are
expected.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...
The upper level pattern during the long term will start off 
highly amplified, with a large upper trough shifting east off the 
eastern seaboard and ridging over the Rockies. Upper flow will 
become more zonal Wednesday night into Thursday as a shortwave 
trough comes ashore over northern California and helps to knock 
down the ridge over the Rockies. Upper flow becomes highly 
amplified again on Friday as another, significantly stronger 
trough comes ashore over southern California. This system will 
eventually eject into the plains Saturday, bringing the potential 
for severe weather to the mid and lower Mississippi River Valley. 
It could even bring some storms to the Tennessee River Valley late
Saturday night depending on which model you believe, but more on 
that later.

Wednesday will be dry, with below normal temperatures as surface 
high pressure is anchored over the lower Miss River Valley. 
Northerly flow should hold temperatures somewhere between 15 to 20 
degrees below normal. Surface high pressure will shift east across 
the area on Thursday, and finally off the coast of the Carolinas by 
Thursday afternoon evening. The aforementioned NorCal trough will 
lead to cyclogenesis over the southern plains Thursday into Friday, 
with a stationary or warm frontal boundary extending to the east 
across northern Miss and Alabama. While much of Thursday will also 
be dry, temperatures will be a tad warmer with southerly flow 
beginning to impinge on the CWA thanks to the surface high shifting 
off the southeast coast. Isentropic lift associated with this trough 
will move east across the CWA late Thursday, and may result in some 
light precipitation Thursday night into Friday. Given the dry air in 
place and sufficiently cold temperatures, it seems very plausible 
that some mixed precipitation types will show up Thursday night into 
Friday morning. Left it with a rain/snow mix for the time being. 
Timing differences in the onset of precipitation, differences in low 
level thermal profiles, and the possibility of a non-diurnal 
temperature curve (temperatures warming during the night due to 
strengthening southerly flow in this case), preclude getting too 
fancy with Ptypes at this time. In any case, no accumulations would 
be expected, and temperatures will quickly warm above freezing 
Friday morning, so impacts would be minimal if at all.

A lull in precip is likely to be seen late Friday into Saturday as 
upper ridging develops over the Ohio and Tenn River Valleys in 
response to the SoCal trough ejecting into the southern plains. 
Temperatures will warm significantly however as southerly flow 
strengthens in advance of this approaching trough. Expect near to 
slightly above normal temperatures by Saturday. 

Saturday night is where things potentially get interesting. Ahead of 
this SoCal trough, a strong low level jet will be seen across the 
southern Appalachians. Cross-Appalachian flow isn't, directionally 
speaking, as ideal as you would want to see for strong downsloping 
winds. However, given how strong this LLJ will be, and the fact that 
there will be a period of decent SSE winds over the mountains, 
expect there will be some good mountain wave activity ahead of any 
incoming storms, even with the slower ECMWF timing. Speaking of 
storms, chances for severe storms will largely depend on the timing. 
The ECMWF is a bit weaker and slower with the overall progression of 
the upper trough. The GFS is predictably stronger/faster. If the 
timing is quicker like the GFS insists on, then some strong to 
possibly severe storms could make it into the southern valley by 
around midnight Saturday night. That is an unfavorable time for 
surface based severe storms, so even in the case of the aggressive 
GFS, the likelihood of severe weather is uncertain. But it bares 
watching as there is a decent signal for strong storms present in 
the GFS. The ECMWF is slower and weaker. It still would favor 
thunderstorms in the forecast Saturday night but not of the 
strong/severe variety. Again, plenty of time for details to change 
but it's worth monitoring at this time.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
The upper pattern this afternoon is highlighted by broad/deep 
troughing across the central/eastern CONUS, while another upper 
low/trough moves onshore out of the Pacific.  At the surface, 
cold/dry high pressure continues to prevail, centered over the 
Southern Plains albeit stretching eastward into the TN Valley and 
Southern Appalachians.  With that, WNW flow prevails over much of 
the fcst area today, with moisture trapped in the llvs beneath a 
capping inversion.  Profiles favor continuation of said inversion 
through the period, albeit with llv drying amidst caa.  Therefore am 
expecting skies to slowly sct later this afternoon and through 
tonight leading into a mostly sunny Tuesday.  As the aforementioned 
ridge center shifts east into Tuesday, PGFs will amplify across the 
region leading to increased WNW flow.  Gusts in the 15-20mph range 
will be possible across the lower terrain, nearly 30mph across the 
higher peaks and ridges of the Southern Appalachians.  Temperatures 
Tuesday morning will fall into the 20s (teens at the higher 
elevations) regionwide, which combined with gradually increasing 
winds could yield some bitter windchills at the higher elevations 
before diurnal warming prevails.  Highs on Tuesday will top out in 
the upper 30s to lower 40s in the valley with 20s to lower 30s 
across the higher terrain.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Sunday)...
A slight warming will begin on Wednesday as we come under the 
influence of a trough building in from the west. Overnight lows will 
still be very cold and a moderate increase in winds Tuesday night 
into Wednesday morning will lead to some frigid wind chill values. 
Wind chill values will dip into the teens or single digits for a 
short while early Tuesday morning. Anyone unfortunate enough to be 
at the in the highest elevations of the Southern Appalachian 
Mountains may see negative wind chill values. 

A shortwave is then forecasted to zip across the Northern Ohio 
Valley towards the end of the work week. After the shortwave moves 
through over the weekend a cold front will sweep through Sunday into 
Monday. Still some discrepancies on the timing of these systems, 
which will impact the wintery weather we may experience, but all 
models agree that these systems will be mostly rain across the area. 
Precipitation will move into the Valley Thursday into Friday and 
precipitation chances will continue over the weekend. Overnight lows 
will likely remain above freezing for most locations over the 
weekend, but the higher elevations and Northern Tennessee Valley may 
see some switchover to snowfall during the early morning hours over 
the weekend. Behind the cold front Sunday into Monday we may get 
wrap around moisture that's cold enough to bring more widespread 
snow. 

Current forecast models indicate we may see around 1-2 inches of 
rainfall over the end of the week and through the weekend. An axis 
of heavier precipitation is forecasted to occur over Western/Middle 
Tennessee so if the track of these systems shifts this heavier band 
may shift as well. Confidence in rainfall amounts is still somewhat 
low at this time, but it's possible that this system could re-
aggravate flooding in areas that were hit hard last week.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Main concern for the very
short-term is left over orographic lift producing light snow
showers over the eastern Tennessee Mountains and Foothills and
higher elevations of southwest Virginia. Snow accumulations of 1
inch or so is expected across the highest elevations.

Otherwise, main question for today is how fast cold air/wrap-
around low clouds will erode over the area. Model soundings show a
slow erosion as dry air advects into the southern Appalachians.
Some scattered to broken mid-level clouds this evening, then
clearing overnight.

Unseasonably cold air continues the concern of patchy black ice
issues this morning and especially for tonight. Water across
roadways will likely freeze overnight tonight producing slick
spots.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Saturday)...The first part of the 
extended will remain in a rather quite weather pattern with 
surface high pressure building in and a broad upper trough 
positioned over the eastern U.S. This pattern will result in dry 
but cold conditions through Wednesday night. Overnight lows 
through Wednesday night are expected to drop into the teens and 
20s. Some higher elevations could see single digits and wind 
chills could fall to the zero to minus 10 degree range. 
Additionally...these cold temperatures combined with continued 
high water and ponding on area roadways may cause freezing or 
patchy black ice development on some roads. Afternoon highs 
through the period should average in the 30s to low 40s for most 
valley locations. By Thursday...winds will shift more southerly as
the next weather system approaches. The south winds will bring in
warmer air and allow temperatures to moderate and slowly warm for
the end of the week. The first system of concern through the 
extended will move in late Thursday/Thursday night with widespread
showers expected to push through on Friday. Then...a second 
system will quickly move in as the first exits and bring another 
round of showers to the area for the weekend. With these last 
couple of systems...temperatures indicate that during overnight 
hours...expect a mix of rain and snow over northern locations and 
across the higher elevations. This snow should transition to rain 
during the warmer daytime periods.

.DISCUSSION...Much of the rain has exited, leaving some patches of
light rain and snow. Current forecast generally has a decent
handle on this, so will only tweak PoPs to trend things down a bit
quicker in the west. Will also lower temps slightly and make some
other minor adjustments for tonight. Biggest concern continues to
be the possibility of patches of black ice, so will continue the

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

The upper level pattern consists of deep cyclonic flow with 
embedded shortwaves. One subtle shortwave embedded in this 
cyclonic flow aloft will traverse the Tennessee valley overnight.
Upper level divergence aloft continues to allow for low level 
pressure falls across the southeast with an area of low pressure 
analyzed across central Alabama moving northeast into central 
Georgia. Currently, area radar depicts a large shield of moderate 
to heavy rainfall across the entire CWA. This rainfall can be 
attributed to the increasing synoptic scale dynamics aloft 
associated with DPVA, and increasing 300mb diffluent flow aloft. 
This area of rain will continue to move eastward overnight with 
decreasing chance of PoPs after 00Z. Mid level flow shifts toward 
the northwest tonight which should support terrain enhanced 
precipitation across the higher terrain in the Smoky Mountains, 
and southern Appalachians. Increasing cold air advection will 
quickly advect much colder air into the region behind the low 
level frontal zone likely changing residual rain to snow. While 
some light flurries are possible late tonight across the central 
valley, the better chance will be in the higher terrain. Not 
expecting any accumulations of snow with the exception of the 
highest terrain with around half inch of snow possible. Monday 
will see mostly cloudy skies across the area with residual 
moisture underneath a strong subsidence inversion aloft. 
Temperatures should be cooler with highs only in the upper 30’s 
to low 40’s. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...

Broad troughing for most of this work week will lead to below normal 
temperatures, but no precipitation is expected until Thursday. 
Overnight lows Mon/Tue/Wed nights will drop well below freezing 
which may cause lingering water over low lying roadways to 
potentially re-freeze leading to black ice. Otherwise benign weather 
is expected until a shortwave will zip through north of the area and 
bring a round of showers/thunderstorms and possibly winter weather 
to the higher elevations. There is still major differences in the 
timing of the arrival of this system and the associated 
precipitation between the GFS and ECMWF. Will continue with broad 
precipitation chances at the end of the week and into the weekend 
with a slight favorability towards the ECMWF. Hopefully in later 
forecasts we're able to shave down the timing of the 
arrival/departure of the precipitation.

TAFs will continue to see deteriorating conditions this afternoon
as a large area of moderate to heavy rain moves out of northern 
Alabama. CHA has been consistently in IFR through most of the late
morning and should continue to see IFR through 23Z before 
prevailing MVFR conditions develop. TYS has been bouncing around 
the MVFR and IFR categories, but expect to see prevailing MVFR 
with a TEMPO of IFR restrictions with the heavier rounds of 
precipitation and reduced visibilities and CIGS. TRI will 
continue to see lower CIGS this afternoon with MVFR conditions 
prevailing. Added a TEMPO for TRI for 19Z to 22Z to try and 
capture some of the heavier rainfall that could move in early this
afternoon. However, this evening the rain should begin to move 
east of all TAF sites with prevailing MVFR through the remaining 
TAF period.

.DISCUSSION...

Forecast remains on track this morning. Only made minor updates to
Pop, and hourly temperatures based on latest trends. Big story
today is rainfall with current regional radar imagery depicting a
wide area of moderate to heavy rainfall moving across the
Tennessee valley. The heavier rain located across southern middle
Tennessee, north Mississippi and Alabama, is aligned along a zone
of enhanced low layer moisture convergence. Further, upper level
dynamics are increasing with a compact shortwave trough moving
across the central plains increasing upper level height falls, and
DPVA across the Mississippi valley. Thus, widespread moderate to
heavy rain will continue to move eastward this afternoon and into
tonight.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
An active short-term with a series of jets moving across the
Tennessee Valley today placing the region under divergence aloft 
with the circulations around the jets inducing strong fronto-
genetic forcing along a cold front. Also, boundary layer southerly
jet of 30-40kts will increase the isentropic lift over the area.
End result will be widespread showers by late morning and
afternoon. Rainfall of 1/2 to 1 inch is anticipated with locally
heavier amounts possible. Due to the already saturated ground and
high stream flows, additional localized flooding is possible.

The southerly jet today will produce breezy conditions across the
higher elevations with gusts of 35 kts expected.

The limiting factor for heavier widespread rains will be the
strong/severe convection anticipated over the Gulf Coast states.
This convection will likely limit some of the moisture transport
into the southern Appalachians. 

For tonight, cold air will move into the southern Appalachians
allowing the rain to change to snow showers, mainly across the
higher elevations. Since the boundary layer northwest flow is
relatively weak (10-15kts), orographic lift will be limited, so
only 1 inch or so is anticipated over the highest elevations.

For Monday, colder and drier air will continue to pull into the
Tennessee Valley/southern Appalachians with the return of sunshine
by afternoon.

.LONG TERM (Monday Night through Saturday)...The overall weather 
pattern early in the period looks fairly quiet with a broad upper 
trough over the eastern U.S. and a surface high slowly building in. 
This pattern will allow dry and much cooler air to move in. 
Overnight temperatures each night through Wednesday night will fall 
into the teens and 20s across most valley locations.  This may cause 
freezing or patchy black ice to develop on area roads that continue 
to have ponding or high water.  Tuesday and Wednesday...high 
temperatures wills struggle to climb and most areas will not reach 
into the 40s.  Winds will shift more southerly by Thursday in 
advance of the next weather system.  This will begin a warming trend 
with temperatures slowly warming each day.  The system and 
associated precip will push in around the Thursday night time frame 
with widespread precip falling on Friday and Saturday.  We may see a 
mix of rain and snow over northern areas and higher terrain during 
the overnight hours as temperatures in these locations drop to near 
freezing...but any snow should transition to all rain for the 
daytime. The additional rainfall from this system could once again 
aggravate any ongoing flooding or high water areas.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

Skies have cleared out this afternoon with temperatures warming 
into the upper 40's to mid 50's area wide. Clouds should begin to 
increase once again this evening as low to mid level moisture 
begins to increase ahead of the next disturbance to the west. 
Current water vapor imagery depicts a southern stream shortwave 
trough moving onshore of central and southern California, with a 
large upper level vortex across southern Canada. A broad southern 
stream jet carries moisture eastward across the Rockies, and into 
the southern plains. To our east, another shortwave trough is 
beginning to exit the New England area with poleward moisture 
transport. The short term forecast will greatly depend on how the 
above features evolve through the next 24 hours. High chances of 
precipitation and heavy rainfall are all hazards to discuss in 
this short term period. The aforementioned Pacific shortwave will 
continue to progress eastward into the Southwest and across the 
Rockies overnight weakening into the zonal flow. The large upper 
level low across Canada will begin to shift east with time, 
setting up a northwest flow regime aloft transporting much colder
air equatward into the northern plains. 

Increased curvature with the lead shortwave across the plains 
will tend to increase isentropic ascent on the 295-305 K surfaces 
as early as 12Z to 15Z Sunday across the region. Further, an 
increased 110-115 knot upper level jet streak will shift across 
the Tennessee Valley with the forecast area becoming placed in the
right entrance region of this jet. Model cross sections depict 
increased deep layer omega in response to the increase in synoptic
scale lift with a nearly upright ageostrophic circulation during 
the Sunday afternoon and evening period. This increase synoptic 
scale lift coincides with an increase in poleward moisture 
associated with a southerly low level jet maximum. Further, the 
increased jet dynamics aloft will lead to an increase in the low 
level thermal gradient across the Ohio and Tennessee valley during
this time which is indicative of a response to the strengthening 
mass field aloft. As a result of the above features, widespread 
precipitation should begin as early as 12Z to 15Z Sunday 
associated with the isentropic lift, and increasing in intensity 
as the upper level dynamics increase. Forecast QPF amounts are 
generally around 1 inch through 12Z Monday. Given the recent heavy
rain event, this amount of rainfall could lead to localized 
flooding in some areas. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

Low will continue to move off to the east and precipitation will 
gradually begin to end from west to east overnight Sunday night into 
Monday. Temperatures will drop well below freezing overnight, and 
there looks to be a brief crossover of lingering moisture and sub-
freezing temperatures, which will lead to some snowfall. Right now 
the highest chances to see wintery precipitation will be in the 
higher elevations of the Southern Appalachian Mountains and over 
towards the Cumberland Plateau. Forecast currently calls for around 
an inch of snowfall at the mountain peaks and a dusting to half inch 
in the higher elevations of the Valley. We could see a brief round 
of wintry weather in the northern Valley locations, but it currently 
looks like it would have difficulty sticking to the warm ground and 
likely result in no accumulations. 

Broad troughing will continue through the middle of the week leading 
to below average temperatures into the weekend. With overnight 
temperatures expected to be well below freezing for several days 
people need to be mindful of any lingering flood waters freezing and 
leading to patches of black ice on the roads in areas that have poor 
drainage.

Shortwave will move through at the end of the work week and bring 
the next chance of precipitation to the region. Current models 
indicate that we could see additional wintry precipitation in the 
higher elevation, but most of the Valley will stay warm enough to 
see all rain. Even if it does fall as mostly rain across the area, 
will have to be mindful of potential re-aggravation of flooding 
conditions, depending on how much the ground can dry out over the 
upcoming work week. So with multiple effects possible from this next 
weekend system, will want to keep a close eye on this one.

The forecast remains on track this morning so will not make any 
major changes. Only minor tweaks to temperature and cloud cover to
follow observations. Current visible satellite imagery indicates 
substantial cloud cover is still across most of the area. This 
moisture is underneath a rather strong and deep inversion aloft. 
Do not expect most of this cloud cover to erode today, but best 
chances of this occurring would be across southern portions of 
Tennessee, and southwest North Carolina.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Surface ridging will continue
to build into the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians Today
with zonal upper flow. Overall, dry conditions with cooler
temperatures. Main differences in the models is how fast cloud
cover will erode. Will follow the slower NAM solution given the
steep low-level inversion.

For tonight, isentropic lift will increase with moisture pulling
north into the area. Mostly cloudy conditions with a chance of
showers for the western half of the area.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...We will return to an active 
weather pattern on Sunday as the first of 2 systems moves in this 
extended period.  This first system has deep low level moisture 
with PWs over 1 inch.  Expect a large band of showers to move in 
early Sunday and the system will continue to generate bands of 
moderate and possibly some heavy rainfall across the area through 
much of the day before pulling out Sunday night into Monday.  Models 
continue to show differences in precipitation amounts and confidence 
remains low on amounts...but overall expect widespread rainfall of 1 
to 2 inches with locally higher amount possible.  This amount of 
rain combined with a continually saturated ground and some minor 
ongoing ponding and flooding could create additional flooding 
problems across the area. Additionally...a strong and gusty 850MB 
jet accompanying the system may increase winds over higher terrain 
is it moves through.  As the system pulls away from the area...much 
cooler air will filter in. Any lingering rain showers will 
transition to light snow or flurries Sunday night into early Monday 
morning. Higher elevations could see some minor snow accumulations 
...generally less than an inch.  Drier but much cooler air will 
continue to move in through the first part of the work week and low 
temperatures into mid week will fall into the teens and 20s.  The 
next system will move in around the Friday time frame.  This system 
will again have the potential to generate widespread moderate to 
occasional heavy rainfall.

out. Prefer the slower NAM solution given the strong low-level 
inversion.

Winds will be light northerly through the forecast period.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast on track this evening with just a few minor
changes. Showers have all but ended, except for some light 
drizzle across our eastern mountains, as a shortwave continues to 
progress further east of the area. Adjusted hourly POPs 
accordingly which took out POPs a little sooner. It should remain 
dry the rest of the night. 

Clouds and light winds should be enough to prevent fog but not 
completely confident that at least patchy fog won't develop 
across some areas. The only location that currently has fog is up 
in Wise County, VA where the temperature has already dropped to 
the dewpoint. All other elements on track and no adjustments 
needed. Will send out new zones.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
Rain is continuing to clear out of the Eastern Tennessee Valley
this afternoon. Rainfall amounts have generally been about
0.25-0.50 inches, but a few isolated locations have seen a bit
closer to 1 inch of rain. Expect rain to continue to move out of
the area and exit SW Virginia/NE Tennessee by sunset this evening. 

Colder air will continue to funnel in from the northwest and
overnight lows will dip down into the 30/40's across the area. Dry
weather will continue tomorrow and temperatures will rebound to us
seeing high temperatures similar to what we saw today. 

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...
On Saturday night, the upper levels will become dominated by 
zonal flow as a strong area of high pressure begins to settle 
southward out of Canada. An area of surface pressure falls across 
the southern plains and western Gulf will lead to a weak area of 
surface low pressure. This surface low will move toward the 
northeast across the southeast states and extreme southern 
Appalachians. Ahead of this surface low, isentropic ascent on the 
290-300K surfaces will begin as early as Sunday morning. Strong 
net isentropic adiabatic omega will occur as a result of the 
strong ascent and with adequate deep layer moisture should lead to
widespread showers across a large portion of the forecast area. 
Precipitable water values are progged to increase upwards of 1.00+
inches with values in excess of 1.25 inches across southern 
Tennessee. This amount of moisture could lead to locally heavy 
rainfall across portions of the area. Already saturated ground 
would mean that this precipitation could create additional flood 
issues. Precipitation should quickly come to an end Monday morning
as the weak area of PVA and area of surface low pressure ejects 
eastward. Residual moisture could lead to light drizzle or 
flurries across portions of the area into Monday morning as a much
colder airmass moves in. Some of this moisture may be able to 
stick around long enough for light snow across the higher terrain 
in the Smokys but am not expecting any impacts. Gusty winds should
follow behind the arctic front with a strong pressure gradient. 
Temperatures Monday will be much cooler with daytime highs only in
the upper 30’s to low 40’s. 

Surface high pressure will remain in control Monday night through 
Thursday with below normal temperatures expected under a northwest 
flow regime aloft. The NAEFS guidance still indicates temperatures 
in the bottom 1-2 percentile range and 850mb temperatures anomalies 
as low as -1.0 to -1.5 sigma.  Further, CIPS analog guidance also 
shows a strong signal of much colder air. Given this, will trend on 
the colder side of guidance.  However, strong subsidence will bring 
mostly clear skies through the extended period.   Models are still 
having issues in regards to the next system to traverse the region 
late in the period.  The main differences are that the ECMWF keeps 
the area under persistent northwest flow aloft, with the GFS showing 
a more active pattern with deep troughing across the central and 
southern plains and a large disturbance.  For now will keep PoPs in 
the 20 to 30 percent range.

Showers and even a few claps of thunder continue to move up
through the Tennessee Valley this morning. Most locations have
seen less than 0.25 inches of rain, but a few places picked up a
bit over 0.50 inches under heavier thunderstorms. Expect storms to
stick around the area through the day and into the afternoon.
Storms will eventually come to an end towards the late
afternoon/evening hours from southwest to northeast. Only a few
minor tweaks were made for this morning update, and the overall
forecast is still largely unchanged.

Showers are quickly moving north into the southern TN valley this
morning. Currently only affecting KCHA, but expect them to spread
north as far as KTRI by 15z-16z. Once rain moves in, prevailing
MVFR conditions are expected, with possible dips to IFR levels in
heavier precip. Rain moves out by 19z-00z this afternoon. Expect 
OVC012-015 ceilings to linger through remainder of TAF period in

tonight but think advection of low level dry air will be enough to
keep visibilities up.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

At the surface this morning, a cold front is draped lengthwise 
down the Tennessee Valley and into northern Alabama. Cold air 
advection isn't particularly strong at this point in time due to 
zonal upper flow and lack of strong surface high pressure helping 
to drive it south and east, so colder temperatures are displaced 
north and west into middle Tennessee and into Kentucky. Showers 
associated with a shortwave passing to our north are still 
lingering in the far northeast TN mountains and into southwest 
Virginia. Those will dissipate in the next few hours. However 
another shortwave is traversing Oklahoma early this morning and 
will impact our weather through the morning and early afternoon 
hours. Expect to see a wave of surface low pressure develop along 
the front to our southwest, riding the boundary northeast through 
the morning hours after daybreak. Lift from this approaching 
shortwave should cause showers to become fairly widespread from 
around daybreak through midday, progressing from southwest to 
northeast with time. Regional radar imagery supports this, with 
numerous showers developing over the last couple of hours over 
central and northern Alabama. Increased PoPs further to support 
the observational, as well as high res numerical guidance, trends 
of widespread rainfall today. Amounts should be light overall, but
suspect most people will see some measurable rain today.

On the temperature front, went with a standard diurnal trend. The 
shortwave responsible for incoming rain and surface low pressure 
riding north along the boundary will not pass by until this evening. 
So any notable shift in the location of the front, and subsequent 
CAA regime, is not expected until tonight. Expect to see highs in 
the mid and upper 50s for the valley and points east, and perhaps 
some upper 40s to low 50s for mainly the northern plateau. Low 40s 
to upper 30s appear on tap for tonight due to some meager 
strengthening of the CAA regime.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...

A few showers will be lingering over the Southern Appalachian 
Region early Saturday as the ongoing system pulls out of the area.
At best a hundredth or two is possible over the eastern 
mountains. Otherwise....Saturday should be dry with zonal flow 
aloft. The main system of concern through the extend will begin to
push in late Saturday night/early Sunday morning with the main 
band of showers moving through during the day Sunday and showers 
lingering into Sunday night/early Monday. Models are in poor 
agreement with the amount of rainfall expected. PWs should be 
above an inch and expect the overall average rainfall to be 1 to 2
inches...though some models do want to bring in at least 3 
inches. So...with the disagreement in models...confidence is low 
on details. The main concern with the rainfall is with the recent 
significant rains during the end of February and still a rather 
saturated ground and there does continue to be some ongoing minor 
flood of low lying areas...this additional rainfall could could 
have more of an impact that it normally would. The rest of the 
extended period looks fairly benign with just a couple of weak 
impulses moving through which is generally expected to 
occasionally increase cloud cover. However...we could see a 
isolated showers move in late Thursday in advance of the next 
approaching system.

.DISCUSSION...Early update this evening to tidy up forecast. The
previous forecast is still mostly on track, just updating to 
follow trends of latest HRRR and RUC. Both these models show the 
current showers progressing east over the next several hours then 
drying out across the plateau and central valley. Then, both hi-
res models show another wave of showers developing off to our 
southwest and moving back into our area a few hours after 
midnight. This is in response to another weak short wave moving 
in. This wave was mentioned in the previous forecast but it is now
moving in slightly faster, thus the POP adjustment after 
midnight. Also added in patchy fog for tonight and tomorrow
morning as several ob sites already reporting fog.

Tweaked POPs for tomorrow morning through early afternoon as well
due to good model agreement with the aforementioned short wave. 
Increased POPs east of I-40, mainly centered along the spine of 
the Appalachians. Will send out new zones.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...The weak short wave energy 
bringing our current round of showers will shift east tonight, but 
another weak short wave will affect the area on Friday. 
Precipitation looks less widespread with this wave, so will carry no 
higher than chance PoPs for Friday.  Precipitation amounts will 
generally be light.  Otherwise, there will be plenty of clouds for 
the short term period with above normal temperatures tonight and 
temperatures near seasonable normals tomorrow.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...Shortwave trough
exits east of the region on Friday night with some  weak 
subsidence across the region resulting in dry weather and some 
mostly clear to partly cloudy skies through Saturday. With zonal 
flow, expect temperatures near normal. Late Saturday afternoon, 
isentropic lift increases from southwest to northeast with high 
clouds moving in Saturday evening and more widespread 
precipitation late Saturday night and Sunday morning. Model 
guidance is in generally good agreement for Sunday and Monday. A 
northern stream shortwave is expected to phase with a southern 
stream shortwave Sunday afternoon with strengthening surface 
cyclogenesis across the Southern and Central Appalachians along an
arctic front. With southwesterly flow ahead of the front on 
Sunday afternoon, PW values will increase above 1.0 inch with 
values up to 1.4 inch across southwest Tennessee and southwest 
North Carolina. This will favor the potential for some additional 
heavy rainfall on Sunday with 1 to 2 inches of rainfall expected. 
Localized convective activity could increase totals in some spots,
but at this time, the bulk of instability is expected to remain 
southeast of the surface low across portions of Mississippi, 
Alabama, and Georgia.

Much colder air advects into the region as winds veer to the 
northwest behind the cold front on Sunday night. This will lead to 
any remaining moisture mixing with or changing to some light snow 
showers and flurries, especially across northern portions of the 
forecast area and the higher elevations. However, most of the 
moisture is forecast to be gone by the time temperatures drop cold 
enough for frozen precip, so any accumulation is expected to be 
little to none. Still, could have some freezing of moisture on 
surfaces, especially elevated surfaces like bridges, Sunday night as 
temperatures drop into the mid 20s across the northern plateau and 
southwest Virginia.

A northern shortwave trough rotating through the longwave troughing 
pattern will usher in a reinforcing cold front on Tuesday and 
strengthen troughing across the Eastern CONUS. While moisture is 
limited with this second front, anomalously cold air will move 
southward into our area. The NAEFS guidance shows temperatures in 
the bottom 2 or 3 percentiles, which is a very strong signal for 
much below normal temperatures 5 days out. In addition, CIPS analog 
guidance also shows a very strong signal for much below normal 
temperatures from Tuesday through Thursday of next week with a near 
100 percent chance of below normal temperatures and surface 
temperature anomalies of 10 below normal (which is the bottom limit 
of the scale). With this information, went much below normal on 
temperatures next week, and even went several degrees below MOS 
guidance. Although temperatures will be much below normal, do expect 
mostly clear skies on Tuesday afternoon through Thursday morning 
with subsidence in the wake of the strong shortwave. By late week, 
another system is expected to approach from the west with isentropic 
lift increasing once again which will bring slight chance/chance 
PoPs across the area.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...We will transition into a more
active weather pattern today as the next weather system moves
through the Southern Appalachian Region. Rain will spread across
the area this morning into the afternoon. Weak elevated
instability over southern areas may allow for a few rumbles of
thunder. For the most part...the showers should be light with a
few band of moderate rainfall possible. Overall...total rainfall
expected this afternoon should average less than a half inch. The
system will pull out of the area this evening with only a few
light showers lingering over the area overnight. Temperatures will
stay mild of the end of February with highs today expected to
climb into the 50s and low 60s...tonight lows will generally be in
the 40s.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday Night)...Seeing some better
model agreement during the long-term portion of the forecast. 
Model consensus suggests that the surface boundary will stall 
further to the south and east. Drier air will move in behind the 
frontal boundary with dewpoints dropping down into the low to mid 
40s. PW values will drop down into the 0.5-0.7 inch range. These 
values are around to slightly above normal for late February into 
early March. Model soundings indicate that this moisture is 
limited to the low-levels and with the lack of lift, went ahead 
and lowered PoPs for Friday. There is a weak trough that will 
rotate through the region and the area will be in the left exit 
region of an upper level jet. However, with the boundary now 
forecast further south and the lack of moisture, kept most areas 
dry on Friday. Under mostly cloud skies, highs will generally be 
in the 50s. 

The period with the highest uncertainty is Friday night into 
Saturday morning. The NAM indicates another upper level trough 
moving in quickly Friday night into Saturday morning. The front 
nudges further northward. The lift increases and NAM model soundings 
indicate saturation at Chattanooga and Knoxville. The GFS and ECMWF 
indicate that the upper level flow during this timeframe remains 
more zonal with the front remaining further to the south. For now, 
have kept PoPs a bit higher Friday night into Saturday morning to 
account for the NAM solution. PoPs during this frame range from 
around 20-50 %. Regardless, expect cloud cover will continue 
overnight with lows dropping into the low and mid 40s.
 
Models also continue to point to a dry solution on Saturday. An 
850mb ridge will move across the forecast area with zonal flow 
aloft. PW values will be in the 0.4-0.6 inch range. These values are 
around average for early March. Model soundings suggest a bit more 
sunshine on Saturday compared to Friday with highs rising into the 
mid 50s to low 60s. The 850 mb ridge will shift to the east of the 
area Saturday night into Sunday as low level southwesterly flow 
begins to increase. A southern stream trough will move out of the 
Desert Southwest into the southern Plains during this timeframe. The 
surface boundary to the south will begin to surge northwards. PoPs 
will increase from southwest to northeast Saturday night into 
Sunday. PW values will increase into the 1.0-1.3 inch range with the 
strong moisture and warm air advection. These values are over the 
90th percentile for early March. Forecast rainfall amounts will 
range from 1-2 inches late Saturday through Sunday. The event is 
still a few days away but any additional precipitation will lead to 
localized flooding issues due to the widespread historic rainfall 
events throughout February. The track of the surface low is a bit 
better defined between the GFS and ECMWF. The models have come 
closer together with the GFS a bit further north and the ECMWF a bit 
further south. For now, it doesn't appear like the low will track 
far enough north to include thunder in the forecast on Sunday.

Much colder air will advect in behind the departing front Sunday 
night into Monday. Model soundings indicate that the deep moisture 
will exit during this timeframe but there could be enough leftover 
for a few snow shower/flurries late Sunday night into Monday 
morning. The best chances for snow will be across southwest 
Virginia, northeast Tennessee, and the east Tennessee Mountains. For 
now, not forecasting an impactful winter weather event due to the 
limited moisture behind the boundary. Temperatures early next week 
will make it clear that winter is still here with highs in the mid 
30s to low 40s and lows in the teens and 20s.

tonight.  Then...the low clouds will remain in place for much of the 
day on Thursday as a couple of broken bands of rain showers push 
across the area.  As rain moves into a TAF site...be prepared for 
lowering clouds and some reduction in VIS for MVFR conditions. The 
system will be exiting the area Thursday evening and rain will pull 
away from the TAF sites.  However...MVFR clouds will persist through 
the rest of the TAF period. As for winds...overall...they should 
remain fairly light...and should remain less the 10 KTs.

.DISCUSSION...
A few small tweaks wil be made to PoPs tonight and tomorrow
morning based on current radar trends and the latest models.
Radar shows light showers along the TN/AL border, which probably
won't be enough to produce measureable precip, but the main area
of rain is just behind over MS. This should arrive in our area
after midnight, initially across southern sections then spread
north through the morning. PoPs will be increased for northern
areas a little earlier for this update. Temperatures are generally
on track so far, with lows mainly in the 40s to lower 50s south
tonight.

VFR conditions are expected to continue at all sites through
tonight, with increasing midlevel clouds. Low level moisture will
increase toward morning, and cigs/vis are expected to drop to 
MVFR as rain spreads into the area in the late morning to early

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...

Quiet weather will continue much of the night as surface high 
pressure to the east maintains dry conditions with a light return 
flow. This combined with increasing clouds will keep lows 5-10 
degrees milder than last night. Heavily weighted tonight's low temp 
forecast toward the CONSSHORT with minor adjustments. 

WAA and isentropic lift will increase after about 12Z Thursday as 
the high moves farther east and a mid level shortwave and associated 
weak surface low move across Mississippi and Alabama during the day. 
This will result in light rain showers developing from S to N across 
east TN and southwest NC between 12 and 18Z. These showers will hold 
off in far northeast TN and southwest VA until around or just after 
18Z. Brought in slight chance pops around 09Z gradually increasing 
to chance and likely through the morning to reflect this increasing 
rainfall, except for southwest VA where likely pops will hold off 
until early to mid afternoon. The good news is that the rain will be 
light and should not redevelop any flooding. WPC QPF guidance 
generally gives a few hundredths to 0.30 inches between early 
Thursday morning and Thursday evening with the greatest amounts over 
the southern Plateau and southern Valley. Extensive cloud cover will 
be mostly locked in for Thursday, but highs will remain near to 
above normal with a few 60's once again possible in the southern 
valley and southwest NC. This will especially be the case if there 
are breaks in the rain showers. Kept Thursday's highs close to the 
CONSSHORT output but raised temps in northeast TN to account for 
some downsloping effects.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...

Models in fair agreement to start the period on Thursday night. An 
upper level disturbance is moving across to our north and will bring 
a weak frontal boundary through the area Thursday night. Enough lift 
and moisture are present for some scattered showers. As the 
disturbance to our north moves further east POPs decrease through 
the night. If the NAM is correct, the weak boundary stalls across 
the area for Friday which allows for more light and scattered 
showers. The GFS has the boundary to our south and keeps us drier. 
The location of the stalled boundary will be key on who ends up 
seeing the showers. If we do see the showers QPF will be light as 
forcing is weak due to isentropic lift.

The boundary begins to lift northward Friday night into Saturday 
morning. During this time another weak disturbance moves through the 
zonal flow and lift is enhanced over the boundary. Another round of 
mostly light showers expected during this time. An upper level 
trough swinging across the Great Lakes Saturday afternoon helps to 
force the boundary back to our southeast. This will allow us to dry 
out during the afternoon hours. Highs on Friday and Saturday will be 
in the mid to upper 50s for most.

Showers move back in Saturday night and into Sunday. This is in 
response to high pressure setting up to our southeast and a strong 
cold front approaching from the northwest. The northern and southern 
stream jet phase and puts our region under a double jet structure. 
This will enhance lift with the left front quadrant of the southern 
jet and right rear quadrant of the northern jet over the area. This 
double jet, strengthening southwest flow, and stalled boundary will 
allow for likely and categorical POPs on Sunday. How much rain we 
receive depends on how and where the northern and southern stream 
jet phase together. As of now, it looks like we could get anywhere 
from 0.75 inches up to 1 inch of rainfall on Sunday. 

The cold front pushes through Sunday night and colder air rapidly 
moves in. There could be a brief period where lingering moisture on 
the back edge transitions to some light snow showers before the 
moisture finally exits. The rest of the period will be under the 
influence of an upper level trough which will keep us in a dry and 
cool airmass. Highs from Monday through Wednesday will range from 
the lower 30s to near 40 with lows in the upper teens to upper 20s.

The current forecast is mainly on track. Tweaked hourly sky cover
the rest of the morning through mid afternoon to reflect current
satellite trends. Believe that the Plateau, northern and central
Valley, and southwest VA will quickly become mostly sunny while
clouds remain thicker farther south. Removed all pops and QPF for
the rest of the day because the light showers in SE areas have
exited. Also inputed current temps and dew points in order to get
a slightly faster rise through the afternoon as the sun breaks 
out.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...The surface high has shifted
east of the area with a weak short wave tracking through the upper
flow to our south. The wave will continue to bring bands of clouds
through the area and may generate a stray pocket of light rain or
sprinkle over far southeast locations early this morning. But 
overall...it should be a dry day with zonal flow aloft. Clouds 
will slowly increase and lower late tonight as the next low 
pressure system approaches the area. Associated rain will begin 
pushing in overnight. By late night/early morning...rainfall 
should be scattered and light...with totals generally less than a
tenth of an inch by sunrise. The main band of rain is not 
expected to move in until the long term period. 

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday Night)...Model uncertainty 
features throughout the long-term forecast period with the timing 
and placement of each upper level trough moving in the zonal flow 
being key to the forecast period. The model discrepancies start at
the beginning of the forecast period. A frontal passage is 
forecast late Wendesday into early Thursday and the boundary will 
stall to the south and east of the area as it takes on more of an 
E-W orientation as the trough to the north lifts out over the 
Atlantic. The models are all fairly consistent with a weak 
shortwave trough move across the southeastern U.S. on Thursday but
differ on the location and strength. The NAM is by far the 
strongest and most bullish with precipitation. The Canadian, GFS, 
and ECMWF both indicate that the front will stall a bit further 
south and will only lift slightly northward with the trough on 
Thursday. This solution keeps best precipitation chances to the 
south and east and have gone closer to this solution for the 
forecast. Thursday night into Friday morning will feature a bit of
a lull in the activity as a weak shortwave ridge passes over the 
area. Highs will range from the upper 50s to low 60s on Thursday 
with lows Thursday night into Friday morning in the 40s.

The next upper level trough moves into the Tennessee River Valley on 
Friday with the surface boundary lingering to the south. The ECMWF 
is the most impressive model with this wave featuring elevated PoPs 
across the area. The Canadian, GFS, and NAM indicate a rather 
similar scenario as Thursday with the upper level trough being to 
weak and the front remaining further to the south and east. For now, 
have gone with chance PoPs around 30-50 %. Most models indicate a 
break Friday night into Saturday morning but the GFS keeps chances 
in the forecast. The GFS solution keeps the forecast area in the 
left exit region of an elongated jet as another weak shortwave 
trough moves into the Tennessee River Valley. Due to this, have 
continued with some mention of PoPs Friday night into Saturday 
morning. Highs on Friday will be in the mid 50s to low 60s with lows 
Saturday morning in the 40s. 

Model solutions continue to diverge into the upcoming weekend. The 
ECMWF and Canadian indicate a rather robust upper level southerly 
stream trough moving through the region On Sunday. The GFS indicates 
best precipitation chances will arrive on Saturday as the front 
lifts northward due to southwesterly low level flow increasing ahead 
of a clipper type system. The ECMWF and Canadian solution suggest 
that Saturday will be dry but have continued with chance PoPs 
throughout much of the weekend to account for the uncertainty. If 
the ECMWF and Canadian solutions are correct, expect there will be 
strong winds across the high terrain on Sunday. A few strong to even 
severe storms could be possible as well as heavy rainfall. This is 
still several days away and still too much uncertainty to add 
anything to the HWO.

The clear part of the extended is that the airmass will change going 
into next week as arctic air moves in behind the departing front. A 
few wrap around snow showers could be possible late Sunday into 
Monday. For now, this does not look to be a very impactful event due 
to the cold air moving in as the moisture exits. Temperatures early 
next week will make it feel more like winter with highs in the mid 
30s and low 40s and lows in the 20s and 30s.

.DISCUSSION...

No notable changes for the evening update. Clouds are coming in as
previously forecast, ahead of a disturbance that will pass by to
our south overnight and into Wednesday morning. Kept the slight
chances in the higher terrain of the Smokies and points south, 
because there is some indication that a few spotty showers could
be seen there. Do not expect much to come of that, maybe a
hundredth or two here and there. Otherwise just an increase of
clouds is forecast. Clouds should clear out nicely tomorrow for
another beautiful late February day with temperatures in the upper
60s for most low elevation locales.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...Some very weak short wave 
energy will slip by to our south overnight, but main effect will 
just be some increase in clouds. May be a few light showers mainly 
far southeastern parts of our area after midnight so will include a 
slight chance PoP there.  For tomorrow expect clouds to decrease 
again as some drying works in, allowing for a mostly sunny afternoon 
and above normal temperatures. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...Definitely some 
uncertainty in the long term forecast with a few ripples in the fast 
nearly zonal configuration early in the period with amplification to 
the upper flow developing over the weekend with cold weather 
returning to the Southern Appalachian region. The first wave moves 
east along the Gulf Coast with limited moisture return as a northern 
stream short wave brings a cold frontal boundary into the region 
Thursday into Thursday night bringing medium chance pops for a few 
showers. Precipitation chances will be a little lower on Friday as 
additional weak short wave energy moves rapidly east across the 
Southern Appalachian region. At this time, the best chance for 
showers and even a couple thunderstorms appears to be Friday night 
into Saturday as a more amplified upper trough and associated cold 
front build into the Eastern United States. Despite the possibility 
of a break in the action, pops have been broad brushed from later 
Saturday into Sunday because of the likelihood of a trailing short 
wave building back through the southeastern states. There is a 
potential of snowfall in this scenario as some sub-freezing air 
streams deep into the southeastern quarter of the nation. This 
period of the forecast will likely undergo changes in strength, 
timing, and associated cold air advection of the late weekend 
system. At this time the better chance for snowfall would be Sunday 
night into Monday. A second chance for some late winter season snow 
would be Monday night into Tuesday with an alberta clipper type wave 
dropping southeast through the Southern Appalachians. We will have 
to wait a few more days to see how these late extended period 
systems may change as we get closer to the event. The forecast 
starts out with above normal temperatures but will the warmth will 
be gradually fading back to below normal with each passing wave. In 
fact, next Monday and Tuesday will feel quite a bit more like winter 
with some snow back in the forecast.

259 AM EST Tue Feb 26 2019

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Overall...it should be a quiet
short term with weak surface high pressure in control. This will
allow southerly flow to develop across the area which will
increase low level moisture and bring afternoon highs into the 50s
and low 60s. A short wave will move through the upper flow late
today/early this evening but the main storm track should keep this
feature to our south. We may see a few mid to high band of clouds
move across the region but the area should remain dry.
However...another wave will move through the upper flow late
tonight. This one will track a bit further north and a few
isolated light showers could push across far southern and eastern
areas toward sunrise. Precip amounts should be minimal. The main
concern through the short continues to be the lingering areal
flooding and high river levels. Some counties continue to have
some flooding issues and a couple of rivers are still above flood
stage. Associated Flood and River Flood Warnings remain in effect.
The areal flooding and river flooding...as well as other local low
lying ponding and higher rivers and creek...will continue to lower
for slowly improving conditions. 

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday Night)...Zonal flow aloft 
will feature throughout the end of the work week. Wednesday will 
feature a warm front moving to the north of the forecast area and 
a cold front approaching from the northwest. The atmosphere will 
stay relatively dry with PW values in the 0.5-0.7 inch range. 
Model soundings also indicate rather limited moisture and with the
lack of any synoptic lift, have removed PoPs for Wednesday. Highs
will warm into the 60s under mostly sunny skies. Warm air 
advection begins to increase Wednesday night ahead of the 
approaching front with low remaining up in the mid 40s to low 50s.
By Thursday, a weak upper level trough will move in with the 
zonal flow aloft. Models differ on the exact track of the surface 
low and how much instability will be available. Regardless, looks 
like instability will be rather low and have included chances for 
a few thunderstorms across southern portions of the forecast area.
Rain chances will increase on Thursday as moisture advection 
increases with PW values rising into the 0.9-1.1 inch range. 
Thursday will feature the best rain chances through the end of the
work week. 

The front will push south of the forecast area on Thursday night but 
will stall due to the zonal flow aloft. Some weak cold air advection 
will drop lows down into the low to mid 40s. With the front 
lingering, chances for showers will continue Thursday night into 
Friday morning. The front will begin to nudge back northward Friday 
night into Saturday with strong low level southwesterly flow ahead 
of another approaching upper level trough. Due to this, some areas 
will reenter the warm sector with a few thunderstorms possible again 
Friday night into Saturday. A more robust upper level trough will 
move into the region late this weekend finally pushing a cold front 
through the area. This front will usher in an airmass change as 
arctic air will feature throughout the extended portion of the long-
term forecast period. Models differ on when this cold air arrives 
with the ECMWF being a bit later than the GFS. The ECMWF lingers 
some moisture behind the boundary Sunday night into Monday morning 
that could result in a few snow showers. WIth the GFS showing a dry 
solution behind the boundary.

Regardless of timing and model solution, it is clear that a pattern 
change is in the works for early next week. Both models indicate 
that the surface boundary will stall along the Gulf Coast early next 
week with several upper level troughs moving through the region. It 
will all depend on the timing and track of these systems but it does 
look like there will be a couple of threats for wintry precipitation 
early next week with temperatures forecast to be below average.

No major updates are needed as the current forecast seems to be in
good shape. Only made minor tweaks to forecasted temperature and 
dewpoints based on latest observations. Otherwise, expect upper 
level clouds to continue to pass through associated with upper

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...Weak high pressure building
into the area will allow for quiet conditions through the short
term. Winds are still gusty this afternoon up across northeast TN,
southwest VA, and the eastern mountains. However, winds will 
settle this evening as the pressure gradient laxes with the trough
pulling off further to the northeast. Generally, clear skies 
tonight with overnight lows in the upper 20s to lower 30s for 
most. 

Tomorrow features another dry and mostly clear skies along with warmer
temperatures as heights rise across the area. Highs will be in the
upper 50s to lower 60s. Southerly flow doesn't become established
until late in the day tomorrow so dewpoints remain low through
peak heating tomorrow. This will allow RH values to dip down into
the upper 20s and lower 30s for most areas. However, with
light winds and saturated soils fire danger should remain on the 
lower end.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...The much needed
quiet weather will continue at the start of the period. Zonal 
flow aloft and surface high pressure off to the east should keep 
conditions dry with seasonable temps through Wednesday. A weak 
perturbation in the zonal flow will quickly move through the 
Tennessee valley late Tuesday night into Wednesday, but this 
should only result in an increase in clouds in most areas. Have a 
slight chance pop in the far south on Wednesday just in case since
moisture will be slightly higher down there.

A stronger shortwave trough will likely bring rain showers in the 
Thursday/Friday timeframe, but model timing has been in 
disagreement. The NAM brings in isentropic lift type showers in the 
late Wednesday night into early Thursday night period, the GFS holds 
off this activity until Thursday afternoon then has showers Thursday 
evening into the first half of Friday followed by a possible break 
Friday afternoon and evening. The ECMWF has these showers Thursday 
morning through Friday morning then tapering off from W to E Friday 
afternoon. For now have chance pops Wednesday night becoming likely 
Thursday then backing off to chance Thursday night into Friday. 
Regardless, this rain will not be nearly as heavy as what we just 
dealt with. Generally expect a few tenths to up to 0.75 inches from 
Wednesday night through Friday night with the greatest amounts 
across the southern valley and southwest NC.  

A deepening longwave trough in the N Plains and Midwest will allow a 
surface low to strengthen as it moves northeastward through the Ohio 
Valley and Great Lakes pulling a strong cold front across east TN, 
southwest VA, and southwest NC this weekend. A band of rain will 
accompany this frontal passage with moderate rainfall, but model 
timing differs. The GFS shows a stronger storm system and frontal 
passage Friday night through Saturday morning while the ECMWF shows 
a weaker overall system with rain chances not returning until 
Saturday night and Sunday. Pops will need to be adjusted as we move 
closer to this time, but the relatively fast moving nature of the 
system should keep rainfall amounts manageable. 

WAA ahead of this system will result in above normal temps Saturday, 
but cold high pressure and a trough aloft will bring below normal 
temps late Sunday and Monday. Could see some teens and low 20's for 
lows Monday morning as winter hangs on.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast mostly on track today. Other than a few 
tweaks here and there the biggest adjustment was to lower 
dewpoints this afternoon. Current dewpoints are running several 
degrees lower than forecast. This will cause RH values to drop 
lower this afternoon than previously forecast. It now looks like 
most areas will see RH values down in upper 20s to lower 30s, some
isolated areas will see values in the lower 20s. Winds have calmed
significantly since yesterday but some areas will still see some
gusty winds through the day, mainly across the eastern mountains,
northeast TN and southwest VA. If it weren't for the saturated 
fuels, fire danger would be a higher concern today. Will send out
new zones and fire weather forecast.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

A dry forecast for the short-term period. PW values will remain 
below a quarter of an inch throughout the short-term forecast 
period. These values are around the tenth percentile for late 
February. In the upper levels, the trough is now over New England 
with upper level heights increasing across the forecast area. At the 
surface, the low is now north of the Great Lakes racing 
northeastward into Canada. Surface high pressure is building into 
the area behind the departing system. Winds have remained up a bit 
tonight between the surface low to the northeast and high to the 
northwest. These winds have kept overnight temperatures a bit warmer 
than forecast and have increased temperatures a bit this morning 
with lows in the upper 20s to mid 30s for most locations.

Sunny conditions will feature today as upper level heights continue 
to increase. There will still be some weak cold air advection across 
the area with the low level ridge axis staying to the west of the 
forecast area. High temperatures today will top out in the 50s for 
most locations. Winds will be lighter as the pressure gradient 
relaxes with the surface high approaching. Will see a radiational 
cooling night tonight with light winds and clear skies. Overnight 
lows will range from the mid 20s to low 30s for most locations.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...

Generally zonal flow and near normal weather conditions are expected 
Tuesday. A weak wave of energy will zip through the area Tuesday 
night into Wednesday. Rain chances will be best in the Southern 
Tennessee Valley. QPF amounts look to be pretty light with this 
system, so at this time additional flooding is not expected, even 
though grounds will probably still be pretty wet. 

We take a brief break before another round of precipitation is 
expected to move through Thursday night into Friday. Looks to be a 
bit more moisture and energy associated with this second system, but 
rainfall amounts still look to be relatively moderate. And once 
again quickly behind this system another even stronger system will 
move through. This third system is Low pressure system moving 
through the Great Lakes region and dragging a cold front through the 
eastern half of the United States. This system looks to move through 
the Eastern Tennessee Valley Friday into Saturday. Precipitation 
will likely begin Friday night and continue into mid-day Saturday. 
Current models indicate that we could see rainfall totals of around 
a half inch, with some places possibly getting closer to an inch. 
Timing and strength of this system is still a bit up in the air 
until models come into better agreement, but once this system does 
move through we will drop temperatures to below normal at the start 
of next week.

.DISCUSSION...

Quiet night weather wise as surface high pressure continues to
shift east out of the plains as a very deep area of low pressure
ejects north of the Great Lakes. As a result of the increased
pressure gradient, winds have been gusty today and this evening.
Expect a gradual decrease in winds as current observations show.
Left the wind advisory going for the mountain zones as these 
areas will likely continue to see higher wind gusts. Only changes 
needed tonight were for the temperature and dewpoint grids. 
Tweaked forecast dewpoints down several degrees to account for 
latest observations and trends. The low levels are becoming 
increasingly dry tonight with dewpoints in the teens to low 20s. 
Tried to incorporate MOS given the current synoptic pattern and 
used a LAV/NAM blend. Used the lamp for hourly temperatures 
tonight, and used a MAV/MET blend for the MinT and MaxT grids.

258 PM EST Sun Feb 24 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...
The upper pattern today features quasizonal flow atop the Tennessee 
Valley and Southern Appalachian region, while surface high pressure 
noses in from the west.  PGFs remain high across the region today 
associated with the advecting high pressure airmass, thus winds are 
quite gusty.  The pressure gradient will relax across the lower 
elevations tonight, thus the present wind advisory will be allowed 
to expire for all areas outside of the mtn zones.  For those areas, 
am expecting persistent advisory level winds through 7AM Monday 
morning, which is when the remaining wind advisory expires. 
Otherwise, still looking at high water across much of the area in 
the wake of the past weeks' (and mainly yesterday's) flooding. Thus, 
opted to carry all areal flood warnings through midday tomorrow, 
allowing for ample time Monday morning to call around to local 
officials and discuss conditions on the ground.  If it is deemed 
conditions have improved sufficiently, warnings will at that time be 
allowed to expire.  River levels also remain high with the Pigeon, 
and North Fork Holston Rivers at moderate flood levels, with the 
Clinch expected to rise to moderate as well.  The South Chickamauga, 
Sequatchie, Tennessee, Powell, and French Broad rivers are at (and 
shouldn't exceed) minor flood levels.  All rivers should crest soon 
(if not already), thus yielding some relief for any impacted areas. 
Otherwise, cooler/drier high pressure will overtake the region on 
Monday allowing for mostly sunny skies and temperatures topping out 
near or slightly below normal levels. Winds on Monday should be 
substantially weaker than that of today. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
There is still a little bit of uncertainty in the extended period
with a couple weaker systems moving through the region during the
middle part of the week. We should still be able to enjoy another
dry day on Tuesday but some moisture may be advancing from the 
south as the first weak impulse rides through a nearly zonal flow 
aloft. This feature may bring a little light rain to the southern 
part of the forecast area Tuesday night into Wednesday morning 
with some of this light qpf moving into the northern half later 
Wednesday into the evening hours. There should be a bit of a gap 
in the precipitation later Wednesday evening. However, the next 
wave, which is progged to be slightly more well developed, could 
bring a little better chance for some showers area wide Thursday 
with departure of this feature later Thursday night. While there 
may some timing issues with the final system of the long term 
period, models agree on a well amplified long wave trough dropping
into the Eastern U.S. into the weekend. The chance for showers 
and thunderstorms will increase Friday and Friday night as a 
healthy, negative tilt short wave drives a deep surface low from 
the Mid Mississippi Valley northeast into the Eastern Great Lakes.
While its almost at the end of the extended period, this 
configuration would allow for the possibility of strong 
thunderstorms later Friday or Friday night depending on how much 
instability will be available ahead of the boundary. At this time,
it certainly appears that shear will be sufficiently strong. 
Temperatures will start out a little below normal to start out the
forecast however, much of the remainder of the week appears to be
near to several degrees above normal; especially when the 
stronger southerly flow develops Thursday into Friday. Cooler air 
will be building back into the region over the weekend behind the 
strong cold front.

.DISCUSSION...
What a difference 24 hours can make. The region continues to dry
out in the wake of epic flooding yesterday. The closed upper low
is advecting northward over the Great Lakes, while quasizonal 
flow and dry high pressure fills in across the Tennessee Valley 
and Southern Appalachian region. Still getting reports of road 
closures across much of the area, therefore will likely just 
continue all areal flood warnings through tomorrow morning to 
play it safe. Likewise, updates to all river flooding warnings and
advisories are underway.

Otherwise, the fcst temps seemed to be behind current trends as 
abundant insolation has returned. Thus blended in latest CONSMOS 
(warmest of guidance) for highs today, which essentially increased
maxed by around 3-4 degrees. Also made a few tweaks to winds as 
gusts were a bit under obs, however these changes were minor. The
wind advisory is unchanged.

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
306 AM EST Sun Feb 24 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

The cold front is still back to the west of the forecast area but a 
line of showers ahead of the surface boundary is currently moving 
through the area early this morning. This line of showers will bring 
in an additional 0.25-0.75 inches of rain and will continue to 
exacerbate the flooding issues across the area. The good news is that 
this will be the last chance for precipitation over the next several 
days. In the upper levels, the trough is racing northeastward 
into the western Great Lakes. The cold front will eventually move 
through the forecast area later this morning with precipitation 
finally coming to an end. The surface low will continue to deepen 
as the upper level jet across the Appalachians into the 
Northeastern U.S. increases with winds speeds as high as 130-150 
kt at 300 mb. The winds will increase behind the front as the 
pressure gradient tightens as the surface low strengthens. Model 
soundings indicate winds around the mixing height of 30-40 kts 
and expect these will be brought down to the surface. Due to this,
went ahead and extended the wind advisory to the south and west. 
Due to the saturated soils, trees could easily be brought down 
with gusts up to 40 mph and there could even be some sporadic 
power outages. The cold air advection behind the system is not 
overly impressive and highs should remain in the upper 40s to low 
50s throughout much of the day. With the cold and dry air 
advection, expect to see some welcome sun today. The winds will 
subside overnight as the surface low tracks well into Canada as 
high pressure move sin from the west. Extended the wind advisory 
through 12z Monday across the higher elevations where winds will 
remain elevated. Overnight lows will be closer to normal for late 
February ranging from the upper 20s to low 30s for most locations.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...

a quiet weather pattern is forecast to start the work-week with high 
pressure building in with upper level height rises. Temperatures on 
Monday will range from the upper 40s to low 50s with sunny skies. 
Clear skies will allow for radiational cooling Monday night into 
Tuesday morning with lows in the upper 20s to mid 30s. The low 
level ridge will shift to the east of the area by Tuesday with 
warm air advection returning. Highs will run a bit warmer in the 
mid 50s to low 60s. 

Precipitation chances will return by the middle of the week as a 
warm front pushes northward from the Gulf States. The warm air and 
moisture advection will persist throughout the remainder of the week 
keeping precipitation chances elevated in the extended portion of 
the forecast. The GFS and ECMWF are both consistent indicating a 
rather robust upper level trough moving into the region over the 
weekend. The forecast area should be well into the warm sector and
have added thunderstorms to the forecast over the weekend. This 
event is still several days away but could also produce some 
stronger storms depending on the track of the system.

.DISCUSSION...

The main purpose for the evening update was to increase rainfall
amounts for the overnight hours and address a growing concern with
regard to the flash flood potential tonight.

Numerical guidance shows a fairly high plume of PWAT values moving
into our area from the southwest tonight, along/ahead of the cold
front that will move through by daybreak Sunday. Couple this with
sufficient forcing for convection and there is concern that
significantly higher rainfall rates will be observed overnight
tonight than what was seen earlier today. Duration will be
shorter, and totals will definitely be lower than earlier today.
But the rainfall rates are what concern me at this point. Flash
flood guidance suggests as little as half an inch in a one hour
period would be enough to start causing additional problems.
I think both the short duration rates, as well as expected 
totals, will be enough to surpass that.

Bumped up rainfall totals through the overnight hours to the 0.75
to 1.00" range for the plateau and central/southern TN Valley 
region. Have little doubt there will be some amounts that exceed
an inch or even an inch and a half. By themselves, those totals 
don't sound impressive. Given the soil conditions though, if they
occur in a 1-2 period tonight, especially for central valley
locations, some additional flash flooding would seem to be a 
given. We will continue to closely monitor the situation
overnight.

I'll close on a positive note here. There are some details that 
give hope for a more favorable outcome. Cloud top temperatures on 
infrared satellite imagery are warming and lightning strike counts
seem to be coming down. Additionally the entire precip shield is 
moving along quickly. So it is possible that this event could 
conclude with no increase in flooding issues above the substantial
problems we've already had.

.AVIATION...

The warm front continues to slowly move north this evening but
still remains to our south across north Georgia, and Alabama.
Rain showers from warm air advection is starting to show up on
radar and this will likely increase across the CHA, and TYS area
through 06Z. In the meantime, a cold front will progress eastward
across western and middle Tennessee. Ahead of this front a line 
of showers and possibly embedded elevated thunderstorms will 
affect the CHA and TYS terminals. Otherwise, CIGS at CHA and TYS
will be reduced to IFR/LIFR levels before beginning to rise
closer to sunrise. TRI will likely stay near VFR and possibly 
MVFR for a few hours closer to sunrise with chances of showers 
impacting the terminals through 10Z. Winds will likely shift to 
westerly by 09Z to 10Z as the cold front moves through. Added wind
shear groups into the TAF's associated with the strong low level 
jet over the area.

310 PM EST Sat Feb 23 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...
Well it's been a busy day around these parts.  A slow moving band of 
H85 frontogenetic forcing has allowed for modest training of 
convection across the I40 corridor region of east TN.  With that, 
rainfall upwards of 3-4 inches over the last 6-7 hours are fairly 
common, especially across Roane, Loudon, and Knox counties. Multiple 
road closures continue to prevail across the area, even outside of 
the above noted hardest hit areas.  

As if that wasn't bad enough, we are still looking at a potent cold 
frontal passage tonight, which will have abundant moisture and lift 
for a line of convection across the region. Guidance favors said 
convective line moving out of middle TN late this evening, slowly 
traversing across the Plateau and through the Great Valley after 
midnight.  Current thinking favors the best chances for any stronger 
convection along south of I40 were best overlapping of 
shear/instability occur.  That said, a potent 60-70kt llj will move 
atop the region ahead of the front, which could mix to the surface 
with any strong cells.  If that occurs, given how saturated the 
ground is, am expecting scattered falling/uprooting trees, even with 
winds maxing out in the 40-50mph range.  Aside from any wind 
threats, additional rainfall (perhaps at higher rates) could 
exasperate/prolong any ongoing flooding. Finally, the traversing llj 
combined with elevation will lead to high winds across the Southern 
Appalachians, especially across the Smoky's where the earlier High 
Wind Watch was upgraded to a Warning through tonight.  Likewise, a 
Wind Advisory has also been issued for the remainder of the TN/VA 
high terrain starting tonight running through Sunday.  

Speaking of Sunday, FINALLY the sun will make it's triumphant 
return.  Expecting mostly sunny skies and highs in the mid/upper 50s 
amidst gusty wly/swly winds regionwide. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...
A powerful upper level trough moves east of the region Monday 
into Monday night with a zonal flow developing aloft. This flow 
helps the waterlogged region dry out as the Gulf of Mexico source 
region won't be involved in this flow pattern early in the week. 
The models are still having a difficult time resolving minor 
perturbations in this zonal pattern at mid week. A weak cold 
frontal boundary drops through the Southern Appalachian region in 
this pattern, but moisture will be limited ahead of the front, so 
the chance for a shower will remain slight. Later Thursday into 
Friday, there will be a gradual increase in isentropic lift as a 
weak wave rides east across the Deep South. Perhaps the best 
chance of rain will be in association with a more amplified upper 
level trough and surface frontal system on Saturday. However, kept
pops in a medium to high chance category due to uncertainty 
during this late period of the extended forecast. Temperatures 
will start out a couple of degrees below normal at the beginning 
of the long term with a warming trend bringing max and mins just a
little above normal mid to late week.

.AVIATION...At the beginning of the forecast period, a large area
of mvfr conditions are around with some ifr weather; especially 
at tri where the corridor of moderate rain will have an 
impact for the next several hours. The band of rain north of the 
advancing warm front is clearing cha and will be moving north of

Tried to use a gradual return to mvfr flight conditions as this 
area of showers and a few thunderstorms presses steadily east 
across the Great Valley. Tri may be able to see improved flight 
weather in the downsloping region of northeast tennessee later 
today into the later part of the evening. The band of heavier rain
along the cold front is forecast to impact cha around 06z, tys

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
238 AM EST Sat Feb 23 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Current upper level pattern features a trough moving out of the 
Desert Southwest into the southern Plains with a ridge extending 
from Florida northward into the Great Lakes. Closer to home, 
southwesterly flow continues to bring in plenty of moisture with PW 
values running in the 1.1-1.4 inch range. These values are around 
the maximum values observed for late February. At the surface, an E-
W boundary stretches across MS/AL/GA. High pressure at the surface 
across New England is keeping a wedge to the east of the mountains 
and this will hinder the fronts northern progression but the low 
level jet is forecast to increase later this morning. Current radar 
imagery indicates widespread precipitation across northern Alabama, 
northern Mississippi and west and middle TN. Models indicate strong 
lift to the north of the surface boundary in these regions with a 
120-130 kt jet developing across the Ohio River Valley. Models 
indicate the best lift across the forecast area in the 09-15z 
timeframe with best precipitation coverage across the northern 
Plateau into southwest Virginia. Amounts through the end of the day 
will range from 1-2 inches but could be as high as 3 inches and with 
the already saturated ground all of this will be runoff. Due to this 
and ongoing river flooding, will extend the Flood Watch for the 
entire area through 12z Sunday. This additional rainfall will also 
lead to the possibility of flash flooding and will exacerbate any 
ongoing river flooding. Models indicate the lift weakens going into 
the afternoon and expect to see a decrease in coverage. 

The strength of the low level jet will continue to increase 
overnight and the front will move northward into the forecast as the 
wedge retreats. There are some model difference on how far north 
the warm front makes it. The warm sector becomes pinched off due to 
the wedge to the east and instability is rather limited regardless 
of model solution. Winds at 925 mb will be around 40-50 kts. Model 
soundings indicate some weak instability across southern portions of 
the forecast area later tonight into Sunday morning and any of these 
strong updrafts could bring these winds down to the surface. 
Therefore, will continue the mention of strong to marginally severe 
storms in the HWO. With the saturated ground, any stronger wind 
gusts will have the ability to bring down a few trees. Additional, 
moderate to heavy rainfall along the front will continue to 
exacerbate any ongoing flood issues. Winds in the mountains will 
increase later tonight as the low level jet surges into the area. 
The event is not a typical mountain wave event due to the 
southwesterly winds blowing parallel to the mountains. For now, will 
continue with the High Wind Watch for late tonight into Sunday 
morning.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...

Drier and slightly cooler weather will begin on Sunday as the 
frontal system has moved off to the east. Breezy conditions will be 
the biggest weather on Sunday as air tries to fill in behind the 
front. Strongest winds will be early Sunday into the daylight hours, 
and will eventually begin to decrease after the sun sets.

Dry weather is then forecasted for several days as we start the next 
work week, and generally zonal flow in the mid levels of the 
atmosphere lead to near normal conditions for this time of year. 
Models then indicate that there may be another weather system to 
move through the area at the end of the week or over the weekend. 
Large differences between the long term models, so will keep low end 
precipitation chances at the end of the week and into the weekend. 
However, hopefully once models come into better agreement the 
duration of the PoP chances can be decreased.

.DISCUSSION...

Many updates to the forecast tonight with additional chances of
heavy rainfall. Additionally, high winds across the mountain 
zones Saturday night is beginning to look increasingly likely. 
Overall, temperatures were on track and am not planning any 
updates. Skies remained cloudy tonight while the main axis of 
rainfall, aligned along a zone of enhanced 850mb convergence, 
continues to lift northward. To the south, a warm front analyzed 
across northern Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi continues its 
northward movement with a poleward transport of low level 
moisture. Area radar shows an area of heavy rainfall forming again
across north Mississippi and west Tennessee along and ahead of 
the front aided by an 850mb jet and associated warm air 
advection. Closer to our CWA, areas of rainfall are starting to 
fill in and will continue to push northward into southern 
Tennessee. Latest short term and hi-res models indicate a band of 
enhanced rainfall along the advancing warm front. The main 
differences in models are where exactly the axis of greater 850mb 
winds will set up. The HRRR is more east with this zone, and as a 
result places the heavier QPF axis further into the MRX CWA. The 
NAM is a bit further west, which keeps the higher QPF totals 
closer to middle Tennessee, although higher totals are still seen 
across the Cumberland Plateau. No matter these differences, it 
seems increasingly likely that heavy rainfall will move back into 
the region in the morning hours with heavy precipitation rates 
given the strength of upper level diffluence and accompanied low 
level convergence along the front. As of this update, 1-3 inches 
of additional rainfall seems possible across the Plateau area. 
While instability looks limited, any elevated convection could 
enhance rainfall rates, and contribute to additional amounts of 
rainfall. These areas have already seen plenty of rainfall, and 
any additional rain could cause flooding. As a result, have 
extended the flood watch timing through Saturday night and added a
couple of additional counties to better match the forecasted QPF 
axis. 

The other item of interest was to issue a high wind watch for the
mountain zones Saturday night. The orientation of 850mb winds is
not favorable for a true mountain wave event, however, enhanced
850mb winds in excess of 50-60 knots in addition to an enhanced
pressure gradient would support high winds across the mountains.
The updated zones have already been published.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
The highlight of the short term period continues to be prolonged 
moderate (at times heavy) rainfall oriented across the TN valley in 
association with an old frontal axis, and beneath the entrance 
region of an upper jet.  The H85 front looks to have been much the 
focus this morning/afternoon for areas along/north of I40, 
especially into the northern valley/plateau and southwest VA.  This 
feature looks to continue advecting northward through the day, while 
the surface front and associated frontogentic forcing works 
northward as well out of northern GA/AL.  With that, precipitation 
should become more showery in nature through the evening/overnight 
as it spreads northward, while areas southward in the lower 
valley/plateau gradually dry out behind the front.  Thus the fcst 
features slightly lowering pops northward this afternoon while pops 
increase across the south, with this region of increased pops 
sweeping northward overnight.  Guidance continues to suggest 
enhanced QPF mainly north of I40 through late morning tomorrow as 
the surface warm front slowly meanders northward into WV/KY.  

All in all, given moist profiles and slow moving boundaries 
additional areal flooding cannot be ruled out given poor antecedent 
conditions yielding continued very low FFGs. Likewise, various 
rivers/streams remain in action/flood stages.  Thus, opted to 
segment the Flood Watch which currently ends at 7AM, extending the 
northern (I40 north) segment through noon Saturday.  Otherwise, pops 
taper from the south to north through the day Saturday, possibly 
allowing that big glorious ball of radiation to show itself once 
again!  Of course, that will be temporary as the subsequent cold 
front approaches tomorrow night. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
Deepening, increasingly negatively tilted, upper trough will be 
making its way from the Central Plains region Saturday night 
through the Great Lakes by mid day Sunday. The system will bring a
close to the never ending moist southwest flow regime as a drier 
mean westerly flow finally develops across the Southeastern U.S. 
for at least a couple days. Showers and even a few thunderstorms 
will accompany the frontal passage Saturday night. A few light 
showers may hang around across Southwest Virginia and Northeast 
Tennessee through mid day Sunday behind the boundary however, much
of the rain will be over before daybreak. It looks like we will 
enjoy that dry period on Monday and Tuesday with some uncertainty 
in the remainder of the forecast. Differences in the Canadian, 
American, and European models concerning short wave energy and 
associated surface cold frontal systems dropping southeast out of 
the Central Canadian provinces will be the reason for the forecast
uncertainty. The current forecast keeps a slight chance for rain 
in this mid week period, with a little higher chance pops toward 
the end of the extended with the possibility of the southern 
branch of the jet becoming more active later Thursday into Friday.
Due to the prevailing mean flow remaining generally westerly 
through the period, temperatures will remain near normal for late 
February through the extended forecast.

Another round of restrictive tafs this cycle as MVFR/IFR
dominates. Moisture associated with a slowly northward migrating
frontal axis continues to yield light/moderate shra and thus low
cigs/visb. This will be variable at all sites associated with 
rounds of precipitation moving through, thus shra/vcsh timing 
attempts to highlight those periods based on cam guidance. Some 
relief from precipitation and possibly low restrictions is 
expected late in the period on Saturday morning as the warm front 
lifts northward. Winds will predominately hold out of the north 
and remain in the 6-12 kts range today/tonight at all sites,

.DISCUSSION...
Scattered to widespread light/moderate rainfall continues to 
traverse the region this afternoon. Pops were updated to reflect 
latest obs/camguide trends which favor northward lifting of the 
H85 front which is currently oriented norther of I40/I81. Thus 
pops are slowly allowed to lower through the afternoon for these 
areas, while holding/increasing across the southern Valley/Plateau
through the afternoon as the surface warm front approaches from
the south. Otherwise, t/td and winds look to remain in line with 
previous fcst. Therefore, no other sig changes for this late

234 AM EST Fri Feb 22 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Current longwave pattern features a trough across the Four Corners 
region with a ridge extending from Florida into the Great Lakes. The 
upper level ridge axis is just to the east of the forecast area with 
southwesterly flow aloft. Several shortwaves troughs are forecast to 
traverse the area throughout the short-term forecast period keeping 
PoPs elevated. At the surface, there is an E-W surface boundary that 
is located across MS/AL/GA into the Carolinas. Radar imagery 
indicates scattered to numerous showers with best coverage currently 
across the northern Cumberland Plateau into southwest Virginia. 
Rainfall rates have been light early this morning with rates of less 
than a tenth of an inch per hour for most locations. Regardless, 
with the saturated ground, any additional rainfall could lead to 
additional areas of flooding.

For today, a 150-160 kt jet will stretch from the Ohio River Valley 
eastward into the northern Atlantic. This will put the forecast area 
in the favored right entrance region for divergence aloft. At 500 
mb, several shortwave troughs will traverse the area today. Models 
indicate the best lift during the day will be around 12-15z as one 
of the stronger shortwaves moves through with decent frontogentical 
forcing. The higher rainfall totals during this timeframe will be 
along and south of I-40. Starting to see some of this enhancement on 
current radar imagery across northern Mississippi and Alabama with 
this expected to move in around or shortly after daybreak. Higher 
rainfall rates associated with this increased lift, will result in 
continued flooding. Models back off a bit on the amount of lift late 
this morning into the afternoon as the upper jet tracks further to 
the east. Regardless, PW values remain elevated in the 1.1-1.3 inch 
range and expect scattered showers will continue for much of the day 
but hard to pinpoint an area of higher precipitation chances or 
rainfall totals during this timeframe. 

The front to the south begins to surge northward tonight as the 
upper level trough moves into the southern Plains. At the surface, 
the wedge to the east of the mountains will impeded the fronts 
northern progress. The focus for forcing and precipitation overnight 
will be across the northern Cumberland Plateau and southwest 
Virginia to the north of the boundary. Overnight, expect an 
additional inch or so of rain will be possible for these areas 
exacerbating ongoing flooding issues. Further to the south, rain 
chances will actually begin to decrease as the front moves 
northward. Overnight temperatures should remain rather steady and 
will even rise slightly across southern portions of the area with 
lows in the upper 40s and low 50s for most locations.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...

Frontal boundary that has been the focus for widespread showers 
should be lifting northward around the TN/KY border. Most of the 
Eastern Tennessee Valley should see a decent break in the rain on 
Saturday afternoon into the evening. However, another round of rain 
will quickly come in from the west as a low moves across the Great 
Lakes region and sweeps a cold front through the area Saturday and 
into Sunday. Ahead of the front a strong southerly/southwesterly low 
level jet will ramp up over the area. Core of the jet will likely 
have winds around 50-60 knots. This will cause gusty conditions, 
especially in the higher terrain near the core of the jet. Even if 
winds at the surface don't get that strong we could see some damage 
to trees due to all the rain saturating the soil.

Another factor to watch with this front will be the possibility for 
thunderstorms Saturday into Sunday. Stronger storms will likely be 
ongoing across Middle Tennessee and will eventually make their way 
into the Eastern Tennessee Valley Saturday night. Severe weather 
parameters don't really line up too well in our area, but if storms 
are able to maintain strength across Middlle Tennessee they could 
tap into the low level jet and bring damaging winds down towards the 
surface. Confidence is relatively low for a severe threat, but will 
want to keep an eye on this aspect of the system.

Once the front finally moves through colder and (FINALLY) drier 
weather will set up for several days. Semi-zonal flow sets up 
through the middle of the week, and precipitation chances stay at 
bay until the second half of the upcoming work week. A weak system 
looks to zip across the area Wednesday/Thursday, but at this time 
QPF amounts look pretty light. Hopefully the second half of the 7-
day forecast gives everyone a chance to dry out.

.DISCUSSION...
Satellite and radar show increasing convection over northern
Mississippi and Alabama. This activity is located along elevated
fronto-genetic band which is being maintained and strengthed by
the right entrance region of the upper jet. SPC Meso-analysis
shows strong moisture transport into this boundary with PWs of 1.4
inches or more south of the boundary. 

High resolution models depict a band of moderate to heavy rain 
with embedded thunder intensifying along the Alabama/Tennessee 
state-line and move east northeast into the southern half of 
Tennessee early Friday morning the moving over the rest of the 
area through Friday. 

Given the high freezing levels, favorable warm rain process is
expected, especially over the southern areas overnight. High
rainfall rates are anticipated. Rainfall in excess of 2 inches 
possible over the southern Plateau and southeast Tennessee which 
will cause significant flash flood concerns there.

Mostly MVFR/IFR/LIFR through this TAF period. Persistent moisture 
transport into an elevated fronto-genetic boundary will produce 
periods of rain, some moderate to heavy, through the period. Models 
show boundary layer staying generally saturated producing low

.DISCUSSION...
Quick update to start the Flood Watch at 7 PM ET. The latest HRRR
and radar shows an area of moderate to locally heavy rains already
developing over northern Alabama. This area will move across
southeast Tennessee this evening. A stronger fronto-genetic band
of showers and possibly thunderstorms will form over northern
Alabama after midnight and move across east Tennessee. Significant
flooding/flash flooding is likely from early Friday morning
through the day. Potential life threatening flooding is possible.

Very concerned that given the very saturated ground and high
stream flows (some out of their banks) that the return of moderate
to heavy rains will cause serious flooding.

334 PM EST Thu Feb 21 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Saturday Morning)...
The upper pattern this afternoon is highlighted by deep troughing
out west, while ridging centered over the western Atlantic 
extends westward across the southeast CONUS. With that, weak 
shortwave impulses continue to eject from the trough base over TX,
eventually sliding northward along/atop a quasistationary frontal
axis laid across the TN valley and southern Appalachians. 
Moisture remains prevalent as regional observed/forecast soundings
continue to favor pwats above the 90th percentile, approaching 
daily maxes. The aforementioned quasistationary surface warm front
looks to slowly slide northward through the overnight into 
Friday, with guidance favoring rather robust QPF along the more 
northern H85 front. QPF totals through Saturday morning will 
ranges from around 1 to 1.5 inches across the central/northern 
mountains and foothills of east Tennessee, with higher amounts 
further west topping out in the 2 to 3 inch range. 

These totals combined with poor antecedent conditions yield rather 
low FFG values regionwide, however especially in the areas noted 
above to receive the most QPF.  Thus, opted for another Flood Watch 
that will start at midnight tonight, running through 7AM Saturday 
morning.  Some additional areal flooding is expected through this 
period, which could result in road closures and even additional 
debris flows (landslides) on steeper slopes. Lastly, area rivers 
continue to rise to bank full levels, with numerous forecast points 
expected to reach/exceed minor flood stage.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...
A slowly, northward, lifting frontal boundary will still be in 
place across the area on Saturday morning. Models in decent 
agreement that the boundary should be north of I-40 and centered 
somewhere around the TN/KY state line. This boundary will provide 
focus for moderate to heavy rain until it finally lifts northward 
into KY by late Saturday morning/early afternoon. Areas along the 
state line and up into southwest VA can expect to pick up 0.25 to 
0.5 inches of rainfall Saturday morning before the boundary lifts 
north. Once the boundary does lift north, the rest of the day will
be fairly dry with only chance POPs in place for light scattered 
showers as we will be deeper into the warm sector. Highs will 
climb into the upper 50s to mid 60s as a strong southwest 850 mb 
jet cranks up through the day. This will allow for gusty winds 
across the higher elevations.

The strongest part of the jet comes through around 00z Sunday 
through 09Z Sunday. During this time a 60 to 70kt 850 mb jet will be 
in place. A wind advisory will eventually be needed for the high 
terrain and perhaps a high wind watch. A line of showers and storms 
move into the area ahead of and along the cold front Saturday night 
through early Sunday morning. Storms will be weakening as the enter 
our area from out of middle TN as instability isn't that impressive 
across our area. Though we will have an inversion in place, any 
convection or heavier showers could possibly transport some of the 
higher winds aloft down to the surface. This will be the greatest 
threat Saturday night, isolated damaging wind gusts. The front 
pushes through Sunday morning with clearing conditions by afternoon 
and cooler air moving in.

Drier air in place Sunday through Tuesday with DRY WEATHER expected. 
Moisture increases Tuesday night through Wednesday as a weak wave 
moves across to our south, this will give us another shot of some 
showers but QPF looks light. We dry out on Thursday as the system 
pushes east.

.DISCUSSION...
Made a few minor tweaks to pops this morning to account for recent
coverage and latest model guidance trends. Biggest change this
morning was to go ahead with a new Flood Watch across the entire
region as additional moderate to heavy rainfall is forecast to
sweep across the area over the next 36 hours as the warm front
slowly meanders northward. This Flood Watch starts at midnight
tonight and runs through Saturday morning.  Further updates will 
follow.

246 AM EST Thu Feb 21 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Rain continues to be the main focus for the forecast. Currently
the heaviest and most widespread rain is along the frontal
boundary that has stalled out across Northern Georgia into South
Carolina. Depending on where/how this frontal boundary moves, it
will remain the location for the most widespread rain showers.
High resolution models keep the boundary relatively stationary as
of early this morning. But that doesn't mean we won't see rain 
away from the front. Waves of showers will be possible away from 
the front, but chances decrease pretty quickly as you head north 
and west away from the frontal boundary. Instability this 
afternoon looks to be enough, especially near the boundary, that 
we could once again see a few rumbles of thunder.

Rain chances will remain across most of the area, but hopefully
many places get a break from rainfall today, and a brief chance to
dry out.

Shortwave will ride up along the front tonight into tomorrow. This
will mean some of precipitation will move back towards Eastern 
Tennessee Valley. And with little time to dry out from previous 
rain, there is the chance to (once again) see flooding over 
locations that have recently received continuous rainfall over the
past couple of weeks. 

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)... 
A band of frontogenetic forcing along with PW values around 1.3 
inches will be over the area through the day on Friday, further 
exacerbating the ongoing flooding problems as widespread amounts are 
expected to exceed one inch. A Flood Watch will likely be needed for 
that period, but will hold off on that for now as the day shift will 
have a better feel for how rivers are responding to the relative 
precip lull today, and still have 24 hours of lead time. 

The trend through Saturday will be a northward shift of the greatest 
forcing, mainly across srn KY and SW VA on Friday night, then into 
nrn KY/WV on Saturday. While a very moist air mass will remain, 
Saturday should provide a brief period of lower rain chances and QPF 
amounts. That changes on Saturday night as a low pressure system 
tracks NE from MO to the Great Lakes, pushing a cold front through 
the area. A 50-60 kt LLJ will advect high theta-e air in the 330K 
range, while forcing aloft increases as the jet streak moves into 
the OH Valley. A slight chance of thunderstorms will be mentioned 
this period, and another half to 1 inch of precip is expected. The 
passage of the cold front is expected around 12Z Sunday. 

A much needs dry period with temperatures closer to normal is on 
track for Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. Model disagreement increases 
after that time, but the general consensus is that a trough and 
upper jet will be moving across southern Canada and the Great Lakes, 
which may bring a return of some low rain chances on Wednesday.

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
343 PM EST Wed Feb 20 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...

Heavy rainfall is the main topic in the short term period.  
Currently across the forecast area skies were cloudy with 
temperatures in the upper 40’s to mid 50’s.  The warmest areas 
where near the foothills of the Smokys where downslope conditions 
have caused temperatures to warm up quicker than other locations.
Current radar shows a solid band of rainfall from the Southern 
Mississippi valley north through the Tennessee valley. The upper 
levels are characterized by lower heights across the western CONUS
and Plains with higher heights across the eastern CONUS. The main
synoptic feature to note is the potent shortwave trough quickly 
ejecting northeast into the Great Lakes amplifying the upper 
pattern. Closer to the surface, an area of low pressure was 
analyzed across eastern Mississippi with a parent low across the 
Midwest. A cold front extends from the Midsouth low southward 
through the Gulf Coast, with a warm front across southern Alabama
and the Florida panhandle.  

The current band of rainfall has been situated along an zone of 
enhanced 1000-925mb frontogenesis. However, warming cloud tops and
a weakening potential temperature gradient suggests low level 
forcing is beginning to weaken. Further, the dynamic shortwave
trough is quickly ejecting northeast weakening upper level
support. This supports what hires model data suggests, which is a
weakening trend in the coverage of precipitation this afternoon 
and evening. Moisture still remains high with precipitable water 
values in excess of 1.5 and near boundary layer mixing ratio’s 
greater than 8 to 9 g/kg. While synoptic lift remains marginal at 
best, low level frontogenesis and convergence should support 
likely PoPs through the evening and overnight before the boundary 
moves out of the area. Forecast soundings support a marginal 
chance of elevated convection this afternoon with only a few 
hundred joules of CAPE generated by models. Latest lightning data
shows a gradual decrease in convective activity this afternoon 
which matches closely with the latest mesoanalysis MUCAPE with 
better values south and west of the forecast area. However, if 
thunderstorms could develop than this would exacerbate the 
flooding threat with increased rainfall rates in areas that have 
low flash flood guidance. The ongoing flood watch looks to be in 
great shape and no changes will be needed. 

As mentioned in the previous updated forecast discussion, have
extended the high wind warning, and wind advisory through 04Z
tonight. The low level jet should still be positioned in an area
that would support high winds in the higher elevations of the
Smokys. Tomorrow should be mostly dry as a surface high pressure
to the north pushes the low level boundary southward. However,
this high will move back northeast allowing the low level boundary
to begin to push northward by Thursday night. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
 

Thursday night a warm front will be lifting northward through the 
area. This is the same boundary that came through earlier in the day 
on Thursday. The warm front advancing back northward is in response 
to the cyclone developing across the Four Corners states and the 
area of high pressure off to our southeast. Models are coming into 
better agreement that this boundary stalls somewhere across the area 
on Friday, providing focus for another round of moderate to possibly 
heavy rainfall. It is very difficult to say exactly where this 
boundary sets up but wherever it does is key to where the heaviest 
precip will occur. It looks like another 1 to 1.5 inches of rainfall 
is possible along the boundary from Thursday night through late 
Friday evening. Areas further away from the boundary will see lesser 
rainfall amounts, around 0.5 to 0.75 inches. We will have to watch 
the boundary location closely as any moderate to heavy rain that 
occurs has the potential to cause additional flooding. If models 
still show the boundary stalled across our area over the next few 
runs a flood watch may be needed during the day on Friday for some 
areas. 


Friday night through Saturday morning there is greater model 
uncertainty regarding the movement of the boundary. The NAM lifts 
the boundary north into KY Friday evening whereas the GFS keeps it 
along the TN/KY state line. At some point from Friday night through 
Saturday morning the boundary does push north and gives us a brief 
break from the moderate to heavy rainfall as we get deeper into the 
warm sector. The break is short-lived though as the aforementioned 
cyclone is moving in from out of the plains along with its 
associated cold front. Southerly winds increase out ahead of the 
front as the 850 mb jet strengthens. Gusty winds likely across the 
high terrain from Saturday through Saturday night. The front pushes 
through Saturday night into Sunday morning bringing another line of 
showers and perhaps a few rumbles of thunder, but not confident 
enough at this point to put thunder in the forecast. Another 0.5 to 
0.75 inches of rain is possible with the precip associated out ahead 
of and along the frontal passage. Storm total rainfall from Thursday 
night Through Saturday night ranges from around 1 inch up to 2.5 
inches.

Sunday through Tuesday looks drier as we are in northwest flow. Late 
Tuesday we return to a southwest flow as high pressure develops to 
our east. Another shot of precip moves in for Tuesday night through 
Wednesday as another cold front pushes through the area.

.AVIATION...

A very active aviation forecast for the 18Z TAF cycle. Currently
CHA is currently seeing IFR conditions with a low cloud deck.
Otherwise, TYS and TRI are VFR with downslope conditions being 
observed on satellite imagery and metar data. Through this 
afternoon CIGS will begin to deteriorate this afternoon and 
overnight associated with increasing chances of rain. Further, 
given the strength of the low level jet, some wind shear could 
become an issue greater than 2,000 feet. Reduced CIGS should carry
over into Thursday with IFR to MVFR conditions expected.

.DISCUSSION...

A lot to discuss in this forecast update. The main updates were to
match temperatures closer to current obs and trends. Updated wind
grids to account for latest wind obs, and short term model trends.
Further, based on radar trends, updated PoP's and Wx grids.

Currently, most of the area was dry with the exception of the
Cumberland Plateau where light to moderate rain was falling. A 15Z
surface analysis places an area of surface low pressure north of
Jackson, Mississippi, with a cold front extending south into the 
Gulf Coast. A warm front extended from this low east and south 
into the Florida panhandle. Further north across our area, a weak 
frontal boundary was draped north of this low through middle 
Tennessee with regional radar imagery showing an area of light to 
moderate rainfall aligned along this boundary. Further, this area 
of rainfall matches well with enhanced frontogenesis in a surface 
to 925mb layer. This area of rainfall will need to be watched 
closely for any flooding problems. Along this diffuse boundary, 
moisture remains high with precipitable water values in excess of 
1.25 inches across middle Tennessee. Enhanced low level 
convergence along this boundary in combination with upper level 
divergence due to a shortwave trough moving across the Midwest 
should continue to support moderate to heavy rainfall. The best 
chances will likely occur west of I-75. 

Additionally, a strong low level jet has led to strong winds in 
the higher elevations of the Smoky Mountains. Expect these winds 
to continue through this evening before the jet finally moves 
north out of the area by tonight. Based on this, have extended the
current high wind warning and wind advisory through 04Z.

242 AM EST Wed Feb 20 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A brief lull in precipitation is occurring early this morning as 
the heavier precipitation shield dissipates and continues to move 
northeastward out of the Tennessee Valley. But during this brief 
break in the rainfall, we won't get to experience much in the way 
of sunshine before the next round begins, so little drying is 
expected to occur meaning the flooding risk will still be
relatively high. That next round of rain will come as a frontal 
boundary moves in from the west this afternoon into the overnight 
hours. 

There is enough instability with this system that
we could see another round of thunderstorms along the frontal
boundary. This second round of rain will also continue the
flooding threat that the area has been dealing with. With the
possibility of thunderstorms comes the possibilty that some 
places could see brief heavy rainfall under a storm... So flash 
flooding will be the primary concern later today into the 
overnight hours. Thus we will continue with the Flood Watch until 
Thursday morning. Precipitation chances will remain the lowest in
the foothills of the mountains where we could see some downsloping
winds keep the rain at bay for a while.

In addition to rainfall a strong low level jet streak will move
across the area today. Strongest winds will be in the higher
elevations, and especially in the foothills of the Southern
Appalachian Mountains where mountain wave winds may bring strong
wind gusts. High wind warnings and wind advisories are in effect
today for the higher elevations of the mountains and the adjacent
foothills that typically see the strongest winds during these
types of events. 

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...
The wet pattern will continue through the end of the week, but there 
is some uncertainty regarding the finer details of the location of 
the heaviest rainfall, as the models are not in agreement. The 
general pattern is that the 850 mb thermal/convergence boundary near 
our southern border on Thursday will push back to the north as the 
Atlantic ridge builds and a trough moves into the Plains. The GFS
favors an axis of highest QPF across our southern tier on 
Thursday through Friday, while the NAM, SREF, and ECMWF favor the 
northern areas. Will lean the forecast toward the latter solution.
Eventually the GFS catches up and takes the strongest QG forcing 
to our north on Saturday. The track of the low pressure system 
across the Upper MS Valley and Great Lakes on Saturday night will 
put us firmly in the warm sector, and with a 50+ kt LLJ and upper
jet streak over the OH Valley, thunderstorms will be a 
possibility. 

These model disagreements lead to a low confidence QPF forecast and 
flooding potential. However, as we have been saying for several 
days, it will not take much rain at all to produce flooding problems 
as any precip will quickly run off. Flooding will likely continue to 
pose a threat through Saturday for at least portions of the area. 

A cold frontal passage on Sunday morning will finally bring a 
period of dry conditions through Monday, with a NW low level flow
and a nearly zonal flow through the mid and upper levels. The 
models hint at a weak shortwave trough passage on Tuesday that 
will warrant a chance PoP returning to the forecast.

.DISCUSSION...We will remain in a wet and active weather pattern 
for the rest of the night as a warm front lifts north across the 
Southern Appalachian Region.  Elevated instability has allow isolated 
thunderstorms to develop across far southern locations. The 
widespread rain showers along the front will transition into 
scattered light showers late tonight as the front lifts north of the 
area. Overnight lows are expected to fall below the freezing mark 
over far northeastern TN. This may allow for a few pockets of light 
freezing rain or even a rain/snow mix.  Any accumulations should be 
minimal and confined to higher terrain.  The main concern will 
continue to be the widespread rainfall tonight. With an already 
saturated ground...it will take little additional rain to create 
localized flooding of low lying areas and increase river and creek 
levels.  As a result...a Flood Watch is in effect tonight and will 
remain in effect through Thursday morning.  Also of concern is a 
strong 850MB jet moving over the region.  This feature will generate 
a strong wind field and create strong and gusty winds over the 
higher elevations of the East TN Mountains and a High Wind Warning 
and a Wind Advisory is in effect. All on track in the current 
forecast package...will update to remove the late afternoon period 
and add a mention of thunderstorms.

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
303 PM EST Tue Feb 19 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Wednesday night)...

An incoming warm front will continue moving over a low level wedge 
of cold air in the forecast area. The resulting isentropic lifting 
will produce a widespread area of continuous rain over the next few 
days. A number of areas, particularly higher in elevation, will see 
an initial leading edge of sleet from this precip shield, but as the 
air continues to saturate to wetbulb, the sleet will fully 
transition over to rain. A few mountainous areas for some of the 
more northeastern counties could see a small amount of ice 
accumulation overnight.

While the majority of the rain will be light in intensity, we can 
expect a period of moderate rainfall for Tuesday evening as the warm 
front continues to lift towards the north. The second period of 
moderate rain will be early Thursday morning as the rain transitions 
to showers as the cold front moves in from the west. The front will 
be slow to push the rain out of eastern Tennessee, as it transitions 
to more of a stationary boundary and sets up the next round of rain 
that we'll see going into the later half of the week. The current 
system does seem to be setting up more towards the west and north of 
the forecast area. As a result the previous few model runs have been 
trending downward in regard to the total rainfall amounts. The 
potential for flooding still exists for the forecast area, with 
greater rainfall amounts expected for the more southern counties. 
Over running banks of creeks and rivers is possible along with 
ponding of low laying areas and runoff along paved surfaces.

The second major consideration for the short term forecast is the 
high wind threat for the mountains and foothills in eastern 
Tennessee. Strong southeasterly flow will create considerable 
mountain wave and downsloping winds for the eastern counties along 
the Smokey's and southern Appalachian mountains. The winds for these 
areas are expected to increase starting Tuesday night and continue 
through Wednesday finally dying down early Wednesday night as the 
predominant wind direction shifts more towards the south
southwest.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...

A break from the rain is expected for most of the region Thursday as 
the active frontal boundary and associated fronto-genetic forcing 
weakens and shifts off to the south and east. Have held onto higher 
pops across far southeast TN and southwest NC into the afternoon 
where forcing lingers over a longer duration, but these rain showers 
should be on the light side. Temps Thursday will be pleasantly mild 
and could see breaks in the cloud cover, especially along the 
plateau and northern valley through southwest VA. Have used the 
CONSALL for temps.

Showers begin to return Thursday night and Friday as the old frontal 
boundary moves back north and isentropic lift develops associated 
with another surface low forming around LA/AR. Have chance pops 
increasing from S to N Thursday night becoming likely then 
categorical on Friday since the best forcing develops overhead on 
Friday. The NAM pushed this warm front and associated lift north 
into KY Friday night which would give a break from the showers while 
the GFS and ECMWF hold the boundary overhead causing rain to 
continue Friday night. Have kept likely pops as an early estimate. A 
strengthening 850 mb southwesterly jet will lead to PWATs increasing 
to 1.2-1.4 inches during this time, so periods of heavier rainfall 
are certainly possible in any of the showers. 

The above mentioned surface low will deepen rapidly as it moves 
northeast into the Midwest Saturday and Saturday night as the 
longwave trough to the west finally moves eastward and takes on a 
negative tilt. There will likely be a break in the showers Saturday 
as strong WAA pushes the warm front north with temps soring through 
the 60's, but models remain in some disagreement. Have held onto 
likely pops for now. A strong cold front looks to move through 
Saturday night bringing a more concentrated period of rain and 
possibly some thunderstorms with the strong wind field aloft and 
weak instability. 

Ridging finally takes control Sunday and Monday bringing dry and 
cooler conditions. The GFS and ECMWF both show another possible 
system in the Monday night through Tuesday timeframe, but with it 
being day 7 and plenty of time for change, have just introduced 
chance pops.

.AVIATION...

Approaching warm front will bring widespread rain and low 
ceilings to all terminals for the majority of the TAF period. 
Conditions are expected to be predominantly MVFR with conditions 
decreasing to IFR due to lowering ceilings. Strong southeasterly 
flow in the upper levels will interact with the mountains in 
eastern Tennessee that will create areas of low level wind shear 
overnight and into tomorrow at all stations. Conditions are 
expected to lift early tomorrow morning as the precip transitions 
from rain to showers as the cold front moves in from the west, but
FROPA for any of the stations is expected to be beyond the 
current forecast period.

.DISCUSSION...

A few updates to go over this morning. After looking over the
updated models for both the RAP and the NAM for winds, decided to
bump up the forecast for winds and wind gusts for Wednesday. With
strong southeasterly flow setting up to come across the Smokies
tomorrow, have issued a High Wind Warning and Wind Advisory for 
several counties in eastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia. 
The forecast for the incoming rain looks to still be on track for 
the moment, although further refinement is expected as past models
seem to be trending the QPF totals downward as the system looks 
to be setting up towards the west and north of the forecast area.

National Weather Service Morristown TN
336 AM EST Tue Feb 19 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Frontal boundary that will be a major player for the wet week
ahead will move northward into the area throughout the day today.
Precipitation is currently in Northern Georgia/Alabama, but will 
continue northward this morning. Reports from further south/southwest
of the area indicate there may be some light sleet mixed in with 
this early morning precipitation, but as temperatures continue to 
increase after sunrise, we will see predominately rain across the 
area. 

Rainfall rates will generally be light to moderate with scattered
showers today, but due to an abundance of rainfall over the past
couple of weeks we could see some flooding issues over the next 
several days. It's difficult to pinpoint if/when/where flooding 
may occur, but there are likely numerous low lying areas around 
the Eastern Tennessee Valley that may see minor flooding (possibly
as early as today) if a couple of rounds of heavy showers move 
over them. With that being said, there will be a flood watch that 
begins this evening and continues through early Thursday morning.
Flash Flood Guidance values hint that a couple of inches of 
rainfall over a few hours may lead to flooding issues, which again
is possible in isolated locations if they get unlucky enough to be
under a few rounds of storms. Some of these scattered showers 
today may bring with them a rumble of thunder as warmer and more 
unstable air moves in along the front. Instability is relatively 
low, but will mention the chance for thunderstorms in the forecast
for late this afternoon into the evening hours. 

In addition to the rains coming with this system we will see
gusty winds, specifically in the higher elevations of the Southern
Appalachian Mountains tonight into tomorrow. Will continue with a
High Wind Watch for the mountainous areas tonight into tomorrow,
as models are still shifting around the axis of strongest winds
and rainfall with this system. Regardless of whether or not the 
strict criteria for a high wind warning/advisory is met there is 
still a good chance that we see several reports of downed trees 
simply due to how saturated the grounds are, which leads to 
falling trees much more easily.

Finally we could also see a wintry mix of precipitation overnight
tonight into early tomorrow morning in the higher elevations of
far Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia. Warmer 
temperatures with this front will reach these locations last which
means they will remain colder for longer. Model soundings suggest
that a mix of winter precipitation is possible, but also that 
amounts of winter weather remain relatively light. Some locations 
could see a dusting up to a half inch of snowfall and possibly a 
brief period of freezing rain before sunrise.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...

The downward trend of lower QPF amounts through the weekend 
continues with the latest model runs, although the threat of 
flooding will remain due to high river levels and saturated soils. 
The timing of the heaviest rain appears to be coming into better 
focus, with Wednesday afternoon/evening, Friday night, and 
Saturday night being the expected periods of highest PoP/QPF. 

Wednesday will open with a warm advection pattern from a strong 
southerly 850 mb LLJ of 50-60 kts. This could produce high winds in 
the mountains and adjacent foothills in the morning hours. The main 
precip axis at this time will be across Middle TN and KY, with 
downslope drying/warming for the central and northern TN Valley. As 
the upper jet and surface cold front approach, we will see a surge 
of higher theta-e air into the area late Wednesday and into the 
night, and PoPs will rise to categorical. Elevated instability and 
upper divergence will warrant a mention of thunderstorms this 
period. With rain amounts on Wednesday night expected to be around 1 
inch (mainly for the southern and central portions of the area), and 
FFG expected to be in that range, the Flood Watch will go to 
12Z to cover that period.

The cold front settles to our south and high pressure builds into 
the area on Thursday, which should result in a dry day for most of 
the area, with the possible exception of the extreme southern tier. 
This does not last very long however, as a low develops in the 
Plains and the Atlantic ridge retrogrades slightly, bringing the 
front and another moisture surge northward on Friday. Isentropic 
lift will produce categorical PoPs on Friday afternoon and night. 
However, rain amounts do not appear particularly heavy as the 
southerly LLJ is not particularly strong. Confidence lowers after 
that time, as the GFS and ECMWF differ in the northward push of the 
boundary, which will affect rain chances and QPF on Saturday. Both 
show a cold frontal passage occurring Saturday night, followed by
dry and air ridging for Sunday and Monday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...

A drier outlook to the short term forecast today with a strong 
inversion in place over the forecast area. Cloud cover is expected 
to become more scattered in the evening, then build back in 
overnight. A few low ceilings are possible for the morning as the 
lower cloud decks continue to build with the approaching warm front 
moving up from the south. The resulting isentropic lift will lead to 
areas of widespread light to moderate rain for Tuesday afternoon. 
Some localized areas of flooding are possible due to the still 
saturated ground, but it looks like the bulk of the rain will stay 
to the west of eastern Tennessee and move north of the forecast area 
into the week.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...

A very wet but 
overall mild week is still expected with areas of flooding, although 
the flood threat will be less widespread than earlier thought. 
Longwave troughing in the west and ridging off the east coast will 
keep the TN Valley in an active southwesterly deep layer flow 
pattern. This combined with an extremely strong upper level jet will 
lead to enhanced lifting of the copious amounts of moisture being 
transported into our region. The result will be a series of short 
wave troughs and surface lows moving northeastward through the TN 
and OH Valleys along a quasi-stationary front bringing waves of rain 
until a stronger shortwave next weekend finally moves the western 
trough eastward and forces the front to clear our region. Even 
though most of the rain will be light to moderate, the long duration 
will cause at least some flooding of creeks, rivers, streams, low 
lying and poor drainage areas, and basements. The above normal 
precipitation this winter has saturated the soil.

Isentropic lift along a warm front will produce a steady area of 
rain that will lift from S to N across the region Tuesday night. 
Freezing levels near 12 thousand feet, a strengthening LLJ, and PWATs 
around 1.2 inches will lead to periods of heavier rainfall rates, 
but the duration will be short lived as the forcing shifts northward 
rapidly after 06-08Z. Have categorical pops early decreasing to 
chance/likely for the second half of the night. A cold wedge is just 
deep enough for a light mix of sleet and freezing rain in Russell 
and Washington Counties, VA and extreme northeast TN Tuesday night 
before 09Z. A light ice accumulation could occur in these areas. WAA 
Wednesday with the warm front to our north and quasi-stationary cold 
front to the west will lead to mostly dry and pleasantly warm 
conditions much of the day. Have pops in the high end chance range 
until the front to the west and associated fronto-genetic forcing 
brings rain eastward into the region after 21Z. Increased pops to 
categorical for late Wednesday into Wednesday night. The front 
continues to progress faster in latest models, so it now only looks 
like a 6-8 hour window of decent rainfall rates. Have pops tapering 
to chance/likely after 06Z Thursday from W to E. The exception is 
extreme southeast TN and southwest NC where the boundary will stall 
and cause steady rain to persist through Thursday afternoon. QPF 
from Wednesday evening through Thursday afternoon should range from 
0.50 to 1.50 inches in much of southwest VA, the Plateau, and valley 
with some higher amounts around 2 inches across far southeast TN and 
southwest NC. These amounts are significantly lower compared to a 
couple of days ago and are low confidence due to run to run 
inconsistency among the guidance. 

High winds are likely in the peaks and foothills of the Smoky 
Mountains in far east TN Tuesday night through Wednesday. Southerly 
850 mb winds of 50-65 kts across the terrain, strongly negative 
Omega, and a duct function up to 24 C indicate this could be a 
classic mountain wave event. Have issued a High Wind Watch for the 
peaks and foothills of Greene County to Monroe. It is possible that 
an advisory will be needed farther north.

Another wave quickly developing on the active frontal boundary 
Thursday night will bring showers back to the region. Have fairly 
high pops returning to all areas Thursday evening through Friday 
night. The ECMWF and GFS are in decent agreement with this, but 
suspect there will be breaks in the rain during this time as 
isentropic ascent is usually forced northward when a low passes to 
our west.  

After a brief break Saturday, a strong shortwave is still progged to 
induce cyclogenesis in the Plains and Midwest which will move a 
strong, pattern changing cold front across the region. Slight timing 
differences continue among the guidance, but have likely pops 
spreading in Saturday night into Sunday afternoon. A strong LLJ and 
deep moisture ahead of this front, strong fronto-genetic forcing, 
and unseasonably high PWAT values once again will bring the 
potential for a period of heavy rainfall on top of saturated soil.  

Dry and colder weather will finally move in late Sunday through 
Monday.

Mostly VFR conditions for the TAF period today. The only exception
would be a brief drop to MVFR due to lower ceilings that will be
moving in and out of the terminals. TRI cities looks to have the
longest instance of lowered ceilings overnight while both TYS and
CHA will see a little more randomness to the lifting and building
clouds. Scattered decks between 2500 and 3000 ft look to stick
around for most of the period. While most of the incoming precip
looks to be just outside of the current forecast period, have
added the chance of some showers to the end of the CHA TAF since,
due to isentropic lifting, it looks like the next rain event will
arrive from the south and move towards the north as the warmer

432 AM EST Mon Feb 18 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A cold front is located across the TN Valley along the back edge 
of light to moderate precip. Extrapolation of the front takes it 
to our eastern border around 12Z, after which time all PoPs will 
be removed from the forecast. The difficulty for today's forecast 
will be how quickly low level clouds clear out. Dry air above 850 
mb builds in quickly this morning behind the front, but a strong 
inversion will likely keep clouds in place through the morning. A 
downslope wind off the Plateau complicates the matter, as it may 
cause partial clearing in the Valley. Will have a general trend of
decreasing clouds through the late morning and early afternoon. 
Temps will depend on the rate of cloud dissipation, but will keep 
highs within the bounds of the cooler NAM and the warmer GFS MOS. 
High and midlevel clouds return tonight as the flow aloft 
amplifies, but dry air below 700 mb should prevent precip from 
reaching the ground until after 12Z Tuesday.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...
Well, we're getting a nice mild mid to late February, complete 
with almost no snow at all, but we're going to pay for it with 
lots of liquid precipitation. The upper level pattern won't move 
too much in the next several days with mean troughing over the 
western states along with the ever present sub-tropical ridge over
the Western Atlantic. A significant short wave trough will drive 
northeast out of the Lower Mississippi Valley through the Upper 
Ohio Valley during the day Wednesday, as a powerful upper level 
jet forms around the periphery of the beloved Bermuda High. While 
the upper levels will be well supplied with Pacific moisture in 
this pattern, a tightening low level height gradient will help 
drag very high precipitable water off the Gulf of Mexico. Strong 
isentropic lifting, along with some thermodynamic instability will
lead to an increasing chance for showers and even a few 
thunderstorms later in the day Tuesday into Wednesday with 
continuation into Thursday morning as the battle front between 
Winter and Spring holds across the Southern Appalachian region. 
This boundary will probably slip just a little south of the 
forecast area Thursday into Thursday night allowing for a small 
break in the action. However, a gradually tightening height 
gradient between that sub-tropical high and another healthy short 
wavelength upper trough appears to pull that moisture lifting 
frontal boundary back across the forecast area later Friday night 
into Saturday, generating another period of moderate to possibly 
heavy rainfall. If all goes well, drier westerly flow behind this 
early weekend system may bring an end to the lengthy period of 
rain. Flooding is still very much a possibility across parts of 
the forecast area with the entire six day precipitation forecast 
indicating the highest totals across southern and western sections
of the forecast area ranging from around four to six inches with 
the "rain shadowed" northern and eastern sections picking up 
around two to three inches of rain. Additional highlights of this 
forecast are a small possibility of a brief period of light sleet 
in the chillier air in the higher terrain across Extreme Northeast
Tennessee and higher terrain across a small part of Southwest 
Virginia later Tuesday night. 

Additionally, at a minimum, advisory level winds are possible across 
the higher terrain later in the day Tuesday into Wednesday as the 
strengthening low level jet builds east across the area with the 
healthy short wave system.

cigs should settle into MVFR levels. By midday, the low clouds
should become scattered and return to VFR.

.DISCUSSION...

Widespread precipitation across the southern Appalachians this
evening. Rainfall amounts over the last 6 hours or so have ranged
from around 0.5-1.0 inches with the higher amounts across
southeast Tennessee and southwest North Carolina. The 500 mb
shortwave trough is currently located across the Tennessee River
Valley moving to the northeast. The surface cold front is now
moving off the Cumberland Plateau into the Valley. Widespread
precipitation will continue across the southern Appalchians
throughout the evening into the overnight hours. Latest radar
imagery indicates some enhancement across the northern Cumberland
Plateau and into southwest Virginia. These areas did receive the
higher rainfall totals earlier this morning and this will be an
area to watch for some localized flooding this evening and into
the overnight hours. Colder and drier air will advect in behind
the system later tonight leading to a rather abrupt cut off to the
precipitation around 08-10z for most locations. Temperatures will
drop off rather quickly late tonight with lows in the mid and
upper 30s.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday night)...

The current rain event looks to persist for the remainder of the
day and into tonight. Due to the isentropic lifting and falling
diurnal temperature for tonight the airmass looks to further
saturate, leading to heavy rainfall overnight. The soundings for
both Chattanooga and Knoxville show some increased convective
forcing tonight, so the chance of an overnight thunderstorm is
possible. Some higher elevation areas in southeastern Tennessee
and southwestern North Carolina could see up to 2 inches of rain
leading to some areas of ponding and runoff possible. The driving
cold front will sweep in tomorrow morning leading to an end to the
current period of rain and rapidly clearing skies. A greater
chance of flooding later in the week due to the increased ground
saturation from the current rain event and more rain predicted
later in the week.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...

A very wet but mild week is still expected leading to flooding 
concerns. Longwave troughing in the west and ridging in the east 
will keep the TN Valley in an active southwesterly deep layer flow 
pattern. This combined with an extremely strong southern stream 
upper jet, sampled at greater than 170 kts at 250 mb at Norman, OK 
and Wilmington, OH this morning, will lead to enhanced lifting of 
the copius amounts of moisture being transported into our region. 
The result will be a series of surface lows moving northeastward 
through the TN and OH Valleys along a quasi stationary front 
throughout the week bringing waves of rain until a stronger 
shortwave next weekend finally moves the western trough eastward and 
forces the front to clear our region. These periods of rainfall will 
not always be heavy, but the frequency of the rain through a long 
duration will undoubtably cause flooding of creeks, rivers, streams, 
low lying and poor drainage areas, and basements. Above normal 
rainfall over the past 2 months has completely saturated the soil, 
so all of this rain will be purely runoff with low FFG expected.

Tuesday will start off dry, but a surface low developing around LA 
and MS will bring a warm front and isentropic lift induced showers 
into the area during the afternoon. Have chance pops expanding from 
S to N after 18Z, but have likely to categorical expanding after 
21Z. As the warm front moves into KY Tuesday night and enhanced 
fronto-genesis band sets up over middle TN along the quasi-
stationary boundary, much of east TN, southwest VA, and southwest NC 
will eventually get into a dry slot, so have reduced pops to 
borderline chance/likely late at night through Wednesday morning. 
That boundary and fronto-genesis will slide east later Wednesday 
afternoon allowing steady rain to return to the area. Have 
categorical pops Wednesday afternoon through Wednesday night. A 
strong low-level jet bringing impressive moisture transport, and 
PWAT values in excess of 1.4 inches with freezing levels around 12 
thousand feet on projected soundings from CHA and TYS support some 
heavy rain with warm rain processes at this time. The good news is 
that the fronto-genesis band will be weaker and propagate faster 
across our region Wednesday evening and Wednesday night which will 
lead to lower rainfall rates compared to earlier forecasts. 

A period of high winds could occur in the peaks and foothills of the 
Smoky Mountain chain in far east TN Tuesday night through Wednesday 
morning. Southerly 850 mb winds of 50-65 kts across the terrain, 
strongly negative Omega, and a duct function of greater than 25 C 
indicate this could be a classic mountain wave event.

Not much of a break from the rain is expected Thursday as another 
wave quickly develops on the active frontal boundary with fronto-
genesis, 850 mb low-level jet, and theta e gradient continuing to 
focus rain over our region. At this early juncture, believe keeping 
likely to categorical pops Thursday and Thursday night is the best 
approach.  
  
Differences arise among the ECMWF and GFS for Friday. The previous 
GFS showed a break between waves and temporarily reduced the forcing 
and rainfall coverage Friday, while the ECMWF has shown continuous 
showers. The new GFS is closer to the ECMWF. Have chance to likely 
pops Friday and Friday night for now, but these may be adjusted 
upward later this week. 

There is good overall agreement that the western U.S. trough will 
eject northeastward into the Midwest Saturday inducing strong 
cyclogenesis near MO and IL. This will bring a final wave of forcing 
and strong cold front across the region sometime Saturday into 
Saturday night. Timing will likely change, but have likely to 
categorical pops returning during that period. Gradual drying is 
expected Sunday. Leaned toward the NAM/GFS blend for high and low 
temps early this week and Superblend mid week through the weekend.

Only a few minor changes to the forecast for the update this
morning. The mountains in eastern Tennessee will be rather windy
today with sustained wind speeds of up to 18 mph with higher
gusts. Widespread showers resulting from the isentropic lifting 
are expected throughout the day for the forecast area with a fair
amount of rain for the northern Cumberland plateau and the 
southern valley in particular. These areas could see over a half 
inch of rain within a 3 hour time window. Temperatures will slowly
rise through the day up into the 50's due to warm air advection 
from the warm front that came through earlier this morning.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Monday night)...
Two waves of precip will affect the area through today and tonight. 
The first will be associated with a low level warm frontal passage 
and isentropic lift that will move through this morning. While 
current radar shows precip across TN being mainly light and 
scattered in coverage, the models show lift strengthening and 
consolidating over N TN/S KY/SW VA. This area should have the 
highest QPF through 18Z, in the range of a half to 3/4 inch. The 
area of lift moves east by 18Z, but another area of increasing 
frontogenetic forcing and surface cyclogenesis across AL/MS will 
spread more precip across our area this evening. Categorical PoPs 
will be forecast late today and tonight, but the southern TN Valley, 
Smokies, and SW NC will likely have the highest QPF amounts as the 
surface low tracks across N AL/N GA and the SW-NE frontogenesis band 
sets up along the TN/NC border at 03Z, with a half inch to one inch 
expected. While flooding problems are not expected with these rounds 
of rain, they will create conditions that could enhance the 
potential for flooding later in the week.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Saturday)...
Model forecasts continue to show an extended period of deep 
moisture being lifted along an area of convergent south to 
southwesterly flow from later in the day Tuesday into early 
Thursday. Models pick up on another period of deep moist lifting 
in the never ending southwesterly flow pattern across the Southern
Appalachian region on Friday with a final push later Saturday 
into Sunday, as a well defined short wave drives east northeast 
out of Mid America through the Northeastern U.S. The resulting 
extended periods of moderate to sometimes heavy rainfall will lead
to flooding concerns mid to late week. The hydrologic outlook 
covers this period of expected flooding rain. While the extended 
forecast starts out with near to slightly below normal 
temperatures, a gradual warming trend will finish out the period 
with temperatures rise several degrees above normal during the 
latter half of the week.

.DISCUSSION...

An E-W oriented surface boundary is located to the south of the
area across the northern Gulf Coast. In the mid levels, there is 
a shortwave trough moving into the Tennessee River Valley. Flow at
850mb is from the southwest with a high to the southeast and a 
low to the northwest. Isentropic ascent will increase later 
tonight into Sunday morning north of the surface boundary. There 
is a wedge of cold air to the east of the mountains and this 
should help keep the surface boundary to the south of the forecast
area throughout the next 12-24 hours. Model soundings indicate 
that the low-levels will saturate later tonight with increased 
isentropic lift and there could be some drizzle late tonight 
before the widespread precipitation begins. The shortwave trough 
will move across the area near daybreak when showers are expected 
to become more widespread. For the update, increased cloud cover 
for the overnight period based on the current observations. Also, 
kept temperatures fairly steady in the upper 30s to mid 40s 
overnight with a gradual increase late tonight as the warm air 
advection increases. Rainfall totals over the next 24 hours will
range from around 0.75 to 1.5 inches.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

The short term period will essentially be part of the primer for 
what will be a long and rainy week to come.

Stratus has been slow to dissipate this afternoon, if at all. The
best erosion of the low cloud deck has actually been in our far
western NC counties where the inversion has had less of a hold on
things. Elsewhere, aside from some erosion due to downslope flow
in southwest Virginia and near the escarpment of the northern
plateau areas, stratus has held tight. Expect to see a slow fall
in temperatures tonight due to this cloud cover.

The main forecast item of concern in the short term is when will 
the rain arrive. The upper pattern tonight and into Sunday is
categorized by relatively zonal flow in the eastern CONUS, with
long wave troughing in the west. A shortwave trough will eject 
into the plains this afternoon, which will be what helps drive
precip forcing late tonight into Sunday morning. The strongest
forcing for ascent arrives just before dawn tomorrow and lasts
into the mid/late morning hours. Guidance suggests the heaviest 
rainfall will be over/west of the Cumberland Plateau region, but 
expect rainfall will be fairly widespread so will go with high
PoPs for this event. As mentioned, this will kind of be the primer
for what's to come over the next 5-7 days. Expect areas along the
plateau and possibly up into southwest Virginia to see rain totals
in the 0.70 - 1.00" range, with lesser amounts the further
south/east you go. Even still, a quarter to a half an inch of rain
can be expected in the mountainous areas.

Going back to the western and more rainy areas for tomorrow,
forecast soundings show just a small amount of positive buoyancy
basically above 850mb. Would not be surprised to hear a rumble of
thunder or two. Not sure it warrants inclusion in the forecast at
this time due to the likely very isolated nature of it.

With the passage of this initial shortwave, expect to see a lull
in precipitation from midday through the end of the period. Rain
showers will surely be present, but they should become much more
scattered in nature as forcing wanes. 


.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

A very active weather pattern through the extended with deep 
southwest flow due to an upper trough over the southwest United 
States and persistent Bermuda Ridge. Very significant flash flood 
event possible for mid to late next week.

For Sunday night, another jet streak moving across the Ohio Valley 
will place the southern Appalachians under the favored right 
entrance region enhancing lift over the region. This system moves 
out around daybreak Monday with total rainfall around 1 inch or so.

For Monday and Monday night, ridging will build into the Tennessee 
Valley and southern Appalachians producing a period of dry 
conditions.

Main flooding concern starts late Tuesday and Tuesday night. Strong 
upper jet becomes established over the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys 
with strong upper divergence over the area from Tuesday night 
through Wednesday night. The direct circulation around this jet 
enhances the fronto-genetic forcing over the area and intensifies 
the 850mb southerly jet pulling in unseasonably high moisture. PWs 
increase to 1.4 to 1.5 inches which is above the daily climatology 
maximum. Another concern is that freezing heights are quite high 
which are also well above the daily climatology maximum. Layer 
above freezing will be greater than 10kft over much of the area 
helping to produce high rainfall rates.

End result, another round of heavy rainfall over already saturated 
ground/high stream flows will set the stage for the potential of 
serious flash flooding concerns, especially over the Plateau, 
central-southern Tennessee, and southwest North Carolina. Will 
highlight this concern in the Hazardous Weather Outlook and 
Hydrologic Outlook.

The persistent southwest flow continues through the end of the week 
with the potential of additional moderate to locally heavy rains 
for Thursday through Saturday. Overall, a very wet pattern with 
flooding concerns continuing. 

River flooding looks to be a major problem as well from mid to late 
next week, possibly into the next weekend.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Sunday night)...
The shortwave trough bringing rain to the area this morning marks 
the beginning of an extended period of wet weather that could result 
in significant flooding problems for parts of the area by the middle 
of next week. 

This first system will be moving through fairly quickly as it is 
weakly amplified, with rain expected to exit the area by noon. A
few spots in Wise and Russell counties in SW VA could see a brief
rain/snow mix early this morning, so the SPS will be continued. 
Low level moisture trapped below an inversion will keep cloudy 
skies in place all day. NAM and GFS continue to show a big 
difference in high temps, but the forecast will lean toward the 
cooler NAM given the amount of cloud cover, low level NE flow, and
weak 850 mb cold advection behind the exiting system.

The next system will be associated with a slow-moving closed low 
over the Plains. The surface low tracks from MO to the OH Valley on 
Sunday, lifting a warm front through our area, with the resulting 
isentropic lift producing rain from late tonight through Sunday 
morning. Temps Sunday morning in SW VA and NE TN appear warm enough 
to have all rain in the Wx grids, although cold air damming sets up 
a tight temp gradient along the NC border. As the low tracks up the 
OH Valley, the trailing cold front will move across the area Sunday 
night, bringing enhanced lift that will produce moderate rain 
amounts in the southern sections, particularly SW NC. While 
widespread flooding problems are not expected with this system, the 
0.5 to 1 inch of QPF expected from it will help set up very moist 
ground conditions ahead of the upcoming systems in the long term.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Friday)...
Predictably better resolution of expected weather is seen in the 
Monday forecast period (where previously we were extending 
precipitation through this period; albeit with some limited 
decrease in pops) where it appears we can go with a drier period 
behind a departing wave. We should continue to see this "better 
model resolution" with individual short waves as we move closer to
the big rain event coming in the new week. 

At this time, model forecasts predict an initial moistening 
southwest flow with another wave of low pressure emerging out of 
the Lower Mississippi Valley into the Southern Appalachian region 
into Wednesday. This is where the atmospheric configuration 
basically stalls out well into Thursday with additional waves of 
lower pressure riding along a stationary frontal boundary situated
over the region. Flooding problems will be the result as the 
deep, moist southwest flow is lifted along the boundary. Tried to 
trim out some qpf in what will likely be an area of at least some 
rain shadowing across the Northern Great Valley into Southwest 
Virginia due to the downsloping regime that would occur in this 
scenario in this region. We will have to wait on future model runs
to better define this event, but it still appears that several 
inches of rain are possible through the entire seven day forecast 
period across the southern and western portions of the forecast 
area with emphasis in the terrain due to orographic lift. Model 
divergence definitely creeps into the latter part of the extended,
but lower probability for precipitation is expected later 
Thursday into Friday with a break in the action before a final 
system moves across the region moving into the weekend. Again, 
temperatures will be too warm for frozen precipitation through 
most of this forecast period.

Rain spreading across the area will keep predominant IFR cigs and
MVFR vis at all sites through the overnight hours. Rain is
expected to end by mid morning, and while vis will rise to VFR,
cigs in the MVFR range will likely linger, at least into the

.DISCUSSION...
Current GOES-16 satellite imagery and 0z RAOBs show an upper 
trough across the Eastern CONUS with a shortwave across the mid- 
Mississippi Valley. A strong upper jet stretches from the Central
Plains through the Tennessee Valley with good upper divergence
across the region. These factors, in combination with WAA and SW 
flow across the lower Mississippi Valley and Tennessee Valley, are
resulting in relatively strong omega and widespread precipitation across
much of the region.

Across our local area, surface observations show a distinct
surface cold front stretching NE to SW across East Tennessee and 
southwest Virginia. This front will slowly push southeast 
overnight with CAA in its wake. A surface low across the Lower 
Mississippi Valley will quickly move east tonight with an increase
in surface convergence late tonight and early Saturday morning to
the north and west of the low. The enhanced precipitation should 
be all rain across our area with the exception of the far northern
portions and higher elevations of Wise and Russell Counties in 
southwest Virginia where a wintry mix may be possible between
about 10z and 14z. Model soundings from LNP continue to show an 
elevated warm layer at around 850mb of around +2C to +3C which 
favors primarily IP. For this reason, added in some wintry mix to
the forecast in the higher terrain and far northern portions of 
our southwest Virginia counties. Any SN or IP accumulation is 
expected to be light and less than an inch, so will issue an SPS 
to highlight some localized impacts for Saturday morning in Wise 
and Russell.

Made other minor adjustments to grids based on recent 
observations and trends, and adjusted some hourly PoPs through 
Saturday morning.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
Atmosphere is moistening up this afternoon ahead of a weak cold 
front that is slowly moving in from the west northwest and 
extends back to the southwest into east Texas. A steady stream of 
moisture is moving across the southern Plains and southeast states
along and north of the front. Lower pressure along the front in 
east Texas and southern Arkansas will travel along the front 
tonight and move east of the Appalachians during the morning 
Saturday. Shortwave energy will increase as well as lift along and
near the front with mostly light to moderate rainfall overnight. 
Heaviest rainfall will be across southeast Tennessee and southwest
North Carolina. Rainfall amounts will be from about one half inch
northeast to one inch southwest. Colder air behind the front will
drop temperatures into the mid 30s along the Tennessee and 
Kentucky border possibly lower in southwest Virginia by Saturday 
sunrise with a small amount of snow or brief freezing rain near 
the border with KY and WV but little to no accumulation. Rain 
chances will be high but drop off early Saturday from the 
southwest to northeast. Low level moisture will stick around 
Saturday and with north to northeast winds prefer to follow closer
to NAM model highs in the 40s to lower 50s.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
An exceptionally wet long-term is expected which will come with 
the possibility of significant flooding. An increasingly positive 
NAO combined with a persistently negative PNA will lead to 
western CONUS longwave troughing and eastern CONUS longwave 
ridging over the next week, with a strong subtropical high 
centered in the vicinity of Bermuda. This is a classic pattern for
mild temps and wet weather across the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys,
and local research at our office shows that past heavy rainfall 
events in east TN, southwest VA, and southwest NC have occurred 
from such a pattern as southwesterly deep layer flow transports 
moisture from the Pacific and Gulf into our area. 

The first wave will bring showers late Saturday night through 
Sunday. 925-700 mb theta e advection and moisture flux should 
strengthen in response to a 130-145 kt 300 mb jet streak overhead 
allowing for isentropic lift along a warm front. Have temps slowly 
rising after 06Z. Showers will develop with this lift prior to dawn 
Sunday morning. Most of these should be light. There could be a 
break in the shower coverage mid to late morning before rain fills 
in again ahead of a weak cold front during the afternoon and 
evening. There are some QPF differences among the NAM, GFS, ECMWF, 
SREF, and WPC, but QPF should generally be a few tenths of an inch 
to just under an inch on Sunday with the greatest amounts from the 
southern valley through southwest NC. Have chance pops expanding 
after 06Z Sunday with likely much of Sunday morning into the early 
evening.

Pops will gradually decrease Sunday night as the rain exists 
eastward behind the cold front, and surface high pressure to the 
north will extend just far enough south for a mainly dry and cooler 
day Monday.

Tuesday through Thursday will be the greatest period of concern. The 
longwave trough out west further amplifies during this time with a 
sharpening of the eastern U.S. ridge. This will place our area in 
the right entrance region of a divergent 130-145 kt southwesterly 
300 mb jet for a prolonged period. The result of this strong upper 
level lift will be low to mid level WAA and moisture flux quickly 
returning Monday night and Tuesday with the strongest 850 mb low 
level jet and associated warm/moist advection coming Tuesday night 
into Wednesday. This will occur as strong frontogenetic forcing also 
moves into the area Wednesday from a slowly advancing, nearly 
stationary, cold front. PWAT values during this period will likely 
be 1-1.4 inches further increasing the heavy rain threat. Have 
chance to likely pops expanding from south to north Monday night 
followed by likely to categorical Tuesday through Wednesday evening. 
As an early estimate, storm total QPF from 00Z Tuesday trough 12Z 
Thursday looks to be 1.5-4 inches from southwest VA through the 
northern valley and 3 to 6 inches from the plateau through the 
central and southern valley. Given the persistently wet pattern 
and saturated soil that we have seen most of this month, we will 
continue to highlight a significant flooding potential in the HWO.

A brief southward suppression of the above mentioned active 
frontal boundary will bring a short break from the widespread rain
Thursday, so have reduced to chance pops, before the trough 
amplifies out west again leading to another enhanced 300 mb 
southwesterly jet and resultant low to mid level warm/moist 
advection and lift. For this reason, have likely pops returning 
Thursday night and Friday. It should be noted that the 12Z ECMWF 
does not show much of a break Thursday and keeps steadier rain 
over the area, but it also shows a drier pattern Thursday night 
and Friday, so the pop forecast will be changing for the late week
period.

The only good news about the next 7 days is that temps will be above 
normal from this southwesterly flow pattern, and have leaned toward 
the Superblend for temps.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Saturday)...
Current obs show that wind gusts in the mountains have dropped 
below Advisory criteria, and that trend is expected to continue 
through the rest of the morning, so the Advisory will be allowed 
to expire at 4 am. Some spotty light showers will be crossing the 
area through the morning, associated with a weak midlevel 
shortwave trough. The trough axis will be to our east by 15Z and 
dry air aloft will bring and end to most of these showers, but a 
southwesterly low level flow will maintain low level moisture and 
cloud cover through the day. A surface cold front behind the 
trough will move into the area from the north in the early 
afternoon, then stall near our southern border with a W-E 
orientation late in the day.

A low pressure system currently over the Plains will track east over 
the Ozarks today and cross TN tonight along the W-E stationary 
front. Increasing isentropic lift over the front will begin to 
spread categorical PoPs from south to north this evening, with peak 
forcing and QPF occurring between 03 and 09Z. Southern sections 
along thr front will likely have the highest precip amounts, which 
could exceed one inch. Rain chances start to decrease Saturday 
morning as the surface low and shortave trough move into western NC. 
However model soundings show a strong inversion trapping moisture 
below that will keep cloud cover in place across the area through 
the day. For this reason, the cooler temps of the NAM are prefered 
over the warmer GFS.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Thursday)...
The battle between the approaching Spring season and Winter will 
be engaged in the vicinity of the Southern Appalachians over the 
long term period as the sub tropical high sets up over the Western
Atlantic around the Tropic of Cancer. Several waves of low 
pressure will ride from southwest to northeast along a quasi-
stationary polar front generating the possibility of more flooding
in our rain soaked region as moderate to sometimes heavy bouts of
rain build across the region with each passing wave. It must be 
stated that there are subtle differences between the Canadian, 
European, and American models with timing and axis of greatest 
lift and deepest moisture. However, it appears the first wave will
be building into the region later Saturday night through Sunday 
night with isentropic lift moisture increasing with the shot at a 
little better qpf across the southern third of the forecast area 
impacting Southeast Tennessee and Southwest North Carolina. This 
wave moves away through the day on Monday allowing for a bit of a 
break in the action. This later part of the extended forecast may 
be the more concerning part in terms of some excessive rainfall as
a long wave trough amplifies across the Western United States 
while the sub tropical high refuses to yield position Tuesday 
through the end of the week. This pattern allows for strengthening
moist southwesterly flow off the Pacific Ocean and in the lower 
levels off the Gulf of Mexico Tuesday into Thursday. This moist 
airmass will be lifted in the presence of a slow moving frontal 
boundary/low level trough with the best likelihood for higher pops
extending from Tuesday into Wednesday night. Some good news is 
that with such a healthy southerly component to the mean flow, 
temperatures are expected to be relatively mild with almost all 
the precipitation being liquid.

.DISCUSSION...

Currently, skies were mostly cloudy with temperatures in the mid
to upper 50's. Winds have become gusty across the higher terrain
this evening under a warm air advection regime and southerly 
flow. Observations in the Smoky Mountains continue to show winds 
gusting at or above advisory criteria. Thus, the advisory looks to
be in good shape through midnight tonight. 

The upper level pattern consists of low amplitude cyclonic flow
across the Great Lakes and Mississippi river valley with ridging
across New England, and the Rockies. At the surface, an area of
low pressure was centered across the Great Lakes just down stream
of a shortwave axis. A weak cold front extended south of this low
across the Ohio valley and central plains. Moisture remains 
limited along this frontal boundary as noted on GOES satellite 
products, upstream RAOBs, and surface observations. This along 
with weak lift to increase low level moisture will likely keep 
most of what precipitation can develop from reaching the surface. 
Lowered PoPs overnight and through the morning to account for 
these trends. Otherwise, the forecast is in good shape with only 
minor updates to temperature and dewpoint grids.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Saturday)...

The warm and dry weather will come to an end by tomorrow as an
initially weak frontal boundary will move into the forecast area
early on Friday. A few areas of higher elevation for the eastern
Tennessee mountains will see an increase in winds tonight with the
passage of this front. Some areas could see sustained winds up to
18 mph with even higher gusts. With the combination of an upper
level jet max moving into the area and a lingering wedge of low
level cold air lending an isotropic lifting mechanism, the front
looks intensify quickly and bring a fair amount of rain late
Friday into Saturday morning. This looks to be the first of
several rain events that will continue over the weekend and into
next week.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Thursday)...

Continued high rain chances throughout the extended forecast over 
already soggy soils will lead to an increased risk of flooding next 
week. Still looks like the next round or wave of rainfall begins 
Saturday night and through Sunday night. Higher pressure with drier 
airmass moves in early Saturday evening temporarily behind latest 
frontal system. However moisture begins to pool to the south ahead 
of developing low pressure along the gulf coast that then moves 
northeast towards the Tennessee Valley Sunday. As air is lifted over 
old frontal system boundary increasing rainfall possible Sunday into 
Sunday night. This next developing system will move through by early 
Monday. ECMWF model shows no break but GFS does show about a 12 hour 
dry period before the front moves back north and then stays near the 
southern border of Tennessee as a couple of low pressure areas move 
along the front Tuesday through Wednesday night. Rainfall amounts 
Saturday night through Sunday night are about one half inch 
northeast to 1.5 inches in the southwest which is not expected to 
produce flooding. The latter system is now showing much more 
rainfall from about 2 inches northeast to as much as 5 inches in the 
extreme southeast through Thursday morning. The models try to bring 
the system farther south and east but another wave may bring in more 
rain at the end of the extended. With the extended period of 
moderate to possibly heavy rainfall several rivers will likely rise 
to near or above flood stage by mid of next week.

.AVIATION...Another good day of flight weather across Eastern
Tennessee as a weak frontal system approaches the region. Much of
the moisture associated with this system will be above fifteen
thousand feet until later tonight when a lower mid deck builds
across the terminals. Ceilings may be as low as four thousand feet
at cha after 07z Friday and there could be a sprinkle here.
Probability of rain is too low to include in the forecast here or
at the other terminals.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A low amplitude upper trough 
and weak cold front will be approaching the Southern Appalachian 
region later today and tonight. Winds will be shifting to the 
south and strengthening from mid day through the afternoon, as the
stronger 85h flow mixes down to the surface. Despite increasing 
high level clouds, strengthening late winter insolation and warm 
air advection should help boost temperatures several degrees above
normal and a good five to ten degrees above yesterday's highs. 
Moisture will be limited with this frontal system, but there 
should be enough low level moistening for the possibility of a few
light showers after midnight and mainly on the Cumberland Plateau
before sunrise. Overnight low temperatures will be very mild; 
bottoming out only in the lower and middle 40s north to the middle
and upper 40s south.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...The main focus of this 
part of the forecast will be the precip amounts falling over 
already moist soils. Looks like three waves of precip--Friday/Fri 
night; Sunday; then the big show Monday night through the end of 
the forecast. The first couple of events should each stay below 1 
inch in general, but the big event will likely produce very heavy 
rains over part of the area, and possibly repeatedly for some 
areas. The mid-range ensembles show an axis of heaviest rains over
N GA/N AL/SE TN/W NC/W SC and staying over the same areas, but 
the deterministic GFS/Euro show more active north or south 
movement of the axis over time, so there may well be some lulls in
the precip, but some areas should definitely get some very heavy 
rains and possible flooding. Between now and when this big event 
starts, it will be important to watch for changes in the placement
of this axis and the placement of the associated frontal 
boundary. Looking at the contributing components for heavy rains, 
things are a little more progressive than it might seem at first 
glance--looks like the heaviest rain rates and flash flooding 
threats will generally be confined to one 24-hour period--like 
Tuesday and Tuesday night -or- Tuesday night and Wednesday, etc. 
However, the river (non-flashy) threat probably will continue 
through the end of next week for the places under that heaviest 
precip axis--once again the forecast for this axis may drift north
or south in the coming days--still 5-6 days away. Pretty cool 
airmass over southwest VA some of these nights, but looks like 
almost all precip will be in the form of rain.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday night)...

The short term forecast will see our area predominantly under the
influence of a high pressure ridge for the majority of the forecast.
Winds across the area are starting to decrease in magnitude as the
tight pressure gradient resulting from the previous upper level
low continues to track eastward. The incoming area of high 
pressure will bring in a much drier airmass aloft, leading to 
suppressed cloud formation and warming temperatures from the 
increase insolation. An increase in clouds late Thursday will 
signal the approaching influence of another deep upper level low. 
This system, although tracking well to the north, looks to also 
bring a tight pressure gradient over our forecast area. As a 
result, winds over the higher elevations are again expected to 
increase to a considerable degree for a few hours overnight.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...

A mild and wet pattern for the weekend into the middle of next week 
at least. The extended starts out with a cold front moving across 
Tennessee and light rain across the area ahead of the front. Light 
amounts initially Friday. Friday night models show new low pressure 
developing over the lower Mississippi Valley and increased lift with 
a period of moderate rainfall as this slows the fronts progress 
through the forecast area. The surface low will finally shift east 
of Tennessee Saturday. Rainfall amounts expected to be less than one 
inch. After a brief break late Saturday another low develops to the 
west and brings another front through the area Sunday. This system 
could produce another inch of rain from late Saturday night through 
Sunday night. Monday brings another brief break in significant 
weather. Then Monday night and Tuesday the front begins to move back 
north with overrunning and a stronger shortwave with a deepening 
upper trough approaching the area. This will produce some heavy 
rainfall over the southern half of the area. Models show around 3 
inches of rain for the southern third of the area from Monday night 
through Wednesday. This may cause flooding due to the saturated 
ground from recent rainfall.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...The upper trough that brought 
the wet weather to the region on Tuesday will be shifting steadily
east with ridging moving in behind the departing feature. Strong 
dry air advection will allow for full insolation and despite the 
cool west northwesterly flow, high temperatures will only fall 
short of typical mid February maximums by a few degrees. The 
pressure gradient between the advancing ridge and the eastward 
moving low will remain tight today, and the strongest winds will 
occur in the higher terrain across Southwest Virginia and in the 
far East Tennessee Mountains. A wind advisory remains in effect in
these areas through the afternoon hours. The low level flow will 
decouple tonight under mostly clear skies allowing low 
temperatures to drop to the middle and upper 20s north to the 
lower 30s south.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...This period starts out 
with an upper level zonal flow pretty much across the southern 
U.S., with a surface high in the Carolinas and cold front well to 
our west, stretching from Minnesota SSW to Kansas. A return flow 
from the Gulf is just picking up in our area. Thursday night low 
level moisture increases rapidly and upper level lift starts to 
move into the area. By Friday the aforementioned cold front will 
be passing through and with the moisture and upper level lift, 
precip chances increase Friday and into Friday night. Models tend 
to diverge somewhat after this frontal passage, but there is 
agreement that from the weekend and into early next week it will 
be an unsettled pattern with numerous chances for precip. Looks 
like airmass over NE Tenn and SW VA might be cold enough for some 
wintry precip Monday night into Tuesday morning, but when the bulk
of the precip comes in with this system around Tuesday it should 
be all rain as a lot of warm air streams northward. We will need 
to watch this system for another possible round of heavy rains 
early next week.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...

Widespread rainfall currently across the forecast area ahead of an 
advancing cold front. The cold front is located from near Toledo, OH 
southward to Nashville, TN to near Houston, TX. In the upper levels, 
there is a 150 kt jet that stretches from the Lower Mississippi 
River Valley into the Great Lakes. This puts the forecast area in 
the favored right entrance region of the jet. PW values are near 
maximum levels observed for mid-February with values in the 1.2-1.4 
inch range. Due to the saturated atmosphere, lapse rates are near 
moist adiabatic and have only seen a couple of lightning strikes 
this afternoon across far southeast Tennessee and southwest North 
Carolina. Radar estimates rain rates of up to half an inch of rain 
an hour with observed storm total rainfall amounts around 0.5-1.5 
inches. Regardless, these amounts are causing some flooding 
issues due to the already saturated ground. The good news is that 
the precipitation is making steady progress to the east and should
come to an end by sunset for most locations and the flood watch 
will expire at 00z. Winds remain elevated in the higher elevations
with latest gusts out of Cove Mountain still above 50 mph and 
will let the high wind warning continue through 4 pm. Winds have 
weakened over the last couple of hours as they take on more of a 
southwest direction. 

Precipitation chances will decrease from west to east later this 
afternoon into the evening hours as cold and dry air advect in 
behind the departing front. Looking upstream, westerly to 
northwesterly winds behind the boundary remain elevated and will 
continue with the wind advisory for the higher elevations through 
Wednesday afternoon. There could be enough moisture leftover later 
tonight as the cold air rushes in for a few snow showers across the 
higher elevations but this shouldn't amount to much more than a 
dusting or so for some of the highest peaks. Temperatures will be 
noticeably colder by tomorrow morning with lows in the mid 20s to 
low 30s with cold air advecting in behind the departing surface 
boundary.

Mostly sunny conditions are forecast on Wednesday as the low level 
ridge moves into the area. Heights will increase as the upper level 
ridge builds to the west. The combination of weak cold advection, 
insolation, and rising heights should lead to a day with highs near 
average for mid-February with most locations topping out in the mid 
40s to low 50s

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...

Models solutions continue to be in flux and model agreement is 
not good, so confidence in the details of the forecast for the 
long term period suffers as a result especially the weekend and 
beyond. We will start out the period dry as we will be under the 
influence of surface high pressure and some low amplitude short 
wave ridging aloft, then a frontal boundary will push through on 
Friday. This system is expected to be moisture starved, so will 
only carry chance PoPs Friday. Beyond that things get complicated,
as the front is forecast to stall and multiple waves of low 
pressure are forecast to affect the region, but timing of these 
waves and how significant they will be is very uncertain. Right 
now, appears best chances for precip will be Friday night into 
Saturday and again Monday night into Tuesday, but while there may 
be a dry period mixed in there for now will keep precip in the 
forecast all periods given timing uncertainties. Much of this 
precip is expected to be rain, although some snow cannot be ruled 
out at times mainly north/higher mountains.

.DISCUSSION...

A line of showers is moving into the forecast area off the
Cumberland Plateau into the Tennessee River Valley ahead of an
advancing cold front. In the upper levels, there is a strong 150
kt jet that stretches from the Lower Mississippi River Valley into
the Great Lakes Region. This puts the forecast area in the favored
right entrance region of the jet. Model soundings indicate
saturation today with PW values in the 1.2-1.4 inch range. These
values are near the maximum observed for mid-February. Ahead of
the system, there are some southeasterly winds leading to
downsloping across the foothills, where a high wind warning
continues. So far, wind gusts at Camp Creek have been around 50
mph. Due to this, delayed the onset of precipitation across the
foothills by and hour or so and also increased highs slightly for
the favored downsloping locations.


Radar estimates indicate rates so far have been around a quarter
to half an inch an hour on the high end. Regardless, the 
antecedent conditions support continuing the Flood Watch with the 
recent heavy rainfall over the last week or so. The cold front 
will sweep across the forecast area this afternoon into this 
evening with rain chances diminishing from west to east as drier 
and colder air moves in tonight into Wednesday.

.AVIATION...Challenging forecast at the terminals today with a
very moist low level airmass that is showing up at cha and tys as
an ifr and even close to an lifr ceiling. The line of moderate to
heavy showers will arrive at cha around 14z, tys around 15z, and
tri around 17z. Downsloping southerly flow across the higher 
terrain may break out some vfr for a while at tys and even longer
at tri until the front arrives. Kept terminals in mvfr category
following the front for several hours and then allowed the change
back to vfr with the dry westerly flow moving into the region
tonight. The other issue with flight operations today will be a
low level wind shear due to the rapid increase in southerly winds
just above the surface during the morning hours.

National Weather Service Morristown TN
330 AM EST Tue Feb 12 2019

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Strong late cold season storm 
system will shift from the Mississippi Valley across the 
Appalachians through the short term period. More moderate to 
occasionally heavy rainfall expected to move across the region and
therefore, the flash flood watch was maintained for the rain 
soaked northern third of the forecast area through early evening. 
Strong southerly flow ahead of the powerful upper trough will 
require a continuation of the high wind warning in the Smokies 
along with a wind advisory in the higher terrain across Southwest 
Virginia and extreme Northeast Tennessee through the afternoon 
hours. Tightening pressure gradient behind the departing frontal 
system will bring a strong northwesterly flow into the higher 
terrain across Southwest Virginia and along the Tennessee and 
North Carolina border. Therefore, will issue a wind advisory in 
these areas Tuesday night through Wednesday Drier air streams in 
behind the surface cold front this evening through the overnight 
hours. Temperatures will be cold enough for a few snow flurries in
the higher terrain tonight before the precipitation ends.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Tuesday)...The extended range 
forecast period looks fairly active and kicks off on Wednesday 
morning amidst the passage of an upper level trough axis and 
associated surface cold front, clearing the way the for rising H5 
heights and surface high pressure through Thursday. This will 
favor dry conditions, a return to above normal temperatures, and 
gusty westerly winds across the mountains of TN/VA where a wind 
advisory will be effective through 00Z Thursday. 

Meanwhile closed a H5 cyclone will dive out of Canada across the 
Upper Midwest states favoring surface cyclogenesis over the Great 
Lakes and northern OH Valley.  A cold front will extend from said 
low pressure southward along the mid MS river and lower OH river 
valleys.  Out ahead, moisture advection amidst swly flow across the 
TN valley will dominate, thereby favoring increasing precipitation 
chances on Thursday night and Friday ahead of the fropa.  This front 
looks to push through Friday evening with high pressure attempting 
intrusion, all while an unphased southern stream H5 wave moves 
across the Plains beneath the left exit region of an H3 jet. This 
feature will traverse the TN valley and Southern Appalachian region 
on Saturday, keeping precipitation chances elevated.  At that point 
guidance features another fast moving upper wave and surface cyclone 
across the deep south on/through Sunday. Temperatures through the 
weekend look to return to below normal levels.  

Lastly, both the GFS/ECMWF favor a deepening/closed southern stream 
H5 cyclone across the Desert Southwest to start the new work week, 
which will eventually advect east initiating surface cyclogenesis and 
warm/moist advection across the Deep South by Monday night into 
Tuesday. However discrepancies in timing, duration, and thermal 
fields yield high uncertainty at this range.

Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED
National Weather Service Morristown TN
811 PM EST Mon Feb 11 2019

.DISCUSSION...Quick update to lower minimum temperatures across
the area. Increasing southerly winds and cloud cover will limit
drop of temperatures the rest of tonight with a slight rise
anticipated soon after midnight. Have also increased chances of
rain early, then drop after midnight as downsloping winds and
decreasing isentropic lift will limit rainfall.

Due to increasing southerly winds of 50-60kts over most of the
area at 850mb, have expanded wind advisory for most of the higher
elevations and adjacent foothills. Have also upgraded advisory for
the Smoky Mountains to a warning. Feel some locations, such as
Cove Mountain, will see wind gusts in excess of 60 mph.

Kept flood watch as is, but feel greatest chance of moderate to
heavy rain will be associated with fronto-genetic band from mid-
morning to early afternoon Tuesday. The fronto-genetic band is
enhanced by favorable jet structure of the right entrance region.
Per previous discussion, ground is very saturated and small
streams are already high, so will not take much to produce
additional flooding issues.

Have a good night.

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
354 PM EST Mon Feb 11 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
Very active short term period with a Flash Flood Watch and Wind 
Advisory currently in effect. The Flash Flood Watch begins begins 
at 4 AM Tuesday and runs through 7 PM covering the northern 
Plateau, northern Valley, and southwest VA. The Wind Advisory 
begins at 1 AM Tuesday and runs through 4 PM covering the peaks 
and adjacent foothills from southern Cocke County down to Monroe.

First the heavy rain: As WAA increases overnight associated with a
potent 50-60 kt southwesterly 850 mb jet, precipitable water
values will increase, peaking as high as 1.4 inches prior to 18Z
Tuesday. This combined with weak elevated instability, strong 
frontogenetic forcing, and upper level support from a nice 300 mb 
jet streak will cause a swath of heavy showers and possible 
thunderstorms to spread across the region. Chance to likely pops 
begin in most areas after 00Z, but categorical pops quickly expand
after 11Z as the swath of rain moves through. Categorical pops 
continue through 18Z before tapering off from west to east. Rises 
in creeks and streams will occur, along with ponding of water in 
low lying and poor drainage areas. This will especially be the 
case where heavy rain fell last week. In between waves of showers,
patchy fog will continue through mid morning due to a lingering 
low level inversion and moist conditions. Temps will slowly rise 
later tonight through Tuesday morning, then fall rather sharply 
later Tuesday afternoon behind the cold front. 

Wind potential: As the 850 mb jet ramps up to 50-60 kts after 
06Z, strong winds should begin in the mountains and foothills 
above 3000 feet. The best potential of seeing sustained winds 
above 25 or 30 mph gusting to 55 mph will be in the peaks of Cocke
County down to Monroe. The time period of strongest winds will be
09-16Z due to the proximity of this 850 mb jet. These elevated 
winds will lift slowly out of the region in the afternoon. A stout
inversion below 850 mb should prevent much in the way of strong 
winds below these elevations.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...
Models in decent agreement early on, but model solutions diverge 
later in the period and run to run consistency is lacking, so 
forecast confidence is degraded as a result. Colder air will be 
pushing in behind the cold front Tuesday night. There may be a few
snow showers especially in the terrain as the precip is ending, 
but any accumulation should be rather light and confined to the 
highest elevations. Surface high pressure and low amplitude 
ridging aloft should provide a couple of dry days Wednesday and 
Thursday, then the next system will bring a chance for precip for 
Friday and Saturday which should be mainly rain with perhaps a few
snow showers on the back side. Models in poor agreement in the 
evolution of this system, as well as how much drying occurs for 
Sunday behind the front. For now will keep Sunday dry. By Monday 
the GFS is showing a potential snow system, while the ECMWF and 
Canadian show differing solutions but indicate more of a rain 
system. Confidence is very low that far out, and a blended 
solution shows mainly rain which is a reasonable forecast for now.

.DISCUSSION...The Flash Flood Watch continues from late tonight
through Tuesday for the northern Plateau and northern half of the
valley through southwest VA. A wave of heavy rain and possible
thunderstorms is still expected to move from west to east across
the region late tonight into Tuesday associated with a strong cold
front, mid and upper level jet energy, a strong LLJ, weak 
instability, and abnormally high PWAT values. This combined with 
already saturated ground will cause rises in creeks, streams, and 
rivers as well as pooling of water in low lying areas. Also issued
a Wind Advisory for the peaks and adjacent foothills from 1 AM to
4 PM Tuesday from southern Cocke County through Monroe. A 50-60 
kt 850 mb jet above a strong low level inversion will ramp up 
after 06Z as the WAA increases ahead of the approaching cold 
front. While the direction is southwesterly, the high speed and 
the inversion should lead to windy conditions at these higher 
elevations. Increased winds in the elevations above 3000 feet to 
sustained at 25-35 mph gusting over 50 mph. Lowered pops for the 
rest of this morning and afternoon across the southern and central
valley and plateau, but continued the mention of patchy fog. 
Adjusted hourly temps and dew points to account for current 
observations. The rest of the forecast is on track.

307 AM EST Mon Feb 11 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The weather pattern across the TN valley and Southern Appalachian 
region will remain active through the short term period.  Southerly 
moisture advection continues early this morning with weak upglide 
favoring iso/sct rain showers across the area.  The moist PBL and 
weak flow also continues to favor patchy fog, which should persist 
through daybreak.  

Otherwise the remainder of the fcst shifts focus to the lee cyclone 
ejecting out of the Rockies later today/tonight.  Given that surface 
high pressure (which has been a good focusing mechanism for upglide) 
is retreating from the area, think a lull in the precipitation is 
favored through much of the late morning and afternoon hours. 
However, flow out ahead of the aforementioned cyclone is expected to 
increase as the system advects east, with guidance favoring a modest 
llj enhancing moisture transport tonight.  With that, pops will ramp 
up across the region tonight with categorical levels favored nearly 
regionwide aside for a strip of likely pops amidst sly downslope 
flow along the NC border, essentially just east of the I81 corridor 
in TN.  Likewise, given intrusion of the llj feature, think high 
elevation winds will probably reach wind advisory criteria, but will 
likely hold off for now and let the day shift take another gander. 
Lastly, very late in the period into late Tuesday morning, surface 
warm advection and falling heights aloft will favor inclusion of 
thunder in the forecast, particularly across the Plateau and western 
valley regions. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...
Period begins with fropa bringing good rainfall and possibly a 
tstm with rainfall amounts on Tuesday running about an inch to 
locally two. Enough of a threat over the already rain-hit areas 
from late last week to issue a Flash Flood Watch. But drier 
weather will visit for Wed and Thurs before the next system moves 
through Thurs night through Fri night, but with less QPF. Dry 
weather this weekend, but some showers may spread back into the 
area Sunday night, cold enough to psbly be a wintry mix.

.AVIATION...
A mixture of IFR/LIFR and MVFR to highlight this taf cycle.
Persistent moist sly/swly flow remains trapped beneath an
inversion tonight. This combined with light ra/dz will favor
patchy MVFR/IFR fog and IFR/LIFR cigs. These conditions dont look
to recover until late morning or even into the afternoon hours as
minimal mixing occurs. Nevertheless, restrictions will still 
remain solidly at MVFR levels for the remainder of the 
day/evening, before lowering back to IFR levels Monday night. 
Winds will remain light/sly through the period.

.DISCUSSION...The main band of isentropic forcing continues its
slowly push northward. This will lift the focus of rain a little
north of the TN border overnight. However...isolated light 
showers and patchy drizzle will persist over the Southern 
Appalachian Region for much of the night. Additionally... 
temperatures will hold fairly steady...possibly rising lightly in 
a few locations during the night. Current forecasted lows indicate
reading a bit warming than current observations in a few 
locations. As such...will need to adjust the forecast slightly. 
Additionally...southern locations should see only very light 
rain/drizzle with minimal chance of accumulating rainfall. 
Therefore...will lower POPs slightly over these areas. 
Otherwise...the overall forecast reasonable with little additional
adjustment needed.

Through most of the overnight period, all TAF sites are expected
to be predominantly in LIFR to IFR conditions. TRI is currently
MVFR with VFR cigs, but these should drop soon as a downslope flow
weakens. Conditions at CHA and TYS will initially be variable
before settling into the LIFR/IFR range. Improving conditions at
all sites should begin in the late morning/early afternoon
tomorrow, returning to MVFR after 18-20Z.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

Radar imagery across the area shows that the main area of isentropic 
forcing is shifting north as forecast, with rainfall mainly limited 
to areas roughly near and to the north of the I-40 corridor this 
afternoon. Initial shortwave trough responsible for onset of 
rainfall today will begin to lift into the Ohio River Valley region 
later this afternoon. After its passage, an ensuing rise in both H5 
and H85 heights will be seen in response to a western trough digging 
into the desert southwest. This suggests isentropic upglide maxima 
will will be shunted to the north, with the focus for rainfall 
tonight and into Monday morning lying along the TN/VA border before 
beginning to taper off in earnest on Monday. The latest model 
guidance indicates very little in the way of additional rainfall 
will be seen from late Monday morning through Monday evening. 
Trended the forecast in that direction, but did not dry out the 
forecast completely tomorrow.

The other interesting forecast item of note is high temperatures 
tomorrow. Tonight will be much warmer than recent nights, with lows 
firmly in the 40s across all but the far northern parts of our 
southwest Virginia counties. Continued warm southerly flow will
push highs into the 50s to even low 60s for tomorrow. However the
the most interesting aspect of this is how model guidance
continues to show very warm temperatures in the mid slope regions
of the foot hills and mountainous areas tomorrow. Forecast
soundings do show a marked increase in 900-850mb temperatures
tomorrow afternoon, and surface winds are ever so slightly
downsloping as well. Perhaps this will be enough to significantly
increase the mixed layer depth and warm temperatures into the
upper 50s to low 60s like some guidance is forecasting. Between 
these factors, and decreasing rain chances, it will be interesting
to see the temperature traces for those areas tomorrow afternoon.
In any case, even if they do not climb as high as forecast, 50s 
seem like a sure thing before rain moves back in during the long
term period.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...

The long-term looks very similar to how it looked yesterday with an 
active, progressive pattern across the U.S. giving east TN, 
southwest VA, and southwest NC rounds of precipitation every couple 
of days. This will add to what has already been a wet start to 2019. 
Two distinct mid and upper level troughs will rotate from west to 
east across the U.S. this week inducing surface cyclogenesis in the 
Plains that will each lift into the Midwest and bring moisture 
fluxes and active frontal boundaries across the southern U.S. 

We start with the Monday night into Tuesday system. The upper level 
trough will be rotating toward the Great Lakes while becoming 
negatively tilted. Its parent surface low will deepen to below 995 
mb as it moves into the northern Ohio Valley by Tuesday afternoon. 
This will force a cold front across our region with the frontal 
passage likely occurring from mid morning Tuesday through about 21Z. 
The latest NAM and GFS have slowed the timing of this frontal 
passage and are more in line with the ECMWF, although the ECMWF is 
slightly slower than both of them. PWAT values will increase to over 
1 inch Monday night to as high as 1.4 inches Tuesday morning thanks 
to strong WAA and moisture advection from a southwesterly 40-50 kt 
925-850 mb jet late Monday night into Tuesday. These PWAT values are 
well above the max moving average for Feb 12 of 1.26 inches. Our 
region will be close to the right entrance region of a 120-140 kt 
300 mb jet streak late Monday night into Tuesday, which combined 
with strong frontogenetic forcing, will produce strong lift for a 
period of heavy rain and possible thunder along and ahead of the 
frontal passage. The timing of the front is not ideal for any 
widespread convection, but a small amount of elevated CAPE seen in 
the projected soundings associated with the strong low level jet 
warrants a thunder mention. I have pops quickly increasing to likely 
and categorical after 06Z Tuesday then slowly decreasing to chance 
from west to east after 18Z. In terms of QPF, I have followed WPC 
which has mostly under a half inch between 06 and 12Z Tuesday 
increasing to about 0.50 to 1.10 inches from the valley across the 
Plateau in the 12-18Z timeframe and 0.40 to 0.80 inch from southwest 
VA through the east TN mountains and southwest NC in the 18Z Tue-00Z 
Wed timeframe. Since the swath of rain will move eastward at a 
decent clip, the duration is not long enough for a flood watch at 
this point, however, rises in creeks, streams, and rivers will occur 
along with localized flooding of low lying areas. WPC has our 
plateau in a marginal risk for excessive rainfall Tuesday with a 
slight risk over the rest of the region. Highs and lows for Tuesday 
will be well above normal, and I have blended the Superblend with 
the NAM12 for these temps.  

Gusty winds above 30 mph will occur in the far east TN mountains 
late Monday night into early Tuesday afternoon due to the strong 850 
mb winds ahead of the front, but a low inversion and southwesterly 
direction should prevent a classic mountain wave.

Wrap around moisture will cause chance pops to continue through 
about 12Z Wednesday across southwest VA and extreme east TN, and as 
temps fall through the 30's in the CAA during the night, some snow 
showers could occur in the higher elevations. Any accumulation would 
only be a trace to a few tenths of an inch. Surface high pressure 
combined with the NW flow aloft will lead to a mostly sunny but 
seasonably cool day Wednesday. 

The surface high will move east Thursday with broad upper level 
ridging returning to the Southeast U.S. ahead of the second trough 
and parent surface low moving into the Plains. This will allow WAA 
to begin, so temps will climb back to above normal levels. Moisture 
flux and theta e advection along a warm front will induce showers 
Thursday night, so I have chance to likely pops after 00Z Friday. 
The system's cold front will cross on Friday afternoon with 
additional showers expected, so I have likely to categorical pops. 
The GFS is a few hours faster with this system than the ECMWF, so 
tweaks are likely throughout the week, and I have utilized 
Superblend pops and temps for this system for the time being. Both 
models show wrap around moisture in the CAA behind the frontal 
passage Friday night into Saturday morning, so have chance pops for 
a rain or snow precip type from the east TN mountains through 
southwest VA. A fairly deep upper level trough and surface high 
gradually building in from the west will bring drier but colder 
conditions Saturday afternoon through Sunday with temps below 
normal.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Lee cyclogenesis over the Central Plains continues to strengthen 
beneath the parent H5 longwave trough, while broad/weakening ridging 
prevails across the east/central CONUS.  A moist sly upglide regime 
will highlight the pattern through the short term as moisture 
continues to advect into the region.  With that, current radar 
trends favor a few echoes over northern AL/GA, however surface obs 
aren't favoring anything just yet.  Thinking virga processes are at 
play at this point.  That said, the llvs will further moisten and 
precipitation will likely be observed around or just after daybreak 
over the Plateau and the southern valley, possibly even as far east 
as southwest NC.  Modest warm nosing and lack of any substantial 
moisture in the dendritic zone would suggest that most of this 
precipitation would be liquid, however there could be a brief window 
of freezing drizzle/rain.  The most favorable locations for that 
look to be over southwest NC, yet likely being very short lived and 
thus presenting no significant hazards, perhaps some glazing on 
elevated surfaces.  

By 10AM or so all locations should have recovered to above freezing 
levels.  As stated above, moisture will deepen through the day, 
therefore pops initialize this morning at slight chance levels 
before increasing into the mid/high chance range by midday.  Beyond 
that, pops ramp up further to likely/cat levels north of I40 where 
guidance favors some minimal enhancement in the upglide regime 
thanks to a weak llj.  Finally, pops will lower gradually through 
the night into Monday morning, yet still holding at likely levels 
northward, tapering to chances southward. Given waa, temperatures 
Sunday night should remain above critical levels for wintry 
precipitation, thus all rain.  Total QPF through the period ranges 
from approx .20 over the lower valley with an increasing gradient 
northward where close to .60 to .70 is possible closer to the KY/WV 
borders. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...
No real change from yesterday. Progressive pattern continues, and 
Four Corners trough will tap moisture into our area as it moves 
across the Plains and up the Ohio Valley through Tuesday night. 
Mostly dry Wed and Thurs. The next Pacific system moves through the 
Rockies and Plains Thurs and Fri with showers beginning to return 
from the west to east beginning late Thurs afternoon, peaking Thurs 
night and Fri. Models are more consistent with an expectation of 
scattered precip accompanying the passage of the trough axis Fri 
night and Saturday morning, with scattered rain and snow showers 
psbl Fri night, dwindling to slight chances over the northeast 
sections Sat morning.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

A +1040mb surface high is anchored over Michigan this afternoon, 
with cold, dry northerly flow stretching down into eastern 
Tennessee. Temperatures are running 5-10 degrees below normal as a 
result. Dry conditions will continue through much of the night, but 
precipitation will begin to spread into the forecast area from the 
west and southwest by daybreak tomorrow morning. The big question is 
will there be any wintry precipitation at the onset?

Out west, a shortwave trough will be ejecting east across Nevada and 
into the four corners region this evening, and moving into the 
central plains by Sunday morning. Ahead of this feature, isentropic 
lift will spread across the CWA by daybreak, leading to some 
widespread light precipitation developing across the area. This 
precipitation will be high-based, with column saturation existing 
mainly above 800mb for much of the day tomorrow. Below this, a very 
deep layer of dry air will exist, allowing for the possibility of 
significant evaporative cooling through a few hours after 
precipitation onset. The uncertainty lies with how cold temperatures 
will be tonight, and what the resulting Ptype will be tomorrow 
morning. Raw model guidance is notably warmer than MOS guidance is, 
especially for areas around and north of the I-40 corridor. Looking 
at IR satellite imagery upstream, there seems to be plenty of high 
clouds set to stream into the area after midnight. Given this, feel 
that MOS guidance is probably too cold, and trended the forecast 
towards the raw model guidance slightly which still yields near, but 
sub-freezing, temperatures for the I-40 corridor northward. This is 
not as simple as surface temperatures however because BUFR soundings 
show a substantial warm nose intruding into the area from the 
southwest as precip moves in. However, given the dry air, wet bulb 
zero heights remain near the surface for much of the morning. All 
things considered, added in a mixed bag of precip for tomorrow 
morning. Think the primary wintry ptype would be either sleet or 
freezing rain given the strength of the warm nose. However wouldn't 
be surprised to see a few flakes mixed in for a brief period at the 
start.

After all of that discussion about Ptype, I get to say that it 
matters very little because temperatures will fairly quickly warm 
above freezing tomorrow. Highs should max out in the low to mid 40s. 
And given the overall low QPF amounts expected, especially during
the period where wintry precipitation would occur, did not carry 
any accumulation of snow, sleet, or snow.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

An active weather pattern will continue in the long-term with more 
unwanted rain and flooding threats. A long wave trough will slowly 
progress from the western U.S. Sunday night into the upper Midwest 
by Tuesday afternoon while deamplifying and becoming positively 
tilted. At the same time, broad ridging will be over the Southeast 
U.S. with the western edge of the ridge slowly eroding from the 
impinging trough. This will set up an active conveyor belt of 
southwesterly warm air advection and moisture flux across the TN 
valley leading to periods of showers Sunday night through Tuesday.

The first wave of showers will be lifting northward Sunday night 
associated with a theta e gradient along a warm front. Theta e in 
the 925-700 mb layer will quickly rise from 306K to about 315K 
Sunday night into Monday morning from south to north. Impressive 925-
700 mb moisture flux is also expected at this time tied to the warm 
front and theta e gradient with values increasing from -9 g/kg/12hr 
to 5 g/kg/12hr. Behind this gradient of theta e and moisture, the 
rain will likely be more scattered with many places seeing periods 
of dry weather. For this reason, I am lifting the likely pops 
northward between 00 and 12Z and expanding chance pops to account 
for this break. Likely pops will continue across the TN/KY border 
through southwest VA. QPF guidance is rather unimpressive Sunday 
night from this first wave with generally 0.10 to 0.30 inches, 
greatest from the northern plateau into southwest VA. Low temps will 
remain mild Sunday night.

Monday will feature the above mentioned warm front well to our north 
in central KY while a cold front develops from MO through AR and 
east TX. This will place east TN, southwest VA, and southwest NC 
into the warm sector with many areas remaining dry and warm as temps 
surge into the 60's. I have kept chance pops in most areas but have 
some likely wording in southwest VA in closer proximity to the warm 
front. At the same time, both the NAM and GFS project PWAT values to 
increase over 1 inch throughout the day, so any showers will contain 
heavy downpours.

As a surface low moves from the Plains into the Great Lakes Monday 
night, the cold front will move through middle TN then into our 
area. The latest NAM and GFS are faster with this front than 
previous runs, so I have likely pops returning to all areas quickly 
Monday night. PWAT values look to be up to 1.5 inches Monday night 
through Tuesday morning which is well above the max moving average 
of 1.26 inches for Feb 12. This will lead to heavy rainfall. QPF 
from the NAM and GFS is generally 1-2 inches Monday night through 
Tuesday with the greatest amounts around the plateau. The SREF is a 
little lighter. I went with a WPC blend which generally brings 0.50 
to 1.25 inches between 00Z and 12Z Tuesday with some additional 
amounts through 18Z. Storm total QPF from 12Z Sunday through 00Z 
Wednesday is about 1 to 2.25 inches. The wild card will be any 
convection that can develop. Diurnal timing of this cold front is 
not very favorable for thunderstorms, but a couple hundred joules of 
CAPE, lift associated with a 120-140 kt 300 mb jet moving near the 
region, strong frontogenesis, high PWATs, and mid level lapse rates 
above 5-6 C/KM will support a thunder mention with periods of heavy 
rain. This would cause localized swaths of heavier QPF. Creaks, 
streams, and rivers could quickly rise in all areas, so I will 
continue to mention the flood threat in the HWO. 

The cold front and associated rain should be moving east of the 
region after 18Z Tuesday, so pops will taper down from west to east 
with falling temps after a warm first half of the day. Dry and 
colder weather is expected across all areas Tuesday night through 
Wednesday as surface high pressure builds in with a NW flow aloft. 
The GFS shows some possible wrap around moisture near southwest VA 
in the colder air that could support a few snow showers late Tuesday 
night into Wednesday morning, but the chance of this occurring and 
confidence level are both too low to warrant any pops at this time. 

A southerly flow of warmer air will begin Thursday ahead of another 
central Plains upper trough and surface low, but we will remain dry 
through the day. The warm front associated with this system and 
moisture advection will spread showers into the region Thursday 
night into Friday morning, followed by additional showers along the 
system's cold front Friday afternoon. Model timing differences 
exist for this system, so I will keep chance pops in the grids for
this extended range. Drier and colder weather will return by 
Saturday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Swly flow aloft continues to promote moisture advection across the 
TN valley and Southern Appalachian region this morning.  At the 
surface, high pressure dominates across the MS/OH and TN valleys. 
Through the period, upper heights will gradually rise with flow 
becoming more zonal, thereby reducing the magnitude of mid/upr level 
moisture advection.  As a result, current mostly cloudy skies will 
scatter through mid/late morning allowing for partly cloudy to 
mostly sunny skies by late afternoon resulting in highs a few 
degrees warmer than yesterday (albeit still slightly below normal). 
Meanwhile, a shortwave will eject across the Plains amidst a 
deepening longwave trough over the western CONUS. With that, llv 
moisture advection will commence across the lower MS valley 
overnight into Sunday morning.  The aforementioned cool high 
pressure center will have advected eastward across the spine of the 
Appalachians, thus setting up wedge conditions over the Carolinas, 
while still stretching well westward across the OH and MS valleys. 
Isentropic ascent of this moisture atop the sprawling region of cold 
high pressure will likely favor wintry conditions over portions of 
west TN/KY by periods end Sunday morning. Fortunately, guidance 
continues to trend slower with precipitation onset timing across 
east TN and southwest NC/VA, therefore the forecast remains dry 
through daybreak Sunday. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...
Progressive pattern continues, and more weather systems will be 
crashing into the West Coast and then rumble across the nation. 
The first one will dig into the Four Corners by Monday morning and
give us another period of SW flow aloft that will tap Gulf 
moisture to return to the area. This system will push a rainy 
frontal boundary through the area Monday night. May see another 
1.5 to 3 inches of rain during this early-week event. At the onset
of the moisture intrusion, light rain during Sunday morning may 
start off as light freezing rain until morning temps warm up above
32 on their way to highs in the 40s that afternoon.

The next system hits the Pacific Northwest Wednesday morning and 
crosses the front range of the Rockies on Thursday, resulting in 
moisture flow returning up the MS Valley that ultimately brings yet 
another round of rain to our soggy section of the country Thursday 
night and Friday morning. Models diverge on this storm's path, so we 
may or may not get chilly wrap-around precip Friday night, perhaps 
some snow included for some locales, but too early to say. Will 
hedge with low pops Fri night for now in the grids.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...

The short term period will be quiet with dry weather conditions
and cool temperatures. This afternoon, an area of surface high 
pressure was situated across the Midwest with confluent flow 
aloft. Continued southwest flow aloft will increase mid to upper 
level moisture tonight through Saturday with a gradual increase in
upper level clouds as noted in current water vapor and visible 
imagery. Temperatures will remain cool as the high slowly 
progresses across the Ohio valley and Great Lakes. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...

A sub 1040 mb surface high will begin moving east and northeast of 
the region Saturday night allowing return flow to begin to develop, 
but a cold wedge looks to persist across the far east TN mountains 
into western NC where northeasterly surface flow hangs on longer. 
Another long wave trough developing in the western U.S. will force 
broad downstream ridging and begin a period of deep layer 
southwesterly flow and WAA beginning Sunday. This will cause fairly 
widespread precipitation to break out by mid morning Sunday due to 
isentropic lift. The GFS and NAM are a couple of hours faster with 
the onset than the ECMWF. It is possible that a light mix could 
occur at the onset around Clay and Cherokee counties in southwest NC 
and across the mountains and southern TN valley, but confidence in 
this is low since the cold wedge will break out of there pretty 
quickly. The lowest 1000-500 mb thickness values shown by these 
models in that region Sunday morning are about 546 dam, and surface 
temps look to be above freezing by 12Z, so any mixed precipitation 
would be very isolated in sheltered areas. Continued WAA and 
isentropic lift will cause periods of showers to expand areawide 
Sunday afternoon with temps rising into the 40's, so have likely 
pops most areas. The rain on Sunday should remain on the light side 
with QPF generally a few tenths to under a half inch.

As the forcing for this initial wave of showers moves north of the 
region Sunday night, we should see less widespread activity, 
especially in the southeast TN and southwest NC counties, so I have 
reduced pops to chance Sunday night except kept likely in southwest 
VA and in the northern valley. 

The main heavy rain threat from this pattern will come Monday and 
Tuesday. The above mentioned long wave trough in the west will 
slowly be shifting east during this period leading to an enhanced 
mid and upper level southwesterly jet between the trough to the west 
and ridge to the east. Looking at the 300 mb level, winds are 
projected to be 120-140 kts from eastern OK through the western TN 
and OH valleys by Tuesday which will help to produce a long swath of 
lift along a NE to SW oriented frontal boundary. This will also 
enhance the deep layer southwesterly flow and WAA leading to 
unseasonably warm temps and waves of heavy rain. The axis of 
heaviest rain may end up over middle TN skirting the plateau on 
Monday with more showery type rain farther east due to the boundary 
being a little farther west, but the above mentioned jet energy will 
induce strong cyclogenesis over the Plains and upper Midwest Monday 
night into Tuesday. This will push the front into the region as a 
cold front and definitely move a swath of heavy rain through most of 
our CWA Tuesday, so I have likely to categorical pops most of Monday 
night through most of Tuesday. The latest WPC QPF plots as well as 
model forecasted QPF supports this idea by keeping the heaviest rain 
west of Knoxville through the plateau into Middle TN Monday then 
progressing through the rest of the CWA Tuesday. Embedded 
thunderstorms are possible ahead of the cold front Tuesday as 
soundings show at least a little CAPE with PWAT values around 1.5 
inches. I mentioned possible thunder in the forecast grids across 
the valley and plateau. Flash flood guidance from the northern 
Plateau across the northern Valley will probably be the lowest due 
to the flooding earlier this week, but standing water and rises in 
area creeks, streams, and rivers are possible anywhere in our 
region. I have mentioned a threat of flooding in the HWO.   

Periods of gusty winds above 30 mph are likely in the mountains of 
far east TN Monday into Tuesday, but wind direction and speed are 
not expected to line up for long enough durations for any distinct 
mountain waves.

Cooler and drier air will quickly filter into the region behind the 
cold front Tuesday night. An upper level trough aloft and surface 
high building into the area will bring mostly sunny and cooler temps 
Wednesday, but still a little above normal for this time of year. 
WAA ahead of another system will begin to warm temps up Thursday, 
but we should remain dry with plenty of sunshine. This system will 
move in Thursday night and Friday bringing the next chance of
rain.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The upper pattern this morning is highlight by deep longwave 
troughing across the east/central CONUS, while a ridge holds over 
the eastern Gulf of Mexico stretching across southern FL.  At the 
surface, a potent cold front continues to move through the TN valley 
region and into the Appalachians, while Canadian high pressure 
advects across the Plains and Midsouth region behind the front. This 
cool/dry airmass will spread eastward through Friday yielding 
afternoon highs approximately 30-35 degrees below that of yesterday 
afternoon. In fact, high temperatures for the day have likely 
already occurred just after midnight as cold advection will prevail 
from this point forward.  Skies are expected to improve for the most 
part behind the front amidst the building dry airmass.  However, 
some upper level moisture is expected to stream overheard yielding 
partly cloudy skies this afternoon, increasing to mostly cloudy 
across the southern tier of the region overnight into Saturday 
morning. Otherwise, should be a fairly nice but cool day across the 
region amidst 10-15mph nwly winds in the valley, roughly 20-30mph 
nwly winds across the high terrain. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...
This period should start out dry, as cool surface high pressure is 
in control. By Sunday the start of the next wet system will be 
moving in.  With the initial onset of the precip on Sunday morning, 
there might be a brief period of freezing rain or sleet in some of 
the colder pockets, but with the warm advection the precip should 
turn to all rain during by Noon. There might be a few pockets of 
minimal ice accrual, but so light that little impact would be 
expected at this time. 

Have 60+ POPs for most of the forecast area from Sunday afternoon 
through Tuesday. QPF totals for this event are running 2+ inches 
from Knoxville and south and west, with a little rain shadowing in 
the northeastern area that cuts totals slightly, but still running 
1.5 to 2 inches in our NE counties.  Damp soils from previous rains 
will likely result in low Flash Flood Guidance for this event, 
although the event itself doesn't look that flashy. Looked at some 
probability river forecasts--suggest several have a chance of 
reaching action stage, with only a few having a slight chance of 
reaching minor flood stage around next Tuesday or Wednesday. 

Ahead of the cold front around Tuesday low level instability will be 
increasing, but right now it looks too weak to warrant inserting 
thunder ahead of the front.  

As the colder air comes in Tuesday night, right now it looks like 
the moisture will be exiting first, so not forecasting any wintry 
precip at this time on the back side of this system. Have the 
forecast dry for Wednesday and Thursday, with just moderately cooler 
air mass.

.DISCUSSION...
Pre-frontal convection is moving onto the Cumberland Plateau and
has weakened considerably this evening from a few hours ago. Some
lightning was seen just west of Marion County so isolated storms
possible southern plateau and Valley next couple hours. Temperatures
are still very mild ahead of the showers. Still in the mid 60s to
lower 70s across much of the area slightly cooler northeast 
Tennessee and southwest Virginia where winds have decreased this 
evening. Expect the showers to move across the area the next few 
hours with cold front lagging slightly behind. The front looks to
have reached Crossville in the last hour and should be east of 
the entire forecast area by around 9Z Friday. Rainfall amounts
with the convection have produced about one quarter to one third
of an inch farther west so dont expect this rain to aggravate any
flooding caused by last nights heavy rains. Behind the front winds
will be west to northwest and gusty until morning and drop
temperatures into the mid 30s to lower 40s. It will feel much
colder in the 20s to lower 30s by morning. Updated forecast
slightly for warmer current temperatures and also rain chances
next few hours ahead of initial band of showers.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
The wind advisory will expire at 01Z since the gusty southwesterly 
winds will diminish rapidly after sunset. An upper level trough at 
500 mb digging into the Midwest and Great Lakes with a deepening 
surface low moving northeastward will push a strong cold front 
across our region between 03 and 07Z bringing an end to this 
round of unseasonable warmth. Winds will veer to the west and 
northwest behind this frontal passage with temps falling over 20 
degrees from west to east after Midnight. I used a non-diurnal 
temperature trend for tonight's lows to account for this frontal 
passage. 

A band of showers will accompany this front, and some thunder is 
again possible, however, quite a bit of mid level warm air ahead of 
the front will keep CAPE values very limited. Soundings suggest 
little if any CAPE until right along the immediate front, and even 
then, it is minimal. The band of showers will also cross fairly 
rapidly. These factors should prevent widespread heavy, convective 
rainfall, so I do not expect a repeat of last night. I do want to 
point out that one hour flash flood guidance is only 0.8 to 0.9 
inches from about Anderson County eastward through Hamblen, Hawkins, 
and Sullivan Counties. Although QPF will be below these values, any 
rainfall will lead to rises in creeks and streams.  

Surface high pressure building in from the northwest through the day 
Friday combined with the trough aloft and 850 mb temps falling to 
between 0 and -5 deg C will lead to a mostly sunny but cold day. 
A few slight chance pops will remain through about 14Z around the 
east TN mountains and southwest VA, but the rest of the day will 
be dry. Most highs will not rise past the low 40's with northwest 
winds of 10-20 mph making it feel much different compared to 24 
hours earlier.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
The weekend looks mostly dry and cool as high pressure at the 
surface begins to move southeast into the Ohio Valley. The upper 
levels will feature southwest flow aloft as troughing develops 
across the Pacific northwest with low amplitude riding across the 
central and eastern CONUS. Temperatures will be cooler during this
period however this will be short lived as the surface high moves
northeast of the forecast area. Low level flow will veer to the 
south in response to this while advecting a warmer airmass atop a 
retreating colder air mass. While isentropic ascent starts as 
early as Saturday night noted by positive pressure advection on 
the 295 to 300K surface, the low levels really do not start to 
saturate until around Sunday afternoon with low condensation 
pressure deficits. By Sunday night, better lift along the boundary
is noted by increasing omega values, along with positive 2-D 
frontogenesis values. As a result, expect rain chances to begin to
increase as early as 18Z to 21Z on Sunday with most of the 
forecast area experiencing rainfall by Sunday night. 

Better dynamics aloft come into play Monday with a shortwave 
ejecting off the Rockies.  Upper level height falls and strong 
diffluence aloft will contribute to upward motion and developing low 
pressure off the Rockies.  This will strengthen the low level flow 
with an increase in baroclinicity across the quasi-stationary 
boundary Monday into Monday night.  A couple of disturbances will 
ride along the quasi-stationary boundary which will aid in low level 
convergence while theta-e advection begins to ramp up south of the 
boundary. Moisture will also be on the increase as the mean mixing 
ratio in the lowest 100mb increase from 4 to 8 g/kg.  All of this 
will contribute to chances of heavier rainfall Monday into Monday 
night.  Models begin to diverge late Monday night leading to much 
less uncertainty in how the latter part of the extended ends up. The 
12Z GFS has come into better agreement with the 00Z ECMWF. The 
aforementioned area of low pressure will move east through the 
central plains.  An associated cold front will extend south of this 
low through the Arklatex Monday night. Forcing along the cold front 
should support additional chances of heavy precipitation with a 
likely already saturated ground.  Do not want to get into too many 
other details at the moment but confidence in another heavy rain 
event is increasing. Generally, a blend of model guidance supports 
upwards of 1 to 3 inches of additional rainfall through the 
extended.  Will go ahead and beef up wording in the HWO to highlight 
the increased potential for heavy rainfall and flooding.  After the 
frontal passage, high pressure at the surface moves in with cooler 
temperatures and drier conditions.

.DISCUSSION...Issued a Wind Advisory from 18 to 01Z from the
Plateau through the middle and southern valley. Projected NAM12
soundings from TYS and CHA show southwesterly 850 mb winds of 50
kts this afternoon. Clouds will continue to thin and mid levels
are drying, so I believe some of these winds will mix down during
peak heating hours leading to 40-45 mph gusts at the surface.
Typical channeling of the valley around TYS in a southwest flow 
event will aid in higher gusts as well. I eliminated pops for the 
morning and early afternoon across the TN/KY border but left a 
slight chance across southwest VA since much of the activity has 
moved north. High temps are on track for today with near record 
highs still expected, but I adjusted hourly temps through the 
early afternoon to better capture current observations.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Tonight)...Extremely warm air mass 
continues over the area with all three climate sites expected to 
break daily record Max Temps.  Tonight strong cold front should push 
through quickly--strange to think with record warm air and a strong 
cold front that severe weather is not expected, but air aloft is so 
warm that convection will be capped until front moves in and gets 
showers going in cooler air mass.  Even though cold air will hit 
suddenly, it is expected to take too long for temps to cool off to 
allow any snow, even in the mountains as much drier air moves in.

.Long Term...(Friday through Wednesday)...Much colder air will surge 
into the area on Friday and will settle in for the weekend.  Max 
Temps for Friday through Sunday are expected to be in the 40s at 
most places, then warming into the 50s Monday and 60s Tuesday. 
Conditions will be drying out as well Friday and Saturday, but 
precip chances move in again on Sunday and stick around for a couple 
of days.  Ensembles pointing to heaviest rains possibly getting into 
area by Monday, but higher confidence for heavier rains from Monday 
night into Tuesday. (Really wet pattern continues!) Initial look 
into rainfall amounts early next week look to be another 1.5 to 2.5 
inches generally for the area.

By Wednesday the main parts of this system should be east of the 
area as cooler air settles into the region again.

.AVIATION...
Active evening with lots of convection over northern half of area.
HRRR and other resources say that convection will start to lift
north during the night, and some of it has fallen apart and lifted
north, but convection over middle TN, still looks to be holding
south right now, and looks like there is a discernible W-E
boundary from north of CSV-Morristown-NW North Carolina that could
help keep convection farther south. As far as TAFs are concerned
the main issues with all this would be KTRI. South of this
boundary expect VFR conditions for the rest of this morning.
During the day all three sites should break out into sunshine as
ceilings break up with good heating and mixing and gusty winds.
Strong cold front will be approaching at end of this forecast--
putting showers and visibility restriction associated with this 
front at end of KCHA/KTYS forecasts. Although the front is strong
the instability ahead of and along the front is expected to be
very weak. So only going with showers.

.DISCUSSION...Quasi-stationary frontal boundary as set up from
near bna to mor and tri this evening with moderate to heavy
showers, and even a little thunder. The rain is producing some
localized flooding along the boundary which is the result of 
strengthening warm air advection and a short wave impulse riding 
east northeast near the front. Believe the models have captured 
the heart of the forecast with a slow boundary drift northward 
through the night as the main storm system presses east out of the
plains states. Will adjust pops up through northeast tennessee 
and may slow the high pop gradient's northward trek during the 
next several hours. Temperatures are doing rather well with a nice
warm southerly flow slowing the diurnal drop or even rising a 
degree or two during the last few hours.

along a warm front stretching into East Tennessee extending from
near tys to around tri. The area of lift will be moving slowly
north through the night with the Great Valley fully within the
warm sector on Thursday producing quite nice, vfr flight 
conditions with a gusty southwest surface wind. However, tonight 
flight weather may be predominantly mvfr at tys and to a greater 
extent at tri, where ifr conditions could develop later this

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Showers and possible thunder will continue through the early part of 
the evening as a warm front lifts northward. An increasing 850 mb 
southwesterly jet of 40+ knots combined with a few hundred joules
of CAPE will support some embedded convective cells through about
05Z before the chance diminishes. Widespread heavy rain is not
expected, but PWATS over 1.5 inches will certainly cause brief
heavy downpours. These showers should be out of the southern and
central valley by 05Z, but the front will take longer to lift
north of the TN/KY border and southwest VA, so showers will linger
in that area until sometime around 08Z. Generally have likely pops
this evening through the first half of the night over the northern
half of our CWA with chance south half, then taper pops back from
south to north second half of the night. Outside of these 
showers, periods of drizzle may develop from the central valley 
and points north overnight. Projected soundings from the latest 
NAM12 show a decent inversion developing around 850 mb overnight 
with low level saturation, but winds should stay up enough to 
prevent widespread fog. A very mild night is on tap with lows in 
the mid 50's to low 60's, well above normal for early February. I 
went 1-2 degrees above the MAV and MET blend for tonight's lows. 

Lower clouds should break apart rather quickly by mid morning 
Thursday as warm air advection really ramps up ahead of an upper 
level trough and strong cold front moving into the western TN 
Valley. This will lead to gusty southwesterly winds and sufficient
mixing for periods of sunshine. Record highs are in jeopardy with
mid to upper 70's forecasted across the entire region! I 
generally followed the MET and MAV blend with some input from the 
CONSSHORT for Thursday's highs.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
At the start of the long term period, a potent shortwave will be 
located across the upper Midwest. An associated 100-120 knot 500mb
southwesterly jet will aid in strong upper level forcing across 
the Ohio valley and Midsouth. A surface low will move through the 
Great Lakes in tandem with the trough axis with an associated cold
front extending south through the Midsouth, and lower Mississippi
river valley. The cold front is forecast to move through the area
early Friday morning with widespread precipitation along the 
frontal boundary. With the quickly ejecting shortwave and 
attendant surface low into the Great Lakes, this will push the 
better dynamics northward as well. Further, this will also tend to
occlude the surface cyclone and weaken the baroclinicity. 
However, frontal forcing, and low level convergence along with a 
moist column would support chance to likely PoPs with the frontal 
passage. Thunder still seems unlikely at this point, and have left
this out of the forecast. Not expecting any flooding issues given
the progressive nature of the front, and location of the better 
dynamics. 

Upper flow becomes more zonal over the weekend with a strong area of 
high pressure moving out of the Midwest through the Ohio valley. 
This results in cooler and drier weather conditions through the 
weekend. As the surface high moves into the Mid-atlantic on Sunday, 
low level flow veers toward the south.  A resulting warming trend 
develops Sunday into the beginning of next week.  In the upper 
levels, the pattern becomes more amplified as a shortwave trough 
moves through the western CONUS. The southerly return flow atop a 
retreating cooler air mass will lead to isentropic ascent over a 
boundary as seen in the 290-300K layers.  An increase in cloud cover 
can be expected starting Sunday as the low-levels saturate before an 
increase in chances of rain Sunday night through Tuesday along a 
frontal boundary.  While it is still too early to get into specifics 
, mean flow vectors oriented parallel to the boundary supports 
chances of heavier rain and flood issues. Again, this is still far 
out with changes likely but will continue to mention this in the 
HWO. Models show less consistency later in the extended period 
temporally with the shortwave trough and low pressure moving across 
the central plains and Ohio valley Monday night and Tuesday. The 
ECMWF is much quicker with the system and brings precipitation to an 
end as early as late Tuesday night while the wetter GFS brings the 
FROPA in on Wednesday. Given the differences, have left chance PoPs 
in for this period.

.DISCUSSION...I decreased pops from now through 18Z since the
first main wave of showers has exited the region. Latest HRRR and
CONSSHORT guidance suggests showers redeveloping after 19Z from 
the Plateau across the central and southern Valley, so I brought 
in likely pops from west to east from 19Z through the early 
evening. I also included a slight chance of thunder with this 
activity since a 40+ knot 850 mb southwesterly jet will begin to 
enhance warm air advection, and soundings from TYS and CHA show a 
few hundred joules of CAPE with LI's of 0 to -3 by late afternoon.
This could cause brief heavy downpours with rumbles of thunder. 
High temps for this afternoon are reasonable, so I just inputed 
current observations to adjust the hourly trends. The rest of the 
forecast is on track.

possible change to look out for--the latest HRRR runs have been
bringing front or outflow boundary into northern parts of the area
with associated showers/storms late this afternoon, will not jump
on this idea completely yet, but will put in VCSH for that time

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Tonight)...After a dry afternoon on 
Tuesday, lift will be moving back into the area today.  There will 
be precip chances across the area, with the highest chances 
making their way SW-NE through the area today and then higher 
precip chances also settling into the NW area tonight. There will 
also be some limited instability, with highest values NW and 
lesser values SE. Will go with isolated to slight chance of 
thunder from Noon to 8pm for about the NW 1/3 to 1/2 of the area, 
then also continuing after midnight for the northern plateau due 
to sustained elevated instability and low level jet. Will plan to 
mention chance of gusty thunderstorm winds for the northern 
plateau in the HWO. We might see some heavier rains over the 
northern plateau as well, but overall the more extreme rains are 
expected to be farther northwest of there. Overall precip forecast
amounts for today through tonight range from near 1 inch near the
KY state line down to only around 1/4 inch along the GA state 
line. 

.Long Term...(Thursday through Tuesday)...Models continue to be in 
decent agreement overall and run to run consistency has been 
reasonably good as well, leading to forecast confidence that is 
above average for this time of year.  It will be quite warm on 
Thursday.  Just how warm depends on how quickly any morning showers 
end and how much clearing occurs, but 70s look likely for most 
valley locations. The cold front will push through Thursday 
night/early Friday, along with some showers. Colder air will push in 
behind the front, and temperatures may slowly fall during the day 
Friday.  Saturday will be dry with high pressure in control, then by 
Sunday afternoon moisture will be increasing ahead of the next 
system.  From late Sunday through Tuesday looks to be a wet period 
as a frontal boundary will be meandering across the region ahead 
of a low pressure system that approaches Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...

The short term period will continue to be warm with increasing
rain chances late tonight through Wednesday. The upper levels
feature ridging across the eastern CONUS and troughing across the
western CONUS. As a result, the region remains under southwest
flow aloft. At the surface, a weakening area of high pressure is
situated across the Florida peninsula with a weak baroclinic zone
across the southern plains and Ohio valley. The trough along the 
Intermountain west will begin to dig across the Rockies overnight 
tonight through Wednesday. Increasing divergence aloft across the 
Rockies will support the development of lee cyclogenesis late 
tonight and Wednesday. The aforementioned frontal boundary will 
become draped from central Oklahoma through the Ohio valley before
gradually lifting north Wednesday night as the upper level 
pattern becomes more amplified. An area of enhanced low level 
convergence along the baroclinic zone should support heavier rain 
mainly north of the forecast area. While upper level support 
remains weak, isentropic ascent along the baroclinic zone supports
chances of rainfall across the entire area with likely chances 
mainly north of I-75, and I-81. Given the weak upper level 
support, thunder chances remain low enough to not include this 
into the forecast for Wednesday. Rain chances gradually decrease 
Wednesday night into Thursday as upper level heights increase. 
Above normal temperatures will continue under southerly flow with 
daytime highs on Wednesday in the mid to upper 60s. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...

A relatively rainy start to the long term outlook, as a well 
organized frontal system moves into the area at the end of the week. 
Most of the rain will fall overnight on Thursday through Friday 
morning and will be light to moderate in intensity. The Cumberland 
plateau and some of the northern valley counties could see up to an 
inch of rain. The unseasonable high temperatures will drop in the 
wake of the front and we will be looking at temperatures that feel 
more like February rather than April by Friday afternoon. As high 
pressure builds in behind the front, expect the overnight lows to 
drop below freezing for most areas over the weekend.

The next major weather event looks to arrive by late Sunday to early 
Monday. A warm front out ahead of the approaching cold front will 
bring increasing clouds and warming temperatures along with steady 
rain. The event is far enough out that the models aren't in complete 
agreement as to it's timing. The Euro shows it coming in a few hours 
earlier than the GFS and with a little more moisture content. The 
GFS looks to delay the heaviest rain until Monday morning and keeps 
most of it to our west. Both show that with the orientation of the 
front that most of the rain will fall over the plateau. Some areas 
could see over 2 inches of rain from this system. Under the 
influence of the warm air mass, temperatures will remain high enough 
that no snow or ice is expected.

The timing with the exit of the system is another point where the 
models are not in agreement with each other. The Euro looks to have 
everything said and done by Tuesday afternoon, while the GFS holds 
the rain in place until midday on Wednesday, outside the current 
bounds of the forecast period. While the timing will become more 
refined as we continue into the week it leaves the total rainfall in 
question at the moment.

As of 10 AM, skies were clearing along the central valley while 
satellite imagery shows increasing mid to upper level clouds 
streaming in from the west. The sky forecast will be tricky in 
regards to whether low level clouds can move back into the 
forecast area. Do expect a gradual increase in upper level clouds 
through the afternoon and evening. Temperatures will ultimately 
depend on cloud cover today. Made minor tweaks to max 
temperatures, and hourly temperatures to account for some clearing
and warm air advection. Otherwise, no major changes needed in the
forecast.

Ceilings have been lowering overnight from SW to NE very steadily. 
At the present trend, it looks like KCHA and KTYS may keep their 
ceilings at or above 1000 feet--will start them out that way, and
will go higher as diurnal heating mixes ceilings later this 
morning. Also looks like fog may hold off this morning.

Tonight ceilings should start lowering again, and with renewed 
isentropic lift, rain/rain showers should be moving eastward toward 
the area as well.  Will insert VCSH for late tonight at KCHA/KTYS. 
This precip in the area will aid in lowering ceilings--going into
IFR for ceilings at KCHA/KTYS. Looks like KTRI may be too far 
east for IFR ceilings and also for rain prior to end of this 
forecast. Fog should be forming as well tonight, but keeping it 
as MVFR levels right now at all sites.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Wednesday Tonight)...During this early 
part of the forecast our area will be under the influence of an 
upper ridge that will keep Temps above seasonal normals, while in 
the lower levels Gulf moisture will continue to build into the area. 
A surface frontal boundary to our northwest will likely stall and 
stay northwest of the area, and during these first 48 hours of the 
forecast, this will keep the focus for heavier rains to our 
northwest as well.  Through Wednesday night, our precip forecast is 
only about 1/2 inch in our western areas, on and near the Cumberland 
Plateau, and less than 1/4 inch in our eastern areas, near the NC 
state line.  

For precip trends, the forecast starts out pretty quiet with patches 
of light showers this morning, that have been supported by moist 
isentropic upglide, but this upglide will be waning over the next 
few hours. So today offers very little meaningful rainfall. Late 
tonight and Wednesday precip chances will be increasing as deeper 
moisture moves in and isentropic lift increases again.  But then 
Wednesday night as the upper ridge build some more, much of the 
precip with this system retreats to the northwest of us again.  

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Monday)...Models in decent agreement 
overall, and forecast confidence is a bit above average for this 
time of year. Thursday will be very warm with just a few possible 
showers mainly in the morning.  Highs will likely reach well into 
the 70s in most valley locations. A cold front will swing through 
Thursday night along with some showers. Convective energy looks to 
be lacking and forcing isn't overly impressive, so for now will not 
include any thunder.  A few showers will linger into Friday morning, 
and colder air will push in behind the front during the day. High 
pressure will build in and control our weather for Saturday, 
providing plenty of sunshine and seasonable temperatures. Then 
moisture will surge back into the area as the next system 
approaches, bringing rain for Sunday and Monday.

Low level moisture continues to build. Some elevated very light
showers are expected to continue through the night and wane after
daybreak--will only go with VCSH for these showers. With moisture
continuing to flow into the area and weak isentropic lift and
nighttime cooling, expect ceilings to lower this morning. Some
light fog might be forming as well, with better chances south.
All conditions should be improving after daybreak. 

Weak frontal boundary to our northwest is expected to stall 
before getting to sites and start lifting back to the north late 
today.

.DISCUSSION...
Little change needed to the forecast for this late evening update.
Weak/moist isentropic ascent continues across portions of
middle/east TN, with steering flow carrying isolated showers
eastward across area. Kept pops rather low given sparse nature,
however did favor the highest chances pops westward along the
Plateau through the immediate near term, then spreading those 
chance pops eastward into mid morning. Think some patchy fog is 
also a possibility in association with any light rain or drizzle, 
however dense fog doesn't look favored given abundant low clouds. 
Otherwise, tweaked t/td trends slightly to align with recent obs. 
No other sig changes needed/made at this time.

A mixture of VFR/MVFR and IFR expected through this taf cycle as
the llvs remain rather moist amidst a sustained warm advection
pattern. With that, tafs feature VCSH with timing based on low 
confidence CAM progs. Confidence is higher in low cigs overnight 
and through mid morning at all sites, thus MVFR/IFR is included. 
Could also see MVFR visb restrictions from patchy fog, but the 
main restrictive element will be the aforementioned cigs. Cigs 
will recover to low VFR late in the day. Winds will remain 
light/vrb overnight, increasing to around 5-8kts and sly/swly on

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...

The most notable feature for the short term outlook is the weakening 
front that is moving into the area. Expect periods of light rain 
over the next few days as the front moves in and stalls. The 
orientation of the front will lead to advection of warm moist air 
from the south that will further aid with the extended period of 
rain, persistent low ceilings, fog formation, as well as maintain 
the unseasonably high temperatures. Most models are in agreement as 
to the timing of the rain event although the SREF is running a 
little drier than the others.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...

A front to the north at the beginning of the extended forecast will 
move north bringing more warm air up from the south Tuesday night 
and Wednesday. High pressure remains over the East coast and this 
stalled pattern keeps temperatures mild and significant 
precipitation to the west and north of the region until Thursday 
night. Southwest flow will allow highs to reach the mid 60s to near 
70 on Wednesday and upper 60s to mid 70s Thursday ahead of the cold 
front with strong southwest winds. Some moderate rain showers and an 
possibly a thunderstorm may affect the western and northern counties 
Wednesday afternoon and evening but the main front will not move into 
the Lower Mississippi Valley until Thursday and the Tennessee Valley 
Thursday night into Friday morning. A big drop in temperatures will 
accompany the late week front Thursday night with lows in the mid 
30s to mid 40s. Friday highs may come early with temperatures around 
40 west and higher elevations to near 50 east. Friday night through 
Saturday night will stay dry then increasing precipitation chances 
Sunday as new low pressure area develops in the plains and moisture 
increases from the south. With cold temperatures early Sunday a 
little snow may fall before temperatures warm above freezing in the 
morning. Much warmer temperatures and high rain chances Sunday night 
and Monday as next front approaches.

.AVIATION...

Incoming front will bring an increase in moisture content, 
leading to periods of on and off rain. Restrictions to both 
visibility and ceiling will be expected for all of the TAF sites 
later today and into the overnight hours. CHA in particular looks 
to drop to IFR conditions for an extended period of the forecast. 
TYS looks to see a brief period of IFR tomorrow morning, while TRI
looks to remain mostly VFR. However, TRI does look to have some 
restrictions due to ceiling tomorrow morning with a possibility of
lower visibility dependent on fog formation. Due to 
inconsistency's between the LAMP and NAM models, along with 
persistence from previous forecasts, confidence isn't high enough 
to include fog for TRI at the moment.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Moisture will be increasing 
today into tonight as a weakening cold front approaches from the 
west and northwest. Clouds will increase, and weak isentropic lift 
is expected to bring a few light showers across south and west parts 
of the area today and then area wide tonight. Moisture will be 
limited and shallow so precipitation amounts will be quite light. 
Will carry no higher than chance PoPs.  Temperatures will continue 
to be warm, and will not stray far from MAV temps which look 
reasonable overall.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...Overall, not much change 
with the long term forecast. Above average highs and lows through 
most of the period. Overnight lows will be warmer than our normal 
highs for many of the nights. 

We start the period with a cold front stalled out from west-to-east 
up across the Ohio River Valley while a strong ridge is centered to 
our south in the Gulf of Mexico. A few light showers may be around 
through the day as weak synoptic lift is in place due to an active 
sub-tropical and polar jet just off to our west. Weak lift and 
residual moisture from Monday may be enough for these light showers 
to develop. Any rainfall that occurs will be very light. Highs will 
be in the lower to mid 60s for most as we remain in the warm sector.

Tuesday night through Wednesday southwesterly flow continues to 
strengthen as the pressure gradient tightens due to an incoming 
western trough. Through this time period, the best chances for 
precip will generally be west of I-75, with lesser chances the 
further east of 75 you go. This is due to the placement of the 
active upper jet off to our northwest. Highs on Wednesday will be in 
the upper 60s to near 70. 

The better jet dynamics lift north of our area on Thursday as the 
incoming trough transitions from a negative tilt to a more neutral 
one. Expect most areas to be dry Thursday with only some slight 
chance and low-end chance POPs in place along the Cumberland Plateau 
up through the KY, TN, and VA border counties. A strong 
southwesterly 850 mb jet is in place through the day and soundings 
indicate good mixing will occur. This will allow for gusty winds 
area-wide with gusts generally around 20 mph and some gusts up to 30 
mph. The strong area of high pressure will allow highs to climb into 
the lower 70s. This is around 20 to 25 degrees above normal. 

POPs ramp up Thursday night into Friday morning as the cold front 
sweeps in from the west. The GFS and ECMWF in pretty good agreement 
on the timing. Both models show the front mostly through the area by 
12Z Friday morning. Warmest temps of the day will be during the 
morning hours with temps falling through the day as cold air moves 
in behind the front. 

Storm total rainfall from Wednesday through Friday ranges from a few 
tenths of an inch across our far eastern mountains, to near half an 
inch across the central valley, and around an inch for the 
Cumberland Plateau up through the KY/TN/VA border counties as the 
heaviest rains remain well to our northwest. Southerly flow returns 
on Sunday and precip chances return.

Overall the previous fcst looked pretty good as skies remain
mostly clear (with the exception of a few sparse low clouds), thus 
yielding ample radiational cooling across the region. Given this 
cooling and low/mid 40s dewpoints across the southern two thirds 
of the valley, think chances for patchy fog remain elevated for 
the overnight. Thus, did tweak hourly t/td trends through the 
night, while also adding in the aforementioned fog. Otherwise, no

moisture in the decoupling BL will present the possibility of
MVFR/IFR fog at CHA/TYS. Confidence is less at TRI given lower 
dewpoints. Said shortwave ridge will shift east into midday Monday
allowing for profiles to moisten thanks to improving waa ahead of
a Plains system. With that, expecting cigs to lower through

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

Most of the short range forecast looks to remain pleasant. Warmer 
than average temperatures and clearing skies are predicted for the 
majority of the forecast area due to a strong mid level ridge moving 
in. While the southern counties will see between clear and scattered 
skies this afternoon, the clouds are expected to build back in early 
Monday morning from the approaching front. The incoming cold front
will bring an initial line of rain showers into the western part 
of the forecast area by Monday afternoon. The previous minor 
shortwave off to the east looks like it will lose it's upper level
jet support and transition into a cutoff low just off the east 
coast. The incoming front, lacking the intensity to push the 
cutoff low out of the way, will start to stall and become more 
stationary.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...

An active pattern on the West Coast over the next ten days means 
a wet pattern for us as trough after trough lifts out of the Four 
Corners into the Plains, tapping the Gulf and Tropical Pacific and
streaming that moisture into the SE. Weak systems will keep 
isolated to scattered showers around until Wednesday, when 
coverage then increases over the NW half of the area with some 
moderate rains. But as troughing sharpens over the Plains late 
Wednesday, the frontal boundary focusing the precip buckles 
westward and places us in an unusually warm regime for Thursday, 
when temps in the 70s will abound beneath mostly fair afternoon 
skies. Then the front passes through fairly quickly Thursday 
night/Friday morning, keeping event total rainfalls at bay. Then a
few dry periods will greet us from Friday afternoon through 
Saturday night, before the next round of Gulf-fed rains try to 
come back into the area Sunday.

Little change required for the morning update as things look to

temperature for the next few hours as things seem to be slower to
warm up than thought, but the high temperature today still looks
good. Surface winds, while remaining light, look to change
direction as the shortwave moves toward the east and a strong

in the southern counties will most likely be sticking around for
the majority of the day. Expect to see some clearing late this

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...The mid/upper level short wave 
sliding by to our south will bring clouds especially south, and 
perhaps a few sprinkles or light rain showers to extreme southeast 
parts of the area this morning/early afternoon.  Some drying can be 
expected as this system moves off to the east and is replaced by 
some short wave ridging, but moisture will start to increase again 
from the southwest later tonight ahead of an approaching and 
weakening cold front. The warm conditions will continue for the 
short term period, with most valley locations making it into the 60s 
today.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...We start the period 
with a weak line of broken showers approaching from western TN 
that is out ahead of a cold front located back across the Great 
Plains. The first half of the day looks dry with POPs slowly 
increasing after the lunch-time hour. Best chance of POPs will be 
west of I-75 with low-end chance POPs in place. As POPs increase 
so will cloud cover, high temps will be in the low 60s for most. 
Light showers around Monday night into Tuesday as the cold front 
draws closer. Chance POPs in place area-wide but what precip we 
see, if any, will be very light. By Tuesday afternoon the once 
southwest-to-northeast oriented cold front becomes west-to-east 
oriented as the strong high pressure across the Gulf prevents the 
front from swinging through. The boundary looks to stall just to 
our north up into KY. Highs will be in the lower to mid 60s. 

The boundary begins to lift back to the north Tuesday night into 
Wednesday as southwest flow strengthens and a 30 to 40 kt 850 mb jet 
becomes established across the region. High-end chance POPs and 
likely POPs in place for Wednesday. This is due to good moisture 
advection from out of the southwest and good synoptic lift in place. 
The strong omega is due to a dynamic upper jet pattern as the sub-
tropical and polar jet merge across the Great Plains. The western 
trough transitions from a negative tilt to a more neutral one on 
Thursday which allows the better dynamics to retreat to our 
northwest. This will limit shower potential through the day. Going 
with just a slight chance of POPs for now with highs in the upper 
60s and low 70s. The trough and cold front draw closer on Thursday 
and by Thursday night POPs begin to increase again as the cold front 
approaches western TN. Chance and likely POPs in place from Thursday 
night through Friday morning as the cold front swings through. Highs 
on Friday will occur around daybreak and will slowly drop through 
the day as cold air ushers in behind the front. Drier air and colder 
temps in place on Saturday as we are in the post-frontal airmass. 
Highs only in the 40s. 

Overall, the Wed/Thu/Fri doesn't appear to be a heavy rain-maker 
across the area at this time. Again, the heaviest precip looks to 
remain to our northwest. However, we will continue to watch this 
system as it evolves over the next few days.

.DISCUSSION...
Latest WV imagery indicates a shortwave trough moving through the 
Midsouth region at this time, with moisture (and thus clouds)
advecting into the TN valley out ahead. With that, mid levels cigs
across northern AL/GA will push northward with time tonight,
likely yielding cloudy skies for locations south of I40, with
partly cloudy skies trending northward. Therefore, ample diurnal
cooling is favored across portions of the northern Plateau/Valley,
and into southwest VA. As for the fcst, did tweak temperatures
through the overnight to align with recent obs/guidance trends.
These changes amidst reduced sky cover and decoupling of the BL
could favor some patchy fog for the above noted cooling regions.
Otherwise, no other changes needed/made at this time.

VFR through the vast majority of the taf cycle, with the only

association with moisture tied to an upper wave. Likewise, can't 
rule out some light MVFR fog at TRI overnight, albeit confidence

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

The predominant feature to keep an eye on in the short term will
be the approaching minor shortwave trough that will be passing to
our south. While all the models are in agreement as to the timing
of the shortwave passing through on Sunday morning, there are a
few differences in moisture content. While the NAM and SREF seem
to run more on the dry side, the GFS and Euro model in particular,
are showing a little more moisture. While most of the rain is 
expected to stay to the south of the forecast area, a few of our 
southern counties have a decent chance of seeing some rain. Most of 
the forecast area will see an increase in cloud cover from this 
system, due to the advection of warm, moist air. We can also look 
forward to an increase in temperatures for the forecast, with most 
areas looking to be much warmer than the seasonal average over the 
next few days.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

Weather system on the West Coast when this period begins will 
slowly ramble across the country, keeping the S.E. US in a mild 
and humid regime all the way through midweek, with isolated to 
scattered showers at best. But the main piece of energy will line 
up a frontal boundary beneath paralleling SW flow aloft over the 
Red/Mississippi/Ohio Valleys for Wed and Thurs...keeping best QPF 
well to our west. This system will then push through our area late
Thurs night and Fri, weakening as it moves through. The good news
at this moment is that this solution seems to be resulting in 
lesser QPFs across the area...with the highest across the northern
Plateau, and overall less than an inch across SE TN. But this 
dynamic system is still far off and models will probably continue 
to debate their solutions for a few more days.

.AVIATION...

Look for the clouds to clear out through the afternoon, leading to
mostly scattered skies, but then begin to fill back in later in
the TAF period due to the shortwave moving eastward to our south.
While none of the terminals are expected to receive much of an
impact from the minor shortwave, CHA in particular, could see 
some lower ceilings late tonight and early tomorrow morning. In
addition, TRI cities does have the potential to reach MVFR due to
early morning fog, but confidence is not high enough at the moment 
to include it in the TAF. All sites are expected to see 
predominantly VFR conditions for the majority of the TAF period.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...A mid/upper level short wave 
ridge will build in from the west today.  Lingering clouds will 
gradually clear out, with sunshine and warmer temperatures this 
afternoon. Tonight a mid/upper level short wave trough will be 
traversing the gulf states to our south, and enough moisture will be 
pulled north for an increase in clouds especially southern parts of 
the area.  Will generally not stray far from MAV temps, which look 
reasonable overall.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)... Overall, not much change in 
the long term as it still looks like a mild and fairly active 
pattern with uncertainty still regarding the Wed/Thu/Fri system.

We start the period with a weak shortwave passing across to our 
south on Sunday. There are still some minor differences on placement 
of this wave but it looks like the bulk of of the precip stays well 
to our south. Still including some slight chance POPs in across 
southwest NC but dry everywhere else. The greatest affect this 
system will have on our area will be cloud cover. More clouds 
expected across the southern areas compared to northern areas. 
Clouds decrease through the afternoon hours with high temps in the 
upper 50s to low 60s. 

As the shortwave exits off to our east on Sunday night into Monday, 
an upper level trough is moving through the Great Plains and into 
the Ohio River Valley. There is a little better agreement between 
models compared to last night. The ECMWF is trending a little wetter 
now. Models in good agreement that the first half of Monday will be 
dry with precip not moving in until the afternoon/evening hours. 
Clouds increase through the day as southwest flow advects in 
moisture. Highs will be in the upper 50s to low 60s. Last night the 
GFS had the cold front associated with the trough passing south 
through our area Monday night/Tue but now the GFS is more in line 
with the ECMWF which keeps the front just to our north in a west-to-
east orientation. Stalled boundary will be focus for some light 
showers around on Tuesday. Highs will be in the upper 50s to mid 60s 
as we remain in the warm sector. 

The main concern of the long term period continues to be with the 
Wed/Thu/Fri system. There are still big timing differences between 
models but the overall synoptic setup lines up fairly well as of 
now. Models agree that high pressure becomes established over the 
Gulf of Mexico while a deep trough is entering the Western United 
States. Strong southwesterly 850mb flow develops and the area of 
high pressure and low pressure associated with the trough work in 
unison to advect in above normal moisture for this time of year. It 
still looks like we could see some periods of moderate to heavy rain 
as PW values are very high but as of now models in good agreement 
that the heaviest precip will fall to our northwest. 

Models very poor on when the actual trough and cold front swing 
through our area. The ECMWF has the front blowing through on 
Thursday night/Friday while the GFS doesn't bring it through until 
Friday night/Saturday. This will greatly affect POPs for Friday so 
very little confidence as of now. Warmest temps of the period look 
to occur on Thursday out ahead of the front with highs in the upper 
60s to near 70. With southwest flow established, low temps from 
Monday night through Thursday night will be in the 40s and 50s.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...An upper level wave will move
across the Southern Appalachian region tonight bringing a few
final flurries of snow to the mountains of Northeast Tennessee and
higher terrain across Southwest Virginia. The layer of moisture
on the tail end of this wave will remain behind tonight into 
Saturday due to some isentropic lift present across the Mid South.
The warming trend will continue with lows tonight expected to fall
only to the lower and middle 30s. Highs will top out in the 
middle and upper 50s north to lower 60s south with the help of 
increasing sunshine from south to north during the day.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...A shortwave trough 
in the southern stream will pass to our south on Sunday. The model
trend has been to suppress precip to our south and east as it 
passes by, and only the ECMWF keeps any precip in our SW NC 
counties. Will follow this trend and lower PoPs slightly for 
Sunday, having just a slight chance PoP in Clay and Cherokee 
counties on Sunday. 

A ridge through the mid and upper levels will be building over the 
region on Sunday night, with a SW low to midlevel flow developing 
behind the ridge on Monday. Moisture advection will bring increasing 
cloud cover through the day, and the approach of a weak shortwave 
trough will bring chance PoPs in the afternoon. Mild temperatures in 
the lower 60s can be expected with the low level SW flow through 
most of the TN Valley. A trailing cold front never quite makes it
through our area as it becomes nearly parallel to the W-SW flow 
aloft, stalling near our northern counties on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, a large ridge across the FL peninsula and western 
Atlantic begins pumping Gulf moisture into the southern Plains and
Deep South. Uncertainty regarding the details is high this far 
out and model agreement is poor, but it generally appears that we 
will be in a warm and moist SW flow each day that will produce 
high chance to likely PoPs and above normal temperatures through 
at least Friday. Since confidence is low this period, no major 
changes will be made to the previous forecast.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Warmer air will begin moving in 
during the short term period. Some weak isentropic lift will bring 
patches of very light precipitation today especially across the 
north.  A look at model soundings indicates precipitation type will 
likely start as light snow at least across the north before 
transitioning to rain as the boundary layer warms. However, highest 
PoPs will be in the chance range and precipitation amounts will be 
minimal. Clouds will linger into tonight, but a gradual decrease in 
clouds from southwest to northeast is forecast as drying occurs.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...Overall, a warm and 
active pattern through the extended. 

On Saturday the flow is mostly zonal across the area with high 
pressure off to our southeast over the Atlantic. Some clouds around 
to start the day but clouds lift northward and thin as the day 
progresses. Highs will be in the upper 50s to near 60 across our 
southern areas and low to mid 50s across our far northern areas. 
Saturday night into Sunday a weak shortwave is moving through the 
mostly zonal flow but there is some model disagreement. The ECMWF 
brings this wave closer to our area whereas the GFS is slightly 
further south. If the track is further north as the ECMWF suggest 
our extreme southern areas may see some very light rain showers 
Saturday night into Sunday morning. No showers if the GFS is 
correct. Lows Saturday night lows in the mid 30s to low 40s. More 
clouds across southern areas Sunday than northern areas due to 
proximity of the weak shortwave passing through. Highs will be in 
the upper 50s to near 60. 

Sunday night into Monday southwest flow begins to increase as a 
trough and associated cold front swing through the Great Plains. The 
GFS and ECMWF agree that precip should hold off until later in the 
day on Monday. However, they disagree on the strength of the system. 
The GFS is slightly more amplified with the upper trough and is more 
organized whereas the ECMWF has a flatter wave keeping the better 
dynamics to our north, which results in lesser precip moving through 
the area. Highs on Monday in the lower 60s with clouds increasing 
through the day from southwest to northeast. 

Depending on which model is right on Monday will determine POPs for 
Tuesday. Since the GFS has a deeper wave it brings the cold front 
through the area, allowing for a drier airmass and no POPs on 
Tuesday. The cold front doesn't make it to our area and remains 
north according to the weaker ECMWF which allows us to remain in a 
warmer and moister airmass. This scenario gives us a shot at precip. 


Wednesday through Thursday gives us our best chance of precip of the 
period. However, it's difficult to nail down the forecast with fine 
details at this point as questions remain on timing and placement of 
several key features. Generally, high pressure in the Gulf of Mexico 
and subtropical jet will pump moisture in across the Southern Plains 
states Tuesday night into Wednesday. This moisture spreads in across 
our area on Wed/Thu as the high in the Gulf shifts eastward and the 
850mb flow becomes southwest across our area. Forecast uncertainty 
is due to how the subtropical and polar jet merge and interact as an 
incoming western states trough swings across our area Wed/Thu. PW

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...

The short term period will be fairly quiet with slight chances of
precipitation on Friday.

The upper levels feature retreating cyclonic flow across the
eastern CONUS, with increasing heights and ridging over the
Western CONUS. A cutoff low is beginning to move onshore across
California. A highly amplified trough was analyzed across the
northeast Pacific. A fetch of moisture associated with this trough
was moving across the ridge and into the upper plains. At the
surface, high pressure was moving across the Ohio Valley, with a
quasi-stationary boundary draped across the central plains and
southeast. 

The rest of today will feature mostly clear to partly cloudy skies
over a large portion of the forecast area as mid to upper level
moisture continues to move southeast. As the upper level trough
across the east begins to move further eastward, more zonal flow 
sets up across the region. The retreating cold air mass will allow
low-level temperatures to increase under a WAA regime as noted on
2-D surfaces, and model soundings. A weak low level jet will 
allow the aforementioned surface boundary to begin to lift 
northward tonight and on Friday. As the low-level boundary 
situates itself across the Mid south and Ohio valley, isentropic 
ascent will strengthen along this boundary. The associated lift 
will allow for light precipitation along the boundary. Expect an 
increase in clouds on Friday with only a slight chance of rain 
showers mainly north of I-40. Model soundings depict a very dry 
sub-cloud layer which would likely keep precipitation very light 
at best. Given some wet-bulbing effects, some light wintry 
precipitation is possible mainly across SW VA on the leading edge
of the precipitation. Given little to no accumulation expected, 
impacts should remain minimal. This is mentioned in the HWO, and 
an SPS may be needed should conditions warrant. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...

Warmer pattern in the extended forecast as southerly flow sets up. 
Higher pressure across the Mid Atlantic and southeast States will 
strengthen with weak warm front moving north of the area Friday 
night. Clearing skies from south to north will still bring 
temperatures down into the lower to mid 30s. High pressure will 
bring a pleasant winter day to the region Saturday with highs 
reaching the 50s to lower 60s. Will follow closest to ECMWF solution 
for the Sunday/Monday period. A weak surface low along the Gulf 
Coast Saturday night and a closed upper low just to the south will 
bring moisture north into the southern part of the area with some 
light rain showers late Saturday night and Sunday. Sunday night into 
Monday models are developing a system in the plains and starting to 
bring in more moisture into the eastern Tennessee Valley. Will bring 
slight chance to chance showers over the rest of the area Monday. 
Still low confidence for the timing of next front for Tuesday 
through Thursday as models tending to hold system back with just 
weak impulses approaching the forecast area Tuesday and only light 
rain showers. The system intensifies by Wednesday but gets held back 
as new surface low develops over the southern plains Wednesday. 
Temperatures will stay mild through the period with highs upper 50s 
to lower 60s Sunday and Monday and then mid to upper 60s Tuesday and 
Wednesday. Behind the front Thursday temperatures will show a 10 to 
15 degree temperature drop for highs and much colder temperatures 
after that. Lows will all be above freezing through the extended.

.DISCUSSION...

Main updates were to hourly weather elements,and max 
temperatures. Cloudy skies were beginning to lift north with drier
air moving across western and southern portions of the forecast 
area. This drier air shows up well on GOES 7.34 micrometer 
imagery. In response to this clearing, temperatures were beginning
to warm quicker than earlier forecast. Updated the hourly and max
temperatures grids to account for these trends. 

Upper level water vapor imagery shows increasing moisture
beginning to move in from the northwest. This is associated with
a weak disturbance moving through upper level cyclonic flow. This
may bring mid to high level clouds back into the area through the
afternoon. Otherwise, the forecast is in good shape, with no 
other updates planned at this time.

358 AM EST Thu Jan 31 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Today is the beginning of our
warming trend as most areas will rise above the freezing mark!
Southwest VA and extreme northeast TN however will stay in the 
upper 20s to lower 30s. 

Warming is due to the flow becoming more zonal today thanks to the
long wave trough lifting off to the northeast. Weak ridging 
begins to develop and fill in behind the departing trough as the
day progresses. As the trough is slowly lifting northeast, a 
small and weak lobe of energy rotates through the trough base and
across our area, allowing for some cloud to spread in. Areas 
greatest affected will be north of I-40, especially into southwest
VA and northeast TN. By the end of the day, weak southwesterly 
flow in place back across west TN as surface high pressure further 
develops to our southeast. 

Not as cold tonight as southwesterly flow continues to slowly 
strengthen. It looks like temps actually rise a few degrees after
midnight and through day break Friday as an 850 mb jet begins to 
nose in from the southwest. Areas influenced the most will be 
north of I-40. Some cloud cover expected overnight as southwest
flow advects in moisture. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...Arctic high pressure
associated with a deep upper trough over the eastern United 
States the last few days, will shift off the eastern seaboard 
beginning Friday morning. This will set the stage for persistent 
southerly flow into the forecast area for the remainder of the 
long term period, with well above normal temperatures and a few 
chances for rain thanks to an active/progressive upper pattern.

For Friday morning, one last impulse embedded in the departing 
eastern trough will swing through the Ohio River Valley and into 
West Virginia. This clipper system will help to pull the arctic cold 
front, currently to our south, back north through the forecast area 
as a warm front during the pre-dawn hours on Friday morning. Warm 
frontal passage notwithstanding, temperatures will be slow to rise 
above the freezing mark until right around daybreak. Isentropic 
analysis shows that the best forcing for ascent will be located to 
the north and west of our CWA, maximized from roughly the Nashville 
area northeast into Kentucky. Model QPF reflects this, showing a 
band of precipitation along that same axis, gradually shifting east 
with time from before daybreak through mid morning Friday. By mid to 
late morning, the jet streak and upper trough shift far enough east 
that forcing is lost and precip chances wane to negligible values. 
The main question for tomorrow morning is, will precipitation occur 
while temperatures are still cold enough to support a wintry 
variety? At this point, model sounding show marginal support for a 
mixed bag if wintry precipitation, possibly as a mix of snow, sleet, 
and freezing rain, but quickly transitioning to all rain. That 
sounds bad, but it's worth pointing out that this would occur over 
the course of perhaps 2-3 hours at most, and with very low liquid 
equivalent QPF amounts. In other words, snow or ice accumulations 
will be effectively zero. Same goes for impacts.

Wintry precip aside, temps warm into the 40s to perhaps low 50s 
(south) on Friday as the warm advection regime gets established. 
Confidence is high that this warming trend will continue through the 
remainder of the long term, with widespread highs in the upper 50s 
to low 60s expected for Sunday onward. Despite model disagreement on 
the pattern, all guidance is showing these above normal temperatures.

Where confidence is low is with regard to rain chances early next 
week. Model solutions diverge quickly over the weekend with respect 
to how they handle the evolution of the upper pattern across the 
CONUS. Agreement is good that a southern stream disturbance will 
shift east from southern California on Friday, to Georgia by Sunday. 
Further to the west a deep trough will slide south along the Pacific 
Northwest and northern California coast Saturday into Sunday then 
eject east through the four corners region on Sunday. But the speed 
and strength of the western trough as it ejects east into the 
nation's interior is not well agreed upon at all. Subsequently, 
there is considerable spread with regard to how widespread 
precipitation becomes locally as we head into Monday. For now, have 
some low PoPs for showers in the southern zones with the 
approach/passage of the aforementioned southern stream disturbance. 
Have much higher PoPs on Monday for that next system but fear those 
may be far too high given the uncertainties that exist.

.DISCUSSION...

Another bitterly cold night forecast with temperatures already in
the teens and 20s with most locations forecast to drop down into
the single digits and teens. Overnight lows are on the warmer side
of forecast guidance with winds still remaining up and a deck of
clouds moving in from the west preventing ideal radiational
cooling conditions. 

The area of snow back to the west in association with a fast
moving mid-level trough is the other point of interest for the
update tonight. Radar imagery and surface observations indicate a
broad area of light snow across Missouri, southern Illinois and
western Kentucky. Most models indicate that this area of snow
should have dissipated by now but the HRRR seems to have the best
handle on the situation. The HRRR indicate that this area of light
snow will hold together into southwest Virginia and have increased
PoPs for the update. The system is rather progressive and the
chances for snow will only last from around 05-08z. The ground is
cold after the last couple of days and have mentioned a dusting up
to a couple of tenths of an inch of accumulation for southwest
Virginia.


Winds will continue to decrease overnight but wind chills will
still drop to 5 to 10 below zero across the higher elevations of
the east Tennessee mountains and the higher elevations of
southwest Virginia where a wind chill advisory continues through
10 AM Thursday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...

Visible imagery this afternoon shows skies have cleared as a
strong cold front continues to move through the forecast area. A
much drier air mass is following this front with dew points in the
teens to the single digits. A strong area of high pressure moving
out of the Midwest is creating strong gradient winds behind the
front with gusty winds. The upper level pattern is characterized 
by deep cyclonic flow across most of the CONUS with several 
perturbations rotating through this flow. Increasing heights are 
noted across the Eastern Pacific, with a cutoff low just off the 
west coast. Water vapor imagery shows a well defined meridional 
deformation zone to the west of this low. Heights begin to 
increase tonight as the flow begins to become less amplified. An 
area of enhanced upper level winds will begin to move through the 
base of the upper cyclonic flow providing weak synoptic scale lift
across the Ohio/Tennessee valley. In response to this increase in
lift, model guidance increase low to mid level moisture. The HRRR
is the only model that develops any QPF with this across Kentucky
before beginning to dry out as it moves into far northern 
counties in the MRX CWA. As a result of this weak lift and a 
strong surface high across the Ohio Valley, only expect an 
increase in cloud cover with maybe some flurries across northeast
Tennessee, and southwest Virginia. Skies clear out on Thursday 
with high pressure, and increasing heights aloft. Warm air 
advection at 850mb will begin on Thursday with warmer daytime 
highs. Southern portions of the forecast area will likely see 
highs in the upper 30's to low 40's as skies remain mostly clear. 
Areas across SW Virginia will likely stay much cooler with the 
increased cloud cover. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...

Light precipitation in the form of light rain and a light snow will 
be possible as upper level energy begins to shift back north early 
Friday. One last night of cold temperatures below freezing but light 
south to southwest winds aloft will begin to warm temperatures to 
above freezing across plateau and southern valley early Friday 
morning. Have slowed weak impulse moving in Friday slightly so only 
a short period of snow possible before temperatures warm above 
freezing. Expect amounts to be light. With increased cloud cover 
temperatures will slowly warm into the 40s and lower 50s...some 
upper 30s in higher elevations. From saturday on pattern changes as 
cold high shifts east and southwest flow aloft produces strong 
warming trend. Modified airmass Saturday with sunshine will begin 
above normal trend with highs in the 50s to near 60 south valley. 
Moisture increases Saturday night and Sunday with light rain in the 
south and even warmer temperatures in the upper 50s to lower 60s. A 
deepening low over the plains states moves up into the Great Lakes 
Monday. This system will bring up more warm air from the gulf with a 
chance of showers spreading across the entire region. Light to 
moderate rain showers will again occur. This front will slow as high 
pressure remains off the southeast coast. Temperatures will stay 
warm reaching the mid to upper 60s Tuesday and then again Wednesday 
as the front still has not made it through. There is a possibility 
of a few thunderstorms the last 2 days but have not included any in 
the forecast yet. Also with the continued wet pattern...rainfall may 
become heavy at times.

.DISCUSSION...

This update consists of minor tweaks to hourly temperature, 
dewpoint, and PoP grids to account for latest trends. 
Currently, temperatures were warming quicker than guidance. 
Bumped up high temperatures a few degrees across most areas as 
the front has lagged a bit. The cold front which currently extends
to the NW of the forecast area will quickly move through late 
this morning and this afternoon. Temperatures will fall again 
behind the front with strong cold air advection. Regional radar 
this morning depicts light snow showers, with local and upstream 
observations also showing this light snow. This snow is being 
generated along an enhanced zone of low-level frontogenesis. 
However, short term model trends show a decrease in frontogenesis 
and therefor precipitation. Westerly winds across the plateau 
would also likely induce some downsloping and subsequent drying. 
Mesoanalysis indicates RH in the DGZ in the 60 to 80 percent range
across SW VA, which would support this area to receive some light
snowfall. An SPS has been issued because of this and upstream 
observations. Not expecting much if any accumulations of snow. 
Winds should continue to gust up to 30 knots across the higher 
terrain, mainly above 3,000 feet.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast mostly on track but wanted to send out a 
quick update regarding the winds for today. Have bumped up wind 
gusts through the day based on latest guidance and upstream obs. 
Previous forecast had gusty winds but wanted to raise them a 
little. Some of the higher terrain areas across the eastern
mountains will see near wind advisory criteria but not issuing 
anything at this time as we fall slightly under criteria. Gusts 
across most areas will range from 25 to 35 mph with isolated 
gusts up to 40 mph. The southern TN Valley should see slightly 
lower gusts compared to other areas, with gusts more in the 15 mph 
to 20 mph range. New zones out shortly.

406 AM EST Wed Jan 30 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Another reinforcing shot of arctic air headed our direction. 
Current radar returns across central and eastern KY show light 
snow showers along and just ahead of the front. Models in good 
agreement that the frontogentic lift associated with the front 
weakens as it nears our area, thus eventually weakening the 
returns currently seen. Slight chance and low end chance POPs in
place along our TN/KY and VA/KY border counties through around 
noon to account for the snow showers dropping down out of KY.
Though QPF is light and snow showers will be weakening, put in a 
couple tenths of an inch of snow accum across the our VA/KY 
border counties because of how cold temps are. Slight cloud 
increase also expected with the front, but mostly sunny skies
expected overall behind the frontal passage.

Highs today will range from the upper teens lower 20s near the 
TN/KY/VA line to lower 30s down toward Chattanooga. Gusty winds
also expected this afternoon along with drier air. Low RH values
and gusty winds will allow for near red flag conditions for some
areas. Temps start dropping mid/late afternoon across the northern
areas behind the front.

Overnight lows will be in the single digits to lower teens. It
would be even colder if it weren't for some overnight cloud cover
moving in. Wind chill advisory for the mountains continues through
Thursday morning and the one for the VA counties goes into effect
tonight at 7 PM EST and goes through Thursday morning as well. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...
On Thursday the arctic air begins to moderate as the large upper 
trough over the eastern CONUS as well as the parent surface high 
pressure center retreats to the northeast. Highs will likely rise to 
near or above freezing for areas south of the Tri Cities. For 
southwest Virginia and also higher elevations in the Tennessee 
mountains, another day of sub-freezing temperatures appear likely.

In the wake of the cold outbreak, a progressive and active pattern 
will setup over the country. One last jet streak will dive into the 
retreating upper trough Thursday night into Friday morning. Forcing 
remains to our north, but with the last vestiges of the arctic front 
lifting back north through the area early Friday there should be 
enough lift to create some light precipitation. The best chances 
will be over the plateau and into eastern Kentucky and southwest 
Virginia. Still, will leave some slight chances eastward into the 
mountains as well early Friday. It will be cold enough Thursday 
night for some ptype concerns on Friday morning. Do have some snow 
or rain/snow mix in the forecast with precipitation onset, but 
amounts should be light so do not expect much in the way of impacts. 
Furthermore there is some indication that warm advection at the 
surface could begin early enough Thursday night to make this a non-
concern to begin with. For now, will stick with a normal diurnal 
trend for hourly temperatures and a northward retreating rain/snow 
mix during the morning hours. By late morning all rain is expected. 
Eventually the boundary will shift to our north by late Friday, 
bringing rain chances to an end. Interestingly though, a westerly 
fetch of 850mb moisture will likely keep cloudy skies in place 
through late Friday night. Could see a few showers lingering in the 
higher terrain late in the day as well given some orographic 
component to winds above roughly 2000 ft. Otherwise rain chances 
will be negligible after midday for most everyone.

By late Thursday a southern stream disturbance will reside over 
southern California, beneath the longwave western upper ridge. This 
rex block pattern will slowly break down as it shifts east Friday 
into Saturday. The resulting downstream surface pattern will be one 
of persistent southerly flow Friday into the weekend locally, 
with temperatures warming into the 50s and perhaps even 60s for 
Saturday and Sunday. Expect mostly dry conditions over the 
weekend, however the aforementioned SoCal disturbance will have 
shifted over northern Alabama and Georgia by Saturday night into 
Sunday morning. Some g guidance indicates chances for rain over 
the southern valley and mountains on Sunday, while others show 
completely dry weather. Have some slight chance PoP in the 
forecast to account for this, but it's not a high confidence 
scenario given significant differences in timing and placement of 
that disturbance by this time.

For Monday and Tuesday, even greater differences exist in the 
evolution of the upper pattern and thus confidence is definitely not 
high. The GFS shows a very vigorous system, with widespread rain 
from the Great Lakes southward through the Ohio River Valley and 
into east Tennessee for Monday. Meanwhile the ECMWF has very little 
rain. Knocked our PoPs down considerably from what we had, but for 
persistence/consistency's sake I kept some chance PoPs in there. But 
that may be stretching it at this point. One thing that does look 
certain though...no snow.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...
Snowfall totals today ranged from trace amounts in the southwest 
and west to around 2 to as much as 4 inches in central and eastern
Tennessee Valley locations. Farther north and east the snow 
started later with amounts mostly less than 2 inches across
northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia. Higher elevations 
reported over 2 inches and reached above 4 inches in a few spots. 
The main precipitation band has just about moved out of the area 
with some possible snow showers and flurries extreme northeast 
Tennessee and southwest Virginia. Now the colder air is rushing 
in. Temperatures at mid afternoon are in the mid 20s to lower 30s 
with the warmest temperatures in the extreme southern valley where
skies have cleared first and also in across southwest North 
Carolina and southwest Virginia where the colder air has just 
moved in. Skies are clearing tonight and with west northwest winds
around 10 to 15 mph...wind chills will drop to single digits 
lower elevations and below zero higher elevations as the actual 
temperatures drop into the teens with single digits highest 
elevations.

A deep cold upper level low has dropped into the Western Great Lakes 
this afternoon bringing the cold arctic airmass into the Tennessee 
Valley. Tonight a weak system will drop through the Northwest flow 
into the Ohio Valley and spread clouds back into the northwest 
sections early Wednesday. A brief few tenths of an inch of snow 
Wednesday morning before skies clear out. Also winds will pick up by 
afternoon behind this system. Highs should reach the 30s south where 
there will be more sun and 20s north but below 20 in the highest 
elevations of east Tennessee and southwest Virginia.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
We begin with deep arctic air entrenched over our entire county 
warning area Wednesday night. The anomalously deep sub 487 dam 
upper low at 500 mb will be rotating from the central Great Lakes 
toward eastern Ontario and Quebec during this time. This will 
allow the longwave 500 mb trough over the eastern U.S. to begin a 
slow east and northeastward shift with a 1034 mb surface high 
pressure sliding down into Illinois and Indiana. The result will 
be fairly clear skies and light winds over our region. This 
combined with 850 mb temps of -15 to -20 over southwest VA and -8 
to -15 over east TN and southwest NC will result in the coldest 
night of the season so far. The NAM, GFS, and ECMWF as well as MOS
and MET guidance seem too warm Wednesday night based on this 
environment. Recent research at our office showed that the 
Canadian (CMC) handled recent arctic air well, so I am using a 50%
blend of this model to the previous forecast for the lows 
Wednesday night. This will bring lows down into the single digits 
in southwest VA, northeast TN, the Smoky Mountains, and on the 
plateau with low teens in most of the valley. A pocket of mid to 
upper teens should occur across the far southern valley near 
Chattanooga.

In terms of wind chills, soundings for TRI show 25-40 kt winds 
around 850 mb lingering tomorrow night which should allow for 5-10 
mph surface gusts in far northeast TN and southwest VA with some 15 
mph gusts in higher ridges of southwest VA. The SREF is most 
aggressive with these winds, and I feel pretty confident that they 
will occur due to weak short waves and enhanced jet energy rounding 
the base of the trough over that region. For this reason, I have 
expanded the wind chill advisory across Russell, Wise, and 
Washington Counties in southwest Virginia to cover -5 to -10 deg 
wind chill values. This will expire along with the previous advisory 
at 15Z.

The above mentioned surface high shifting eastward into Ohio and 
Pennsylvania Thursday will allow mostly sunny skies and slowly 
rebounding temps across our region. Again, I will use a blend of the 
CMC and previous forecast for highs to cover the retreating upper 
trough and corresponding arctic air. This will yield upper 20's to 
low 30's across northeast TN and southwest VA with low to mid 30's 
across the valley and plateau and possibly around 40 in the southern 
valley. Increasing warm air advection and clouds Thursday night will 
hold lows 10-15 degrees warmer compared to the bitterly cold 
previous night.

Friday's forecast is still a bit challenging. Isentropic lift based 
on pressure advection on a 300K pressure layer should cause light 
precip to develop in the morning, but confidence on timing and 
amounts are low due to continued model differences. The GFS shows 
widespread precip much of the day while the ECMWF is fairly dry. The 
NAM is dry in the morning then moves activity in during the 
afternoon. NAM12 soundings for TRI project faster boundary layer 
warming compared to yesterday's runs, and alot of dry air will be in 
place. However, lingering low level cold in the morning could still 
lead to light mixed precip if anything manages to reach the ground. 
All areas will warm well above freezing for the afternoon. At this 
point, I will continue with chance to slight chance pops and a 
rain/snow mix wording.

The weekend into early next week continues to look warm and 
unsettled. A zonal flow over the eastern U.S. will give way to a 
western trough and eastern ridge. Temps will be above normal, and 
guidance suggests a series of disturbances will lead to a wet 
pattern at times, but timing differences exit. I am keeping the 
Superblend pops for this period.

411 AM EST Tue Jan 29 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Let's get straight to the point. 
Snowfall amounts continue to trend downward this morning based on 
all the latest data. Total snowfall amounts are similar to the 
previous evening update but slightly lower with this latest 
forecast. Generally, it looks like most of the central and southern 
valley will see amounts less than one inch, with some areas seeing 
little to no accumulation. Some lower elevation areas across 
northeast TN and into southwest VA could see up to 1 inch, but most 
areas will see less than an inch. The higher terrain areas of 
northeast TN and southwest VA could see 1 to 2 inches. The high 
terrain of the eastern mountains will see amounts from 2 to 4 
inches. Southwest NC will see less than an inch for valley locations 
and 1 to 2 inches across the high terrain.

The cold front is on our doorstep and cold air will move in quickly 
over the next few hours. Temps are still in the mid to upper 40s 
across most of the area with temps in the lower 30s on the 
Cumberland Plateau. The lowered snowfall amounts are due to lack of 
moisture along the front and the slower arrival of the cold air. As 
it stands, there will be a very small window for accumulation to 
occur this morning as we currently have the precip over the area but 
are still waiting on the cold air. Rain will change over to snow as 
cold air rushes into the valley over the next few hours but the 
precip doesn't hang around for long. The changeover from rain to 
snow doesn't occur in the central valley until 6 to 8 AM EST. Our 
narrow band of precip will likely be east of I-75 between 10 AM EST 
and noon. Snow showers will linger across northeast TN and southwest 
VA into the early afternoon. Snow showers will linger across the 
high terrain of the eastern mountains through late afternoon.

Most areas will see sunshine by early/mid afternoon as moisture 
clears out quickly. Once temps drop, temps will remain in the upper 
20s and lower 30s for most of the day. Very cold temps tonight as 
arctic air moves in with lows in the lower to upper teens. 

Broke up the winter weather advisory into two segments. Areas west 
of I-75 will expire at noon and areas east of I-75 will expire at 4 
PM EST. Winter storm warning and wind chill advisory remain 
unchanged. 



.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...The gist of the long term 
is that the large upper trough responsible for the cold outbreak 
this week, will shift east of the New England coast by Thursday 
evening. This will allow for a more progressive upper pattern for 
the remainder of the long term, along with warmer temperatures and
a few chances of rain.

Going into a bit more detail, Wednesday will start off rather chilly 
with morning lows in the teens for low elevation areas and some 
single digits perhaps in the higher ridges of the mountains. Suspect 
the southern valley will likely rise above freezing by the afternoon 
but for areas closer to, or north of, the I-40 corridor mid to upper 
20s will be about it for highs. The upper low over the Great Lakes 
will still be in place for much of the day Wednesday. Rounding 
the base of this trough during the first half of the day will be a
+140kt jet streak, being roughly centered over the TN/VA border 
by daybreak. This will be positioned atop an arctic front with a 
reinforcing shot of polar air set to spill into the region during 
the day. Models continue to advertise some light precipitation 
along this boundary as it moves in. Will maintain some slight 
chance pops for some light snow showers, but do not expect much in
the way of QPF so do not have any measurable snow accumulations 
for that time frame. Think it more likely that accumulating snow 
will be seen further north where better overall forcing resides.

Also on Wednesday, breezy conditions are expected. As the jet streak 
and arctic front move through, mixing heights should be sufficiently 
deep to tap into some +40kt winds around 800mb. Would not be 
surprised to see wind gusts of 30-40mph at higher elevations near 
the TN/VA border and especially further north into southwest 
Virginia. As the morning wears on and the arctic front continues 
south, these winds will subside however. Clearing skies and an 
arctic air mass Wednesday night should be good radiational 
conditions and sufficient enough for lows to dip into the low teens 
to perhaps single digits for even low elevation areas. Coldest 
temperatures are likely to be in SW Virginia.

Late Wednesday through Thursday night will be dry but an incoming 
system may spread precipitation back in from the southwest by 
daybreak Friday. Do have a rain/snow mix mentioned early Friday but 
uncertainty in the timing of precip is high, and strong warm 
advection will change that over to rain fairly quickly so do not 
expect any notable impacts there. Another dry patch is expected for 
the first half of the weekend, with increasing rain chances for 
Sunday and Monday.

.DISCUSSION...Still a difficult forecast for tonight into first
part of Tuesday, as current observed weather and short term 
models are generally trending toward less snowfall. However, still
will see rain changing to snow and some mainly light accumulation
in the valley, and potentially higher accumulations in the 
mountains, are still expected. Will keep the advisory and minimal 
warning going as is, but will generally lower forecast snow 
amounts. Will make a few other tweaks mainly to hourly temps and 
dew points.

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
338 PM EST Mon Jan 28 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
The short term forecast period will be active with the potential
for winter weather, and cold temperatures. Currently, skies were
mostly clear with temperatures in the 50's. An area of low
pressure was analyzed across NE IL at 18Z with a trailing cold
front extending south through the Ozarks, and into the Southern 
Plains. Regional radar depicts a band of precipitation along an 
area of enhanced 925-800mb zone of frontogenesis co-located with 
the baroclinic zone. The 12Z suite of guidance had trouble 
initializing this precipitation and this may cause some issues
with its raw model output relative to the precipitation field.

The synoptic pattern consists of deep mean longwave troughing
across the CONUS with several perturbations rotating through this
cyclonic flow. While the Midwest shortwave ejects northeast into
the mean upper level flow, a Polar low moves southeast with very
deep Arctic airmass. This Arctic airmass shows up well on the 
GOES 16 airmass product. Closer to the surface, an area of low 
pressure will move northeast this evening and overnight with a 
trailing sharp frontal boundary moving through the Ohio/Tennessee 
Valley. 

Precipitation will likely continue to develop along and behind
this frontal boundary as it continues to move east overnight. A
warm subcloud layer will lead to an initial p-type of liquid 
rain. As cold air advects in behind the front, this p-type will 
quickly change over to snow. While the main synoptic scale lift 
will likely be south of the MRX CWA, strong frontogenesis will 
likely allow for at least a narrow band of snow behind the front. 
While confidence remains low, there is at least a small chance 
that some heavier bands could be realized along the steep frontal 
slope. Another item of interest to watch is the development of a 
weak surface low along the baroclinic zone. Should this still 
occur near the CWA, enhanced convergence could increase QPF 
slightly. 

Probably one of the most difficult aspects of the forecast is
snowfall amounts. This will greatly depend on how much
precipitation we see and how quickly the column can cool in time
before the majority of the precipitation can move out. While
previous models were consistent in QPF amounts, the 12Z NAM came
in much drier. This does cast some doubt in the forecast,
although, it may have initialized the precipitation field 
incorrectly. Based on the latest guidance, and WPC, 0.1 to 0.4 
inches of liquid equivalent seems likely. At least half of this 
will likely be rain. Assuming at least 0.1 to 0.2 can fall as snow
still leads to most of the area seeing 1 to 2 inches with locally
higher amounts up to 3. The higher terrain in the Smoky's will 
likely see even greater amounts up to 6 inches. 

Remember that exact amounts are not important. The impacts will
remain the same with any amount of snow we receive. Hazardous
travel could be an issue especially with the timing of the change
over. The airmass behind the front will be very cold. This means,
what snow does fall will not melt on Tuesday or Tuesday night. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...
Drier conditions are expected Tuesday night as the arctic frontal
boundary moves to the east, however, the coldest air of the 
season will pour into the region. Taking a look at 500 mb, an 
anomalously deep trough will carve out across the entire U.S. east
of the Rockies Tuesday night through Thursday night. An 
extraordinarily deep upper level low at 500 mb will be located in 
the center of this trough over the upper Midwest and Great Lakes 
by Tuesday night with heights of 489 dam progged by the ECMWF and 
487 dam progged by the GFS! This upper low, infamously known as 
the polar vortex, is typically in the vicinity of Hudson Bay. The 
feature will slowly rotate eastward into Quebec by Wednesday night
and Thursday. This is all in response to a massive upper level 
ridge of high pressure situated from the west coast all the way up
into Alaska and the arctic circle over the next couple of days, 
which forces cross polar flow and a downstream displacement of the
arctic air. 

In terms of temperatures in east TN, southwest VA, and southwest NC, 
this will lead to well below normal temps with dangerous wind chills 
through early Thursday before moderation begins. Temps at 850 mb 
falling to -10 to -18 deg C by Wednesday will allow for widespread 
lows Tuesday night in the teens, and WSW surface winds of 5-15 kts 
will lead to single digit wind chills in all lower elevations with -
5 to -10 wind chills in the mountains. Highs Wednesday will only 
recover to 25-30 across the valley and southwest NC with mid teens 
to low 20's across southwest VA, the mountains, and plateau. A sub 
1035 mb surface high near Illinois Wednesday night should allow for 
calmer winds and less cloud cover resulting in the coldest night of 
this stretch. Lows in the single digits are likely across the 
plateau, northern valley, and mountains with low teens across the 
southern valley and southwest NC. Below zero lows are not out of the 
question in southwest VA. Wind chills between -5 and -15 should be 
more widespread Wednesday night from the mountains through southwest 
VA. The good news is that the upper trough lifting northeastward 
Thursday will allow highs to recover to above 30 in many areas. 

Snow chances in this arctic airmass look confined to Wednesday. A 
secondary lobe of vorticity rotates through the 500 mb trough during 
the morning and afternoon. The right entrance region of a distinct 
jet streak (120 kts at 500 mb and 150 kts at 300 mb) will produce a 
swath of light snow across the northern valley and southwest VA 
beginning Wednesday morning, so I have included chance pops as of 
now. The NAM holds onto these snow shower chances through Thursday 
morning, while the GFS, ECMWF, and CMC end the activity by Wednesday 
evening, so confidence on timing is still fairly low. Amounts should 
be on the light side with no more than 0.5 inches.

For the remainder of the long-term, retreating cold air and building 
heights aloft combined with a weak surface low west of the Tennessee 
Valley will begin a warm air advection pattern Friday. This will 
result in isentropic lift induced precipitation. Lingering cold air 
near the surface in northeast TN and southwest VA could allow precip 
to start as a mix of snow, sleet, and rain up there. Soundings from 
the GFS show a warm layer around 850 mb with a shallow remaining sub 
freezing layer at TRI Friday morning, but the GFS and ECMWF are in 
disagreement about how much precip there may be with the ECMWF 
running drier. I put chance pops in the grids with a rain/snow mix 
wording. This will be find tuned in the coming days. Heights will 
continue to build this weekend bringing much warmer temps, but the 
pattern will remain unsettled with rain moving into the area by 
Sunday.

.DISCUSSION...

Made minor tweaks to temperature, and dewpoints based on latest
data, and trends. Currently, temperatures are in the low to mid
30's with clear skies. At 12Z, deep surface low pressure was 
analyzed near eastern Iowa. An associated cold front extends from
this low across the Ozarks and southern plains. In the upper 
levels, a shortwave was diving south out of the Midwest. As this 
shortwave continues east, the atmosphere will begin to saturate. 
This is starting to show up in upstream 12z soundings. 

Low-level winds are beginning to back toward the southwest ahead
of the baroclinic zone. This will advect a warmer low-level 
airmass. Decided to go a bit higher on afternoon highs. Yesterday 
was warmer than what guidance advertised, and see no reason why 
we will not be just as warm or warmer then yesterday. 

New 12Z suite of guidance is beginning to come in. It is trending
drier, but will wait to see additional guidance this morning 
before making any significant changes to the forecast.

.SHORT TERM...(Today)...

A cold arctic air mass is heading our way, but first a very nice 
January day is on tap across the region.

Strong low pressure was situated over central Iowa this morning, 
with a cold front draped southwestward across the central plains and 
a stationary boundary extending southeast through the Tennessee 
Valley and the southern Appalachians. Meanwhile the arctic front was 
just a little further north across Wyoming and South Dakota. The 
aforementioned stationary boundary will surge back to the north as a 
warm front today as the Iowa surface low moves east into Michigan. 
This is all in response to strong energy diving south into a 
persistent and broad upper trough that has been in place across the 
eastern CONUS for the last couple of days. With the warm front to 
our north and us sitting firmly in the warm sector of the 
strengthening mid latitude cyclone, expect to see a very comfortable 
January day. A well mixed low level atmosphere should result in 
partly to mostly cloudy skies, and temperatures in the well into the 
50s for much of the Tenn Valley with a few locations possibly 
approaching 60 degrees this afternoon in the south.

The daytime hours today should be dry. Precipitation, cold air, and 
all the wintry mess arrives in the long term period beginning later 
tonight.

.LONG TERM...(Tonight through Sunday)...
A challenging forecast for tonight and Tuesday. A deep upper
trough move into the Great Lakes with a series of jets increasing
the upward forcing over the Tennessee Valley and southern
Appalachians. In response, an increasing low-level southwest jet
pulls moisture back northward into the area. There are fairly
significant disagreements in how much/fast this moisture gets
pulled north. The previous GFS and current ECMWF and NAM are in
decent agreement, but latest GFS run is drier. Plan on following
the trend with the models and SREF/GEFS plumes to decide snowfall
potential with this system. 

The jet dynamics will enhance the frontogenetic forcing along a
strong arctic front which moves across the area between 06-12Z
Tuesday. Models show a sharp drop in temperatures with frontal
passage. The precipitation will begin as a mixture of rain/snow
then quickly transition to snow with a period of 3 to 4 hours of
decent snowfall. Will call for 2 to 3 inches over most locations,
except for the Smoky Mountains to southeast Monroe County with 3
to 6 inches are anticipated. Thus will upgrade watch to an 
advisory, except warning for the Smokies.

Snow will end by late morning/early afternoon most locations with
sky gradual clearing from west to east.

For Wednesday, a true arctic front will usher in the coldest air
so far this season. A period of light snow is possible, especially
along and north of interstate 40. Dangerous wind chills are likely
for the higher elevations Tuesday night and especially Wednesday
night. Even the lower terrain will see very cold wind chills.

For Thursday, arctic high will build into the area producing dry
conditions but still cold.

For Thursday night and Friday, arctic airmass will quickly lose
it's grip with more seasonal temperatures. There is a chance of
snow or snow/rain mixture for Friday as warmer air (isentropic
lift) produces lift over the area.

For next week, upper ridging becomes established with southerly
winds developing producing milder conditions. Southerly winds will
increase the isentropic lift produce a chance of rain showers.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...
Clouds will continue to exit the region the remainder of the 
afternoon as the cold front and upper level forcing move away from 
the area. This will allow for mostly clear skies tonight as a 
surface high over the Ohio Valley nudges into the Tennessee Valley. 
The clear skies and calm winds should allow for a good radiational 
cooling night, so I am undercutting the MET and MAV blends by a 
couple of degrees for tonight's lows with generally mid 20's from 
southwest VA through northeast TN and upper 20's to low 30's for the 
rest of the area. 

The surface high will quickly shift to the east Monday with the 
pressure gradient and southerly return flow increasing ahead of a 
strong cold front moving through the Midwest. Low and mid level 
warm air advection combined with a mostly sunny sky most of the 
day will result in a pleasantly warm mid winter day across all of 
east TN, southwest VA, and southwest NC. Increasing clouds will 
hold off until after 21Z allowing for maximum surface heating to 
be achieved. Based on this afternoon's high temps that 
overachieved, the warm air advection, and mostly sunny skies, I am
going a few degrees above guidance for highs Monday. I think 
upper 50's in the southern valley and southwest NC, low to mid 
50's in the northern and central valley, and low 50's across far 
northeast TN and southwest VA are likely. The slowly increasing 
sun angle will help to achieve this. Looking at projected 
soundings, decent mixing will allow for 10-20 knot gusts from the 
south and southwest during the afternoon, especially from the 
plateau through the central and southern valley, so it will be a 
breezy and mild day. Enjoy it while you can because the above 
mentioned cold front is of arctic origin associated with a very 
amplified 500 mb trough that will center itself over the upper 
Midwest and Great Lakes for the rest of the week. This will lead 
to bigtime changes after the warm Monday. More on that below.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
Active long range with potential winter weather, and low 
temperatures midweek. By 00z Tuesday, a highly amplified mean long
wave trough will situate itself over the CONUS with several 
perturbations traveling through this cyclonic flow aloft. Long 
wave ridging will manifest itself across the eastern Pacific. A 
deep 500mb 490 dam polar low will be located near the southern 
border of Ontario, and Manitoba. Very strong curvature will exist 
aloft across the Midwest into the Mississippi river valley. An 
area of low pressure will move across the Great Lakes between 00z 
and 12z Tuesday. An associated cold front will extend from this 
surface low across the Ohio Valley and Mid south. 

Models depict the air mass will saturate quickly ahead of the strong 
shortwave as it dives south out of the Midwest.  The aforementioned 
strong cold front will traverse the region early Tuesday with 
widespread precipitation along and behind this front.   Upper level 
support will become maximized between 09z to 18z through upper level 
divergence aloft, and strong PVA near 500mb that aids in increasing 
synoptic omega.  Latest trends in the 00z and 12z guidance show the 
better upper level dynamics shifting further south.  This can be 
seen in 24 hour QPF amounts with higher QPF across central Alabama. 
Further models back away from a nearly upright direct lift response, 
however, ageostrophic circulations still support deep tropospheric 
lift. This leads to less confidence in precipitation amounts, and 
therefor snow amounts. While the initial thermal profile supports a 
rain/snow mix at the onset of precipitation, the column will quickly 
cool to below freezing. Forecast model soundings, and cross sections 
depict a rather deep (~100mb) layer of dendrite growth that is 
saturated. Omega should be strong in the saturated DGZ through 18z 
before drier air quickly filter in.  Snow-to-liquid ratios quickly 
increase to nearly 12:1 or 15:1 as the cold air mass pours in behind 
the front. The strong front will be characterized by strong 
frontogenesis from the surface through 700-500mb and just below the 
co-location of max omega and the DGZ. Cross sections also depict 
another secondary area of low-level frontogenesis that is likely due 
to a low-level convergence boundary.  

Now for snowfall amounts...The above supports a couple of inches of 
snowfall through the day on Tuesday. The newest 12z suite of model 
data paints roughly 0.2 to 0.4 of 24 hour QPF across a majority of 
the forecast area. While some of that will be in the form of rain, 
at least half should be snow. Raw model output would suggest a 1-4 
inch snow range. Further, latest 15z SREF has jumped up with a mean 
above 4 inches, although much model spread still exists. KCHA, and 
KTRI have more uncertainty with regards to QPF and snow amounts but 
have both increased with the newest run.  A couple of factors could 
lead to heavier snowfall rates.

 1) Albeit weak, NAM and GFS cross sections do show some elevated 
negative EPV within areas of saturation between 15 and 18z.    This 
weak elevated instability could allow for higher precipitation 
rates.  

 2) Guidance, specifically the NAM and GFS, have been advertising a 
surface low developing along the frontal wave as it passes through 
the area.  Should this indeed occur, surface and low-level 
convergence could increase helping to increase precipitation rates, 
and QPF.  

Needless to say, the snow forecast is low confidence.  The best 
consensus on todays shift would be a 2-4 inches of snow across a 
majority of the forecast area with higher amounts in the higher 
terrain, and SW VA. It is best to remember that the impacts will 
likely remain the same with hazardous travel expected on Tuesday. 
Due to forecasted amounts, and potential impacts to travel, have 
decided to issue a winter storm watch for the entire CWA.  

Bitter cold will follow Wednesday through Thursday as mean long wave 
troughing sets up over the Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley. 490 dam 
500mb heights will move south of the Hudson Bay area and sets up 
near the Great Lakes.  Lows Tuesday night and Wednesday night will 
fall into the teens and single digits.  Wind chills will also be 
bitter with readings in the 5 to -15 degree F range. Cyclonic flow 
remains over the eastern CONUS through midweek with an additional 
true Arctic front moving south through the Ohio/Tennessee valley. 
This front will be moisture starved, yet enough frontogenesis may be 
available to squeeze out some moisture in the form of snow.  Given 
the dynamics involved, this seems to be more showery in nature as 
low-level lapse rates become steep.  Decent microphysics exist 
aloft, with at least a 1-2 kft layer of supersaturation with respect 
to ice in the DGZ.  Confidence is too low to mention any 
accumulations at this point.  A sub-1040mb surface high glides south 
into the Ohio/Tennessee valley by 12z Thursday. There are some minor 
differences spatially in regards to where the center of the surface 
high will be placed at 12z Thursday. However, assuming we can clear 
skies, temperatures are expected to drop into the teens to single 
digits. It is not out of the realm of possibilities to see 
temperatures in the low single digits should we end up with a 
sizable snow pack on the ground with radiational cooling conditions. 
 Thursday through Friday remains below average with long wave 
troughing still over the eastern CONUS.  This weekend remains 
uncertain but seems to be unsettled with a couple of disturbances 
impacting the area.  Temperatures are expected to moderate during 
this time as well.

.DISCUSSION...Several changes for this update. I increased high
temps about 3 degrees from southwest VA through the northern
valley and northern Plateau to account for observations already
running warmer this morning. This will lead to highs in the low to
mid 40's up here. I still expect mid to upper 40's farther south
across the rest of the area. I decreased sky cover across the
southern valley for much of today but slightly increased it from
the northern valley through southwest VA. This is based on
satellite trends and surrounding neighbors. I removed all pops
from northeast TN through southwest VA this morning as precip has
not been reaching the ground, but I went with slight chances in
this area from 17-21Z. The weak cold front and enhanced mid level
jet is still expected to cross in the early to mid afternoon, and
the latest HRRR and 4-KM NAM hint at a few showers. Any precip
will mainly fall as rain due to the warmer afternoon temps
expected, but a stray flurry cannot be ruled out.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

A shortwave trough axis, embedded in the larger eastern CONUS 
trough, will approach from the west this morning. Low clouds will be 
on the increase over the forecast area in response to this feature, 
however indications are that a dry forecast is in order for most, if 
not all, of the CWA. Most guidance supports this, with the GFS being 
the wet outlier in showing a grand total of five hundredths total QPF 
today in southwest Virginia. Can't say this is totally unreasonable 
given there are some light returns on radar upstream. But certainly 
am not expecting much out of this disturbance. Previous shifts had 
slight chances in southwest Virginia and south into bordering 
Tennessee counties. Decreased PoPs slightly, shifting the focus for 
any precip mainly into southwest Virginia. Temperatures are a bit 
cooler in those same areas than previously forecast thanks mainly to 
a dearth of cloud cover so far tonight over much of the CWA. As 
such, should any precipitation occur it will likely be snow or a 
rain/snow mix for much of the morning before temps warm sufficiently 
to change precip to strictly rain. However, despite having several 
hours of snow or rain/snow mix in the forecast, QPF will be quite 
light and thus do not expect any snow accumulations whatsoever. 

Clouds will clear out this evening, making for a mostly clear 
overnight period with temperatures once again below the freezing 
mark for most areas. Mid to upper 20s will once again be the norm, 
with low 30s expected further south. The warmest places tonight will 
likely be the foothill areas south of I-40 as drainage or even 
slight downslope winds set up. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...

Main weather feature is baroclinic wave that moves across the 
late Monday night and Tuesday producing widespread precipitation. 
Also, arctic front that moves through the area Wednesday morning.

Best day during the extended period will be Monday. For Monday, 
ridging aloft and increasing southwest winds will produce a dry and 
mild day. Increasing cloudiness is expected as southwest winds pull 
moisture back into the Tennessee Valley. Breezy conditions can be
expected over the ridges and mountains. 

For Monday Night and Tuesday, a depending upper long-wave trough 
will dive into the northern plains and Great Lakes region. This 
will pull the first series of cold fronts into the Tennessee 
Valley and southern Appalachians. Models in reasonable agreement 
in pulling Gulf moisture into the area in response to the dynamic 
upper jet forcing. Strong fronto-genetic forcing is depicted along
the front late Monday night and Tuesday morning. The latest runs 
are pulling the front earlier into the area.

Initially the vertical temperature profile will be too warm for 
snow, except for the highest elevations. The light rain produced by 
the isentropic lift Monday night will be mainly rain, but as the 
strong frontal boundary moves through between 09-15Z, the rain will 
quickly transition to snow. Deep lift is noted for about 3 hours so 
do expect accumulating snows with the greatest snowfall in the 
mountains. 

Currently thinking of around 2 inches (give or take 1/2 inch) over 
most of the area, expect 3 to 6 inches across the higher elevations, 
such as High Knob, Smoky Mountains, and Roane Mountain. Still a 
little early to issue an advisory/watch, but will include into the 
HWO and SPS.

The snow will come to an end by late morning through mid-afternoon 
Tuesday with decreasing clouds. 

For Tuesday night, dry conditions are expected except for the far
east Tennessee Mountains where light snow/flurries are possible. 

For Wednesday, models show a true arctic front moving across the 
area. These type of cold air advection behind the front will squeeze 
out the lift over moisture across the region. Also, northwest flow 
will produce some orographic enhance lift in the Mountains. 
Currently going for low chance PoPs, but would not be surprised if 
we need to call for widespread light snow/flurries for much of 
Wednesday.

Very cold arctic air will be the main concern for mid-week with 
dangerous wind chills, especially for the higher terrain. The snow 
on the ground will also enhance the radiational cooling conditions 
for Wednesday night/Thursday morning.

For Thursday afternoon and Thursday night, a moderation in the 
arctic air is expected. 

For Friday, another system diving southeast from the Plains into the 
Ohio/Tennessee Valley could produce another round of wintry 
precipitation. Confidence is low on the evolution of the system.

For Saturday, upper trough lifts out with milder conditions 
returning for the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians.

.DISCUSSION...The current forecast is on track for the overnight
period into Sunday morning with weak warm air advection ahead of
a midwest frontal system. This system is relatively weak and
moisture starved, so there will be an increase in clouds prior to
sunrise with a very limited chance for snow flurries across 
Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee through the morning
hours Sunday. The main aspect of the overnight forecast will be 
the uncertainty of low temperatures, with weak warm air advection
and the arrival of the mid deck later tonight slowing radiation. 
Will ride with the predicted lows ranging from the middle and 
upper 20s across extreme northern parts of the forecast area to 
lower 30s farther south, because radiation may be remain effective
for several more hours.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...
The rest of this afternoon into most of tonight is a break between 
systems. Shortwave ridging and weak warm air advection in the 850-
700 mb layer has led to a milder afternoon, and this will also keep 
low temps quite a bit warmer compared to last night with upper 20's 
to near 30 in southwest VA and northeast TN and mainly low 30's 
across the valley and plateau. Increasing clouds after 06Z will also 
aid in the insolation process as a cold front approaches from the 
west. This front is the result of a low pressure system passing from 
Indiana into the lower Great Lakes during the night. According to 
the latest NAM soundings, moisture depth with this front is lacking 
compared to what was shown yesterday. Expect the cold front to cross 
the region between 12 and 16Z, but due to moisture in the 09-18Z 
time frame generally confined to around 850 mb, widespread precip is 
not likely, so slight chance pops will cover this. These pops will 
be confined to the northern Plateau, northern valley, and southwest 
VA between 12 and 18Z. Moisture is deeper near TRI, so the greatest 
pops will be across extreme northeast TN and southwest VA. Any 
showers in this region will be a mix of rain and snow as 850 mb 
temps will be between -2 and -5 degrees C with surface temps 
struggling to get above the mid to upper 30's. Snowfall amounts in 
southwest VA will be a trace to a tenth at most. The precip chances 
should quickly exit the entire region after 18Z with cloud cover 
gradually beginning to thin. The central and southern valley will 
see the greatest rise in temps tomorrow afternoon with mid to upper 
40's still likely.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...
The long term period remains active with wintry precipitation and
very cold temperatures. The upper level pattern will remain 
highly amplified with a broad trough situated across the CONUS 
centered along and just south of Hudson Bay. A shortwave will dive
out of Canada late Sunday night which will drive an area of low 
pressure and associated cold front into the Plains, and Ohio 
valley. Another shortwave will traverse the Gulf Coast before 
lifting across the Eastern seaboard. Models are in decent 
agreement with the overall pattern and strength of the synoptic 
features. Monday is forecast to be dry as low-level winds begin to
back toward the southwest and 850mb temperatures begin to climb 
slowly ahead of the shortwave trough that will dig into the 
Midwest. Behind the northern shortwave, a deep upper level low 
will quickly dive south out of Canada and begin to phase this 
shortwave. Some minor differences still exist in regards to the 
depth of this eventual long wave trough. The 00z/12z ECMWF has 
come in much deeper with the jet streak just south of the Gulf 
Coast. The GFS is not as deep with the upper-level jet streak 
across central MS/AL/GA. Nonetheless, the region will be under 
deep cyclonic flow. Closer to the surface, the aforementioned 
surface low will travel through the Great Lakes Monday and 
Tuesday. A trailing cold front will approach from the west Monday 
night into Tuesday. Behind this frontal boundary, deep Arctic air 
will quickly filter in behind with increasing pressure to the 
west. 

As mentioned previously, the upper-level pattern will feature a 
strong jet streak rounding the base of the deep trough axis.  As a 
result, divergence will increase which will aid in lift across the 
region.  Deep moisture will be in place immediately along and behind 
the surface front.  Widespread precipitation will develop as a 
result of the increased divergence and deep moisture.  Model cross 
sections still show deep lift associated with the favorable dynamics 
aloft and strong positive omega values extending through the low and 
mid levels of the atmosphere.  Further, the strong omega values can 
be attributed to the strength of vorticity advection in the mid 
levels.  2-D plane and cross sections show very strong frontogenesis 
values along the Arctic front with a steeply sloped frontal zone 
extending from the surface to 500mb.  It will be a combination of 
upper level dynamics, and low-mid level frontogenesis that will lead 
to widespread and at times, heavy precipitation. Cold air will 
quickly filter in behind the front with strong CAA. 1000-500mb 
thickness values crash to as low as 520-530 dam with 850mb 
temperatures as low as -5 to -15 degree C during the time of the 
precipitation.   Precipitation will likely start out as liquid rain 
as the lower troposphere will likely remain above freezing briefly. 
However, this will not last long as rain will quickly turn to snow 
with very strong CAA in the lower levels of the atmosphere.  

Snow amounts are still difficult to pinpoint this far out with some 
model differences still apparent.  However, with the degree of 
moisture and omega values in the -12 to -18 degree C layer, 
dendritic growth will become maximized between 12 to 18Z Tuesday. 
The strength of dynamics aloft in combination with strong low-level 
frontogenesis forcing supports moderate to heavy precipitation 
falling as well.  The cold air in place will mean that SLR's will 
likely be higher than climatology (12:1 to 15:1).  The limited 
factor is the window of precipitation will be short lived.  Models 
are all in decent agreement in regards to snow amounts.  1-3 inches 
of snowfall looks likely for the majority of the area with higher 
amounts up to 4 inches in the higher terrain.  It is important to 
realize that regardless of specific amounts, impacts will be similar 
with the cold air moving in.  Icy and hazardous travel may become an 
issue across the entire area Tuesday.  

Precipitation will quickly come to an end Tuesday afternoon. 
Temperatures will continue to fall Tuesday night.  With 850mb 
temperatures in -10 to -15 degree C range, minimum temperatures will 
likely fall into the teens to single digits.  If we do end up with 
accumulating snow on the ground, then expect surface temperatures to 
be even colder then what guidance is advertising.  Wind chills could 
be below 0 Tuesday night as high pressure quickly builds to the 
west.  The higher terrain could see wind chills as low as -15 at 
times.  Global models are both suggesting additional chances of snow 
showers Wednesday along the sharp Arctic front.  How far south this 
band of snow ends up is still in question. Temperatures on Wednesday 
and Wednesday night will continue to be below average. Strong high 
pressure will meander through the Ohio valley Thursday before winds 
begin to back toward the southwest ahead of a developing low 
pressure system across the Plains.  A slight warming trend will be 
possible Friday and into the weekend.

.DISCUSSION...Added a chance of flurries to the southwest VA
counties through Noon due to a shortwave currently passing through
the region. Also increased cloud cover from this area through the
northern and central valley through the rest of the morning. The
back edge of the overcast skies is approaching the plateau
according to visible satellite loops, so I still expect clouds to
decrease early this afternoon as the upper level disturbance moves
east of the region. High temps are on track for today, so I only
tweaked the hourly temp and dew point grids through 21Z to more
closely match the observations this morning. The rest of the
forecast is on track.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Temperatures were in the 20s across the forecast area early this 
morning, with low 20s present in southwest Virginia and a few 
sheltered valleys in northeast Tennessee. Thin, but widespread 
cirrus has been streaming overhead much of the night thus far. 
This may prevent morning lows in the teens from being observed, 
but it will be close. After a chilly start, expect to see
temperatures rebound into the 40s for much of the lower elevation
areas, with upper 30s in portions of southwest Virginia.

To our west, regional radar imagery shows some light returns 
stretching from central Kentucky southward into middle Tennessee 
early this morning. Not much is showing on surface observations, 
although there has been some light snow reported around the Bowling 
Green area. This is all associated with shortwave energy that is 
moving through that region at this time. Guidance indicates this 
feature will shift east of the forecast area by shortly after 
daybreak. Would not be totally surprised to see some flurries in 
southwest Virginia this morning, but in large part forcing 
mechanisms favor any precipitation being mostly north of our CWA. As 
such, continued to advertise a dry forecast, with only an increase 
in cloud cover today as this shortwave moves overhead. 

Clouds will shift well east of the area this evening and
overnight. However do not expect temperatures to be quite as cold
as recent nights, with upper 20s to low 30s expected.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Saturday)...

The main feature through most of the extended will be a deep 
long-wave upper trough over southern Canada into the eastern 
United States. 

For Saturday night and Sunday morning, a short-wave will dive across 
the Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley. Most of the precipitation 
from this system will be north of the area as dynamics and moisture 
stays north. 

A much stronger wave will dive southeast from the northern Plains 
toward the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley. Better jet dynamics with this 
system for the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians. Also, 
this wave phases better with a southern stream wave and Gulf 
Moisture. The ECMWF and NAM models are close in agreement in timing 
and strength in pulling the brunt of the precipitation in after 12Z 
Tuesday. The GFS is faster and weaker. Will trend toward the ECMWF 
and NAM solution. 

Jet dynamics associated with the right entrance region of the jet 
will enhance the forcing over the area along a strong cold front. As 
the front moves through the area between 12-15Z, precipitation will 
increase in intensity. Vertical temperature profile shows a mixture 
of rain/snow initially, but strength of the cold air advection 
behind the front will quickly change mixture to snow. A period of 
snow between 3 and 6 hours is expected. Looking at the latest GEFS 
plumes and WPC coordination, snowfall around 2 inches will be 
common, but up to 4 inches. Given the cold air advection, do expect 
problems on area roadways for Tuesday.

An arctic cold front will move through the region Wednesday 
producing another round of light snow into Wednesday night. 
Additional light snow accumulation is possible.

For mid to late week, a cold arctic high will build into the 
southern Appalachians with very cold temperatures building into the 
region. Dangerous wind chills will be a concern. Winds chills of -15 
to -20 degrees is possible over the mountains areas with -5 to 5 
degrees possible elsewhere Tuesday night.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
Clouds thinned this afternoon as arctic high pressure nudges in from 
the west. Latest satellite shows clear skies. Decent radiational 
cooling conditions are expected tonight as winds become light due to 
the high sliding overhead. Lows in the upper teens to near 20 are 
likely from southwest VA through northeast TN and on the plateau. 
The middle and southern Valley will be slightly warmer with 
generally low to mid 20's expected. This type of pattern would 
normally lead to colder overnight lows, but a weak low pressure 
system approaching the region along with some jet energy in the base 
of the longwave trough will cause cirrus to move in from the west 
overnight. The above mentioned disturbance will pass north of the 
region Saturday. Mid level moisture will briefly increase Saturday 
morning from about 12-18Z, especially across southwest VA and the 
northern valley. Low levels remain fairly dry, so I am not 
introducing pops at this time and feel that this will only result in 
greater cloud cover through mid to late morning. Warmer 850 mb temps 
will lead to a milder day with highs reaching the low to mid 40's 
during the afternoon once the clouds clear out. Southwesterly winds 
will increase during the afternoon as well ahead of another 
disturbance which approaches tomorrow night.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
A highly amplified upper level pattern will dominate the long term
period with deep long wave troughing across most of the central 
and eastern CONUS, and ridging across the Pacific Northwest. 
Several disturbances will rotate through the cyclonic flow and 
will bring increasing chances of precipitation. The first 
disturbance moves through the region Sunday. Models are in decent 
agreement with the placement and strength of this disturbance; 
however, differences arise in regards to available moisture. While
widespread precipitation is not anticipated, slight chance to 
chance PoPs seem reasonable at this time.

High pressure develops across the northern Gulf of Mexico on 
Monday, before a deep low pressure system associated with northern 
stream energy dives south out of Canada. Monday will likely be dry 
under zonal flow aloft as low-level winds back toward the southeast. 
Models begin to diverge Monday with the strength of synoptic 
features.  The ECMWF is a much colder solution as the shortwave 
diving out of Canada is much stronger then the GFS is showing.  The 
GFS however has a deeper surface low as it traverses the Great 
Lakes.  A preferred model blend suggests as the surface low moves 
across the Great Lakes, an associated cold front will moves west to 
east and begin to move into the area Monday night into Tuesday. 
Ahead of the cold front, 850mb winds strengthen to near 50 knots. 
This could support high winds across the Smoky Mountains. Even with 
the differences in the overall strength of the system, widespread 
precipitation will accompany the frontal boundary.  This is a result 
of increasing upper level dynamics, as the area is in the left exit 
region of a 150 knot 300mb jet streak rounding the base of the 
trough with strong 500mb PVA. This indirect circulation is easily 
visualized in model cross sections with a nearly vertical 
ageostrophic circulation, and strong omega values in the low to mid 
levels of the troposphere.  In addition, there will be a narrow band 
of isentropic lift in the wake of the low-level frontal passage. 
This overrunning will enhance lift between the 850 to 700mb layer. 
The enhanced low-level lift, in concert with strong upper-level 
dynamics aloft, supports deep lift in the troposphere Tuesday. While 
the ECMWF is stronger with the shortwave, and develops cyclogenesis 
in the Mid-Atlantic, the GFS has a weaker shortwave with limited 
cyclogenesis along the surface wave. Albeit these differences, a 
model blend still supports widespread precipitation and some heavy 
precipitation, especially along and behind the FROPA. The GEFS even 
paints high probabilities of 12 hour 0.1 to 0.3 precipitation 
totals.  

While the thermal profile initially supports liquid rain, strong 
cold air advection immediately behind the front will quickly allow a 
change over to all snow.  Further, the usual 10-1 snow to liquid 
ratio will likely be increased to more like 12-1 or 15-1 given the 
depth of cold air advection.  This system is still several days 
away, and a lot can, and most likely will, change.  However, it 
seems reasonable that a couple inches of snow could fall at most 
locations with higher amounts in the higher terrain.  The region 
will be under the influence of deep troughing Wednesday and 
Thursday.  A vort lobe is progged to push into the area Wednesday 
night.  This could produce additional snow showers during this time. 
Temperatures at 850mb are forecast to drop in the -15 to -20 degree 
C range during this time.  This will translate to very cold surface 
temperatures with many locations several degrees below normal.  If 
snow does indeed fall, it is likely temperatures Wednesday and 
Thursday morning could be several degrees cooler then what models 
currently show.

Models become more uncertain with the late week as the operational 
GFS is much cooler then the ECMWF.  An additional shortwave is 
forecast by both operational models to impact the region by Friday. 
For now, will lean with the Superblend.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Fog product satellite imagery shows a fairly expansive low level 
cloud deck in place across southern Appalachia early this morning. 
Per model soundings and cloud top height products GOES-16 imagery, 
cloud tops should be around 4-5k ft. Assuming numerical guidance was 
absolutely correct, these clouds would not quite extend vertically 
into the dendritic growth zone, falling short by 500 to 1000 ft or 
so. Previous shifts included some very low PoPs for some light 
snow/flurries through mid morning, and given light radar returns 
in eastern Kentucky are beginning to expand southward, I am
inclined to keep that in the forecast for now. Would not be 
surprised at all, especially in our southwest Virginia, to see 
some light snow through shortly after daybreak. In any case, 
little to no accumulations are expected, so impacts should be 
negligible.

For the rest of the short term period, broad upper troughing will 
remain in place across much of the nation, but especially the 
eastern half of the United States. A shortwave trough over Arkansas 
will shift eastward through Tennessee and into the Carolinas by 
midday. This will help clouds clear out by the afternoon, with clear 
skies prevailing through late tonight thereafter. Highs should hold 
in the 30s for lower elevations today, but may warm into the lower 
40s in the south depending on how quick clouds dissipate. Continued 
with undercutting guidance for tonight's lows. With light winds, 
clear skies, and very dry air in place, prime radiational conditions 
should exist. Did bump overnight lows up a degree or two, but 
still think teens (north) to low 20s (south) seems very plausible.
Most guidance is about 3-5 degrees warmer across the board, 
likely banking on increased cloud cover prohibiting temps from 
falling too far. Trended that direction slightly but, as 
mentioned, continued to undercut guidance.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...

A deep long-wave upper trough over southern Canada into the Great
Lakes/Ohio Valley will be the main feature of interest through 
most of the extended. This pattern will pull periods of very cold 
airmass into the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians.

For Saturday, a dry period with near seasonal temperatures as 
southwest flow aloft pulls milder air into the region.

For Sunday and Sunday night, a short-wave will move across the area 
with boundary layer southwest flow producing a period of isentropic 
lift. This lift will produce a chance of rain, possibly mixed with 
snow. Light snow accumulations are possible over the northern 
Plateau into southwest Virginia. Snow accumulations of 1 to 2 inches 
are possible.

The main weather feature of interest will be a stronger short-wave 
moving southeast from the northern Plains into the Great Lakes/lower 
Ohio Valley late Monday through Tuesday. The northern stream wave 
will phase with a southern stream jet over the lower Mississippi 
River Valley pulling moisture northeastward into the Tennessee/Ohio 
Valleys. A strong arctic front will sweep through the region 
sometime Tuesday. The GFS is the fast and pulls the front into the 
area by 12Z, while the ECMWF is slower and more toward 18Z. Either 
way the precipitation will likely begin as rain (rain/snow higher 
terrain), but quickly transition to snow. 

Strong jet dynamics with this short-wave with deep lift for about 6 
hours. Snow accumulations are looking more likely with this system, 
even across the Tennessee Valley. Since this system is several days 
away, snowfall forecast will likely change, but currently 2 to 4 
inches is possible most locations with higher amounts across the 
higher terrain. Additional light snowfall is possible Tuesday night.

For mid to late week, a cold arctic high will build into the 
southern Appalachians with very cold temperatures building into the 
region. Dangerous wind chills will be a concern.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
A surge of cold air behind an upper jet and trough will be making 
its way into our area tonight. Clouds that have been over the area 
for most of today are gradually eroding from SW to NE, but satellite 
shows more clodu cover upstream across IL/MO. This moisture is 
fairly shallow but with the very cold air mass, there will be some 
moisture in the dendrite growth zone for some snow showers or 
flurries across northern sections late tonight, mainly in the 06-12Z 
time frame. With very weak forcing, any accumulations should be less 
than a half inch, even in the mountains. Flurries may linger in the 
northern sections into Friday morning due to steep low level lapse 
rates. Clouds will clear through the late morning and early 
afternoon, but cold advection will hold high temps into the 30s in 
most spots. Wind chill values tonight will be in the single digits 
in the mountains, with perhaps a few spots briefly going below
zero.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
As we head into the weekend...there will be a couple of short 
waves riding along the upper flow. The first one should track to 
our north Friday night into Saturday. Any associated precip should
stay to our north with the main impact being an increase in 
clouds across at least northern areas of the MRX CWA. The second 
short wave will be a bit stronger and should dip a little further 
south as it move through the area Sunday into Sunday evening. A 
mix of rain and snow could reach into northern locations Saturday 
night. As the system moves in on Sunday...precip should transition
to rain with the exception of a mix of precip over the highest 
elevations. Coverage will be higher over northern locations but a 
few isolated showers could spread into southern locations. We will
be between systems on Monday. The main system of concern through 
the extended will be a strong cold front expected to move in 
around the late Monday night/Tuesday time frame. Accompanying the 
front will be a wide band of showers. The temperature profile with
the initial round should generate mainly rain. However...the 
strong cold advection along and directly behind the front will 
allow for rain to change to snow. Timing of the transition remains
difficult but should see precip change to mostly all snow late 
Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday evening. The snow will linger 
through Tuesday night with weak wrap around precip 
possible...mainly north and across higher terrain...on Wednesday. 
The system should pull out for a return to dry conditions by 
Thursday.

The bulk of precip has exited our area, with only a few sprinkles
or flurries expected over the next few hours over the eastern half
of the area. Low level moisture will remain trapped in the Valley
below a 850 mb inversion that will keep cloudy skies in place
through most of the day for most areas. Some partial clearing may
develop in southern sections this afternoon. Temperatures will
need to be adjusted downward, expecially in northern sections
where a 850 mb thermal trough will be located this afternoon.
Temps in that area will likely not deviate much from their current
values.

Currently, the back edge of the rain band has already moved east of 
CHA and will move through TYS soon after 12Z.  For TRI, the main 
rain band will move east of the terminal around 15Z, but there is a 
chance of rain or snow showers through early afternoon.

Drier air will filter into the Tennessee Valley with CHA clearing 
around 16Z and TYS around 20Z. TRI will likely maintain a ceiling 
through the day but lift to 3500 feet this afternoon.

Another weak system will move through overnight, but limited 
moisture will keep forecast dry. Flight conditions will be VFR 
overnight.

Winds have already gone west to northwest after the frontal passage 
at CHA and TYS.  Winds will becomie westerly at TRI later this 
morning. Gusty winds up to 20kts are possible today.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Early this morning, a cold
front was moving across the eastern sections of the Tennessee
Valley into the far mountains areas. Cold air is finally beginning
to move into the Plateau and western sections of the valley and
this eastward push will continue. The western end of the rain
shield is moving through the Plateau and will exit the area,
except for the mountains, by late morning. A brief transition to
light snow or flurries is still expected over the northern Plateau
into the western sections of southwest Virginia. Also, across the
far east Tennessee Mountains. Snow accumulations to 1/2 inch to
possibly one inch, mainly across the higher elevations, such as
High Knob and Smoky Mountains. Decreasing clouds today.

For tonight, a weak system will move through the area with limited
moisture. Light snow showers and flurries are possible, mainly for
southwest Virginia and northeast Tennessee Mountains.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...

A mild start for the long term outlook with seasonal temperatures
and calm weather for the start of the weekend. A weak low pressure
system to the north has a chance to bring in some rain on Sunday
for the more northern counties in the forecast area. Calm weather
and warm temperatures can be expected for Monday as a warmer
airmass moves over us out in front of another strong cold front.

Another active weather event on Tuesday resulting from the well
defined cold front. While we can expect to receive mostly rain for
the majority of the day, colder temperatures move in behind the
front. Any ongoing showers into Tuesday night will transition over 
to snow. We'll have a better idea of what we can expect out of this 
system as we get closer to it's arrival, but currently with it still 
being several days out, it makes it difficult to call how much we 
could see from it.

The approaching front will also produce a long period of high
winds, especially for the mountains, plateau and foothills due to
downsloping. While it is far in the forecast, current guidance 
shows some areas with sustained winds of 18 to 20 mph with
expected gusts up to 35 to 40 mph. While the rain and wind will
clear out by Wednesday, the cold airmass will remain in place,
leading to the mid week temperatures remaining below freezing

.DISCUSSION...Forecast on track for the most part with some minor
adjustments. Tweaked hourly POPs to match up with past few runs 
of HRRR and radar trends as well as tweaks to temps and 
dewpoints. Biggest change was to extend high wind warning until 3
AM EST across the higher elevations of the eastern mountains. 
This is due to the frontal passage being a little slower than 
previously forecast. The highest winds should be over with but the
warning area could still see some gusts up to 60 mph over the next
several hours. Nudged previous snowfall forecast downward
slightly due to slower frontal passage. The overlap between 
available moisture and favorable temp profiles aloft aren't that 
long, maybe a few hours. Last thing, we did issue a flood warning
for the Sequatchie River as the river obs were coming in higher
than forecast. The new data we recently received from the RFC 
took it into action stage, thus a FLW was issued. Everything else 
on track, new zones out soon.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
A strong southerly flow across the Southern Appalachians will 
continue to produce high winds in the East TN mountains through the 
evening. Gusts as high as 85 mph at Camp Creek have been measured 
with reports of downed trees around the area. Most obs over the past 
hour have been showing gusts in the upper 30s to lower 40s, and that 
is expected to continue through the evening. One change to the NPW 
will be to extend the Wind Advisory for the eastern half of the area 
until 10 pm. After that time, the models show the strongest winds of 
the LLJ moving to our east. 

Rainfall this evening and tonight will be moderate to locally 
heavy, but widespread flooding issues are not expected, with total
QPF amounts between 1-2 inches. The cold front is expected to 
reach our western border around midnight, and exit to the east 
around 12Z. Cold advection behind it will overlap with adequte 
moisture in the dendritic growth zone, giving a small window for 
snow. But it will be brief as midlevel moisture drops off quickly 
between 09-15Z. Even in the mountains and SW VA, less than one 
inch is expected with perhaps a dusting in the Plateau and no 
accumulation in the Valley. Thursday afternoon will have 
decreasing clouds and cold advection with a NW wind keeping highs
only in the 30s to lower 40s.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
As a cold front continues to pull away from the Southern 
Appalachian Region Thursday evening...the area will be between 
systems for cool and dry conditions. However...this will be short 
lived as a weak secondary boundary will push through late Thursday
night into Friday morning. This feature will generate a few 
isolated light snow showers over far northern and eastern 
locations and will usher in another surge of cooler air. Then...a 
couple of weak waves will ride through the upper flow during the 
weekend. The main track should keep these waves mainly to our 
north with only the tail end swing south and potentially into the 
MRX CWA. As a result...isolated to scattered showers may 
occasional move through the area mainly around Sunday...with the 
best chance across northern locations. Temperatures will moderate 
a bit during the weekend and therefore...expect any daytime 
showers to generally fall as rain and overnight showers may be a 
rain/snow mix. The main system of concern through the extended 
will be a cold front expected to move in Monday night into 
Tuesday. This system will bring a band of rain and snow to the 
area. Drier and cooler conditions are expected on Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Thursday)...
An active short-term with a strong upper jet over the Great Lakes
into the Ohio/mid-Mississippi Valley. This jet will produce broad
divergence aloft over the Tennessee Valley today into tonight. The
direct circulation around this jet will enhance the fronto-genetic
forcing along a cold front that moves across late today and
overnight. The strong upper jet/forcing has induced a very strong
low-level jet with 850mb winds of 70-75kts over the Tennessee/Ohio
Valleys. The strong boundary layer jet even reaches down to the
925mb level.

This low-level jet will produce a mountain wave high wind event
for the Mountains and Foothills. Winds at Camp Creek are already
gusting near 50 mph early this morning. Since the strong winds
reach down to the 925mb level decided to include the rest of the
area, even the Valley, under a wind advisory. Gusts of 30-40 mph
are possible, especially for the ridge tops.

The downslope southerly winds into the northern and central Valley
will help hold off the rain across much of the eastern areas, but
isentropic lift is already producing showers over the Plateau.

The brunt of the upper jet forcing will move across the area from
late today through early Thursday morning. Widespread rain can be
expected with periods of moderate to heavy rain. Rainfall amounts
of 1 to 1 1/2 inches will be common with localized areas receiving
2-2 1/2 inches. Similar to the last rain event, localized runoff
issues are possible given the saturated ground. Plenty of ponding
of water across low lying areas are likely.

As the cold front moves through overnight the vertical tempeature
profile will turn cold enough to change the rain to snow. The
mountains of southwest Virginia, far east Tennessee, and the
Plateau will likely see light accumulations of 1/2 to 2 inches
over the Smokies and High Knob.

Will include these impacts within the HWO and SPS.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday Night through Tuesday)... 
A less active outlook for the upcoming weekend and following 
week, with only a few notable weather events. As the front moves 
out of the forecast area on Friday, expected temperatures to be 
colder with a chance of seeing a few snow showers. A few counties 
in southwestern Virginia and higher elevations in the Smokey's 
could see a modest amount of accumulation up to around a quarter 
inch or so. Winds along the base of the mountains and foothills of
eastern Tennessee will also gradually decrease moving into the 
weekend.

Temperatures will steadily rise over the weekend following the 
normal diurnal curve with a few snow showers possible on Sunday 
morning. Expect any showers in the valley to transition from snow to 
rain as the temperature climbs during the day on Sunday. Monday 
looks to be fairly pleasant with highs reaching the high 40's to low 
50's for much of the forecast area.

The last event of note will be another low pressure system on 
Tuesday of next week. While the GFS and Euro aren't in particularly 
great agreement on the time of it's arrival or duration at present, 
this system has the potential to produce a fair amount of precip. 
This one looks to be very similar to the one of the previous week, 
so expect rain showers for most of the day Tuesday, with the 
possibility of transitioning to snow later on as the system moves 
through and the cold air behind it sets in.

.AVIATION...Several concerns this forecast period. Strong low level 
jet which will result in LLWS in at all sites as a strong jet is in 
place down to 2000 feet. Eventually strong and gusty winds are 
expected at all TAF sites this afternoon and early evening ahead of 
rain shield. Gusts up to 30kts possible, especially at TYS.

As the rain shield approaches this evening ceilings will drop to 
MVFR conditions, possibly to high end IFR. The main rain band will 
move into CHA by 22-00Z this evening, TYS 00-02Z, and TRI 02-04Z. 
Frontal boundary will accompany the rain shield with winds becoming

.DISCUSSION...Some changes to the forecast this evening. Biggest
changes were to slow the onset of precip overnight and raise 
overnight lows. Slowing of precip based on past few HRRR runs and 
latest radar data. Biggest changes to overnight lows was up 
across northeast TN and southwest VA. Raised lows by 3 to 4 
degrees. Clouds moved in sooner than anticipated and minor 
downsloping is also occurring as noted by past few hours of
southeasterly wind direction at Elkmont, Camp Creek, and TRI. 
Otherwise, previous forecast still on track with moisture 
continuing to increase through the night as southerly flow 
strengthens. Already seeing some wind gusts up into the upper 20s
and lower 30s at Signal Mountain, Roan Mountain, Norton, and
Nolichucky.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...Moisture will increase 
across the area tonight into Wednesday as a cold front and upper 
trough approach from the west.  A southerly low level jet will 
increase, and while thermal profiles do not look ideal for mountain 
waves, it still appears that mountain wave enhancement of the winds 
will be a threat in the usual locations and given the strength of 
the low level jet, will issue a high wind warning for the mountains 
and foothills that were previously included in the watch.  Expect 
downsloping to hinder the advancement of the rain in the northern 
and central valley locations, so will show a fairly tight gradient 
of PoPs late in the day depicting this. While some spots are 
expected to dip below freezing early tonight, temperatures will 
likely rise later tonight in most areas as clouds increase and the 
warm advection increases, so at this point it looks like any light 
precipitation that makes it into mainly southern/western areas and 
possibly the far eastern mountains areas should be all rain.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday Night through Tuesday)...The extended 
will begin in an active pattern as a cold front continues it's 
push across the Southern Appalachian Region. This will have 
categorical POPs in place Wednesday evening with the chance of 
precip slowly decreasing through the night and ending from west to
east on Thursday. Another round of cold air will filter in behind
the system and rain will transition to snow at many locations 
Wednesday night and Thursday. Little to no snow accumulation is 
expected over most lower elevations of the TN Valley. 
However...higher terrain of the Cumberland Plateau...Southwest VA 
and especially over the East TN mountains...some minor snow 
accumulations are possible. The highest elevations could see 
around an inch. Additionally...a strong 850MB jet will accompany 
the front and higher elevations of the East TN will have a High 
Wind Warning in effect through 03Z Thursday. The area will see a 
brief break late Thursday/Thursday evening for dry and seasonally 
cool conditions. A secondary frontal boundary will slide through 
the region late Thursday night into Friday morning, This will push
through a band of isolated to scattered light snow ...mainly over
northern areas. Little to no accumulation is expected with this 
feature. A couple of weak short waves will ride through the upper 
flow Friday night through the weekend. The main track should keep 
these moving through to our north and at best may generate a few 
isolated to scattered rain or snow showers. Again no accumulations
are expected. The next main weather system of concern will be a 
cold front progged to move through around the Monday night 
/Tuesday time frame and bring a mix of rain and snow into the 
area.

Besides a chance of showers at CHA toward daybreak Wednesday, VFR 
conditions can be expected at all TAF sites through the period. 
Upper ridge will remain across the southern Appalachians today 
keeping conditions dry, but allowing plenty of cirrus/cirrus-stratus 
to move into the area. Surface ridge will will located east of the 
Appalachians allowing the boundary layer jet to become southerly. 
Southerly winds of 30-40kts is expected in the afternoon pulling 
warmer air back into the Tennessee Valley.

The southerly winds will also increase the isentropic lift over the 
area with scattered showers developing near CHA after 06Z. The 
developing low-level jet will produce gusty winds up to 20kts at TYS 
and CHA this afternoon. LLWS is possible across the TAF sites 
overnight, especially toward daybreak Wednesday, as the low-level 
jet intensifies.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Upper ridge will remain across the southern Appalachians today 
keeping conditions dry, but allowing plenty of cirrus/cirrus-
stratus to move into the area. Surface ridge will will located 
east of the Appalachians allowing the boundary layer jet to become
southerly. Southerly winds of 30-40kts is expected in the 
afternoon pulling warmer air back into the Tennessee Valley.

For this evening into tonight, southerly jet will continue to 
increase to 50 to 60kts with another mountain wave high wind event 
developing this evening through Wednesday. We have issued a high 
wind watch for the Mountains and Adjacent Foothills with gusts up to 
65-70 kts possible in the favored areas. 

The southerly winds will also increase the isentropic lift over the 
area with showers moving into southeast Tennessee and southwest 
North Carolina overnight. Downslope winds will help keep the shield 
of rain from moving into the northern and central valley until 
Wednesday.

Lows tonight will likely occur by midnight since increasing clouds 
and advection of warmer 850mb temperatures allowing temperatures to 
warm toward daybreak.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...

Starting off the long term forecast with a frontal system on
Wednesday. Temperatures during Wednesday will be warm enough that
we will initially only see rain from this weather system. Rainfall
could reach up to 2 total inches with a possibility of localized
flooding. As we get into Wednesday night, the temperature will 
drop low enough for areas of moderate to higher elevation, such as
the plateau and the Smokey's, to start seeing snow. Some minor 
accumulation is possible for these areas of under an inch.

Winds will also be a concern during this weather system. Some
downsloping winds along the mountains and foothills could see 
sustained wind speeds of 40 mph with even higher gusts. The winds 
are expected to calm by Thursday morning as the front moves out of
the forecast area.

Wednesday also looks to have unseasonably high temperatures due 
to the warm front out ahead of the frontal boundary, but it will 
be back to colder weather by the end of the week. The passing cold
front brings in another very cold airmass that will be relatively
short lived as we return to more seasonal temperatures by the 
weekend. Another weather system is expected around midway through 
the weekend, although models are currently not in great agreement 
with it's arrival time.

.DISCUSSION...Not many changes for tonight with another cold mid 
winter night expected, although slightly warmer than last night. 
Low temps will generally be 10-15 from southwest VA through 
extreme northeast TN, upper teens in the middle Valley and 
Plateau, and around 20 in the southern Valley. I inputed the 
observations for the past couple of hours in order to better 
capture hourly temp and dew point trends through about 08Z. Also 
slightly increased cloud cover through 08Z due to cirrus that 
continues to stream into the area. Looking at IR satellite 
upstream, this high cirrus extends back into Arkansas, so I 
believe it will take a few extra hours to move out. The rest of
the forecast period is on track.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...Surface high pressure 
centered to our north will continue to extend into our area as it 
drifts east. It will be another cold night tonight with some high 
clouds drifting across the area especially north.  Tuesday will 
start be precip free, but moisture will start to increase ahead of 
the next system, bringing increasing clouds in the afternoon 
especially south and west.  Temperatures Tuesday afternoon will be 
close to normal for this time of year.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...Tuesday evening
starts out dry as surface high pressure over the Mid Atlantic 
area begins to shift east and deep trough over the Rockies moves 
into the South central states. Once again strong south to 
southwest flow will develop Tuesday night and Wednesday ahead of 
the system which has surface low over the Mid Mississippi Valley 
Tuesday evening then moves up to the Great Lakes early Wednesday 
with front moving across the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys Wednesday.
The strong southerly flow aloft should cause winds to gust to 
over 40 miles per hour in the higher elevations...possibly up to 
60 miles per hour in the preferred high wind areas late Tuesday 
evening through Wednesday. Will need to watch if winds increase 
more for possible High Wind Warning may be needed late Tuesday 
night to Wednesday afternoon. Models also show heavy rainfall will
also accompany the front late Wednesday afternoon and night. 
Rainfall amounts of around 2 inches could fall in Southeast 
Tennessee and southwest North Carolina. Behind the front cold air 
will bring a quick temperature drop with snow developing late 
Wednesday night into Thursday morning before the moisture moves 
out. A couple inches of snow may accumulate by late Thursday in 
the higher elevations of east Tennessee and southwest Virginia. 
Thursday temperatures will be colder...mostly 30s and a few 
degrees colder Friday. A weak impulse will move through Thursday 
night and early Friday and another weak system Saturday into 
Sunday which will bring some more chances for snow or cold rain. 
Not expecting much accumulation with these later systems but the 
eastern states will stay in a long wave trough with temperatures 
staying below normal. Highs will be in the 30s to lower 40s and 
lows mostly 20s.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

The coldest airmass of the season is in place with temperatures 
early this morning in the single digits to low 20s. Low temperatures 
around sunrise will range from the single digits and teens. 
Northerly winds remain elevated across the southern Appalchians with 
the surface low currently located off the New England Coast and the 
surface high across the western Great Lakes. Due to this, wind chill 
values are already below zero across the higher elevations with 
single digit wind chills across a good portion of the valley. A wind 
chill advisory continues for the higher elevations of east
Tennessee, southwest Virginia and southwest North Carolina through
10 AM. Regardless, wind chills will be brutally cold this morning
across the entire area.

Upper level heights will rise today as a ridge builds in from the 
west. At the low levels, the ridge axis will move overhead with the 
bulk of the cold air advection shifting further to the east. Another 
cold day is forecast but temperatures will be a bit warmer than 
yesterday with mostly sunny skies, temperatures will warm into the 
mid 20s to mid 30s for most locations. Winds will decrease 
throughout the day as the pressure gradient relaxes with the surface 
high pressure move into the region.

The upper level ridge axis will move over the forecast area tonight. 
The low level ridge axis will shift to the east of the area 
overnight with low level southerly to southeasterly flow returning 
bringing back in warm air and moisture advection to the area. 
Overnight lows will be warmer than the last couple of nights ranging 
from the teens to mid 20s. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Monday)...

The longterm period will be active with several chances of 
precipitation and below normal temperatures expected much of the 
period.  Model guidance is above average through Thursday before 
much uncertainty exists.  Tuesday will be dry with near normal 
temperatures. This is the result of surface high pressure across the 
Mid-atlantic and surface low pressure developing across the Central 
Plains.  As a result of lower pressure to the west, winds will begin 
to back to the south. An increase in cloud cover can be expected 
Tuesday afternoon and night in weak isentropic ascent.  As the 
surface low ejects northeast into the Great Lakes, cyclogenesis is 
expected across the Midsouth along the low-level boundary Wednesday 
morning. The increase in upper-level dynamics associated with a 140 
knot upper-level jet, and increased low-level convergence, will 
allow the precipitation field to expand.  Precipitation is expected 
to move into the region Wednesday morning ahead of the front.  The 
increase in upper level support further supports locally heavy 
rainfall through Wednesday night. A low-level jet develops Wednesday 
with 50-60 knot southerly flow. This would support strong winds 
across the mountains and wind advisories or a high wind watch may be 
needed in future forecast packages for those areas.  

Surface high pressure builds into the area on Thursday with colder 
air moving in.  Precipitation on the back side of the system could 
turn to a rain-snow mix or all snow.  As is usual with these types 
of systems, the moisture looks to move out quicker then the colder 
air.  As a result, not expecting much if any accumulations. 
Confidence is low Thursday night and into the weekend.  It is clear, 
however, that a much colder airmass will settle into the area under 
a deep trough.  Some disturbances could rotate through this cyclonic 
flow and produce precipitation.  For now, kept PoPs at slight chance 
to chance.

.DISCUSSION...Low temperatures are on track for tonight with
generally 10-15 expected from southwest VA through the middle
valley and 15-20 in the southern valley. I slightly adjusted the
hourly temperatures and dew points through 05Z based on recent 
observations. A weak short wave is rapidly diving southeastward
toward the Plateau with an increase in mid to high level
cloudiness, so I increased cloud cover through 06Z before letting
clouds thin out again. This disturbance could produce a few snow
flurries, but nothing of significance is expected, so did not
introduce any pops for the overnight. The rest of the forecast is
on track.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...Very cold air will continue 
to push in tonight. Some weakening and moisture starved mid level 
short wave energy will brush us with some high/mid clouds early 
tonight, but other than that brief interruption the overall 
clearing trend will continue, and Monday should feature plenty of 
sunshine although it will still be quite cold. Have not been 
seeing evidence of wind gusts to advisory criteria over the past 
few hours, and with winds gradually diminishing will cancel the 
wind advisory early. Wind chill advisory still looks to be needed 
for tonight/early Monday as wind chill values will be quite low 
over the higher elevations from the Smokies north.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...Arctic high pressure
will be hanging on one more night Monday night with temperatures
warmer in the west and southwest than tonight. Expect mostly 
clear skies and lows still in the teens to lower 20s. Southeast 
winds starting Monday evening will keep temperatures warmer. 
Tuesday will start out mostly clear with southerly winds and 
warmer temperatures in the 40s. Moisture begins to increase 
Tuesday afternoon and night with temperatures warmer by morning. 
Rain will spread into western sections by morning then slowly 
spread northeast early Wednesday as deepening surface low moves 
from the plains toward the Great Lakes. Winds will increase with a
wind advisory possible for the higher elevations and the 
foothills with southeast wind flow. Rainfall will increase late 
Wednesday and Wednesday night just ahead of the cold front and may
cause localized flooding. Behind the front temperatures will fall
quickly with some snow late Wednesday night and Thursday. A 
secondary cold front Thursday night will bring in much colder air 
once again Friday through the weekend. On Sunday a surface low 
tracking southeast in the Northwest Flow will bring another chance
of snow and reinforce the cold air over the region.

301 AM EST Sun Jan 20 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

The cold front is now to the east of the forecast area with strong 
cold air advection pushing into the southern Appalachians. Current 
radar imagery indicates a band of snow across Middle TN moving into 
the Cumberland Plateau. The temperature at Crossville is already 
below freezing with light snow being reported. Temperatures will 
continue to plummet overnight. Radar trends indicate that this band 
of snow is eroding some and models indicate this as well. With 
northwesterly winds, there will be some downsloping as the 
precipitation moves off the plateau into the valley. Then 
reintensify as it moves into western portions of the valley into the 
east Tennessee and southwest Virginia mountains. Models suggest a 
rather classic northwest flow snow event setting up for this morning 
and into the early afternoon. Forecast soundings show rather shallow 
moisture but the moisture does extend up to around -10 degrees 
Celsius on the lower end of the dendritic growth zone and expect 
precipitation will be all snow as the cold air advection moves into 
the area later this morning. The low-level lift begins to weaken 
early this afternoon and snow will come to an end across the higher 
elevations. For now, expect amounts of around 1-4 inches across the 
higher elevations of east Tennessee and southwest Virgina, around 
0.5-1 inch across the northern Cumberland Plateau and lower 
elevations of southwest virginia, and a dusting to around half an 
inch across the central and northern Tennessee Valley. The ongoing 
winter weather products look to be in good shape and have kept those 
the same.

Strong northwesterly surface winds are forecast today ushering in 
the pattern change. These winds will be strong enough for a wind advisory 
across the higher elevations with gusts into the 35-45 mph range 
today. For the lower elevations, expect gusts in the 25-35 mph 
range. High temperatures will remain below freezing in the upper 
20s to low 30s for most valley locations. The combination of winds
and temperatures will lead to wind chills in the mid teens to low
20s for most valley locations with wind chills of -5 to 5 in the 
higher elevations. 

Winds will remain elevated during the overnight hours with continued 
cold advection. Wind chill values in the higher elevations of the 
east Tennessee and southwest Virginia Mountains will drop to as low 
as -10 and a wind chill advisory has been issued. Wind chill 
readings in the valley will drop down into the single digits to low 
teens for most locations. Low temperatures will range from the 
single digits in the higher elevations to mid teens to low 20s for 
most of the valley.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Sunday)...

A cool weather pattern will start the long term period off as 
surface high pressure settles across the Ohio Valley. In the upper
levels, deep troughing is forecast to exist across New England 
with low amplitude ridging across the Plains. Troughing will also 
exist across the Western CONUS. The surface high pressure and low 
850mb temperatures will keep daytime highs on Monday below 
average. Further, good radiational conditions will produce another
night of cold temperatures for Monday night. Early Tuesday, the 
ridge will build across the Eastern CONUS as troughing moves 
across the Rockies. Lee cyclogenesis will produce a surface low 
across the Central Plains. As a result, low-level winds will begin
to back toward the Southwest. This backing wind, and upper level 
pressure falls, will allow for an increase in moisture and cloud 
cover Tuesday afternoon. 
 
Models are in fairly good agreement with the midweek system.  At 00z 
Wednesday, the surface low is progged to be located across northern 
Missouri with a trailing cold front across the Midsouth and 
Arklatex.  Upper level forcing along this boundary will produce 
numerous showers.  The front will begin to move into the forecast 
area as early as Wednesday morning.  A south to southwest low-level 
flow trajectory will likely produce downsloping across the Smoky 
Mountains which will delay precipitation across northeast Tennessee, 
and southwest Virginia.  Speaking of the low-level winds, models 
project 850mb flow in excess of 45-50 knots on Wednesday with gusty 
winds in the Smokys likely. Models have been consistent in showing 
cyclogenesis along the low-level boundary as it moves through the 
area.  This could produce enhanced convergence along the boundary. 
The enhanced convergence in combination with upper level forcing 
from a 130-150 knot 300mb jet will produce an environment conducive 
for deep lift. Model soundings suggest a moist adiabatic profile 
with precipitable water values greater than 1 inch.  Periods of 
heavy rainfall are possible, especially Wednesday night.  

Cold air will filter into the region behind the front which could 
create a rain/snow mix for areas along the Plateau, and higher 
elevations.   Carried slight chance to chance PoPs Thursday across 
the higher terrain, and in southwest Virginia where upslope snow 
showers are possible.  The region will get a break as surface high 
pressure builds in behind the front.  For the latter portions of the 
period, confidence becomes low as models have shown low run-to-run 
consistencies. However, global models have been showing a few 
disturbances that could impact the area this coming weekend. Given 
the deep cyclonic flow in place, it seems reasonable that systems 
could travel in this flow and impact the area.  Timing of individual 
disturbances this far out is difficult but temperatures will be low 
enough for low end PoPs of snow.

.DISCUSSION...Not too many changes to tonight's forecast. The
heavy rainfall is now shifting out of the area, so only scattered
showers are expected the rest of the night gradually changing to
snow showers after 06Z. Little to no accumulation is anticipated
across most of the valley, but could see 1-2 inches across extreme
northeast TN and southwest VA and 1-3 inches in the far east TN
mountains by morning. Temperature trends are on track. A 20 
degree drop is expected from west to east beginning around 06Z as 
the powerful cold front crosses the region and cold air advection
begins. Temperatures will be in the 20's and 30's by 12Z with
brisk northwesterly winds of 15-25 mph gusting up to 30 mph.
Slightly adjusted hourly temperatures through 06Z with a weight
toward the 00Z NAM and covered most of the region with chance pops
through the night.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...A strong cold front will sweep 
through tonight.  Widespread rain is occurring ahead of this system, 
and there may be a few rumbles of thunder late this afternoon/this 
evening mainly south. Mountain wave enhanced winds have been 
occurring in the usual locations, but these should subside this 
evening.  Will leave wind advisories/high wind warnings as they are 
for now. Much colder air will be pushing in later tonight on gusty 
west and northwest winds.  Lingering rain showers will change to 
snow showers/flurries and there will be a period late tonight/early 
Sunday when upslope flow will combine with enough moisture for some 
accumulating snow mainly across the higher elevations of Southwest 
VA and the E TN mountains.  Will issue a winter weather advisory for 
a few inches of snow in these areas.  Elsewhere accumulations are 
expected to be nothing or less than an inch. Moisture will become 
very shallow quickly late Sunday morning/Sunday afternoon, and some 
clearing is expected.   Temperatures will be nearly steady or slowly 
falling on Sunday, so high temperatures will be around daybreak in 
many areas.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...Building surface
high pressure from the Northwest will bring in very cold air 
Sunday night and early Monday. Some light snow flurries could 
continue in the higher elevations of Southwest Virginia and 
northeast Tennessee during the evening. The Arctic high pressure 
will drop lows into the teens lower elevations and single digits 
higher elevations of Virginia and eastern Tennessee with highest 
elevations below zero. Monday with full sunshine temperatures will
only warm to the 30s to near 40 but in the 20s higher elevations.
As upper level ridging sets up ahead of next trough developing 
across the midsection of the country Tuesday. Temperatures will be
several degrees warmer Monday night and then rebound to near 
normal 40s Tuesday. As deepening trough develops over the plains 
states Tuesday moisture spreads back into the Tennessee Valley 
Tuesday night and Wednesday. Slowed spread of rain back into 
region slightly Tuesday night into Wednesday. A little snow 
possible as precipitation starts in the northeast part of the area
before temperatures warm Wednesday morning. Wednesday night heavy
rain possible ahead of slow moving front. In the colder air 
behind the system some snow possible before precipitation moves 
out Thursday night and early Friday. This will likely be in the 
higher elevations. Friday there will be a break in the 
precipitation before another fast moving front moves through 
Saturday. Another slight chance to chance of rain or snow with 
this system and colder temperatures continuing.

.DISCUSSION...Current forecast for the remainder of today generally
looks to be on track. Have already been seeing some wind gusts to
around high wind warning levels at Camp Creek in Greene County,
and no changes planned for current advisories/warnings. Heavy rain
with localized flooding still a concern, but at this point does
not look widespread enough to warrant a flood watch. Will mainly
just make a few tweaks to temps and dew points in the database

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Sunday)...

A very complicated short-term forecast period with heavy rainfall 
today with the possibility of localized flooding. Strong winds will 
develop across the area ahead of the system today with a high wind 
warning for the mountains. A few thunderstorms will also be possible 
this afternoon with the possibility of a stronger storm or two with 
gusty winds. Then as a cold air rushes in, snow will be possible 
late tonight into Sunday morning with accumulations of 1-3 inches 
across the higher elevations of the east Tennessee and southwest 
Virginia mountains that summarize the short-term forecast period 
for further details see the paragraphs below. 

Upper level trough is currently moving out of the southern Plains 
into the Lower Mississippi River Valley. At the surface, a low is 
currently located along the OK/AR line with a warm front extending 
to the west across MS/AL/GA. Current radar imagery, indicates 
widespread showers with a few embedded thunderstorms ahead of the 
main system in association with the strong warm advection across W 
TN, N MS, and N AL. This activity is forecast to move into 
southwestern portions of the forecast area just before sunrise. Low-
level southerly winds ahead of the approaching system will create a 
mountain wave event with gusts in the high terrain and foothills up 
to 60-70 mph at time today. The wind direction will lead to 
downsloping across portions of NE TN and SW VA and will delay the 
onset of precipitation until later this afternoon for these 
locations. Moisture advection will be impressive with PW values 
soaring into the 0.9-1.2 inch range later today. These values are 
around the 90th- to maximum values observed for mid to late January. 
Storm total rainfall amounts will range from 1-2 inches with some 
locally higher amounts. These values are a bit below the 3 hour 
Flash Flood Guidance values and have held off on a Flood Watch for 
now. Although, do expect some areas of localized flooding. 

The strong low-level temperature and moisture advection will push 
the warm front northward today bringing southern portions of the 
forecast area into warm sector. Model soundings indicate some weak 
instability in these areas with surface dewpoints climbing into the 
mid to upper 50s. Storms that do form in the warm sector could 
dynamically bring down strong winds just above the surface leading to 
locally damaging wind gusts. Although. confidence is rather low with 
this scenario due to the limited instability with the overly 
saturated atmosphere. 

Much colder air will advect in behind the front tonight. Model 
soundings indicate that the upper and mid levels will dry out as the 
main upper level trough lifts out to the northeast. A textbook 
northwesterly flow will setup behind the departing system. 
Saturations will reach up to around -8 to -10 degree Celsius on the 
lower end of the dendritic growth zone and expect the main 
precipitation type will be snow. The best lift, moisture, and cold 
air will be around the 09-15z timeframe on Sunday. Snowfall amounts 
of 1-3 inches will be possible across the higher elevations of the 
east Tennesse and southwest Virginia Mountains with 0.5-1 inch 
across the northern Cumberland Plateau and lower elevations of 
southwest Virginia, and a dusting possible across the central and 
northern Tennessee Valley. In addition to the snow, strong 
northwesterly winds will reduce wind chills below zero across the 
higher elevations and a wind chill advisory may be needed in later 
forecast issuances for the east Tennessee Mountains. In the majority 
of the valley, winds chills will be in the teens. Highs on Sunday 
will be bitterly cold with most locations remaining below freezing 
all day with highs in the mid 20s to low 30s.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday Night through Saturday)...

The longterm period starts off with building surface high 
pressure moving out of the northwest with strong troughing across 
the eastern CONUS. With northwest flow aloft, some light snow 
flurries still remain possible across the higher terrain Sunday 
night into Monday morning. Temperatures Sunday night will likely 
be very cold. With strong arctic high pressure in place, 850mb 
temperatures are progged to drop to around -10 to -20 degrees C. 
This will likely send surface temperatures into the single digits 
to teens across the majority of the area. 

For the beginning of the week, the area will be between systems with 
the next system across the Intermountain west by 00Z Tuesday. Upper 
level ridging will develop across the midsection of the country 
bringing drier and clearer weather to the area. Temperatures Monday 
and Monday night will likely be below average. Winds begin to back 
toward the Southwest Tuesday ahead of a deep positively tilted mid 
to upper level trough that will advect a warmer and wetter airmass. 
Lee cyclogenesis will develop a surface low late Monday night and by 
Tuesday night this low will be located in the Great Lakes.  A cold 
front associated with this surface low will traverse the Midsouth 
Tuesday night before slowing as it approaches the MRX area.  Upper 
level divergence across the Southeast will aid in weak cyclogenesis 
along the boundary Wednesday. Increasing chances of rainfall look 
likely by Tuesday night into Wednesday. Some of the rainfall could 
become heavy as surface convergence increases along the front, and 
with PWAT values in excess of 1.0 inches.  

Models begin to diverge with the exiting system Wednesday night and 
Thursday.  As of the latest 00Z suite of guidance, the GFS places a 
surface low across the Delmarva region by 12z Thursday, while the 
ECMWF has its surface low across the Carolinas.  The 00z GFS is far 
removed from the GFS ensemble mean.  Further, the ECMWF has shown 
low run-to-run consistency.  Given these trends, have used a model 
blend for timing of precipitation ending. It is likely some residual 
moisture will be left over behind the system as the cold air 
arrives.  How much is left is still uncertain. Expect a change over 
from rain to a rain-snow mix with low impacts at this time. Needless 
to say, this is a low confidence forecast with many details yet to 
figure out.  

The region will be under the influence of deep cyclonic flow by the 
end of the week and into next weekend.  Several disturbances 
traveling in this cyclonic flow could impact the area with low end 
chances of rain or snow.  Temperatures during this time look to be 
below average.

.DISCUSSION...Middle America storm system continues to progress
steadily east toward the region at mid evening. Cloudy skies will
continue overnight with some lower level moisture and advancing
higher clouds with the big system. Temperatures are not dropping
too quickly across parts of Northeast Tennessee and may tweak low
temperatures up a bit here. Also, not convinced fog formation will
become dense on any broad scale, so will remove the dense wording.
Pop forecast still in the ballpark with area of strengthening 
lift in strong warm air advection pattern ahead of the 85h low 
over Central Oklahoma. Showers should develop over the Mid South 
and press into western sections of the forecast area toward 
daybreak Saturday. High wind warning remains in place for the

lingering in the Great Valley this evening, but with a strengthening
southerly flow developing, would expect this lower layer will 
continue to dissipate at tys and tri. The layer may hang around a 
bit around cha and will fill back in toward daybreak as an area of
showers spreads into Southeast Tennessee. These pre-frontal 
showers may be a little more scattered at tys and tri with low vfr

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Sunday)...Active weather the next
48 hours with a strong storm system.

For Tonight, even though the cloud deck has risen over much of the
area, plenty of boundary layer moisture will redevelop areas of
fog with some locally dense overnight. The isentropic lift from
the incoming upper trough will begin to pull rain into the western
counties toward daybreak.

For Saturday, plenty of synoptic dynamics taking place. Almost a
double jet structure from the jet streak associated with the upper
trough and jet over the Great Lakes producing widespread
divergence aloft over the southern Appalachians/Tennessee Valley.
Continued isentropic lift due to strong low-level jet combined
with the upper support will produce widespread showers Saturday
and Saturday night. Rainfall of 1 1/2 to 2 inches will be common. 

Do expect some localized flooding issues with near bankfull
streams, ponding of low lying areas, and isolated roadway
flooding. Besides the rain, a band of showers and isolated
thunderstorms are expected late Saturday afternoon and evening
with produce strong and gusty winds. Due to the wet ground, the
strong winds along this line may down isolated trees and produce
localized power outages.

The strong low-level jet will also produce a mountain wave high
wind event over the Mountains and Foothills. Have issued a high
wind warning for the Smokies and advisory for the northeast
Tennessee and southwest Virginia Mountains.

For Saturday night into Sunday, cold air will spill into the
region behind a cold front Saturday with the rain changing to
snow. Orographic lift will enhance the snowfall over the
Mountains. Snow showers or flurries are expected most locations 
with snow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches over the far east 
Tennessee and southwest Virginia Mountains. Snowfall of 1/2 to 1 
inch over the Plateau and lower elevations of southwest Virginia.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Friday)...Models in decent 
agreement overall, but more disagreement and poor run to run 
consistency shows up late in the period and lowers forecast 
confidence.  Colder air will continue to push in Sunday night, and 
wind chill values will be quite low especially over some of the 
higher mountains. Will continue to mention this in the HWO, as a 
wind chill advisory may be needed over some of the higher terrain 
for Sunday night into early Monday.  It will be dry and cold Monday, 
then the next system will be approaching Tuesday bringing warmer air 
ahead of it, and a chance for rain Tuesday afternoon through at 
least Wednesday.  For late in the period, models are having a hard 
time handling a potential wave of low pressure that is expected to 
form along the front and track northeast, but the trend has been 
wetter and warmer for our area Wed night and Thursday.  Some 
rain/snow showers may stick around into Friday as well. Precip type 
quite problematic that far out, but right now looks like mainly rain 
until colder air starts pushing in behind the system Thu night. This 
system will bear watching as a shift southeast in the track of the 
surface low could increase our potential for snow.

.AVIATION...
Plenty of moisture and LIFR or lower flight conditions remains 
across the TAF sites through most of the night. Persistent low-level 
surface ridge in the valley will keep things from mixing out. Not 
until surface trough develops over the eastern valley that 
conditions begin to improve around daybreak Saturday. A band of 
shwoers will move into the TAF sites from west to east beginning 
around daybreak through noon Saturday.

Low level wind shear may become a problem Saturday morning as 
boundary layer jet becomes established.

.DISCUSSION...
Areas of fog remains across the area but is slowly dissipating.
Have let dense fog advisory to expire. Dense cloud cover will keep
temperatures from rising much today, so will continue temperature
forecast on the cooler side.  

Strong storm system will move into the Tennessee Valley and
southern Appalachians Saturday. The 850mb winds will increase to
60-65kts in the Valley. Definitely not perfect setup for mountain
wave high winds but feel the Mountains and Foothills could reach
to high wind criteria, so have issued a watch. Will reevaluate
this afternoon for potential upgrade to high wind warning or 
advisory.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Current water vapor imagery indicates dry air in the upper and 
mid=levels with a cold front at the surface currently back to the 
west. The cold front currently stretches from near Cleveland, OH to 
the southwest to just to the east of Nashville, TN. Model soundings 
indicate that the saturated low-level layer is limited to around 
1000-800 mb with an inversion and dry air just above 800 mb. There 
is some low-level lift in this layer with increase surface 
convergence ahead of the boundary. Due to this, there is some light 
rain/drizzle currently on radar with the best coverage across NE TN 
and SW VA. Temperatures across the area are above freezing and do 
not expect any issues with any wintry precipitation early this 
morning. Winds are light ahead of the boundary and as the low level 
lift exits near sunrise, expect fog will become more widespread and 
have added fog and drizzle to the near-term forecast. 

Clouds will linger once again today as the front slowly moves across 
the forecast area late this morning. Not seeing much in the way of 
cold air advection as the front stalls across southern portions of 
the forecast area. A weak shortwave ridge does build into the region 
today as the low level lift weakens. Therefore, expect most 
locations will remain dry but it does appear that cloud cover will 
linger. Due to this, went a bit lower with forecast highs in the mid 
40s to low 50s. 

A more robust system will move out of the Southern Plains tonight 
into the Lower MIssissippi River Valley. warm air and moisture 
advection will move into the southern Appalchians with 850 mb winds 
ranging from around 35-45 kts. The warm front will surge northward 
as rain chances increase across southwestern portions of the 
forecast area. PW values will climb to over an inch for southwestern 
portions of the forecast area before sunrise. For overnight lows, 
went with a more raw model blend with temperatures warming overnight 
due to strong southerly flow. With the stronger winds at 850 mb, 
expect gusty winds across the higher elevations and a wind advisory 
may become necessary for locations along the TN/NC line.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...


The longterm forecast period will be active with several 
disturbances impacting the region under an active Polar jet.  Heavy 
rainfall, thunderstorms, wintry precipitation, strong winds, and 
cold temperatures are all possible in this long term period.  

Model confidence is average for the weekend system.  The latest runs 
of the ECMWF have trended quicker with the system, and this is in 
consensus with ensemble means.  The 12z and 00z GFS has trended 
notably faster with its trough and this quicker solution is more in 
consensus with the ECMWF. Also, the GFS has trended with a deeper 
trough versus a flatter system in previous runs. This forecast 
utilized a blend of the ECMWF and GFS for placement and timing of 
synoptic features. 

The longterm period starts off with a deep trough across the Central 
Plains and Midwest with lowering heights aloft covering the CWA. 
Further north, northern stream energy was beginning to dive out of 
the Hudson Bay area. Upper level ridging will be building across the 
Rockies.  At the surface, an area of low pressure will develop under 
upper level mass divergence across the Midsouth and travel through 
the Tennessee River valley. Winds will begin to back toward the 
southwest ahead of the approaching upper level system.  This will 
advect deep moisture into the region.  Precipitable water values 
will increase upwards of 1.5 inches with normalized anomalies as 
high as 1.5 to 2.0 standard deviations.   Model soundings show a 
nearly fully saturated column that is moist adiabatic by 18z. 
Further, upper level winds will be unidirectional with vectors 
parallel to the low level boundary. This ultimately means locally 
heavy rainfall is possible.  K-index values are progged to be above 
30 and model soundings and 2-D plane views show some elevated 
instability. Some thunder is possible but widespread thunderstorms 
seem unlikely at this time.  By Sunday morning, the surface low is 
forecast to move through the Mid Atlantic with a neutral tilted 
trough over the Ohio Valley and Southern Appalachians.  As the 
system pulls out, moisture wrapping around the system in combination 
with negative thermal advection could allow precipitation to turn to 
snow on the back side.  GFS model soundings at 12z Sunday show a 
thermal profile that is completely below freezing with a saturated 
layer between 900-650mb. Further, an isothermal layer exists from 
850-750mb.  While most of the upper level support is too far east, 
the residual moisture could become lifted by northwest flow aloft 
and would allow light snow especially for areas in higher 
elevations.  Snow amounts look to remain light with the highest 
terrain in the Smoky Mountains seeing 1-2 inches of snowfall 
possibly.

Strong winds are also possible during the day on Saturday as the low 
level jet cranks up over the area.  A true mountain wave event does 
not look likely, but higher gusts could still occur over the higher 
terrain.  

Upper level ridging will develop by the beginning of next week with 
high pressure diving out of Canada.  850mb temperatures are progged 
to drop to -10 to -20 degrees C which is nearly 10-20 degrees below 
normal.  This will allow surface temperatures to plummet. 
Temperatures in the single digits to teens are likely on Sunday 
night.  In the meantime, another trough will develop off the Rockies 
allowing for lee cyclogenesis Monday night into Tuesday. This low 
will track through the Central Plains and into the Ohio Valley 
through midweek.  Low level flow will strengthen ahead of the trough 
and advect low level moisture back into the area. Precipitation will 
begin as early as Tuesday along the frontal boundary.   Most of the 
precipitation Tuesday through Wednesday night will likely be liquid 
rain.  As colder air filters in, a change over to a rain/snow mix or 
snow could occur on Thursday with chance PoP's.  Confidence on exact 
placement of surface and upper level features is low at this time, 
and this time period bares watching. Surface high pressure builds in 
by the end of the period with below normal temperatures expected.

.AVIATION...

LIFR conditions currently at the terminals with light rain/drizzle
ahead of an approaching cold front. Model soundings indicate that
this layer of shallow low level moisture will continue throughout
the overnight hours until after sunrise. The cold front will move
through the terminals just before sunrise but the low level
moisture remains plentiful to the west of the boundary as well.
Added a tempo group for around sunrise for the possibility of
quarter mile visibilities. Slow improvements are expected
throughout the day but have gone more pessimistic with MVFR being
the best conditions late in the TAF cycle.

.DISCUSSION...The current forecast appears to be on track with a
relatively deep corridor of moist air being lifted in the presence
of an upper level trough. Observations reveal light rain and
drizzle continues across a broad area with the departing trough
with a little more on the way; evidenced by the returns showing up
on radar across Middle Tennessee. The temperature forecast also
looks good with readings remaining steady or rising a degree or 
two even across parts of Southwest Virginia and Northeast 
Tennessee, where there was some sleet reported earlier in the 
evening. There may be some isolated spots where this mixed 
precipitation is still occurring but with the strengthening 
southerly flow ahead of the front, this action may not occur on 
any large scale deep into the night.

.AVIATION...An upper level trough and weak surface boundary will
be moving slowly east across the region tonight. The features are
generating some light rain and drizzle and will continue to
produce this light precipitation through the first half of the
forecast period. The lower atmosphere is just cold enough that
some light sleet is occurring in parts of Northeast Tennessee and
Southwest Virginia as well. In this moist environment, flight
conditions will remain predominantly mvfr and ifr due to low
ceiling and reduced visibility in drizzle and fog with these
categories dropping as low as lifr at times. There will be some
improvement on Friday but an mvfr ceiling may remain through the
final six hours of the forecast.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...The Winter Weather Advisory
for our southwest Virginia counties will expire at 4 PM.
Temperatures remain in the mid 30's in that area which could cause
a light mix of rain and snow to continue. Little to no additional
accumulation is expected. 

Low pressure system will pass east of the area tonight dragging a
weak cold front through the region. The widespread rain and snow 
showers from earlier today will become more scattered through the 
evening. Have likely pops decreasing from west to east this 
evening with generally chance pops after Midnight. The soundings 
are very saturated. Drying begins around 750 mb at 06Z, but the 
profile remains saturated from 850 mb and below through at least 
15Z Friday due to a surface high moving down from the north 
creating an inversion over the wet ground. This will lead to 
periods of drizzle overnight into Friday morning. Patchy fog 
could develop at times overnight, but this is low confidence due 
to winds increasing a bit. The soundings should dry enough by late
morning or early afternoon Friday to allow clouds to gradually 
thin with possibly some sun, but have lowered high temps from 
previous forecast to account for morning drizzle and low clouds. 
Generally expect low/mid 40's in southwest VA, northeast TN, and 
the Plateau with upper 40's/low 50's in the southern valley. 


.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
Strong low pressure system is still expected to move across the mid-
Atlantic region and bring with it a wide range of weather over the 
upcoming weekend. There will be several impacts from this system 
ranging from thunderstorms, wind, rain, snow, and cold 
temperatures... So let's just break it down by impact.

Winds...As this system moves across Central Kentucky the low level 
jet out of the South/Southwest will crank up to over 50+ knots 
Saturday. While this is not a classic mountain wave set up (with 
winds coming out of the southeast) but we could still see strong 
winds in the higher elevation closer to the jet max. Will need to 
watch this for a potential wind advisory if models continue with the 
strong jet trend.


Thunderstorms...Strong divergence aloft will help lead to rising air 
in the warm sector of the low pressure system on Saturday afternoon. 
Even though instability is weak there appears to be enough for some 
thunderstorm activity and with the strong low level jet there's the 
possibilty of transporting the strong winds down towards the 
surface. 

Rain...Decent amount of moisture will be wrapped up in this system. 
Rainfall will begin moving into the Tennesee Valley around Friday 
night and begin to move out by Sunday. Current QPF totals are 
expected to be in the 0.5-1.5" range, with a few locally higher 
amounts under thunderstorms or heavier bands of rain.

Snow...As this system exits the area on Sunday/Monday temperatures 
will drop and lingering moisture could be converted over to 
snowfall. The higher elevations and Northeast Tennessee/Southwest 
Virginia have the highest chance to see accumulating snowfall. We 
could see some accumulating snowfall in the Valley, but with little 
moisture to work with for a relatively short period, would expect 
snow amounts to remain less than 0.5" for most Valley locations. 
Higher elevations could see closer to an inch or more, but certainty 
is still somewhat low due to differences in the models on when the 
cold temperatures and the moisture will actually overlap to bring 
snowfall. 

Cold temperatures...Skies will clear out Sunday night and very cold 
air will continue to funnel in from the northwest. These will help 
lead to temperatures in the teens (and possibly single digits in 
some places) Sunday night/Monday morning. Winds will remain 
relatively light in the Valley, but wind chill values are still 
expected to drop into the single digits early Monday morning.

After this system's influence finally leaves us alone we'll get a 
break for a few days starting on M.L.K. Jr. Day.

Another weather system/frontal boundary will move through the 
forecast area in the second half of the work week. Models are coming 
into better agreement with the system expected to move through on 
Wednesday. It will likely bring mostly rain, but we could see some 
light snowfall as it exits the region.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Active short term forecast period with increasing chances of
rainfall today and tonight. The upper level pattern starts off
with cyclonic flow across New England with troughing across the
central plains. A ridge was analyzed across the intermountain
west. Across the southeast, the upper level flow was more zonal in
nature with slight ridging ahead of the trough. Closer to the 
surface, an area of low pressure was centered across Oklahoma. A 
warm front was aligned NE of the low across central Missouri with 
a portion of that front stalled across Kentucky. 

The rest of tonight should remain quiet with lows in the low to 
mid 30's. Some fog is possible through morning but should remain 
patchy in nature. Isentropic ascent (as viewed on the 290-300K
levels) and warm air advection as noted on point soundings will 
allow moisture to increase during the day with an increase in 
clouds. As of this discussion, light rain was beginning to develop
across the Midsouth in the aforementioned area of warm air 
advection. Short term model guidance and CAM's indicate rainfall 
will begin to move into the area in the late morning to afternoon 
hours. Given that temperatures in the morning are just above 
freezing and thermal profiles are supportive of wintry mix, there 
is the chance that the onset of precipitation could contain a 
mixture of liquid rain, and ice pellets or snow. Confidence on 
this is very low, and will not cause any issues as any mix would 
not last very long at all. As of now, the best timing for rainfall
is between 15-18z for areas along and west of I-75 and I-81. 
Areas east of I-75 would likely see rainfall after 18z. Intensity 
should remain light as the system remains on the weaker side. PoPs
drop off late tonight into Friday morning with only chances of 
precipitation across NE TN, and SW VA. Friday looks to be warmer 
then previous days with highs in the low to mid 50's. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...
 
A strong low pressure system will be tracking from the Ozarks across 
KY to the Mid-Atlantic region Friday night through Saturday night. 
As we have been following the past few days, there will be several 
concerns with this system. First, a southerly LLJ of 50-60 kts may 
create some potential for high winds and/or mountain waves on 
Saturday. Second, East TN will be in the warm sector Saturday 
afternoon, and although instability is weak, strong divergence aloft 
between diffluent jets will enhance lift and give a chance of 
thunderstorms, likely in the form of a squall line. With the strong 
LLJ, there may be a damaging wind threat Saturday afternoon/evening 
as the line moves through. Third, there will be a chance of light 
snow accumulations behind the cold frontal passage Saturday night. 
Most of this will occur in the mountains and SW VA, and even there, 
only a few inches are expected at this time as deep moisture pulls 
out quickly Sunday morning. Finally, temps will be falling through 
the day Sunday with a brisk NW flow that could create low temps in 
the teens in the Valley and sub-zero wind chill values in the 
mountains Sunday night. 

Ridging over the area should provide a dry and mostly sunny day on 
Monday with below normal temperatures. Another system is expected to 
follow on Tuesday/Wednesday, although there are some model 
differences in the timing of the best precip chances with this 
system. The GFS focuses on Tuesday night, while the ECMWF delays it 
until Wednesday. Will maintain chance PoPs during both of these 
periods.

Complex aviation forecast through the next 24 hours. Currently,
CHA and TYS are reporting VFR conditions. CHA should see high
level clouds through the next 6 hours before CIGS begin to fall
as moisture begins to increase. TYS has an OVC deck around 3500 ft

to fall to MVFR levels around mid morning with light rain 
impacting the terminal around 16z. TRI has been socked in with
MVFR for several hours, and this trend is expected to continue
through the TAF period. As boundary layer moisture increases, fog
could become an issue especially at TRI. Added a TEMPO for TRI to
try to capture some of the possible lower CIGS, and fog.
Otherwise, as CIGS begin to lower and rain increases in coverage,
fog may form at all TAF sites during the day Thursday.

A brief period of clearing early tonight before ceilings lower
back down to MVFR. Currently predicting the onset of fog for TRI 
cities later tonight into early tomorrow morning, but all three 
stations have the potential of seeing fog before sunrise. 
Currently TRI cities is the only station where confidence in fog 
formation is great enough to include it in the TAF. Will re-
evaluate the potential for fog for the next TAF iteration. Rain 
will make it's way into the forecast area tomorrow and should be 
on station for all the TAF sites around 16z. Conditions are 
expected to drop to predominantly IFR tomorrow with the potential 
for LIFR during periods of more intense rain and lowering 
ceilings.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...Stratus clouds have held
tough over much of east TN and southwest VA due to an inversion 
between 950 and 850 mb. This has led to a cold mid January day 
across the region. Lowered hourly temps for the rest of the 
afternoon. There has been some clearing in the southern Valley and
across southwest NC, but expect clouds to fill back in tonight as
a low pressure system approaches from the west. Decent 
insentropic lift will begin to take place by mid morning Thursday 
to allow for chance pops expanding west to east. Increasing warm 
air advection and southerly surface winds should warm temps enough
mid to late morning to allow the precip type to be rain, but I 
would not be surprised to see some wet snow in the eastern 
mountains above 2500 feet in any showers that do pass through. Dry
air aloft and wet bulbing will slow the temp rise in those higher
elevations. Latest NAM and SREF bring the most widespread showers
into the region after 17 or 18Z, so have likely pops starting at 
that time with likely to categorical pops through the afternoon. 
Temperatures will only rise into the low 40's through the 
afternoon leading to a cold rain. The cold front associated with 
this system will approach late tomorrow evening.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...Rain will
continue to exit the Tennessee Valley from southwest to the 
northeast on Thursday night as the surface low drags the moisture 
away to the northeast. We'll then see a brief break in the rain 
and colder weather as we head into the weekend. 

The biggest weather system of the 7-day forecast will be a upper 
level trough and strong surface low expected to move over the region 
through the weekend. Ahead of this system we'll see temperatures in 
the Tennessee Valley rise as we're in the warm sector of the low 
pressure system. Temperatures will be very warm again on Saturday 
with highs expected to be in the 50's (and flirt with the 60's in 
some locations) in the Valley. Saturday is also when the rainfall 
will begin moving into the forecast area. A good amount of moisture 
and dynamics are associated with this system. So we could see a 
brief period of thunder on Saturday afternoon in addition to 
moderate/heavy rainfall. By the time the weekend is over we will 
likely see rainfall amounts of around 0.5-2" in most locations.

As this system exits the region much colder air will begin to filter 
in from the northwest. Forecast models depict there will be an 
overlap of below freezing temperatures and precipitation leading to 
some snowfall across the mountains and maybe even some Valley 
locations. Right now it's a bit difficult to determine how much snow 
may fall, but northern Valley locations and the higher elevations 
have the greatest chance to see potentially accumulating snowfall 
amounts. Right now forecast models are indicating any valley 
locations would see around an inch or less of snowfall, but this can 
and will likely change as the system approaches.

Also of concern with this system is very cold temperatures Sunday 
night into Monday morning. Temperatures will dip into the teens 
across most of the area...There will be light winds in the Valley, 
but wind chill values may still dip into the single digits early 
Monday morning.

Dry weather will then take over through the first part of the work 
week as temperatures rebound. Another weather system will move 
through on Wednesday or Thursday but models are in disagreement with 
when it will move through, so confidence on timing of precipitation 
chances is low at this time.

temperatures based on the current observations. Still expect highs
to reach the upper 30's to low 40's this afternoon, but no warmer
than that due to the lingering stratus deck. Also increased the 
cloud cover early this morning to account for thicker stratus over
the next few hours. There have been spotty reports of freezing 
fog in southwest Virginia. Expect that this will dissipate over 
the next hour or two as temperatures warm above freezing. The rest
of the forecast is on track.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Across the area, skies remain cloudy with the exception of the 
higher terrain in the Smoky mountains with temperatures in the low
to middle 30's. In the upper levels, broad cyclonic flow exists 
across the eastern CONUS with ridging to the west across the 
Rockies and central plains. A subtropical jet was noted nosing 
into the Gulf Coast and across the GoM with upper level moisture 
as shown on GOES channel 9 imagery. At the surface, high pressure
remained across the southeast with a cold front progressing SE 
out of the Midwest associated with low pressure in Quebec. As 
mentioned above, the area still remains under low level stratus 
with area LAPS soundings showing a low level inversion around 
900mb with shallow moisture trapped beneath it. The NAM has been 
the most pessimistic model showing the low level stratus 
persisting. Given these trends, and the fact that low level flow 
remains orthogonal to the mountains, have trended for stratus not 
deteriorate as quickly as other guidance indicates. In fact, areas
near and north of Knoxville may see mostly cloudy skies through 
the morning and afternoon. Areas across the far southern 
Tennessee counties stand the best chance to scatter out as the low
level inversion begins to weaken, but confidence remains low. 
This will also likely influence high temperatures today. Since the
forecast hangs on to cloud cover longer, have trended max 
temperatures downward in consensus with the NAM especially across 
northern portions of the forecast area.

Otherwise, expect a quiet day weather wise, as surface high 
pressure remains in control. Low level flow begins to back to the 
SW tonight ahead of an approaching weather system to the west.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...
 
Rain will begin to spread into the area Thursday morning ahead of a 
shortwave trough and a surface low tracking up the OH Valley. This 
should be a fairly light QPF (and all-liquid precip) event as the 
trough is weakly amplified and inflow of Gulf moisture remains cut 
off, but with good model agreement giving high confidence, PoPs will 
be in the categorical range in the afternoon. The mid/upper trough 
outpaces the surface cold front, so chance PoPs will remain in place 
until the fropa Friday morning. 

High pressure at the surface with a near zonal flow aloft will 
briefly be across the area Friday and Friday night before the next 
system starts to approach for the weekend. Models have some timing 
differences with the onset of precip, with the GFS fastest, and the 
NAM being slowest. Will lean the forecast toward the ECMWF, which is 
in the middle of those two, and bring in chance PoPs to the Plateau 
and southern Valley late Friday night. The dynamics with this system 
do not appear quite as impressive as before, as the northern stream 
trough does not amplify as sharply and merge with the southern 
stream as completely as previous runs. Still, heavy rain, gusty 
winds, and thunderstorms will be concerns Saturday afternoon as the 
system crosses the MS Valley. QPF amounts are expected to be in the 
range of 1-2 inches. Cold advection sets in late Saturday 
night/Sunday morning, and there should be enough overlap of moisture 
and cold temps to produce some potential for snow accumulation, 
mainly in the mountains and SW VA but also in the TN Valley. 

Bitterly cold temps and low wind chills will be the concern behind 
this system for Sunday night and Monday, as lows will be in the 
teens to single digits with a brisk NW wind. The GFS is quick to 
bring another deep trough into the Plains with precip spreading into 
our area on Tuesday, but the ECMWF is slower with a cut off upper 
low. With uncertainty this far out, will keep Tuesday dry.

Low level stratus still remains socked in at all TAF sites this
evening. Latest GOES satellite does show the clearing line near
BNA at this time moving very slowly east. Most guidance has been 
fairly optimistic about overall clearing with the NAM remaining 
pessimistic. Given the strength of the low level inversion, and 
moist layer trapped underneath this inversion, kept MVFR CIGS in 
through mid morning at CHA, and through the entire TAF period for 
TYS, and TRI. Winds will remain light out of the N/NW.

.DISCUSSION...

A shallow layer of low level moisture continues across the
forecast areas with a strong inversion around 760-800 mb. The NAM
seems to be handling the current situation with cloud cover the 
best and model soundings indicate that most of the area will 
remain cloudy through sunrise. Due to this, the major update to 
the ongoing forecast was to increase the cloud cover across the 
forecast area. There are a few areas in SW NC and SW VA where 
clouds have begun to clear and temperatures have dropped rather 
quickly due to radiational cooling. For the update, had to adjust 
the lows downward in these areas into the mid 20s. Otherwise, the 
ongoing forecast was in good shape. Do not anticipate fog 
formation overnight with low-level winds remaining around 5-7 kts 
or so.

west into western Tennessee, improvement isn't looking too likely
tonight, although some guidance suggests slight improvements.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...
The upper pattern today is highlighted broad troughing over the 
eastern seaboard with ridging to the west atop the Rockies which is 
yielding deep nwly flow across the OH/TN valleys.  A weak shortwave 
impulse moving along the mean flow aloft on the tail end of a jet 
streak will sweep through the region today/tonight, however with 
little/no consequence.  The main story of the weather in the short 
term is the persistence of a llv inversion, and the modest llv 
moisture trapped beneath.  Given the inversion, said llv cannot 
escape as long as flow remains orthogonal to the mountains, or the 
inversion erodes. Am expecting H85/H925 flow to back swly with time, 
thus some scattering of low clouds is favored through the remainder 
of the afternoon/evening.  That said, per latest visb sat loop, 
there is an interesting region of downslope drying (in the lee of 
the Black Mountain range in KY) across portions of the northern TN
valley and southwest VA. Otherwise, a fairly quiet short term in 
store as sly high pressure prevails on Wednesday amidst rising 
heights aloft. Thus, am expecting temperatures to moderate nearly 
10 degrees from that of today. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
Shortwave trough will be moving towards the area Wednesday night 
into Thursday and a surface low will race along with it. These will 
combine to bring chances of precipitation with the highest 
likelihood of rain coming Thursday afternoon and night. Rain will 
begin to decrease as we move into Friday from southwest to 
northeast. When everything is said and done this first system will 
probably bring less than 0.25" of rain to most locations.

The second system of the forecast will move in quickly on the heels 
of the first, a southern stream shortwave will interact with a 
trough further to the north and combine over the Eastern United 
States. Strong surface low will move to the northeast on Saturday 
just north of the Tennessee Valley. This will bring in very warm and 
moist air on Saturday. There may be enough  dynamics with this 
system to produce a few rumbles of thunder on Saturday as well. 
Highs on Saturday are currently forecasted to be about 20-25 degrees 
above normal for this time of year. Moderate to heavy rain looks to 
be the main mode of precipitation on Saturday afternoon/night with 
widespread rainfall totals around 1-2" over the weekend looking 
possible.  After this system exits to the north we will see strong 
cold air advection from the northwest at the end of the weekend and 
into next week. 

High temperatures will drop about 25 or more degrees on Sunday 
compared to Saturday. Overnight lows look to drop well below 
freezing into the teens on Sunday night/Monday morning. With some 
lingering winds behind the system we could see wind chill values 
drop into the single digits as well. The final aspect to watch with 
this weekend system will be the potential for some snow showers as 
it exits the region on Sunday. A bit difficult to time the departure 
of the moisture with the drop in temperatures, but can't rule out 
some light snow showers in the Valley on Sunday at this time.

Llv moisture trapped beneath an inversion continues to favor low

moisture spread about for most of the first half of the period. 
Therefore, MVFR expected to persist for much of the day/evening at

TRI. Another round of llv moisture looks to advect in from the

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

At 3 AM, skies were cloudy with temperatures in the mid to lower 
30's. The region is under the influence of surface high pressure 
located across the lower Mississippi valley. In the upper levels, 
weak shortwave ridging was analyzed across the Ohio valley with a 
shortwave trough moving southeast out of the northern plains. 
Some patchy fog is possible overnight across SW VA, and the higher
terrain of the Smoky's, but should mix out by 12-14z. The 
persistent cloud cover will begin to clear out today as a drier 
airmass continues to advect into the area. Temperatures are 
forecast to be a couple degrees warmer today than yesterday with 
highs in the lower to mid 40's. Cloud cover should start to
increase tonight as low level stratus begins to move back into the
area underneath a strong inversion.  

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...

The period begins with large differences between the NAM and GFS 
moisture and temperature profiles, making for an uncertain 
temperature forecast for Wednesday. The NAM shows a strong inversion 
from 900-850 mb that locks low level moisture in place all day 
across the Valley, and gives highs in the 30s and 40s. The GFS is 
mostly clear with highs in the 50s. The forecast will lean toward 
the NAM, given the extensive upstream stratus seen on satellite and 
the tendency of the GFS to weaken inversions and erode cloud cover 
too quickly. The majority of SREF members lend support the colder 
NAM temps as well. On Thursday a shortwave trough will be crossing 
the area, bringing likely to categorical PoPs to the area, mainly in 
the afternoon. However it should move through quickly, with PoPs 
decreasing in the evening and ending altogether by 12Z Friday. 
Precip with this system will be all rain. 

A southern stream shortwave trough will merge with a deepening 
northern stream trough to produce a longwave trough across the 
eastern ConUS for Sunday and Monday. Surface cyclogenesis in the lee 
of the Rockies will begin on Friday, and moisture advection ahead of 
it will spread rain into our area beginning Saturday. The model 
consensus is that the low will track across KY, putting us in the
warm sector. Add in some potent dynamics with the upper and low 
level jets, and there may be some potential for thunderstorms 
Saturday afternoon. Will add a chance of thunder to go with with 
categorical showers. Fropa occurs Saturday night, with falling 
temperatures through the day on Sunday. Snow showers will be 
possible during this time as temps aloft will drop sharply and 
create steep lapse rates with a NW upslope flow. At this time, 
accumulations appear to be mainly in the mountains. Highs Sunday 
and Monday will be in the 20s and 30s, with lows Sunday night 
mainly in the teens.

.AVIATION...

MVFR conditions are expected through the next 6 to 12 hours with
low CIGS around 1000-1500 ft. Area observations this evening have
shown light precipitation at TRI. Given that temperatures are 
expected to continue to cool overnight, periods of freezing 
drizzle or flurries are possible at TRI through 09z. Otherwise, 
winds remain W/NW 3 to 5 knots through the TAF period. Fog 
potential is low given the strength of surface winds tonight. 
Mixing after sunrise will allow the stratus deck to gradually mix 
out with improving conditions expected at all TAF sites.

.DISCUSSION...

A rather complex update for the weather this evening into tonight 
with drizzle, freezing drizzle, fog, freezing fog, snow flurries, 
and snow showers all expected. Model soundings indicate a 
saturated low-level layer from around 950-750 mb across NE TN and 
SW VA. Seeing enough low level lift with the northwesterly flow 
behind the departing system to lead to precipitation from this 
shallow layer of low-level moisture and have continued with some 
mention of precipitation through about 10z or so. Current
observations indicate that most of the precipitation is currently
in the form of light snow or drizzle but have added the chance for
freezing drizzle due to the shallow nature of the moisture. Best 
chances for any snow or ice accumulations will be in the higher 
elevations above 3 kft with snowfall amounts of under an inch and
ice amounts of only a trace amount. Additionally, there will be 
the possibilty of fog/freezing fog during the overnight period, 
especially in the sheltered valleys and for locations near area 
rivers and streams. The freezing fog could lead to some minor 
travel issues early tomorrow morning depending on the coverage.

MVFR conditions currently across the terminals with a lingering
layer of shallow low-level moisture. Current radar imagery and
observations indicate an area of drizzle/flurries from TYS to 
TRI. Temperatures will continue to cool this evening with the 
possibilty of freezing drizzle or flurries at TRI through 10z. 
Temperatures at TYS should remain above freezing throughout the 
evening and have just mentioned -DZ for now. Will continue to 
monitor near-term radar and temperature trends and make any 
amendments if necessary. Freezing fog will also be possible at
both TYS and TRI late tonight with visibilities in the MVFR
category. The low level moisture will eventually mix out after 
sunrise with improving conditions shortly after daybreak.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
High pressure and persistent low ceilings will continue for the
remainder of today and tonight. We can look forward to some of the
clouds clearing out tomorrow afternoon as a drier airmass moves in
and the inversion weakens. Some possible fog formation overnight 
and early morning for the northeastern areas of the valley. 
Temperatures are expected to remain cool overnight tonight with 
lows in the low 30's to upper 20's and the high tomorrow only a 
few degrees more than today. With a few lingering areas of light 
precipitation for the higher elevations and SW Virginia, combined
with overnight lows, it's possible to see a further few 
hundredths of an inch of mixed precip tonight and early tomorrow 
morning.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday Night through Monday)...
The extended will begin with a ridge over the region providing 
dry and warmer weather. The ridge will dominate area weather 
through Wednesday night. Then...the weather will transition into a
wet and unsettle pattern as a series of systems move through the 
region. First up will be an area of low pressure riding through 
the upper flow and will push across the Southern Appalachian 
Region Thursday into Thursday night. A warming trend will continue
over the area and this should allow for a mostly rain event. A 
few showers may linger into Friday as the system pulls 
away...otherwise...much of Friday will see a brief dry period with
the area being between systems. Then...the next system will 
quickly move in Friday night and Saturday. This will be a 
relatively strong and well organize cold front. On 
Saturday...ahead of the front... expect a line of convection to 
move through. There may be some embedded thunder but this should 
be limited and for now will not mention in the forecast. 
Also...expect a strong 850MB jet to accompany the front. This will
allow for breezy and gusty winds...especially over the higher 
elevations. Behind the front...much cooler air will push in and 
temperatures will fall to below normal levels. By Sunday...the 
upper low will move through and pull in some low level moisture 
and weak lift. With he colder air in place...expected isolated to 
scattered rain and snow showers to move through the area. High 
pressure will build in on Monday for a return to dry conditions.

Low ceilings resulting from low level moisture, combined with an 
inversion will lead to prominent IFR conditions for most of the 
forecast period for TYS and TRI. CHA is expected to remain MVFR
for the rest of Monday with lower ceilings overnight dropping into
IFR conditions. Both TYS and TRI look to see some fog development
overnight with the greatest restrictions to visibility just before
sunrise tomorrow morning. There is a small possibility that TRI
could see a brief period of freezing fog dependent on how low the
temperature falls overnight, but confidence of this particular
event is currently too small to include in the TAF.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A northwesterly low to midlevel flow will continue through today and 
tonight, and with moisture trapped against the mountains and 
underneath an inversion around 850 mb, we will continue to see 
cloudy skies with drizzle and pockets of light rain through the 
period. Any measureable precip today will be in the mountains and in 
SW VA/NE TN where moisture depth will be greatest, and a shortwave 
trough passing to the north will provide weak lift this morning. 
Locations above 2500 ft will be could enough to have some potential 
for light icing, and the SPS for this will be continued. A trough 
passage tonight will bring drier air behind it, further decreasing 
moisture depth which should limit any lingering drizzle to the 
mountains.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)... 
High pressure ridge to change cloudy wet pattern Tuesday with a 
warming and drying trend. Clear conditions will prevail Tuesday 
but will stay cool. Mostly clear Tuesday night and warmer 
temperatures Wendesday as surface high moves overhead. Thursday 
low pressure develops over the southern plains and warm front 
moves into the forecast area. A chance of rain Thursday with a 
little snow as precipitation begins early Thursday but will not be
significant. Rain becomes likely by Thursday night ahead of cold 
front. Wet pattern will continue Friday with the front. Then a new
area of low pressure will develop along the front east of the 
Rockies Friday. The next system deepens over the Plains states 
Saturday. The surface low will move across the forecast area late 
Saturday and move into the Carolinas Sunday. This might bring 
windy conditions and a chance for thunderstorms. Will leave out 
thunderstorms for now as it is several days out. This last front 
will bring in much colder airmass. There is a chance of snow 
Saturday night and Sunday behind the front. Temperatures will be 
near average Wednesday then become above normal Friday and 
Saturday becoming much colder Sunday and into next week.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast mostly on track this evening with some
minor updates. Biggest changes were to update POPs through the 
night based on current radar and hi- res model trends and also
added in fog/freezing fog across the area. After looking at 
latest soundings it still looks like freezing drizzle will occur 
rather than snow, for areas that dip below freezing, because 
moisture is shallow and struggles to reach above -6 to -8 degree 
Celsius. Will maintain light ice accumulation across the higher 
elevations with up to a few hundredths of an inch possible. Travel
may be difficult in areas that see freezing drizzle as well as 
areas that see any fog and freezing fog. Overnight lows look good
and will be in lower to upper 30s.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

Winds will shift to be more from the west northwest late tonight
leading to cooler temperatures overnight and into tomorrow. While
a more northwest flow will eventually lead to clearing skies we
can expect Monday to remain relatively cloudy with a few stray
showers overnight. The combination of the overnight precipitation
and lowering temperatures will create the chance for some frozen
precip for areas of higher elevation. Some areas of the Smokey's
and southwestern Virginia could see some accumulation of ice, up
to a few hundreds of an inch. No weather advisory will be issued
due to limited area of expected accumulation of frozen precip, but
will issued an SPS.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...

A few pockets of light snow and even some freezing drizzle will 
linger over the higher elevations of the East TN Mountains Monday 
evening...before ending overnight. Little to no snow or ice 
accumulation is expected. A ridge of high pressure begins to build
in on Tuesday...ushering in a warming and drying trend. The mild 
and quiet conditions will continue over the Southern Appalachian 
Region through Wednesday night. The area will then transition into
a more active and wet weather pattern for the rest of the 
extended as a series of systems move through. On Thursday/Thursday
night...a weak area of low pressure will track through the upper 
flow and spread scattered showers across the area. Any precip that
moves into the higher elevations early Thursday could see a mix 
of rain and snow...otherwise daytime temperatures will be warm 
enough for all rain. There should a be brief dry period somewhere 
around the Friday time frame when we are between systems. 
However...the break will be short lived and timing of this is 
difficult. This is because the next system...a decently strong 
cold front...will move in quickly late Friday into Friday night 
and continue to affect the area into Saturday. The main band of 
showers will push through ahead of the front. The warm air mass in
place will keep precip as rain. Cooler air will filter in behind 
the cold front late Saturday/Saturday night. Any residual rain 
Saturday night will change over to snow at many locations as the 
front pulls away from the area. The associated upper low will then
wrap low level moisture into the area for Sunday...continuing to 
generate light scattered rain or snow showers...with snow mainly 
over northern locations and especially across favored upslope 
area.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Monday)... 
WV imagery shows that deep moisture has pulled east of our area, 
with plenty of dry air upstream. IR imagery shows low cloud cover 
extending all the way into OK and NE TX. This pattern of dry air 
aloft and low level saturation will be our lot through the short 
term period. A surface low pressure center over West TN  this 
morning will track across the area, with the midlevel circulation a 
moving across KY. This will bring the best rain chances to northern 
sections today, with low to slight chances of measureable rain in 
the southern half, but with patchy drizzle as well. The chance of 
rain will drop this evening as the low moves to our east, but 
drizzle will persist through tonight and tomorrow. Cold advection 
will also set in tonight behind the departing low, dropping the 
freezing level and producing some freezing rain and/or drizzle for 
the mountains and higher elevations of SW VA. Will reissue the SPS 
to mention this potential for light icing. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Saturday)...
The current system will move out during the overnight hours Monday 
night with some lingering patchy drizzle and freezing drizzle. 
Ridging aloft builds in with a warming trend Tuesday through 
Thursday. Highs will warm about 5 degrees Tuesday to the upper 30s 
and 40s. The warming continues Wednesday with highs in the mid 40s 
to lower 50s. Wednesday night and Thursday clouds increase as system 
develops over the Ohio Valley. Light rain will spread in by Thursday 
morning with a probable warm front across the region. Models bring 
cold front close to the region Friday with increased rain chances 
through the day Thursday and Thursday night and much warmer highs in 
the 50s. Friday there will be a brief break in the rain as another 
system begins to wind up over the plains states. This system and 
surface low over the southern plains deepens over MO late Friday and 
Friday night. Rain spreads through the Tennessee Valley Friday night 
with much colder airmass moving in behind it late Saturday. 
Temperatures likely to fall Saturday afternoon as this system ushers 
in a colder temperatures and a chance of some winter precipitation 
Saturday night.

.AVIATION...

MVFR to VFR conditions currently across the terminals with rain
spreading across the southern Appalchians. Flight conditions are 
a bit better than anticipated and have gone with a slightly more 
optimistic forecast. Pushed back the timing of IFR and MVFR 
ceilings with IFR around 07z at CHA and MVFR around 02-03z at TYS 
and TRI. Forecasting some slight improvements after sunrise but 
expect the terminals will stay MVFR throughout most of the TAF 
cycle. The majority of the precipitation will move through by 
06-08z with a few lingering showers afterwards. Winds will remain 
light throughout the TAF cycle.

.DISCUSSION...Quick update this evening to put in snow at 
elevations above 4000 feet with the onset of precip. Current 
Newfound Gap ob coming in at 28 degrees. 850 model temps show 
that it should already be above freezing at this hour. Believe
any snow will change over to rain before midnight as warm air
advection continues. Expect minor snow accumulations to occur, 
anywhere between half an inch and one inch are possible at 
elevations above 4000 feet. Will send out new zones. Will also 
issue a new SPS that accounts for the aforementioned snow.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...Low pressure to our west 
will move east into our area, then begin to redevelop along the 
coast. An area of rain will spread across the area this afternoon 
and early tonight, and then the better lift will exit to the 
northeast leaving behind some patches of light rain and drizzle 
later tonight and into Sunday. Temperatures have warmed strongly 
over most of the area, and precip type should be primarily rain. 
However, there continues to be the possibility of a few pockets of
snow and/or freezing rain over some of the higher peaks of the 
northeast mountains and eastern portions of Washington/Russell 
counties of SW VA. Will issue an SPS talking about this 
possibility as a few spots might see some light icing. Will keep 
the wind advisory going as is for the higher elevations/foothills 
of the eastern TN mountains, as we have been having some mountain 
wave enhancement of the winds in these areas and conditions remain
favorable for much of the night. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...Scattered showers 
will linger over the region Sunday night into Monday as the weekend 
system slowly exits the area.  Most lower elevations will see mainly 
a few pockets of light rain.  Higher terrain will have a mixed bag 
of precip types...where rain...snow and freezing rain/drizzle will 
be possible.  These higher elevations could see some minor snow 
accumulations but this should remain less than an inch.  A couple of 
hundredths of freezing precip can not be ruled out.  The last 
remnants of this system should pull out during the overnight hours 
Monday night with any residual patchy drizzle/freezing drizzle 
ending overnight.  By Tuesday...a ridge of high pressure will begin 
to build in...allowing for a warming trend and a return to dry 
conditions.  Models continue to show some difference by the end of 
the period but overall the pattern will transition to wet and 
unsettled.  Models currently want to bring two different systems 
through...one late Thursday into Friday and another Friday night 
into Saturday.  With the warmer air mass in place from the mid week 
ridge...these system currently look to be mostly rain 
events...though some overnight mixing of rain and snow is possible 
over higher elevations both Thursday night and Friday night.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Sunday)... 
Isentropic lift is producing some light precip across the area this 
morning, but much of it is not reaching the ground as the sub-750 mb 
layer remains very dry as seen in the 00Z OHX sounding and models 
soundings in East TN. CSV has reported snow as well as a few sites 
in E KY so some spots on the Plateau and higher elevations of SW 
VA/NE TN may see light snow this morning, but with very little 
accumulation. With weak lift and dry low levels, PoPs will remain in 
the low to slight chance range through most of today, but increase 
late in the afternoon as southerly 850 mb winds bring increasing 
moisture advection and synoptic lift strengthens ahead of the 
approaching closed mid/upper level circulation. Categorical PoPs 
will be forecast tonight when forcing peaks in the 00-06Z time 
frame. After 06Z, we begin to see midlevel drying begin from the 
west, and with the lack of moisture in the dendrite growth zone, 
precip will become mainly drizzle by Sunday morning in most spots. 
Low level saturation with dry air aloft and weak low level forcing 
contines through Sunday, and will have categorical drizzle with a 
chance of rain all day. Late in the day, the freezing level starts 
to drop as the midlevel trough moves overhead, and the TN mountains 
may see some freezing drizzle, mainly above 4000 ft.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Friday)...
Sunday night into Monday night low pressure will have moved off the 
coast with another upper trough moving into the Tennessee Valley.
Mostly lighter precipitation lingering with light rain mixed with
snow changing to drizzle/freezing drizzle or very light freezing 
rain as moisture decreases Monday and Monday night. Temperatures 
Sunday night will be above freezing except at the highest 
elevations of east Tennessee mountains and southwest Virginia. 
Snowfall amounts will be less than 1 inch and ice accumulation 
amounts only a couple hundredths of an inch. Monday will stay cold
as higher pressure tries to build in behind developing low off 
the mid atlantic coast. Also low clouds and lingering moisture 
will hold temperatures down. Followed closer to NAM guidance for 
highs only mid to upper 30s southwest Virginia and near 40 to 
lower 40s elsewhere. Monday night moisture finally moves out with 
lingering drizzle/freezing drizzle possible. As high pressure 
builds in Tuesday through early Thursday temperatures will warm 
into the 40s to mid 50s and there will be at least two days of 
sunshine. Another weak front will approach late Thursday into 
Friday with moisture increasing from the southwest. Right now only
low chances for rainfall but staying in a mild pattern for 
temperatures.

.DISCUSSION...Discussion...Updated the forecast to decrease the onset of pops 
across extreme northern TN and southwest VA until after 06Z, and 
trimmed the areal extent of the "chance pops" to areas confined near 
the TN/VA border. Still believe areas of light rain, sleet, and snow 
will occur in these areas through about 15Z, but upstream 
observations show that the precipitation has not been reaching the 
ground so far this evening. The soundings look dry for much of the 
night which will allow for the slower onset and reduced coverage. I 
have also increased low temperatures 1-3 degrees across the entire 
county warning area to account for the increasing clouds plus 
current temperatures running slightly warmer. Updated zones have 
been sent to reflect these changes. The rest of the forecast is on 
track.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...Surface high pressure that is 
extending into our area from the north will retreat overnight as a 
developing low pressure system approaches from the west.  Moisture 
will increase, and an area of weak isentropic lift should bring some 
light precipitation to at least northern areas later tonight into 
early Saturday.  This precipitation is likely to be light snow 
and/or sleet across the north, and if any precipitation makes it to 
the surface late tonight/early Saturday in the central valley we 
could see a bit of sleet briefly mixing in there as well.  However, 
precip amounts with this are expected to be light with little or no 
accumulation except across parts of southwest Virginia, and even 
there any accumulation should be less than an inch. Warmer air will 
be pushing in Saturday, so the next more significant area of 
precipitation that moves begins moving in later Saturday will be 
mainly rain as the surface low and mid/upper trough approach. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...Weather will be ongoing 
at the start of the extended.  A low pressure system will be making 
it's way across the Southern Appalachian Region Saturday Night into 
Sunday.  Model consistency has been poor with this system... 
especially with respect to temperatures over the region and 
confidence in details remains rather low.  The overall trend has 
been a bit warmer.  Expected a large band of precipitation to be 
moving through the area Saturday night into Sunday.  Over most 
valley locations...the temperature profile shows precip should stay 
rain...though some northern valley areas could see a brief rain/snow 
mix.  Higher elevations and northern locations will see snow or rain 
transitioning to snow overnight.  Some snow accumulations are 
expected.  Most of these locations will see accumulations generally 
less than an inch.  However...the highest elevations could see one 
to possible up to 2 inches by the end of the day Sunday.  Scattered 
showers will linger into Sunday night or Monday with higher terrain 
...at most...picking up an additional inch.  The area will then move 
into a warmer and drier pattern with a high pressure ridge building 
in for mid week.  By the end of the period...model discrepancy 
increases and confidence lowers but current tends want to bring the 
next system and associated precip in around the Thursday/Friday time 
frame.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Surface high pressure over the Great Lakes will be shifting east to 
New England through the day, while a mid/upper level ridge will 
continue to build over the Southeast. The dry NW flow aloft will 
give a sunny day with temperatures rebounding closer to normal, with 
highs in the 40s in most spots. High and midlevel clouds will 
increase quickly late in the day as the midlevel ridge axis moves 
east and a shortwave 700 mb trough approaches. Isentropic lift and 
midlevel saturation associated with the trough will begin to produce 
light precip across the northern half around 06Z, but with precip 
falling into a dry sub-800 mb layer, it may not reach the ground 
until around 09Z. Top-down saturation and evaporative cooling will 
give the higher elevations of SW VA the best chance of seeing some 
snow accumulation late tonight, but less than one inch expected for 
places like High Knob due to the small window of timing of adequate 
lift/moisture as the trough exits around 12Z. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Friday)...
Cold high pressure centered east of the Appalachians at the 
beginning of the extended with a weak surface trough over the 
central Appalachians into the Tennessee Valley. Warm moist air in 
southerly flow ahead of a surface low moving into the Tennessee 
Valley Saturday will continue to bring moisture across the region. 
Light rain and snow will be occurring across the southern half of the 
area with some light snow north. Only light snowfall accumulations 
possible Saturday generally less than 0.5 inch northeast and higher 
elevations as temperatures warm aloft with warm air advection 
pattern and colder air trapped east of the Appalachians. The main 
shortwave with system moving up from the Mississippi Valley will 
approach late Saturday and Saturday night. Temperatures will stay 
warm except across southwest Virginia and the extreme northeast 
Tennessee mountains where a couple inches of snow could fall 
overnight in the highest elevations. possibly even freezing rain 
along the North carolina border. The surface low will move from west 
Tennessee Saturday night then into the southeast states Sunday. 
Temperatures Saturday will only reach the upper 30s to mid 40s 
across the area and drop into the 30s at night with slightly warmer 
readings Sunday. A few more tenths of an inch of snow possible in 
the colder northeast section Sunday. The low finally exits to east 
of the coast Monday with precipitation ending as mostly rain. High 
pressure with warmer temperatures building in late Monday through 
Wednesday. Another weak front will bring clouds and more rain by 
Wednesday night and Thursday. Temperatures will be near normal 
mid 40s to lower 50s.

.DISCUSSION...Tonight's forecast is on track. Surface high pressure
which dropped down from the north through the day now has a firm 
hold on the Tennessee Valley with clear skies and light N to NE 
winds. This will lead to another bitter cold night with widespread
upper teens to low 20's across the region for overnight lows. I 
have inputed the current observed temperatures into the hourly 
grids to tweak how temperatures will fall throughout the first 
half of the night. The rest of the forecast is on track, so expect
a mostly sunny day tomorrow with highs rebounding into the low to
mid 40's and near 50 across the southern Valley as the high 
shifts eastward and allows return flow to develop.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...Surface high pressure centered 
to our northwest will continue to extend into our area as it slides 
east during the period.  The atmosphere will be rather dry, although 
some increase in moisture can be expected late as flow begins to 
turn more southerly aloft, but this will just result in an increase 
in high clouds. Will be mostly clear and cold tonight, then mostly 
sunny tomorrow with temperatures close to seasonal normals.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...The GFS is coming into 
better agreement with the remaining suite of models including the 
WRF/ECMWF/CMC with a little more northward track of the surface low 
pressure center associated with the weekend weather system. The 
upper trough presses east from the Southern Plains on Friday into 
the Mid Mississippi Valley on Saturday. The resulting warm and moist 
strengthening southerly flow, showing up in the models as a brief 
period of isentropic lift, will produce some light rain across 
Southeast Tennessee with a mixture of light rain and snow farther 
north across the forecast area. Surface temperatures are expected to 
be warm enough across much of the region for little to no snowfall 
accumulation late Friday night through Saturday morning. 
Strengthening warm air advection through the day Saturday should 
change precipitation type in all but the extreme northeastern 
reaches of the forecast area to rain. The main body of deepest 
moisture and short wave lifting will occur later Saturday afternoon 
through the evening hours with lighter precipitation and slightly 
lower probabilities later Saturday night through Sunday as the mid 
latitude cyclone's low pressure center shifts slowly east across the 
Southern Appalachians into the Carolinas. Again, temperatures may be 
just cold enough for a couple snow showers in the most northern 
reaches of the higher terrain across Southwest Virginia and Extreme 
Northeast Tennessee late Saturday night. The chance for 
precipitation will be a little lower Sunday night into Monday but 
remains in place as some northern stream short wave energy drops in 
behind the main storm system. There could be a few light snow 
showers in the higher terrain, mainly across Southwest Virginia and 
Northeast Tennessee, in the cold air advection pattern from the 
trailing upper level features Sunday night into Monday morning. 
Drier air finally fills in behind the early week unsettled pattern 
giving us at least two dry days Tuesday and Wednesday. Model 
uncertainty remains late in the extended forecast on Thursday. At 
this time, just used a slight chance pop for a moisture starved weak 
frontal system possibly in the area toward the end of the work
week.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Large upper level trough is slowly moving out of the forecast area
late tonight but not before bringing some weak shortwave energy 
across the northeast part of the region in the form of low 
cloudiness and a few snow flurries across southwest Virginia. 
The flurries are expected to only last a few more hours as the air
mass is becoming too dry to support precipitation. Winds are 
expected to start decreasing later this morning as surface high 
builds in. Temperatures early this morning are much colder than 
Wednesday morning with readings in the lower 20s to around 30. As 
the strong cold air advection continues through the morning 
temperatures will only very slowly climb into the 30s to around 40
by afternoon. North to northwest winds of around 10 to 15 mph 
early with higher gusts will add to the chill. Tonight the surface
high will be centered from the Tennessee Valley north across the 
Ohio Valley and winds will decrease to near calm. With the cold 
dry air in place lows will drop to the teens to lower 20s...even 
colder than this mornings values.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Thursday)...
The extended forecast period kicks of on Friday morning amidst an
approaching H5 ridge axis, while a deepening trough ejects 
eastward over the southern Plains. At the surface, high pressure 
centered over the northern OH valley will prevail across much of 
the eastern CONUS, while surface cyclogenesis strengthens beneath 
the aforementioned upper trough over TX. Pattern evolution through
the weekend continues to favor eastward advection of this storm 
system, with dry weather forecast for Friday ahead of increasing 
precipitation chances Friday night as a region of moist upglide 
passes overhead. Into late Saturday morning guidance continues to 
suggest warm advection ahead of the approaching low, therefore 
other than a brief period of rain/snow mix on Saturday morning, 
expecting a phase change to all rain for much of the day Saturday 
(except for at the highest elevations where rain/snow will 
prevail). Diurnal cooling overnight into Sunday could support 
another round of rain/snow and perhaps some sleet across portions 
of southwest VA and the high terrain of east TN, otherwise all 
rain for remainder of the region. To round out this particular 
system, the upper trough will swing in on Sunday with profiles 
cooling aloft which should support another round of snowfall 
Sunday night as the system departs the area. Overall it looks like
the most favorable regions for accumulating snowfall will be 
across the east TN mountains, portions of southwest VA, and 
perhaps some light accumulations over portions of the northern 
Plateau/valley. High pressure and dry conditions look to consume 
much of the east/central CONUS by Tuesday morning, likely lasting 
into/through midweek with a slight warming trend to prevail.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...A large upper level trough
over the eastern U.S. will gradually shift eastward allowing
surface high pressure to build southward into the Tennessee 
Valley from the Midwest late tonight and Thursday. Before this
high builds in, gusty winds and mid to high level clouds will
continue to affect far northeast TN and southwest VA through the
first half of tonight due to shortwave energy continuing to rotate
around the backside of the trough. Winds will begin to diminish
after 06Z, and clouds lingering in NE TN and SW VA will clear out
after 12Z. Scattered snow flurries/snow showers are possible
before 12Z in these northeast areas, but a lack of moisture will
prevent widespread coverage. Temps will be quite cold tonight in 
the cold air advection with upper teens to low 20's in the 
mountains, far NE TN, and SW VA and low to mid 20's across the 
Valley. Mostly sunny skies will dominate Thursday with the high 
overhead, but highs will only reach the mid 30's to low 40's.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
Today's model runs for the weekend forecast indicate differences 
in strength and surface low track through it's trek across the 
Southeastern United States with the ECMWF a little stronger, 
warmer, and farther north with track than the GFS. Trended the 
weekend forecast toward this warmer solution which would allow 
more rainfall than snowfall during the event. It still appears 
that there could be significant snowfall in the very highest 
reaches of the terrain in the Southern Appalachian region 
including mountains across Southwest Virginia, Northeast Tennessee
and along the Tennessee/North Carolina border. The period of 
greatest accumulation in these areas would be shifted perhaps to 
the main cold advection part of the system with the trailing upper
level part of the storm system Sunday into Sunday night. 
Otherwise, temperatures "could be" cold enough for some minor one 
to two inch accumulations in these mountain areas as warm and 
moist air rides over the top of sub-freezing air later Friday 
night into Saturday morning. The warming ahead of the feature 
during the day Saturday would allow for a changeover from snow 
back to rain possibly into the evening hours followed by another 
late night shift in these higher terrain areas where snow mixes 
with and entirely changes back into snow again. Uncertainty still 
remains high with this system and there could be another snow to 
rain shift in the northern part of the forecast area Sunday. Drier
air will stream back into the area during the early part of the 
work week bringing an end to the precipitation with possibly a dry
Tuesday followed by an indication of a low amplitude feature on 
Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Across the region it was mostly clear, slightly cooler, and 
breezy. Temperatures have been moderated by the winds overnight, 
however, that will change as more cold air pours into the region 
today in the wake of the cold front. The wind advisory for the 
Tennessee mountains will continue through early this evening where
the highest gusts will occur. 

Strong northwest flow and an associated shortwave will translate
across southwest Virginia today. This will reinforce cold air
advection into the area. Additionally, shallow moisture will also
be present which could produce a few snow showers into the early
evening. Do not anticipate much, if any, accumulations from this
system. The bigger problem will be the wind chills later today
into tonight particularly for portions of southwest Virginia and
higher elevations of the TN mountains. Will be monitoring for the
possibility of a wind chill advisory for tonight for these areas. 

Temperatures for today and tonight will be well below normal
values. Look for temperatures to drop or remain steady through the
day. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...

The extended range fcst period initializes on Thursday morning 
amidst rising heights aloft and nwly flow as a ridge slides east. At 
the surface, high pressure will be moving across the Midwest and 
into OH/TN valleys, enhancing the pressure gradient across the high 
terrain.  This combined with modest but weakening nwly H85 flow will 
allow for some gusty winds and brisk wind chills at elevations above 
3kft early on Thursday. Otherwise, the aforementioned upper ridge 
will continue to advect east while surface ridging slides beneath 
and atop the central/southern Appalachians, eventually setting up 
CAD conditions east of the mountains by late week.  All in all, the 
remainder of the work week continues to look dry and cool. 

Meanwhile an H5 trough will dig out of the Rockies promoting surface 
cyclogenesis and setting up a zone of baroclinicity over the lower 
MS valley and Midsouth regions by Friday afternoon.  At this point 
the guidance begins to diverge with regard to placement of both the 
upper/surface low tracks, as well as timing of said features. 
Nevertheless, as the entire complex shifts east overnight into 
Saturday isentropic upglide atop the entrenched surface ridge looks 
plausible, which depending on precipitation onset timing could yield 
a brief period of wintry weather early on Saturday morning before 
WAA favors all rain.  Precipitation will increase in 
coverage/intensity with passage of the upper low and any associated 
dynamic forcing through the day on Saturday into Sunday morning when 
the surface low slowly pulls away to the east.  As the upper trough 
swings overhead, profiles will begin to cool from the top down with 
critical thicknesses favoring a change over to snowfall during these 
overnight hours for the higher elevations, with a rain/snow mix in 
the valley.  Diurnal warming on Sunday will favor yet another phase 
change with mostly rain expected until cooling prevails yet again 
overnight into Monday when profiles look to support mostly snowfall 
as precipitation slowly tapers toward midday.  Beyond that the 
forecast dries out for Monday night through Tuesday as another H5 
ridge axis slides east a top the TN valley, and dry surface high 
pressure prevails.

.DISCUSSION...

Temperatures tonight have been running several degress above
forecast as the atmosphere has been well mixed as noted by the
gusty winds. Updated the forecast based on these trends, and
increased overnight lows by a few degrees. While the area should
see cold air advection as lower tropospheric winds turn toward the
NW, mixing should keep temperatures from falling as they would
normally behind a cold front. Otherwise, this cold front now
analyzed east of the forecast area will continue eastward while an
reinforcing front moves south out of the Ohio Valley. Skies 
should remain mostly clear with the exception of SW Virginia, 
extreme northeast Tennessee, and the higher mountain elevations 
where shallow moisture may still be present by morning. The 
northwest flow aloft could allow for orographic precipitation in 
the form of snow flurries overnight and the morning. Winds will 
remain gusty with strong pressure rises behind the front, and as 
the pressure gradient remains tight. The ongoing wind advisory 
across the mountain zones looks good, with no other updates 
planned at this time.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...

The cold front is still back to the west of the forecast area 
currently. Radar returns have been rather sparse today with little 
in the way of deep moisture across the area. The moisture has been 
confined to below 750 mb and strong low level winds have helped to 
mix out the cloud cover. The shallow moisture coupled with the lack 
of synoptic lift has left the forecast area mostly dry today. Winds 
ahead of the boundary have been rather impressive mixing down to the 
surface with gusts in the 20-25 kt range being reported. Models 
indicate increasing low level convergence and orographic lift as the 
front moves into extreme NE TN and SW VA. Expect to see a moderate 
increase in shower coverage but still only have around a 30-40 
percent chance for extreme NE TN and SW VA. The frontal passage is 
forecast to occur later this evening with strong cold air advection 
behind the boundary late tonight into Wednesday. Temperatures will 
be noticeably colder by Wednesday morning with lows in the upper 20s 
to mid 30s. Winds will remain elevated overnight into Wednesday 
morning with wind chills in the upper teens to mid 20s for most 
locations. Winds are forecast to be high enough for a wind advisory 
for the East Tennessee Mountains. These locations will experience 
wind gusts of up to 45 mph leading to single digit wind chills on 
Wednesday morning in the high terrain.

Cold air advection surges into the area late tonight into early 
Wednesday with northwesterly winds of 20-30 kts at 850 mb. 
Concurrently, a lobe of vorticity at 500mb will swing across the 
central and southern Appalachians. Models indicate some lingering 
shallow low-level moisture during this timeframe with low level lift 
as well. Due to this, there could be a few snow showers across the 
higher elevations of NE TN and SW VA but confidence is not overly 
high with the shallow nature of the moisture. Expect any snowfall 
accumulations would be limited to locations above 4 kft and would be 
less than an inch.

Highs will be much colder on Wednesday with strong cold air 
advection continuing. It will be a rather blustery days with strong 
northwest winds and highs only in the mid 30s to low 40s for most 
locations.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...The weak clipper 
pattern with northwest flow and cold air advection could still 
produce a couple tenths of an inch of snow accumulation in the 
highest reaches of the mountains across extreme Northeast Tennessee 
Wednesday night before moisture and lift exits the region. Despite 
the return of sunshine on Thursday, the prevailing northerly flow 
will limit warming with high temperatures remaining a good ten 
degrees below normal. Short wave ridging builds into the area on 
Friday allowing for a little more warming sunshine after a cold 
start to the day. However, clouds will be spreading back into the 
Southeastern United States ahead of a weekend low pressure system 
that will bring light rain to much of the southern part of the 
forecast area later Friday night into Saturday morning. Winter 
precipitation is possible over northern sections with emphasis in 
the higher terrain as low level east to northeasterly flow should 
produce a temperature profile that keeps sub-freezing air in place 
during this late night period into Saturday morning. At this time, 
the main lift and deepest moisture with this system will arrive 
during an approximate twelve hour period later Saturday afternoon 
into Saturday night.  This would also coincide with the period of 
strongest warm air advection and a changeover to rain in all but the 
highest terrain. On Sunday, a trailing area of lift and moisture 
with a final upper level wave could get some snow showers going 
again in the higher terrain areas; especially across Southwest 
Virginia and Northeast Tennessee. This prevailing northwest flow 
pattern may last into Monday morning in the mountains before ending. 
This event is still five to six days away and several significant 
changes are possible in the system's track and surface low position 
with corresponding temperature structure changes from today's 
modeling depiction. However, a possibility for significant snow 
exists for our mountain locales due to the antecedent cold air that 
will likely be in place above three thousand feet. Drier air finally 
builds back into the forecast area for Monday night and Tuesday with 
high temperatures at least approaching normal for mid January.

.DISCUSSION...

A cold front is still back to the west of the forecast area. 
Temperatures are currently in the 50s with widespread cloud cover 
ahead of the surface boundary. The 12z sounding from KOHX and 
forecast model soundings indicate that the moisture ahead of the 
boundary is rather shallow and limited to below 750 mb or so. 
Current radar imagery, indicates a few light showers but coverage is 
rather sparse. For the rest of today, expect isolated light showers 
across the forecast area with best chances for precipitation in the 
higher elevations where there will be additional orographic lift as 
the front approaches later this afternoon and evening. Elsewhere, 
models indicate that the dry air aloft could actually mix down to 
the surface. Due to the low confidence, have kept PoPs generally 
around 20 percent except for locations in northeast Tennessee and 
southwest Virginia where there is slightly better confidence. Cold 
air will sweep into the area tonight with strong cold air advection 
behind the departing front.

Additionally, it looks like northwesterly winds behind the front
will be strong enough to issue a wind advisory for the East
Tennessee Mountains for late this evening into Wednesday
afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

It was mostly cloudy this morning across the forecast area and 
temperatures were generally in the 40s and 50s. 

Near zonal flow aloft early with a shortwave poised to swing across 
Kentucky this afternoon. This feature will push a cold front across 
region from this afternoon through early evening. With increased low-
level moisture a few light showers cannot be ruled out with the most 
favorable areas being along the mountains and adjacent foothills. 
Also, winds will increase this afternoon in concert with the 
shortwave and frontal passage. Winds will be gusty at times. Believe 
that the highest winds/gusts will occur between 6 and 9 pm ET and 
will be strongest across the higher terrain. Coordinating with 
surrounding offices - at this time, will hold off on a 2nd period 
wind advisory. Afternoon temperatures will be well above normal 
again today (although cooler than yesterday).

Behind the cold front, skies will clear after sunset, however, 
higher winds expected overnight should allow temperatures to be 
several degrees above seasonal normals, albeit much colder than the 
past several days.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Tuesday)...

The extended range fcst period tips off on Wednesday morning amidst 
a CAA regime as nwly flow prevails in the wake of a trough/front 
passage.  This orthogonal nwly flow will bank against the west side 
of the Appalachians on Wednesday afternoon with enough moisture to 
favor light snow showers, likely lasting overnight into Thursday 
morning.  Given available but limited qpf, think accumulations will 
be rather light and confined to locales above 3500ft.  

Moving on, a couple dry/cold days in store to end the work week as 
Canadian high pressure settles across the OH/TN valley regions, 
while an upper system and associated surface cyclogenesis exits the 
lower Rockies and pushes into the southern Plains.  Upglide moisture 
out ahead looks to spread into the lower TN valley and southern 
Appalachians overnight into Saturday morning, with thermal profiles 
possibly favoring a wintry mix of precipitation until mid/late 
morning when WAA prevails.  As the weekend evolves the upper low 
will move nearly overhead and the surface cyclone will slide by to 
the south. The eventual track of this system will determine 
resultant sensible weather across east TN and southwest VA/NC. 
Nevertheless, the pattern does look like it could yield some notable 
winter weather across the fcst area Saturday and Sunday, however 
with the details yet to be determined.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...

The main forecast challenges for the short term are temperatures, 
wind, and rain chances tonight and tomorrow. In the upper levels,
the eastern CONUS is under the influence of upper level ridging, 
while a trough digs into the upper Mississippi river valley. At 
the surface, high pressure was located over the southeast while an
area of low pressure progresses across the Great Lakes. At the 
same time, a cold front associated with the aforementioned surface
low extended south into Southern Plains. GOES water vapor/airmass
RGB data shows moisture continuing to stream aloft across the 
Southern Plains, and into the Mid South and Ohio Valley out ahead
of this surface front. The front will continue to slowly move 
eastward with time overnight with a slight increase in cloud cover
and precipitation chances. Not expecting heavy rainfall as the 
upper level dynamics remain weak, and overall moisture is limited.
In fact, it will likely take some time to moisten the column 
enough for rainfall to reach the surface as the 12z KOHX sounding
indicated the mid and low levels of the atmosphere to be very 
dry. Model soundings overnight do not really moisten the column 
sufficiently until the 03-06z time frame when low end chance PoP's
are introduced into the forecast. Low temperatures will be tough 
to forecast given the amount of cloud cover, and the fact that the
boundary layer never fully decouples under the WWA regime. Given 
this environment, steered away from any guidance that utilized a 
cooler MOS scenario. 

Tuesday remains cloudy as low level moisture looks to stick around
ahead of a 850mb thermal trough. However, additional mixing ahead
of the approaching front will likely keep maximum temperatures in
the upper 50's to low 60's. Would not be surprised to see drizzle
tomorrow as well given the magnitude of dry air above the
saturated low layer. The pressure gradient begins to tighten ahead
of the approaching frontal boundary tomorrow with an increase in
winds expected. The overnight shift will evaluate the need for a
wind advisory tomorrow.  

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...

Main story for the long term portion of the forecast will be the 
return of cooler weather behind the cold front. Temperatures will 
drop a bit below normal for this time of year, and look to remain 
that way into next week.

On Tuesday and Wednesday breezy conditions will continue as strong 
850mb winds continue out of the northwest behind the front. Since 
winds will be out of the northwest we're not expecting a mountain 
wave event on the West side of the mountains, but nonetheless winds 
may flirt with advisory criteria in the highest elevations.

As the drier air continues to flow in from the northwest we enter a 
period of benign weather for the remainder of this work week and 
into the weekend. Over the weekend our next weather system will 
begin to impact the region. A trough and associated surface low will 
move across the Eastern half of the United States. Models are still 
waffling on how to handle the track of the low. Right now models are 
depicting the low to move near the Tennessee Valley sometime on 
Saturday into Sunday. Models differ with how much cold air will be 
associated with this system, which leads to a low confidence in 
precipitation type. Will need to keep an eye on this system as it 
could bring a bit of snow to a few of the Valley locations depending 
on the final strength/track.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The upper pattern this morning is highlighted by a ridge axis laid 
atop the eastern CONUS, while a region of height falls approaches 
from the west in association with a trough.  At the surface, high 
pressure over the southeast states prevails, albeit weakening with 
time as surface low pressure and the associated cold front move 
through the Plains. Mid level moisture continues to stream aloft 
across the southern Appalachians aligned with a weak warm front over 
KY/VA, which should only yield mid clouds through daybreak before 
the front lifts northward.

For Monday am expecting another fairly nice day as the aforementioned 
ridge axis moves through.  On the back side of the ridge swly flow 
will overtake the region allowing for weak waa.  Ample heating today 
should favor modest mixing, which combined with 30-40kt H85 flow 
could lead to some gusty winds across the region.  With that, the 
higher elevations of the southern Appalachians will likely 
experience gusts in the 40-50mph range at times, therefore will 
issue a wind advisory for such (again, mainly for elevations above 
3kft).  Otherwise, highs today will top out nearly 15-20 degrees 
above normal.

The weak cold front will continue to approach the region from the 
west overnight into Tuesday morning.  Thus the fcst will feature 
increasing clouds/pops into periods end, with pops topping out in 
the low end chance range. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...
A weakening cold front will be moving through the Southern 
Appalachian Region early in the extended. There is little moisture
or lift associated with this feature and expected a few isolated 
showers to slowly push across the area on Tuesday. Temperatures 
should be warm enough for all rain. The main concern with this 
system will be a strong 850MB jet that will accompany the front. 
The jet moving through the area will create occasional breezy to 
gusty winds...especially over higher elevations. An enhanced wind 
field may persist across the region through mid week. 
However...the precipitation should end Tuesday afternoon with 
cooler air and dry conditions pushing in Tuesday night into 
Wednesday. Temperatures will cool to more seasonal levels for the 
rest of the period. The dry conditions will continue through 
Friday. Models continue to have difficulty with timing and track 
of the next system moving in late in the period. Confidence 
remains low on details but the current trend should bring a round 
of showers into the area Friday night into Saturday with some 
activity lingering into Sunday. With the cooler air mass in 
place...at least the higher terrain could see a rain/snow mix as 
the system moves through.

Fog appears unlikely tonight due to 1) afternoon dewpoints that
are lower or close to forecast low temperatures, and 2) broken to
overcast cirrus clouds that are approaching the area and will
cover all sites overnight. Tomorrow, winds may be near or exceed
10 kts at CHA and TYS as a low pressure system approaches from the

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

High pressure continues to be in control of the forecast area.
Winds will remain calm for the remainder of the weekend and pick
up throughout Monday ahead of an oncoming frontal boundary. A few
areas higher in elevation could see sustained winds of 15 to 20 
mph with higher gusts on Monday afternoon. No significant precip 
is expected with the short term forecast as the front is 
forecasted to arrive late Monday night to early Tuesday morning. A
stray shower is possible late in the day on Monday for the
northern plateau, but the rest of the forecast area will remain 
dry. Temperatures will remain above seasonal averages.

.LONG TERM (Monday night through Sunday)...

Front will be moving close to the area as we start the long term 
portion of the forecast. Slight rain chances will move in Monday 
evening and continue into Tuesday. Moisture looks pretty limited 
with this front, so precipitation chances will likely remain low and 
QPF amounts will as well. Likely the biggest impact from the front 
will be gusty winds as a strong 850mb jet out of the southwest moves 
across the area. This will cause gusty winds Monday afternoon into 
monday night in the Valley. Gusty winds will continue to impact the 
higher terrain for a few days behind the front as 850mb winds remain 
elevated behind the front. 

After the front moves through temperatures drop about 15-20 degrees 
by Wednesday. This will lead to highs around normal and overnight 
lows below freezing. 

Models continue to hint at anther weather system impacting the 
Southeastern United States over the weekend, but location of 
precipitation and type of precipitation remains pretty uncertain at 
this point.

High pressure continues to dominate the forecast area but
conditions have been slower to dry than previously expected. As a
result, temperatures have been running a little cooler than
originally thought. Have lowered temperatures for the area a few
degrees in order to remain consistent with the obs, but should 
climb up steadily through the day.

302 AM EST Sun Jan 6 2019

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Deep ridging continues to strengthen across the region consequent of 
rising heights aloft and surface high pressure centered over the 
deep south.  Skies remain clear regionwide which is allowing for 
abundant radiational cooling this morning, with some patchy fog 
likely to result (especially near any water bodies).  Moving into 
Sunday, should be a fairly nice day with perhaps only some patchy 
high cirrus streaming across the area.  Nevertheless, expecting 
sunny skies with temperatures surging nearly 10 degrees above normal 
regionwide.  Meanwhile on the western periphery of the surface ridge 
a weak warm front will surge northward into the mid MS and lower OH 
valleys.  As the remainder of the forecast evolves some residual 
moisture associated with such will advect downstream across portions 
of the southern/central Appalachians into Monday morning bringing 
increasing cloudiness to the region, with no precipitation expected. 
Low temperatures Sunday night with also be around 10-12 degrees 
above normal. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...
The extended period will begin warm and dry with a ridge of high 
pressure shifting east and out of the area. As the ridge moves 
off...a cold front will move in. Models continue to show 
differences in timing but are in decent agreement with the front 
weakening as it moves in and with limited low level moisture 
available. Current trend should bring a band of scattered showers 
through Monday night with some additional lingering showers with 
the frontal passage on Tuesday. With the limited moisture...expect
precip amounts to be light and with the warm temperatures...it 
should be all snow. The only other issue with this feature will be
an 850MB jet accompanying the system. This will create breezy and
gusty winds across the area...especially over higher elevations. 
High pressure and a return to dry conditions will dominate area 
weather late Tuesday/Tuesday night through Thursday. Cooler near 
seasonal norms will also move in behind the front. Model 
consistency becomes quite poor by the end of the extended. There 
is a system expected to be approaching the area around the 
Friday/Saturday time frame. Confidence is quite low regarding 
timing or track of the system...so for now...will keep Friday dry 
and begin to bring isolated to scattered showers in Friday night 
into Saturday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

Clearing skies and mild conditions expected for the remainder of
the weekend. Temperatures are expected to run a little higher than
seasonal averages. Southeast Tennessee could see temperatures in
the low to mid 60's on Sunday. Winds continue to calm across the 
forecast area with a few gusting winds in the higher elevations 
finally dying out later in the afternoon. A few areas of patchy 
fog are possible overnight due to radiational cooling from clear 
skies but not enough confidence at this time to add to the 
forecast.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...

Warmer temperatures will continue for the first part of the work 
week as mid level ridging continues to build in from the west. The 
break from well above normal temperatures will come with a cold 
front that will sweep through he area Tuesday afternoon/night.
Moisture won't have much time to pool over our area ahead of the 
front so it doesn't look like there will be much precipitation 
associated with this frontal passage. Behind the front temperatures 
will take a dive with daytimes highs dropping from the 60's ahead of 
the front down to the 40's, and overnight lows dropping below 
freezing by the second half of the work week. 

Weather looks to remain dry behind the front and temperatures look 
to remain closer to normal through the rest of the work week and the 
weekend. Another weather system looks to zip across the southeastern 
portion of the United States at the end of the weekend, but models 
are still resolving how far north/south to take it at this time, so 
certainty is low on precipitation chances it at this time.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A nearly stacked low pressure system continued to slide 
east/northeast across the southern Appalachians this morning, 
leaving residual llv moisture and thus a few ra/sn showers in it's 
wake.  With that, thermal profiles are cooling behind the system 
favoring falling snow levels across the higher terrain of east TN. 
Thus the fcst this morning will initialize with likely pops across 
the mtn/valley regions of northeast TN and southwest VA, with 
slight/chance pops elsewhere.  Pops will taper into mid/late morning 
to below mentionable levels, holding longest at the higher peaks 
given this brief window of nwly upsloping flow.  Did continue with 
some light snow showers along the TN/NC border, however at 
subadvisory levels.  Speaking of advisory, given model progs of 
brisk nwly winds around H85, did issue a wind advisory through the 
day along the NC border zones where gusts could reach as high as 50 
mph this morning/afternoon, especially above 3kft.  Otherwise, H925 
moisture will be diminishing by midday therefore the fcst will 
feature decreasing cloudiness and temperatures at or just above 
normal levels for afternoon highs (of course this depends on timing 
of cloud cover scting).  Clear skies tonight will favor modest 
radiational cooling, however with lows fcst just above normal 
levels.  Also will not rule out some patchy valley fog overnight 
into Sunday morning.  

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...
Overall...should see a rather mild and quiet extended forecast. 
The period will begin with high pressure building in behind an 
exiting low. This will provide a dry and seasonally warm Sunday. 
Models indicate a weakening frontal boundary moving in early in 
the work week. The models are trending towards a slower...weaker 
and drier frontal passage. We could see a slight chance of showers
begin to push into western areas late Monday. The main band of 
showers should track across the region Monday night into early 
Tuesday. With the trend of drier low levels...expect the coverage 
of showers will be isolated to low end scattered and amounts 
should be light. An 850MB jet will accompany the front and this 
may create breezy and gusty winds over higher terrain late Monday 
into Monday night. Cooler...more seasonal...air will move in 
behind the front with surface high pressure slowly building in for
the mid week. This should allow for dry conditions from the end 
of the day Tuesday through Thursday. Then...models are hinting at 
the approach of the next system around the Friday/Saturday time 
frame. Models are trending this system slower as well and so for 
now...will leave things dry for Friday.

.DISCUSSION...The steadier showers are exiting extreme northeast
TN and southwest VA over the next hour, so have updated pops to
confine the likely wording to these parts of the CWA for another
hour or two. The rest of the region will have chance pops
throughout the night to account for scattered showers rotating
around the back side of the low. The one exception where pops have
been increased is in the Smoky Mountain peaks of extreme east TN.
The westerly flow combined with moist soundings will lead to
upslope showers in this region. Temperatures have dropped below
freezing in that area with Newfound Gap currently sitting at 31
degrees, so on and off snow showers are expected through the 
night across the peaks. This could accumulate 1-2 inches of snow 
by morning. Have increased QPF in the mountains and updated the 
zones to account for these changes. The precip chances greatly 
diminish after 12Z as drier air finally filters into the region. 
The rest of the forecast is on track.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
Upper low is moving across Middle Tennessee and pushing a warm
front northward across the forecast area. We're seeing a few
hundred J/kg of CAPE over the area with the warmer temperatures
today. This will allow for the development of showers, and likely
thunderstorms, this afternoon into the evening. With some of these
storms we could see some brief gusty winds and possibly small
hail. With the gusty winds under the thunderstorms and the very
saturated grounds we could see some downed trees even with sub-
severe winds. Along with these saturated soils we could see some
isolated flash flooding with a heavy thunderstorm. 

Rain and thunderstorms will come to an end from southwest to
northeast as we move into the overnight hours. Some light clearing
of skies will begin overnight into tomorrow, and we could see some
fog develop in response, especially in places that see rainfall
this afternoon/evening. 

.LONG TERM (Saturday Night through Friday)...

Finally a drying trend for the extended forecast period. The upper 
level low will be out over the Atlantic to start the extended 
forecast period with higher heights building in from the west. PW 
values will drop to below half an inch with a dry weekend forecast. 
Skies will be mostly sunny on Sunday with highs in the upper 50s to 
low 60s throughout most of the forecast area.

The ridge axis will shift to the east of the forecast area late 
Sunday into early Monday with southerly flow at the low levels ahead 
of the next approaching system. Clouds will increase throughout the 
day on Monday as an upper level trough moves through the Central 
Plains. Models have been a bit slower and drier with the evolution 
of the system and have most of the forecast area dry through the day 
on Monday with highs in the upper 50s to low 60s. The best lift and 
moisture will move into the forecast area overnight Monday into 
Tuesday as a cold front moves into the forecast area. However, 
expect rainfall amounts will be light and do not expect more than a 
tenth of an inch of rainfall at this time with this system. The 
upper level trough is fairly progressive and drier air will return 
to the forecast area late Tuesday into Wednesday. Cold and dry air 
advection will advect into the forecast area behind the departing 
system. Temperatures through the end of the week will remain closer 
to normal with highs in the 40s and lows generally in the 30s. The 
next chance of rain looks to arrive with another progressive system 
just beyond the end of the long-term forecast period.

Still looking at a fairly restrictive taf period. Predominate
moist upglide region slowly shifting east, however shra remains
favored at all sites through at least late morning as the warm
front has yet to pass. Cigs/visb will remain in the MVFR/IFR 
range through mid/late morning. Current nly winds will veer sly by
late morning as the warm front passes with shra prevailing and 
cigs possibly lifting to MVFR levels regionwide, maybe low VFR at 
TYS/TRI. CAM models continue to suggest steepened lapse rates and 
thus chances for tsra this afternoon. Probs look best at TYS 
therefore only added VCTS for that terminal, however wouldn't be

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The pattern through the short term will be highlighted by the closed 
upper low atop the ArkLaTex region, and the consequent surface low 
and frontal complex beneath and eastward along the lower MS valley. 
With that, a warm front continues to slowly move northward toward 
the I20 corridor at this time, however with abundant llv upglide 
further north into the lower TN valley.  Light rain continues across 
much of the southern tier of the fcst area, only to spread 
regionwide over the coming hours.  

As the warm front finally moves into the southern Appalachians after 
sunrise, a narrow H85 jet will traverse the region leading to modest 
gusting upward of 45-50mph at elevations greater than 3kft across 
the Smokies. Therefore the current wind advisory looks good with no 
changes planned. Precipitation rates will likely increase along the 
passing warm front as it spreads northward through mid/late morning, 
briefly lowering behind as the upper low and surface cold front 
approach.  Downsloping flow amidst the aforementioned sly llj with 
aid in localized drying closer to the terrain as well into the 
afternoon hours.  

As the cold front and upper low sweep in, the combination of frontal 
forcing and steepened lapse rates aloft will favor at least chances 
for a few thunderstorms, especially along/east of I75.  All in all 
the forecast features widespread likely/categorical pops this 
morning, tapering a bit into the early afternoon hours before 
ramping back up along the front when some thunder is mentioned. As 
for hazards today, other than the above mentioned high elevation 
winds, think most convection will be rather weak.  However, given 
saturated soils across much of the area, any modest thunderstorms 
this afternoon could produce 35-40mph wind gusts which could topple 
a few trees.  Some isolated flash flooding cannot be ruled out as 
well, especially along/north of I40 and along the I81 corridor into 
southwest VA where flash flood guidance is lowest. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...
An upper low will be pulling away from the Southern Appalachian 
Region Saturday morning but a few lingering pockets of light rain 
will continue to affect the area...mainly over the eastern half of
the CWA. Higher elevations should be cold enough for 
snow...though little to no additional accumulation is expected. 
High pressure builds in behind the exiting low for dry and 
seasonally warm conditions through the rest of the weekend. The 
mainly system of concern through the extended will be a cold front
progged to move through the area around the Monday/Monday night 
time frame. As the front moves through...expected a broken line of
showers to develop and track through the area. The air mass will 
be fairly stable and do not anticipate any thunder. Also...the 
temperature profile will be warm enough that it should be an all 
rain event. Accompanying the front will be a strong 850MB jet 
which should generate breezy and gusty winds across the higher 
elevations. A few showers may linger into Tuesday as the low pulls
out. Then...we should return to a quiet and dry weather pattern 
for the rest of the extended as high pressure once again builds 
in.

.DISCUSSION...Issued a Wind Advisory from 10-18Z for the Smokies
and adjacent foothills. Latest NAM-12 plan view and forecast
soundings indicate southerly 50 knot 850 mb winds peaking around
12Z. This will lead to some advisory level gusts around 45 mph in
the normally windy locations of the mountains. The window for
these gusty winds will be short because the direction will change
to more of a westerly component behind a cold front in the early
afternoon. The other change was to pops for tonight. Delayed the
onset of higher pops until after 06Z to account for a slower
advancement of the rain shield. The latest radar mosaic shows that
most of the steady rain is still back over Alabama and
Mississippi, so think it will take a few more hours to reach our
southern counties. The remainder of the forecast is on track.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
The closed low pressure system over the Red River Valley today will 
be tracking nearly due east through the period, bringing yet another 
round of moderate rainfall to the area. Isentropic lift in the warm 
sector of the cyclone will begin to spread rain into SE TN this 
evening, mainly between 03-06Z, and gradually spread northward. As 
850 mb winds back in response to the approaching low, the downslope 
component will increase and may delay precip in the northern half 
until late tonight. Frontogenetic forcing in the jet exit region 
will provide stronger lift for heavier precip rates in the 06-12Z 
time frame, and some locally heavy rain will be possible. QPF 
amounts will be highest in southern sections, between 1 and 1.25 
inches total. This is well below flash flood guidance for this area, 
so no flood watch will be necessary at this time, although localized 
minor flooding in the usual places will be possible. 

From 12-18Z tomorrow we will have drying aloft as the upper jet 
moves over the area, decreasing precip amounts and coverage. 
Southeasterly 850 mb winds will peak during this time, which will be 
in the 40-50 kt range, and may necessitate a Wind Advisory on later 
shifts, although it looks marginal at this time. The downslope 
winds may warm temps in the northern Valley and Foothills into the
lower 60s depsite abundant cloud cover. The center of the closed 
low moving directly overhead Friday afternoon will bring 
steepening lapse rates, and a slight chance of thunderstorms will 
be mentioned with this across the northern half of the area. As 
cold advection sets in late in the day, freezing levels will drop 
quickly after 00Z, allowing for a change to snow for higher 
elevations. Model soundings indicate that this will be mainly at 
or above 2500 ft elevation. Up to 1 inch accumulation may be 
possible Friday night for the highest peaks of the Smokies and NE 
TN mountains. Gusty W-NW winds will develop overnight as the 
system exits.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
Two main points of focus for this period: 1) Minor focus on any 
residual wintry precip the first few hours of the forecast 
Saturday morning and 2) see if there are any threats associated 
with the frontal passage early next week. 

For Saturday morning, conditions dry out very quickly, so only looks 
like about 2-3 hours of light snow showers in the higher elevations. 
My snow grid shows only a few pixels of 0.1" for Saturday morning. 
So no real further contribution to any early accumulations.

For the Front early next week--it looks to be racing through around 
next Monday night.  Doesn't look like there will be any instability, 
so will not introduce any thunder, and the showers associated with 
the front should sweep through pretty quickly.  Will have POPs 
Monday afternoon, Monday night, and Tuesday, but that is mainly a 
timing issue of when the front will pass through--the actual precip 
time with the front will likely only be an hour or two as the band 
of showers marches through--a little wider band and longer 
precip time north vs. south.

Monday afternoon the pressure gradient will be getting pretty tight, 
inducing a moderate to strong deep southwest flow up the valley. The 
angle is not good for a mountain wave event, but it is good for a 
gusty flow up the valley, and might be as high as advisory level 
Monday afternoon--we'll keep watching.  

Other than these two time periods, it should be drying out somewhat 
with below average precipitation for a change, and looking like 
temperatures will be notably above seasonal averages as well.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...This morning begins with a band
of showers pushing east across the Southern Appalachian Region.
The rain should exit the area during the morning hours with a
brief dry period expected for the afternoon. We will remain mostly
cloudy through the day and temperatures will continue to be mild
for this time of year with highs generally in the mid 40s to low
50s. We will then transition quickly back of a wet pattern tonight
as a low pressure system approaches the area. Rain will spread
from south to north during the night with POPs reaching likely to
categorical over much of the area. Overnight lows will be in the
mid 30 to mid 40s range at most locations.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...The upper level low 
approaching from the west will swing across our area Friday and 
Friday night.  We will see showers across the entire area on Friday. 
Some weak elevated convective energy may support a rumble or two of 
thunder, but looks like primarily just showers Friday.  Models 
continue to show the southeast low level jet strengthening on 
Friday, and there may be some mountain wave enhancement of the winds 
in the usual locations although for now it looks too marginal for 
any high wind watch.  A wind advisory may need to be issued as the 
event draws closer.  Colder air will move in Friday night as the 
core of the upper low moves across, and there may be some snow 
mixing in across the higher elevations of the mountains. Still looks 
like any accumulations will be light and confined to the highest 
elevations. Drier air will move in Saturday as high pressure builds 
across the region.  The next chance for rain looks to be Monday 
night into Tuesday as a cold front pushes through. Models have been 
struggling with the timing of this front so timing confidence is 
low.  Drier air will work in behind the front for Wednesday. 
Temperatures will generally be near to above normal for the long 
term period.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Initial precip associated with midlevel isentropicl lift has been 
light due to evaporation through a dry subcloud layer. Precip will 
expand through the evening as low level forcing strengthens and the 
column saturates, associated with an 850-700 mb convergence zone 
across N GA and western NC. Southern portions of the area will have 
the greatest QPF amounts tonight, peaking between 03-09Z, with 
amounts around 1 inch expected in SE TN and SW NC through Thursday 
morning. Rain will begin to exit Thursday morning as a 700 mb 
shortwave trough moves through and pushes the convergence zone 
farther east and bringing some drying aloft.  The afternoon should 
be dry with decreasing clouds, however a weak north to northwesterly 
low level flow will likely not be adequate to clear out low clouds 
entirely. The high temps forecast will depend on how much clearing 
occurs, which is uncertain, but will lean on the cool side of 
guidance as low clouds often get trapped in place by the mountains 
and an inversion aloft.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
At the beginning of this period the next round of precip will be 
heading toward the area with the precip spreading across the area 
late tomorrow night and continuing into Friday and Friday night, 
then finally exiting for Saturday, leaving is with a mostly dry 
weekend.  Then another system moves into the area around Monday 
night.

With this first system there will be a pretty intense upper low that 
moves across the area Friday and into Friday evening.  Looks like 
thunder-level instability will be kept south of us, so will just go 
with showers.  With the approach of this low, a marginal mountain 
wave event looks to be setting up in the southern Appalachians--
right now, looking more like the threat for winds would be only 
advisory level, but will keep a watch on it.  Also, as the core of 
this upper low goes across--in the mountains there will likely be a 
short-lived mixing or changeover to snow--looking right now that 
this would be limited to probably 4000 feet or higher, and kind of 
limited by the upper cold pool. Right now, snow grids only have some 
pixels in the highest elevations of the Appalachian chain.  

By Sunday an upper ridge builds in, then by Monday night a good 
return flow has set up ahead of the next cold front and deep lift 
and moisture will be set up as well as the front approaches. Pretty 
good agreement that this front will be moving along pretty quickly, 
so timing of front is not exact, but thinking that moisture will 
sweep out of here pretty quickly behind front.  

One last look at QPF for Thursday night and early Friday, thinking 
flood threat is somewhat limited this far north.  Will see what 
Flash Flood Guidance numbers look like after this first round of 
rain.

.AVIATION...
Light rain will spread across the area through the afternoon,
however vis and cigs will initially remain VFR as the rain falls
from a midlevel cloud deck into drier air below. Low level
moistening will occur this evening, lowering cigs and vis to MVFR
followed by IFR toward midnight. Rain is expected to taper off
around 12Z in the morning, with some MVFR clouds remaining in
place at all sites until the end of the TAF period.

.DISCUSSION...
An update will be issued to account for the earlier arrival of
precip in southern sections than reflected in the forecast.
Although the 12Z OHX sounding shows a dry layer between 900 and
650 mb, and surface obs vs. radar indicates quite a bit of 
evaporation occurring, rain will likely be reaching the ground at
CHA in the next few hours. With overcast cloud cover also expected
through the day, a slight downward adjustment will be made to high
temps.

.AVIATION...Patchy fog and persistent low clouds mainly 
affecting TRI this morning.  The fog will lift by mid morning but 
overall...expect deteriorating conditions today.   A frontal 
boundary to our south will lift north as a short wave moves through 
the upper flow.  The result will be widespread showers spreading 
from southwest to northeast across the area late today and through 
the overnight hours.  This will create IFR/MVFR conditions with 
occasional LIFR conditions possible.  Winds should remain fairly 
light through the TAF period...generally staying below 10 KTs.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...We will transition into a wet
period during the short term. The overall weather pattern has a
frontal boundary positioned to our south. A short wave moving
through flow aloft along the boundary will lift northward in the
MRX CWA. This will increase low level moisture and eventually
bring widespread showers through the area. The showers will begin
to reach into far southern locations early this afternoon and push
north through the day into the evening hours. POPs will reach high
likely to categorical overnight. With PWs averaging over an
inch...expect the main threat will be the potential for locally 
heavy rainfall. This...combined with an already wet ground...could
produce some localized minor flooding and increased river levels.
Temperatures for today and tonight will remain rather mild for 
this time of year.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...There may be a 
lingering shower early Thursday, but drier air will work in as weak 
surface high pressure builds across the area.  Another round of 
showers can be expected to begin working in Thursday night into 
Friday as a mid/upper level low to our west advances east. Models 
continue to trend warmer with this upper low as it moves across our 
area Friday night, so it appears that if there is any snow it will 
be mainly in the higher elevations.  Will continue to mention this 
snow possibility in HWO, but right now the threat of significant 
snow looks to be quite low. While models are not in great agreement 
yet and it looks marginal at this time, there continues to be some 
potential for mountain wave enhanced winds Friday as this system 
approaches.  Will mention wind potential in HWO as well. Once this 
system moves off to our east Saturday, drier air and high pressure 
should be in control through Monday, then another system may bring 
some showers on Tuesday. Temperatures will generally be near to 
above normal during the entire period.

.AVIATION...Low level moisture remains in place across the Southern 
Appalachian Region tonight.  This will result in widespread low 
clouds providing a mix of MVFR to low VFR conditions. 
Additionally...patchy fog is expected to develop overnight and may 
generate some reduction in VIS at local TAF sites.  On Wednesday...a 
frontal boundary that is positioned to our south will be lifted 
northward as a short wave rides along the upper flow.  This will 
allow scattered showers to spread from southwest to northeast across 
the area this afternoon and evening and will lower the cloud deck to 
IFR/MVFR.

.DISCUSSION...
Overall the current fcst looks pretty good. Made a few minor
tweaks to t/td/sky trends to align with recent obs. Did issue an
SPS for patchy dense fog across the US 64 corridor region of
southeast TN and southwest NC where some sites are already
reporting visb less than 1/2sm. Dewpoint depressions are rather 
low across the remainder of the area as well, thus did bump up the
patchy fog wording overall. A dense fog advisory may be needed toward
early/mid morning, however at this time confidence in 
location/coverage is too low. Otherwise, no sig changes 
needed/made with this update.

.AVIATION...
A mixture of VFR and MVFR conditions expected through this taf
cycle given persistent llv moisture and swly flow aloft.
Initialized all tafs at sct low VFR amidst light nly winds, 
however wouldn't be shocked to see occasional MVFR cigs this 
afternoon/evening. The uncertainty continues overnight as any 
scting of low clouds and dry air aloft will favor fog 
development. Guidance tends to favor CHA/TRI as the most likely 
candidates, therefore such was included with only 6sm at TYS (for
now). A weak wave will ride along the old frontal axis across the
deep south and move into the TN valley region on Wednesday, 
therefore favored deteriorating conditions with vcsh/shra and MVFR
cigs amidst backed sly/vrb flow.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...
Moisture stream to our south will stay south overnight, then will
buckle back northward Wednesday as a closed low over the desert 
southwest ejects a disturbance into TX that shifts the southern 
jet northward back toward our area. Rainfall amounts will be light
Wednesday, and temps will remain mild. 

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
On Wednesday night the much talked about southwestern upper low will 
be moving east into Texas. Meanwhile a northern stream trough will 
depart the upper midwest and move east towards New England. Rain 
should be rapidly expanding to the northeast across the forecast 
area during the late evening hours on Wednesday as broad ascent and 
a coupled subtropical and polar jet is in place overhead. Rain 
should taper off during the early morning hours on Thursday however 
as the northern stream trough pulls off the eastern seaboard and jet 
support wanes. Subsequent shortwave ridging will develop to the east 
of the upper low, still over central Texas by this time, to develop 
over the eastern Tennessee region. Expect much of Thursday to be dry 
as a result of this evolution, with rain not likely to spread back 
into the area until early Friday morning when the upper low nears.

Ahead of this feature, some downslope flow over the mountains 
develop. Don't expect winds to get to high wind levels by any 
stretch as H85 flow is sub 50kt at the peak. However wind advisory 
criteria may be reached in the higher terrain. Will watch how this 
progresses to see if any wind headlines will be needed. The more 
significant reason for bringing this up is that the upper low, and 
mid level low, swings through middle Tennessee and then up into 
southwest Virginia Friday into Friday night. This leaves our CWA in 
a downslope pattern, with some rain shadowing becoming a strong 
possibility as a result. Forecast PoPs as well as QPF amounts favor 
a mountain bias, with lesser values over the valley. This entire 
system pulls off to the northeast by late Saturday morning, bringing 
rain chances to an end. Guidance has trended warmer for several 
consecutive runs now with respect to mid level temperatures. Will 
still carry a rain/snow mix for mainly elevated locations Friday 
night. But given the trends, do not expect there to be a lot of snow 
with this.

High pressure and a warming trend will round out the weekend, with 
the chance for another system to impact the area late Monday night 
into Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A few showers will linger over
the Southern Appalachian Region into the morning hours as frontal
system slowly exits the area. Low level moisture will remain in
place and some low clouds will persist for much of the day.
Otherwise...we will be between systems for the short term and
after the few morning showers exit the area...expect generally dry
conditions for the rest of today and through the night.
Additionally as the system pulls away...winds will continue to
decrease. Temperatures will remain above normal through the short
term with highs today reaching into the 50s and low 60s and lows
tonight mainly in the 30s and low 40s.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...We will continue to be in 
southwest flow aloft to start the period, with a stationary frontal 
boundary to our south. This front will begin advancing as a warm 
front on Wednesday, with an area of isentropic lift moving in from 
the south.  Will see a dry start, but some rain will begin moving in 
from south to north during the day, and will overspread the entire 
area Wed night. There should be lull in the precipitation during 
much of Thursday as somewhat drier air works in, but another round 
of showers can be expected by Thursday night into Friday as a 
mid/upper level low to our west advances east. Models have trended 
warmer with this upper low as it moves across our area Friday night, 
so right now it looks like if there is any snow it will be mainly in
