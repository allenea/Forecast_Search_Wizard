315 PM EST SAT DEC 31 2005

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS IN CONTROL 
OF AREA WEATHER TONIGHT FOR CONTINUED DRY CONDITIONS. ON SUNDAY... 
CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INVADE THE MRX CWA FROM WEST TO EAST AS A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM APPROACHES THE AREA. WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES NEAR 
GUIDANCE. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS REMAIN IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE EVOLUTION AND PROGRESSION OF A STRONG LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE PLAINS SUNDAY NIGHT. ITS ASSOCIATED STRONG 
WARM FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY 
NIGHT...WITH BOTH THE NAM AND GFS MODELS NOW REVEALING MORE 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT AHEAD OF IT (COMPARED TO THEIR PREVIOUS 
RUNS). THIS APPEARS TO BE THE RESULT OF MORE ELEVATED INSTABILITY 
EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE WARM FRONT. THUS...WILL INCREASE 
POPS SUNDAY NIGHT AND ADD A MENTION OF TSTORMS. WITH LOW WET BULB 
ZERO HEIGHTS...THIS ELEVATED INSTABILITY MAY LEAD TO THE POSSIBILITY 
OF LARGE HAIL WITH A FEW TSTORMS OVER SOUTHEAST TN AND CENTRAL EAST 
TN. 

ON MONDAY...INSTABILITY WILL INCREASE AND BECOME MORE SURFACE BASED 
AS DEWPOINTS AND TEMPS RISE (TO UNSEASONABLY WARM LEVELS) BEHIND THE 
PASSAGE OF THE WARM FRONT. A COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO BE OVER THE 
WESTERN TN RIVER VALLEY AROUND SUNRISE...AND WILL SLOWLY MOVE EAST 
DURING THE DAY. A DRY SLOT WILL LIKELY DEVELOP MONDAY MORNING OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA AFTER THE WARM FRONTAL PASSAGE AND BEFORE THE COLD 
FRONT ARRIVES. LATEST GFS AND NAM MODEL RUNS BOTH CONTINUE TO REVEAL 
A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS DEVELOPING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA... 
BUT BOTH MODELS NOW GENERATE LESS CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ALONG THIS 
COLD FRONT. FEEL THIS IS THE RESULT OF A CONVECTIVE PARAMETERIZATION 
PROBLEM IN THE MODELS CAUSED BY THE EARLIER WARM FRONTAL CONVECTION. 
WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS IN PLACE...COMBINED WITH STRONG 
WIND DYNAMICS (AS AN UPPER TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE MS RIVER 
VALLEY)...FEEL THAT THIS SCENARIO SHOULD RESULT IN A SEVERE WEATHER 
OUTBREAK WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SUPERCELLS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
ON MONDAY. WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT TO ADDRESS 
THIS POSSIBILITY.

ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM QUICKLY MOVES ACROSS THE MIDWEST ON 
WEDNESDAY...BRINGING ANOTHER COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. 
LATEST GFS MODEL RUN CONTINUES TO REVEAL A DRY FRONTAL PASSAGE...BUT 
WILL MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS ON WEDNESDAY. A DEEPER AND 
MORE PERSISTENT UPPER TROUGH IS THEN PROGGED TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY WED NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. THUS...WILL CONTINUE TO 
MENTION A CHANCE OF PRECIP THROUGHOUT MOST OF THIS PERIOD. TEMPS 
SHOULD COOL CLOSER TO NORMAL BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH 
THE MRX CWA TONIGHT. AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE...WE WILL SEE AN INCREASE 
IN WINDS AND A BAND OF SHOWERS MOVE THROUGH THE AREA. TEMPERATURE 
PROFILE IS SUCH THAT SHOWERS SHOULD REMAIN AS RAIN THROUGHOUT. THE 
SHOWERS WILL LINGER OVER THE AREA...MAINLY OVER EASTERN ZONES INTO 
SATURDAY MORNING. THE FRONT WILL EXIT THE AREA BY MORNING...WITH THE 
TROUGH AXIS SWINGING THROUGH AND FLOW ALOFT BECOMING NORTHWESTERLY. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
IS PROGGED TO BUILD OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY...WITH ZONAL 
FLOW ALOFT. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN QUIET AND MILD CONDITIONS FOR THE 
BEGINNING OF THE NEW YEAR. MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH A 
QUICKER PROGRESSION OF A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE MIDWEST 
ON MONDAY. IT NOW APPEARS THAT SHOWERS WILL BEGIN TO DEVELOP ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT SUNDAY NIGHT. AN UNSEASONABLY WARM 
AND MOIST AIRMASS WILL BE ADVECTED NORTHWARD INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT. LATEST GFS AND NAM MODEL RUNS BOTH INDICATE A 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS DEVELOPING ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY... 
WITH STRONG WIND DYNAMICS ALSO EXPECTED AS AN UPPER TROUGH AMPLIFIES 
OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY. THIS SCENARIO COULD RESULT IN AN ACTIVE 
SEVERE WEATHER DAY ON MONDAY. 

ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM QUICKLY MOVES AGAIN ACROSS THE MIDWEST 
ON WEDNESDAY...BRINGING ANOTHER COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN CONTINUES TO REVEAL A DRY FRONTAL 
PASSAGE...BUT A DEEPER AND MORE PERSISTENT UPPER TROUGH IS PROGGED 
TO LINGER ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS WED NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. AS A 
RESULT...WILL INCLUDE A CHANCE OF PRECIP THROUGHOUT MOST OF THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LOW CURRENTLY OVER CENTRAL 
OHIO WITH ASSOCIATED TROF SHIFTING TO THE EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA 
WILL BRING A SHOT AT SOME WRAP AROUND SHOWERS AND LATER A FEW SNOW 
FLURRIES.  DO NOT THINK ANY OF THIS WILL AMOUNT TO MUCH EXCEPT 
POSSIBLY A DUSTING AT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  MOST OF THE PRECIP 
SHOULD BE ENDING BY EARLY EVENING THEN CLOUDS SHOULD BEGIN TO 
DISCIPATE BY LATE TONIGHT.  NOT ANY BIG DIFFERENCES TO GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS BUT LEANED TOWARDS WARMER MAV NUMBERS. 


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE FAST PARADE OF WEATHER 
SYSTEMS CONTINUES FOR THESE PERIODS...IN FACT THE BREAK BETWEEN 
TODAYS SYSTEM AND THE NEXT FOR FRIDAY NIGHT LOOKS SHORTER THIS 
MODEL RUN.  BIG DIFFERENCES ARE THAT BOTH THE SURFACE AND UPPER LOW 
WILL BE MUCH FURTHER NORTH...LEADING TO MUCH LESS DYNAMICS AND  
LIMITED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION IN ADVANCE OF THE WEAK TRAILING 
COLD FRONT.  DEWPOINT TEMPS LOOK TO NOT REACH ABOVE THE MID 30S TO 
LOWER 40S...AND THE COLD FRONT SHOULD ARRIVE AROUND 12Z SAT.  THIS 
SHOULD ALL HINDER THE POTENTIAL FOR ANY THUNDERSTORMS...BUT THERE 
WAS A HINT OF ELEVATED INSTABILITY...SO I KEPT IN SLIGHT CHANCE 
WORDING FOR THUNDER LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY MORNING.

ALONG THE GA BORDER STRONG INSTABILITY AND BACKED WINDS ARE KEEPING 
CONVECTION VERY WELL ORGANIZED.  

SPC GRAPHICS ARE SHOWING GOOD CHANCES OF MID LEVEL ROTATION...BUT 
MUCH LESS CHANCES OF ORGANIZED LOW LEVEL CIRCULATIONS.  CLOSE LOOK 
DOESNT SHOW ANY SURFACE BOUNDARIES AHEAD OF THE CONVECTIVE 
LINE...SO LOW LEVEL CIRCULATIONS WOULD MAY HAVE TO DEPEND ON LOCAL

MOISTURE OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY WITH SOME BREAKS IN THE

AS THE COLD POOL ALOFT MOVES ACROSS TODAY...WBZ WILL BE QUITE LOW
(AROUND 6 KFT OR LESS) WITH A FAIRLY STRONG LOW LEVEL JET (35-45 KNOTS).
LATEST NAM CAPES AND LIFTED INDICES SUGGEST ATMOSPHERE WILL BE
UNSTABLE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. ALSO...NAM

LATEST SWOMCD...STATES THAT A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH MAY BE REQUIRED
SOON. MAIN CONCERN IS LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING STRAIGHT LINE WINDS. 
SHEAR PROFILE ALSO SUPPORTS SUPERCELL DEVELOPMENT AND ROTATION WITH 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING STORMS AS WELL...WHICH WILL ENHANCE UPDRAFT.

WILL CONTINUE MENTIONING OF LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS THIS 
EVENING. AFTER FROPA...NAM SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF LOW STRATU-CU MOVING
ACROSS THE REGION OVERNIGHT AND THURSDAY. ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
AND UPSLOPE FLOW TO SCATTERED SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY HIGHER ELEVATIONS
TONIGHT AND THURSDAY MORNING. TEMPERATURE PROFILE BECOMES COLD ENOUGH
FOR PRECIPITATION TO CHANGE TO SNOW FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN. SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS UP TO 1 INCH POSSIBLE FOR ELEVATIONS 4 KFT OR MORE.

LOW CLOUDS AND COLD NORTHWEST WINDS WILL PRODUCE A RAW DAY FOR THURSDAY
WITH LITTLE IF ANY TEMPERATURE RISE.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE 
MOVES THROUGH THE AREA THU NGT AND EARLY FRI. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
MOVES EAST ACRS THE LOWER GRTLKS EARLY WEEKEND. BEST CHC OF PCPN 
WILL BE EARLY SAT BEFORE FRONT SWINGS INTO S APPALACHIANS. GOOD WARM 
UP BEGINS SUN AND CONTINUES THROUGH MON AS SLOW MOVING SYSTEM 
APPROACHES FROM W. BEST PCPN CHCS WITH THIS SYSTEM LATE MON/EARLY 
TUE. ANOTHER LOW FOLLOWS SUITE WITH A FRONT APPROACHING LATE WED. 
CONFIDENCE TOO LOW ON TIMING SO HAVE LEFT THAT DAY DRY FOR NOW.

.DISCUSSION...
DEEP UPPER TROUGH ACROSS ILLINOIS WILL MOVE EAST OVER THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE
VALLEYS TODAY AND TONIGHT. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED ACROSS MIDDLE
TENNESSEE TO EXTREME NORTHWEST ALABAMA WITH STRONG SOUTHERLY WINDS
AHEAD OF THE FRONT PULLING SURFACE DEWPOINTS INTO THE 50S OVER
ALABAMA AND SOUTHERN MIDDLE TENNESSEE. THE BOUNDARY LAYER JET WILL INCREASE
THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY WITH SOME
BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS ANTICIPATED AS WELL TO DESTABILIZE THE AIRMASS.

AS THE COLD POOL ALOFT MOVES ACROSS TODAY...WBZ WILL BE QUITE LOW
(AROUND 6 KFT OR LESS) WITH A FAIRLY STRONG LOW LEVEL JET (35-45 KNOTS).
LATEST NAM CAPES AND LIFTED INDICES SUGGEST ATMOSPHERE WILL BE
UNSTABLE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. ALSO...NAM
SHOWS FORECAST AREA UNDER FAVORED LEFT FRONT QUADRANT OF UPPER JET.

AFTER COORDINATED WITH SPC AND SURROUNDING OFFICES...I HAVE
UPDATED THE HWO AND ISSUED AN SPS CONCERNING THE POTENTIAL OF
SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. MAIN CONCERN
IS LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING STRAIGHT LINE WINDS. SHEAR PROFILE ALSO SUPPORTS
SUPERCELL DEVELOPMENT AND ROTATION WITH AFTERNOON STORMS AS WELL.

AS WARM FRONT MOVES INTO THE WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...
I EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO WARM INTO THE 50S TO NEAR 60 SOUTH...SO
WILL UPDATE HIGHS ACCORDINGLY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A VERY BOTHERSOME FORECAST WITH 
A SHORTWAVE SWINGING THROUGH THE REGION TODAY AND WRAP AROUND 
TONIGHT.  MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE THE BIG LIMITING FACTOR WITH 
PRECIPITATION YET TO BREAK OUT.  DO FEEL THAT AS THE SYSTEM TAPS 
INTO THE GULF...PRECIPITATION WILL BEGIN AND SHOULD HAVE GOOD 
COVERAGE ACROSS THE AREA...HOWEVER AMOUNT WILL BE LIGHT.  WORDING 
FOR THE CATEGORICAL PERIOD WILL BE ...PERIODS OF RAIN SHOWERS...AND 
WILL PROBABLY ALSO ADD THE WORD LIGHT TO INDICATE LIMITED RAIN WITH 
THIS SYSTEM.

BOTH GFS AND NAM FAIRLY CLOSE AND LEANED A LITTLE TOWARDS THE GFS 
FOR GUIDANCE WHERE THEY DIFFERED AS IT APPEARS TO HAVE A LITTLE 
BETTER HANDLE ON TIMING OF THE SYSTEM.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...LOTS OF MINOR CHANGES
MADE EARLY PERIODS OUT TO SATURDAY NIGHT. THE SHORT TERM SYSTEM
(WHICH LOOKS STARVED FOR MOISTURE AT THIS POINT) MAY PROVIDE SOME
WRAP AROUND MOISTURE INTO THURSDAY...BUT MAINLY FOR THE NRN HALF OF
THE FORECAST AREA. POPS WERE REDONE TO REFLECT THIS SCENARIO WITH
MUCH LOWER POPS GIVEN TO SE TN/SW NC AND THE CENTRAL SECTIONS OF
THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY. NOT MUCH THREAT OF SNOW ON THURSDAY
AS LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES STAY MUCH TOO WARM...AND 850 MB TEMPS
BARELY FALL BELOW ZERO DEGREES CELSIUS. LET THE PCPN END MUCH
FASTER THURSDAY EVENING...KEEPING JUST A MENTION OF SPRINKLES OR
FLURRIES IN SW VA...SMOKIES AND NRN MTNS OF TN.

NEXT SYSTEM FOR FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY ALSO REQUIRED A FEW
CHANGES...MAINLY TO SPEED UP THE ONSET OF SHOWERS BY LATE FRIDAY
NIGHT PER BOTH NAM AND GFS. CONFIDENCE WAS TOO LOW (GIVEN WEAKNESS
OF TODAYS SYSTEM) TO GO LIKELY OR HIGHER WITH POPS JUST YET FOR
FRIDAY NIGHT OR EARLY SATURDAY. SYSTEMS SEEM TO BE ARRIVING IN LINE
WITH FASTER SOLUTIONS OF LATE...SO SOME SUPPORT FOR THIS THINKING.

OTHERWISE...MINOR ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO MAX AND MIN TEMPS TO BE IN
LINE WITH LATEST MOS IN THE EARLIER PERIODS...AND ALSO TO SMOOTH
OUT SOME SLIGHT DISCREPANCIES WITH NEIGBORING GRIDS FURTHER OUT IN
THE LONG RANGE. NAM MOS MAX TEMPS FOR THURSDAY STILL APPEARED TOO COOL
...ESPECIALLY IN AREAS THAT GET DOWNSLOPING AND POSSIBLE PARTIAL
CLEARING BY THE AFTERNOON. THANKS TO NEIGHBORING OFFICES FOR THE GOOD
COLLABORATION TO WORK OUT THESE CHANGES.

HIGH AND MIDLEVEL CLOUDS WILL OVERSPREAD THE AREA TONIGHT...WITH
LOW LEVEL CLOUDS INCREASING TOWARD DAYBREAK AS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
ADVECTION INCREASES. THESE CLOUDS SHOULD PUT A CAP ON RAPIDLY
FALLING TEMPERATURES. TEMPS ACROSS THE AREA ARE WELL BELOW FORECAST
VALUES...BUT EXPECT THAT THE FORECAST MINS ARE NOT TOO FAR OFF.
WILL MAKE SOME SLIGHT DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS TO TEMPERATURES. WILL
ALSO INCREASE WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS AS MODELS SHOW A STRENGTHENING

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...NEXT SYSTEM ALREADY HEADED 
TOWARD AREA WITH WARM/MOIST ADVECTION BEGINNING.  GENERALLY WENT 
CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS TONIGHT...EXCEPT A LITTLE WARMER IN THE WEST 
DUE TO EARLIER ARRIVAL OF CLOUD COVER AND WARM ADVECTION.  WORKED 
HOURLY TEMPS TO GET LOW TEMPS IN MIDDLE OF NIGHT WEST AND NEAR USUAL 
DAYBREAK TIMING IN NORTHEAST.  LIKEWISE ON WEDNESDAY...HAVE HIGH 
TEMPS EARLY IN WEST AND CLOSER TO NORMAL TIME IN NORTHEAST DUE TO 
TIMING OF CLOUDS AND PRECIP.  HAVE GONE QUITE COOL WITH HIGH TEMPS 
IN WEST WEDNESDAY AS CLOUDS AND RAIN SHOULD BE STARTING EARLY...BUT 
IN NORTHEAST DOWNSLOPING WINDS AND LATE ARRIVAL OF CLOUDS SHOULD 
OFFER GOOD WARMUP...SO KTRI SHOULD BE WARMER THAN KCHA FROM LATE 
MORNING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON.

QUESTION AS TO HOW UNSTABLE THE AIR MASS WILL GET ON WEDNESDAY.  
LOOKING LIKE MOST OF THE RICH/MOIST AIR WILL STAY ON OTHER SIDE OF 
THE PLATEAU AND SOUTH OF THE AREA...SO WILL NOT INTRODUCE THUNDER AT 
THIS TIME.  BEST CHANCES IN SOUTHWEST AND WESTERN AREAS ON 
WEDNESDAY...BUT NOT LOOKING THAT PROMISING FOR NOW.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS BRINGING A 
COLD FRONT THROUGH AREA ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  PRETTY GOOD MOISTURE 
AND DYNAMICS WITH IT...WILL BUMP UP POPS TO 90 PERCENT FOR WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. THICKNESSES STILL INDICATE PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE LIQUID 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  UPPER TROUGH TRACKING THROUGH ON THURSDAY...BEST 
CHANCES SHOULD REMAIN IN THE MORNING HOURS AND IN THE NORTH.  
MOISTURE LINGERS INTO THURSDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP 20 POPS FOR 
SOUTHWEST VA AND THE MOUNTAINS THURSDAY NIGHT...SHOULD BE COLD 
ENOUGH FOR A RAIN/SNOW MIX...ESPECIALLY IN THE MOUNTAINS...EXPECTED 
DRY WEATHER ELSEWHERE.  RIDGING RETURNS BRIEFLY BRINGING DRY WEATHER 
ON FRIDAY.  NEXT FRONT MOVING INTO AREA BY FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
SATURDAY...FRONT A LITTLE SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS...WILL HOLD BEST 
CHANCES FRIDAY NIGHT UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT...THEN CONTINUE 40 POPS 
INTO SATURDAY.  DRY WEATHER RETURNS SATURDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY DRY FOR NOW.  ANOTHER FRONT APPROACHES ON 
MONDAY...A LITTLE QUICKER THAN PREVIOUS FORECAST...WILL ADD SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND BUMP UP POPS TO 40 PERCENT ON 
MONDAY.  UPPER TROUGH LINGERING INTO MONDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP CHANCE 
POPS MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WITH THE BEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CLEARING SKIES WITH INCOMING 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL QUICKLY GIVE WAY TO NEXT APPROACHING SYSTEM 
BEGINNING LATER TONIGHT.  BOTH NAM AND GFS SIMILIAR TO HANDLING NEXT 
SYSTEM WITH GFS A LITTLE QUICKER.  DO FEEL THIS IS A LITTLE TOO 
QUICK AND LEANED TOWARDS NAM FOR GUIDANCE IN THE NEAR TERM. 


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...STILL SOME SLIGHT TIMING
DIFFERENCES WITH WEDNESDAY SYSTEM...NAM BEING A LITTLE SLOWER THAN
GFS. HOWEVER...OVERALL THERE APPEARED TO BE GOOD CONSISTENCY AND
AGREEMENT ON PATTERN INTO NEW DAY 7. DID NOT BRING SHOWERS IN QUITE
AS FAST AS GFS JUST YET...PREFERRING TO KEEP SW VA AND NE TN POPS
IN THE UPPER END OF CHANCE FOR NOW. POPS FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WERE
RAISED TO 80 PERCENT...SINCE NAM...GFS AND ECMWF ALL SUPPORT
WIDESPREAD SHOWERS EARLY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. CONSIDERED A MENTION OF
THUNDERSTORMS FOR WEDNESDAY EVENING...BUT MAIN AXIS OF INSTABILITY
IS OVER WEST AND MIDDLE TN...THEN MAINLY TO OUR SOUTH ACROSS AL AND
GA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. LOWERED POPS A LITTLE FASTER FROM THE WEST
ON THURSDAY...WHICH MAY STILL NOT BE SOON ENOUGH IF GFS TIMING IS
CORRECT. LOWERED HIGHS TEMPS A BIT ON THURSDAY DUE TO LINGERING
CLOUDS AND AT LEAST WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION.

OTHERWISE...REMAINDER OF EXTENDED STILL LOOKS ON TRACK WITH SOME

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FORECAST BASICALLY APPEARED TO 
BE ON TRACK THIS MORNING...ALTHO TIME OF THE DAY DOES NOT AFFORD 
MUCH GROUND TRUTH REPORTS AS TO WHERE IT IS SNOWING AND HOW MUCH. 
FEW CALLS MADE TO SWRN VA INDICATED VERY LIGHT SNOW IN WISE COUNTY 
VA...BUT SNOW WAS NOT ACCUMULATING ON ROADS OR GRASSY AREAS.  
SURFACE TEMPS REMAIN GENERALLY IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 30S ACROSS 
SWRN VA... WITH WEAK WARM AIR ADVECTION IN THE LOWER LEVELS ALREADY 
NUDGING EASTWARD FROM CENTRAL KY AND WEST TN.  THUS...DECIDED TO 
KEEP SWRN VA SNOW ACCUMULATIONS BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA FOR 
TODAY...ALSO BASED ON A DIMINISHING MOISTURE PROFILE FOR LATER THIS 
MORNING...ACTUALLY FALLING BELOW THE BEST DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE.  
COLDEST TEMPS AT TOP OF THE SATURATED LAYER WERE ALSO MARGINAL EVEN 
FOR EARLY THIS MORNING (BARELY -10 DEGREES C).  

MAIN AREA OF THREAT FOR SNOW ADVISORY AMOUNTS STILL APPEARS TO BE 
NRN AND SMOKY MTNS OF EAST TN.  SWITCHED THE KMRX RADAR OVER TO 
CLEAR AIR MODE TO BETTER DETECT ANY AREAS OF SNOW...AND WE FIND SOME 
20 TO 30 DBZ RETURNS MAINLY IN THOSE AREAS.  EVENING SHIFT 
COORDINATED WITH SMOKY MTN NATL PARK AND SOME LIGHT SNOWS WERE 
STARTING TO ACCUMULATE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AT THAT TIME.  RADAR 
VAD WIND PROFILE SHOWS DECENT UPSLOPE COMPONENT (WINDS AROUND 280 AT 
30 KNOTS)...SO LATER THIS MORNING WOULD EXPECT MAINLY AN UPSLOPE 
LIGHT SNOW EVENT (ALTHO HIGHEST SPOTS LIKE NEWFOUND GAP TO MT 
LECONTE MIGHT GET SLIGHTLY HEAVIER AMOUNTS THAN WILL APPEAR IN THE 
GRIDS AND WSWMRX PRODUCT).  ALTHOUGH...SOME CONCERN THAT SURFACE AND 
BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPS MAY BE TOO WARM AND WILL HINDER ACCUMULATIONS.

BASED ON CURRENT SURFACE AND TOWER OBSERVATIONS FEEL THAT WIND 
SPEEDS WILL REMAIN BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA...AND WILL RUN 15 TO 25 
MPH WITH GUSTS UP TO 35 MPH IN SMOKY AND NRN MTNS.  OTHERWISE...
ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO MOST GRIDS FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT.  WILL

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WITH WEAK 
RIDGING ALOFT TUESDAY AND A RAPID WARMUP FROM MONDAY ACROSS THE

OF THE EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY. CROSS SECTION DATA SHOWS SOME HIGH 
CLOUDS SPREADING IN BY AFTERNOON BUT A FAIRLY DRY AIRMASS AND WARM 
AIR ADVECTION AND RISING HEIGHTS SHOULD RAISE HIGH TEMPERATURES 
ABOUT 10 DEGREES. HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS WILL KEEP LOWS MUCH WARMER 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS. ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA TEMPERATURES 
WILL STILL BE AROUND FREEZING IN THE SHELTERED VALLEYS BUT ELEVATED 
AREAS MAY BE CLOSER TO 40. STRONG SOUTHERLY WINDS WEDNESDAY SHOULD 
DEVELOP AS A DEEP LOW PRESSURE AREA FORMS OVER THE MS VALLEY AND 
MOVES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY OVERNIGHT. SOME INSTABILITY IS SEEN ON 
SOUNDINGS WEDNESDAY EVENING WITH THUNDER A POSSIBILITY. BUT TIME OF 
DAY AND TIME OF YEAR ARE NOT FAVORABLE FOR THUNDERSTORMS. WILL STILL 
KEEP PRECIPITATION TYPE SHOWERS AT THIS TIME. INCREASED POPS TO 
LIKELY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF COLD FRONT. WRAP AROUND MOISTURE 
WILL AFFECT REGION THURSDAY WITH CONTINUED CHANCE OF RAIN.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...MID LEVEL 
CIRCULATION OPENING UP AS IT MOVES THROUGH MRX CWA THIS AFTERNOON.
SURFACE CONTINUES TO MOVE NE ACROSS OH. FIRST WIND SHIFT TO THE SW 
HAS MOVED EAST INTO THE MOUNTAINS. ANOTHER WIND SHIFT TO THE WEST 
WILL OCCUR THIS EVENING. THEN A LATER SHIFT TO THE NW WILL BRING THE 
BETTER CAA INTO THE LOW LEVELS. PCPN WILL DECREASE SOME THIS EVENING 
THEN INCREASE AS WRAP AROUND 850-700 MB TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH THE 
AREA. THIS TROUGH FAIRLY MOIST WITH HIGHER RHS AT OR ABV -10 C AS 
IT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA OVERNIGHT. FREEZING LEVELS LOOK CONSISTENT 
WITH PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS DROPPING TO 2000 FEET BY EARLY MONDAY. THE 
DEEPER MOISTURE WILL MOVE OUT OF THE AREA MONDAY MORNING. GOOD NW 
UPSLOPE FLOW WILL ALLOW SNOWSHOWERS TO CONTINUE ACROSS ADVISORY 
AREAS ON MONDAY. SW VA AND N CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WILL LIKELY SEE 
MEASURABLE SNOW TONIGHT AND MONDAY BUT AMOUNTS SHOULD REMAIN BELOW 
ADVISORY CRITERIA. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE WEST ON MONDAY 
WITH A FAIRLY FAST WARM UP FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS BRINGING A COLD 
FRONT INTO AREA ON WEDNESDAY...BEST CHANCES SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL 
AFTERNOON WHEN BETTER MOISTURE ARRIVES.  PRETTY GOOD DYNAMICS 
EXPECTED WITH THE FRONT...WILL GO WITH HIGH CHANCE ACROSS THE CWA 
FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUE CHANCES INTO THURSDAY.  THICKNESSES 
STILL INDICATE PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE LIQUID WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY.  MOISTURE LINGERS INTO THURSDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP 20 POPS 
FOR SOUTHWEST VA AND THE MOUNTAINS THURSDAY NIGHT...MAY SEE A 
RAIN/SNOW MIX LATE THURSDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS...SHOULD BE 
DRY ELSEWHERE.  DRY WEATHER CONTINUES ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA ON  
FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT.  NEXT FRONT MOVING INTO AREA BY SATURDAY.   
WITH BETTER MOISTURE EXPECTED THAN PREVIOUS RUNS...WILL BUMP UP POPS 
TO 30 PERCENT FOR SATURDAY AND 20 FOR SATURDAY NIGHT...SHOULD BE 
WARM ENOUGH FOR ALL RAIN ON SATURDAY...BUT THICKNESSES INDICATE 
PRECIPITATION COULD BE RAIN/SNOW ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND THE 
MOUNTAINS ON SATURDAY NIGHT.  DRY WEATHER RETURNS ON SUNDAY.

430 AM EST SUN DEC 25 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND MOST OF TONIGHT)...BROKEN AREAS OF RAIN 
CONTINUE TO SPREAD NORTHEAST ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
MORNING.  SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL JET OF AROUND 30 KNOTS DOES CONTINUE 
TO PRODUCE A RAIN SHADOW AREA FROM LOWER ELEVATIONS OF SEVIER COUNTY 
NE TO JOHNSON COUNTY IN EXTREME NE TN.  SURFACE OBSERVATIONS AND 
IFLOWS DATA SUGGEST MOSTLY LIGHT RAIN AMOUNTS...ALTHO RADAR DATA 
INDICATES SPOTTY HEAVIER SHOWERS.  CEILINGS (CLOUD HEIGHTS) REMAIN 
MVFR TO VFR MOST AREAS...ALTHO IFR CONDITIONS ARE APPROACHING FROM 
MIDDLE TN AND NRN AL.  

THE UPPER LOW HAS SPUN EASTWARD TO BE CENTERED OVER FAR WESTERN TN 
NORTH INTO SRN IL.  A BRIEF DRY SLOT NOTED ON WATER VAPOR AND IR 
SATELLITE PICS APPEARS POISED TO MOVE IN BY OR BEFORE MID MORNING 
TODAY...WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO A SHORT BREAK IN THE RAIN...BEFORE MORE 
AT LEAST LIGHT RAIN WRAPS BACK AROUND INTO THE AREA AS THE UPPER LOW 
EASES FURTHER E AND NE.  POP AND WEATHER GRIDS WERE ADJUSTED TO 
REFLECT THIS THINKING FOR TODAY.  

FOR TONIGHT...COLD AIR ARRIVES JUST AS THE SYNOPTIC SCALE POSITIVE 
OMEGA LOOKS TO BE MOVING EAST OF THE REGION...WITH MOISTURE 
GRADUALLY BECOMING MORE AND MORE SHALLOW OVERNIGHT.  ALLOWED FOR A 
MENTION OF MIX OR CHANGE TO SNOW BY AROUND 02-03Z ON THE 26TH...
MAINLY JUST IN THE NWRN AREAS AND NRN MTNS.  WARM SURFACE TEMPS AND 
BOUNDARY LAYER MAY INHIBIT ANY SIGNIFICANT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS...
AND ALSO NOTED PER ETA BUFKIT THAT THE DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE LOOKS 
TO BE ABOVE THE MOISTURE PROFILE LATE TONIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY.
THUS...CONFIDENCE IN SNOW AMOUNTS REACHING ADVISORY LEVELS IS STILL 
LOW AT THIS POINT.  PLANNING TO CONTINUE A MENTION IN THE HWO 
PRODUCT AND ALSO MAY ISSUE A SHORT SPS LATER THIS MORNING.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...COLD AIR ALOFT BEHIND 
TODAYS SYSTEM SHOULD BE PRODUCING MOSTLY SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA EARLY MONDAY MORNING AS FREEZING LEVELS DROP TO NEAR 
THE SURFACE. SOME STRONG NW WINDS MONDAY AND CONTINUED MOISTURE WILL 
ADD SOME ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS IN FAVORED HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS 
OF SW VA AND NE TN INCLUDING THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS OF THE SMOKIES. 
THIS WILL BE MAINLY IN THE MORNING BUT PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE 
ENDING BY AFTERNOON AND TEMPERATURES WILL SLOWLY WARM. LOW CLOUDS 
WILL SLOWLY DECREASE AS UPPER LOW AND TROUGH LIFTS NORTHEAST. NE 
SECTIONS MAY SEE CLOUDS ALL DAY WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE THICKER 
THERE. A FAST MOVING SHORTWAVE MONDAY NIGHT EARLY TUESDAY WILL BRING 
ANOTHER INCREASE IN HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE BUT NO PRECIPITATION. 
RIDGING WILL BUILD IN TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT AND A SURFACE LOW 
DEVELOPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. MUCH WARMER TEMPERATURES 
TUESDAY AS HEIGHTS RISE. WEDNESDAY THIS SYSTEM DEEPENS AND SPREADS 
RAIN INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY LOOKING SIMILAR TO WHAT IS OCCURRING 
TODAY. THE SURFACE LOW MAY TRACK EVEN FARTHER SOUTH AS WELL. DAY 
SHIFT WILL PROBABLY NEED TO INCREASE POPS TO LIKELY FOR THE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT OR THURSDAY TIME FRAME OF THE FORECAST. ANOTHER 
STRONG SYSTEM APPROACHES FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY WITH THE LOW 
MOVING OVER THE GREAT LAKES STATES. NEITHER SYSTEM HAS MUCH COLD AIR 
BEHIND THEM SO ONLY THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS SHOULD SEE ANY SNOW.
AN SPS HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THE EXPECTED SNOWFALL TONIGHT AND MONDAY 
MORNING. MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM US HERE AT MRX.

MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION THIS MORNING.  SURFACE LOW PROGD TO 
DEVELOP ACROSS WRN TN AND NRN AL BY THIS EVENING...WITH ASSOCIATED 
COLD AND/OR OCCLUDED FRONT TO MOVE THRU MOST OF OUR FORECAST AREA BY 
12Z SUNDAY.  MODELS SEEMED IN GENERAL AGREEMENT AND SPREAD SHOWERS 
INTO WRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA LATE THIS AFTERNOON...THEN 
ACROSS REST OF THE AREA FROM LATE EVENING INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.  

ONLY SLIGHT POP AND SKY COVER ADJUSTMENTS MADE FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS 
FOR THESE PERIODS...ALTHO DID ADD A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS 
FOR SE TN COUNTIES IN LINE WITH DAY ONE CONVECTIVE OUTLOOK.  LIMITED 
THE MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS TO LATE TONIGHT...WHEN BEST LIFT...UPPER
LEVEL DIVERGENCE AND INSTABILITY WERE NOTED.  DID INCREASE THE WINDS 
LATE TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS PLATEAU AND ERN MOUNTAINS...AS LOW

HIGH POPS IN THE FORM OF RAIN SHOWERS GOING ALTHOUGH A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION LINGERING SUNDAY MORNING 
BOTH ALONG FRONT AND WITH COLDER AIR ALOFT ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE 
SYSTEM. HAVE WARMED TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES SUNDAY WITH A BREAK 
IN THE PRECIPITATION EXPECTED IN THE MORNING AS DRY SLOT MOVES

SOUNDINGS SHOWED JUST AROUND A VERY MEAGER 0.10 INCH OF PRECIPITABLE

SATELLITE PICS SHOW A SHORTWAVE MOVING EAST TO OUR NORTH ACROSS THE 
MID/UPR MISS VALLEY REGION.  THIS FEATURE LOOKS TO SPREAD SOME MID 
TO HI CLOUDS OVER THE OHIO VALLEY AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS TODAY... 
WHILE OUR REGION ENJOYS SUNNY SKIES.  IN FACT...THERE MAY JUST BE A 
SLIGHT INCREASE IN HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE VERY LATE TONIGHT TOWARD 
DAYBREAK SATURDAY.

SURFACE GRADIENT TIGHTENS TONIGHT AS STRONGER SHORTWAVE AND COLD

LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE

SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT AS A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS TN. MAIN

LOOKS TO BE LATE SATURDAY AND THEN OVERNIGHT SATURDAY NIGHT TAPERING 
OFF SUNDAY. AS COLDER AIR MOVES IN BEHIND SYSTEM SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
EARLY MONDAY FREEZING LEVELS DROP TO AROUND 3000 FEET AND THEN NEAR

AND MID ATLANTIC BUT MOUNTAIN LOCATIONS COULD PICK UP AN INCH OR SO 
OF SNOW...POSSIBLY MORE AT THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. AT LOWER 
ELEVATIONS SNOWSHOWERS OR FLURRIES WILL BE POSSIBLE BUT GROUND 
TEMPERATURES AT LOWER ELEVATIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE TO WARM FOR ANY 
ACCUMULATIONS BEFORE PRECIPITATION ENDS EARLY MONDAY. HIGH PRESSURE 
MOVES IN FROM THE WEST LATER MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THE NEXT CHANCE OF

OFF SUNDAY. AS COLDER AIR MOVES IN BEHIND SYSTEM SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
EARLY MONDAY FREEZING LEVELS DROP TO AROUND 3000 FEET AND THEN NEAR 
THE SURFACE BY MORNING MONDAY. THE BEST MOISTURE STAYS IN THE OHIO 
AND MID ATLANTIC BUT MOUNTAIN LOCATIONS COULD PICK UP AN INCH OR SO 
OF SNOW...POSSIBLY MORE AT THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. AT LOWER 
ELEVATIONS SNOWSHOWERS OR FLURRIES WILL BE POSSIBLE BUT GROUND 
TEMPERATURES AT LOWER ELEVATIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE TO WARM FOR ANY 
ACCUMULATIONS BEFORE PRECIPITATION ENDS EARLY MONDAY. HIGH PRESSURE 
MOVES IN FROM THE WEST LATER MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THE NEXT CHANCE OF

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...A BAND OF CIRRUS WILL 
MOVE EAST ACROSS THE AREA THIS EVENING. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE

UNDERWAY. A DRY SHORT WAVE APPROACHES AREA FROM SW AND MOVES THROUGH

DROPPING OUT OF THE N ROCKIES ON SAT. PREFER THIS OUTLIER SOLUTION 
BUT EFFECT ON MRX CWA CHANGES LITTLE EXCEPT WIND SPEEDS AND 
DIRECTION MAY NEED LATER TWEAKING PENDING DEVELOPING SFC LOW 
POSITION/STRENGTH. MOISTURE DOES TRANSPORT IN THE AREA FROM THE SW 
ON SAT. LIFT/INSTABILITY LIMITED BUT SCT SHWRS ON TRACK TO MOVE IN 
SAT AFTN. BULK OF PCPN NEAR FRONTAL ZONE WHICH MOVES THROUGH SAT 
NGT/SUN MORN. CAA UNDERWAY SUN WILL TEMPS STEADY OR FALLING IN THE

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DRY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT AND 
STRONG SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE AREA WEATHER THROUGH THE 
NEXT 24 HOURS.  AS A RESULT...WE WILL SEE CONTINUED DRY CONDITIONS.  
TEMPERATURES WILL WARM SLIGHTLY TODAY AS HEIGHT RISES PRODUCE WEAK 
WARM ADVECTION.  MODELS HANDLE THIS WELL AND WILL KEEP CLOSE TO

LONG TERM...(FRI THROUGH WED)...LOOKS LIKE PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AGAIN 
ON FRIDAY WITH MILD TEMPS...THEN NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES FOR THE 
WEEKEND.  MODELS STILL IN POOR AGREEMENT...SO CONFIDENCE ON THE 
DETAILS STILL LOW.  GFS DEEPER THAN THE NAM...CUTTING OFF A LOW AT 
H5.  THINK A COMPROMISE SOLUTION IS THE COURSE OF LEAST REGRET FOR 
NOW.  WILL BRING CHANCE POPS IN BY SAT AFTERNOON...AND CONTINUE 
CHANCE THROUGH SAT NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING.  THIS PRECIP SHOULD BE 
MAINLY RAIN...ALTHOUGH COLDER AIR ARRIVING ON SUNDAY MAY TURN ANY 
LINGERING SHOWERS TO SNOW SHOWERS OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  MAY 
SEE SOME SHOWERS AND SNOW SHOWERS IN THE COLD AIR ADVECTION AND 
NORTHWEST FLOW SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY...MAINLY NORTH AND

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...TRANQUIL WEATHER  
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS OVERHEAD. 
ALSO A VERY DRY ATMOSPHERE WILL ALLOW ANOTHER COLD NIGHT WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT BUT A WARMER DAY THURSDAY AND EVEN MORE WARMING FRIDAY. PUT 
HIGHS FRIDAY AND SATURDAY IN THE 50S IN MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA.

IN THE WAY OF UPSLOPE CLOUDS...AND NO PRECIPITATION. WILL GO NO MORE

IN INCREASING HUMIDITY FOR THE SUPPORT OF PRECIP UNTIL LATE IN THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
INCREASING CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED OVERNIGHT AS SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS
CIRRUS APPROACHING FROM THE SOUTHWEST. MODELS SHOW A SHORTWAVE
TROUGH CROSSING THE AREA TOMORROW. MOISTURE CONTINUES TO BE VERY
LIMITED AND LIFT IS VERY WEAK. WILL REMOVE THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP
AND MENTION ONLY MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES TOMORROW. A DRY NORTHWEST FLOW
WILL PERSIST THROUGH WEDNESDAY...AND WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGHS IN THE
FLOW MAY ONLY BRING A SLIGHT INCREASE IN MID/HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS. COLD
ADVECTION WILL KEEP TEMPS BELOW NORMAL.

.LONG TERM...
A BUILDING RIDGE ALOFT WILL BRING A WARMING TREND FOR THE END OF
THE WEEK. A SOUTHWEST FLOW ON FRIDAY WILL WARM TEMPERATURES WELL INTO
THE 50S IN MOST SPOTS. THE PAST COUPLE RUNS OF THE GFS HAVE SHOWN A
DEEP TROUGH DIGGING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY ON SATURDAY...WITH THE
DEEPEST MOISTURE AND LIFT OVER OUR AREA ON SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL ADD

EVIDENCE SO FAR THAT ANYTHING IS REACHING THE GROUND OVER OUR AREA.  
SHOULD SEE A DECREASE IN CLOUDS TODAY AS SYSTEM TO OUR SOUTHEAST

BUILDS SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE APPALACHIANS ON 
MONDAY AND FEATURE IS DEPICTED BY BOTH MODELS TO BE JUST A LITTLE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
12Z NAM HAS COME INTO MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE GFS...SHOWING
A FASTER AND DRIER SYSTEM (FOR US) TONIGHT. IN FACT THE NAM IS NOW
DRIER THAN THE GFS...AND POPS AT RHP FELL FROM 81% IN YESTERDAYS
12Z RUN TO 6% TODAY THUS CONFIDENCE IS HIGH THAT WE WILL SEE VERY
LITTLE PRECIP IN OUR AREA...WITH THE MOUNTAINS BEING THE ONLY
POSSIBILITY OF SEEING PRECIP. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP
OVERNIGHT FOR THE MOUNTAINS AND NC COUNTIES.

A FAST-MOVING UPPER TROUGH CROSSES THE AREA ON MONDAY. MODELS HAVE
FLIP-FLOPPED WITH HOW MUCH MOISTURE THERE WILL BE IN THE NORTHWEST
FLOW. HOWEVER LIFT CONTINUES TO BE VERY WEAK...AND WILL MAINTAIN A
DRY FORECAST. 

TEMPERATURE DO DIFFER QUITE A BIT IN THE MOS GUIDANCE TOMORROW...WITH
THE MET SHOWING HIGHS IN THE 50S. THIS SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE TOO
WARM GIVEN THE BELOW NORMAL TEMPS WE HAVE HAD LATELY. WILL LEAN
TOWARD THE COOLER GFS...WITH HIGHS MAINLY IN THE 40S. OTHERWISE MOS
TEMPS ARE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER...AND WILL STAY CLOSE TO CONSENSUS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
LITTLE CHANGES NEEDED THIS PERIOD...DRY FORECAST WILL BE CONTINUED.
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH IN THE SOUTHERN STREAM PASSES WELL TO OUR
SOUTH...AND MAY BRING A SLIGHT INCREASE IN CLOUDS. OTHERWISE MOSTLY

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STILL SOME DISAGREEMENT IN THE 
MODELS FOR THE SHORT TERM.  NAM IS A BIT FURTHER WEST WITH SOUTHEAST 
SYSTEM...AND BRINGS A BIT MORE MOISTURE AND PRECIP INTO OUR EASTERN 
ZONES.  WILL USE A BLEND BUT THINK CLOSER TO THE GFS WILL BE 
BETTER.  STILL LOOKS LIKE BETTER MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL STAY TO OUR 
SOUTHEAST...SO WILL JUST CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND SW VA.  OTHERWISE...SHOULD SEE SOME MID 
AND HIGH CLOUDINESS THROUGH TONIGHT. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE...SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.        

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HELD ONTO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
FOR SOME -SN IN THE MOUNTAINS BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA FOR THE FIRST 
HALF OF THE MORNING SUNDAY AS SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM MAKES ITS EXIT. 
THE NEXT SYSTEM OF INTEREST IS S/WV PRESSING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE 
GREAT LAKES AND UPPER OHIO VALLEY INTO THE NORTHEAST U.S. ON MONDAY. 
NOT A GREAT DEAL OF MOISTURE TO WORK WITH AS THIS TROF PUSHES SOUTH 
AND EAST AND WILL MAINTAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES BUT NOT MUCH ELSE ON 
MONDAY. THE REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST FEATURES A DRY 
NORTHWEST TO WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WITH MODERATING TEMPS BY THE

.SHORT TERM...
TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...A LARGE LOW PRESSURE AREA AND UPPER LOW WAS 
SPINNING ACROSS THE NORTHERN MI LAKE SUPERIOR REGION THIS AFTERNOON 
WITH WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO THE TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS BEHIND YESTERDAYS SYSTEM ALREADY OFF THE ATLANTIC 
COAST. SUBTROPICAL MOISTURE IS ALREADY STREAMING INTO TN FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF NEXT DEVELOPING SYSTEM OVER TX ALREADY BEGINNING 
TO PRODUCE PRECIPITATION OVER WEST TEXAS THIS AFTERNOON. SKIES ARE 
GENERALLY PARTLY CLOUDY THIS AFTERNOON AFTER SOME STUBBORN LOW 
CLOUDS ACROSS THE NORTH DEPARTED LATE THIS MORNING AND HIGH CLOUDS 
BEGAN ARRIVING FROM THE SW THIS AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES ARE A LITTLE 
COOLER THAN EXPECTED DESPITE A GOOD SOUTHWEST WIND FROM DEPARTING 
LOWER PRESSURE TO THE NORTHEAST AND HIGHER PRESSURE TO THE 
SOUTHWEST. BOTH NAM AND GFS INDICATING MOSTLY HIGH AND MIDDLE 
MOISTURE INCREASING TONIGHT AND SATURDAY WITH APPROACHING SOUTHERN 
SYSTEM. TONIGHT THE HIGH CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE AND THICKEN 
BUT NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM DROPPING INTO THE MID 20S 
TO NEAR 30. TEMPERATURES MAY ACTUALLY SLOWLY WARM OVERNIGHT. THE GFS 
HAS A MORE DENSE CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY WHICH 
IS REFLECTED IN THE GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR HIGHS. FOLLOWED CLOSER TO 
THESE NUMBERS. NO PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE CWA UNTIL SATURDAY 
NIGHT.       

.LONG TERM...
SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...
SOME MAJOR DIFFERENCES IN THE MODELS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
SUNDAY LEADS TO A LOW CONFIDENCE FORECAST. THE NAM INITIALIZED 
POORLY...SHOWING A MORE AMPLIFIED TROUGH/RIDGE IN THE SOUTHERN 
ROCKIES/TEXAS AND A WEAKER CLOSED LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES THAN 
OBSERVED. THE LESS AMPLIFIED PATTERN OF THE BETTER INITIALIZED GFS 
RESULTS IN A FASTER SYSTEM...AND MOISTURE AND LIFT ARE SUPPRESSED TO 
OUR SOUTH. IN ADDITION...THE MODELS GENERATE CONVECTION ALONG THE 
GULF COAST...WHICH WILL TEND TO CUT OFF OUR MOISTURE SUPPLY. THE GFS 
SEEMS TO DEPICT THIS BETTER IN ITS QPF FIELD. THUS PREFER THE GFS 
SOLUTION OF LOWER POPS IN OUR AREA...WITH THE HIGHEST POPS ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT INSTEAD OF SUNDAY. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS IN THE MTNS 
WITH SLIGHT CHANCES IN THE VALLEY. WILL MAINTAIN A SLIGHT CHANCE POP 
IN THE MTNS SUNDAY MORNING...AND ALL PRECIP SHOULD BE GONE BY THE 
AFTERNOON. PRECIP SHOULD BE SNOW IN THE CLIMATOLOGICALLY FAVORED 
AREAS OF THE MTNS AND SW VA/NRN TN VALLEY. WILL MENTION RAIN OR SNOW 
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY/SOUTHERN MTNS AND ALL RAIN IN THE SOUTH. IT IS 
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE NAMS SLOWER/MORE NORTHERLY SYSTEM 
PRODUCES 7-12 INCHES OF SNOW IN SW VA AND NE TN DURING THE DAY ON 
SUNDAY...BUT THE NAM IS AN OUTLIER AMONG THE MODELS. 

ON MONDAY AFTERNOON A SHORTWAVE TROUGH CROSSES THE AREA..BUT 
MOISTURE IS VERY LIMITED. SOME UPSLOPE SNOW IS POSSIBLE IN THE 
MTNS...BUT LOW LEVEL FLOW DOES NOT APPEAR STRONG ENOUGH TO WARRANT 
ADDING POPS AT THIS TIME. COLD ADVECTION ON MONDAY WILL HOLD HIGH 
TEMPERATURES ONLY IN THE 30 IN MOST SPOTS...WITH SOME LOWER 40S IN 
THE SOUTHERN VALLEY.

MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED THIS PERIOD 
WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPS AS A CLOSED LOW OVER EASTERN CANADA PRODUCES 
A WEST TO NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. MODELS INDICATE A SPLIT FLOW 
DEVELOPING AND A SOUTHERN STREAM TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE GULF COAST 
REGION...BUT MOISTURE AND LIFT REMAIN SUPPRESSED WELL TO OUR SOUTH. 
A SLIGHT WARMING TREND IS EXPECTED LATE IN THE PERIOD AS A RIDGE 
BUILDS ALOFT.

HAS A SLIGHTLY WEAKER RIDGE AND THUS BRINGS PRECIP A LITTLE FARTHER 
NORTH THAN THE GFS...BUT THE BULK OF THE LIFT AND MOISTURE REMAIN 
SOUTH. WILL REMOVE POPS SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
MONDAY THE NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH BEGINS TO DIG SOUTH. THE GFS SHOWS 
A STRONG VORT MAX AND UPPER JET PROVIDING LIFT OVER THE AREA MONDAY 
AFTERNOON. HOWEVER MOISTURE MAY BE LIMITED IN THE WESTERLY FLOW 
ALOFT. WILL ADD A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON AND MONDAY 
NIGHT...WITH RAIN OR SNOW FROM TYS NORTH AND SNOW IN SW VA AND TN 
MTNS. A SURGE OF COLD AIR BEHIND THE TROUGH WILL GIVE HIGHS MAINLY 
IN THE 30S ON TUESDAY. REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST WILL REMAIN DRY 
WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPS.

.DISCUSSION...STRONG COLD AIR DAMMING IS STILL OCCURRING ACROSS 
MAINLY THE CAROLINAS WHERE WIDESPREAD FREEZING RAIN HAS BEEN 
FALLING. MOST AREAS OF THE CWA HAVE WARMED TO THE MID 30S TO LOWER 
40S AS WARMER AIR MOVES IN AHEAD OF LOWER PRESSURE WEST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS. A FEW REPORTS OF ICING AND SLEET OR SNOW IN EXTREME 
EASTERN PARTS OF SW VA COUNTIES AND NEAR THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE TN 
MOUNTAIN COUNTIES HAVE PROMPTED A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR THE 
REST OF THE AFTERNOON. IT MAY TAKE A FEW MORE HOURS UNTIL THE COLD

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
340 AM EST THU DEC 15 2005

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRONG COLD AIR DAMMING EVENT 
OCCURRING ACROSS THE CAROLINAS AND NORTHEAST GA WHERE FREEZING RAIN 
HAS BEEN REPORTED AS FAR WEST AS ATLANTA. LOCAL OBS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA INDICATE TEMPS HOVERING ABOVE FREEZING...BUT DEWPOINTS 
REMAIN IN THE 20S ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. THESE 
DEWPOINTS HAVE BEEN SLOWLY RISING THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT...AND HAVE 
QUICKLY RISEN WHEN RAIN DEVELOPS AND MIXES WARMER AIR FROM ALOFT 
DOWN TO THE SURFACE. HOWEVER...SOME EVAPORATIVE COOLING AT THE ONSET 
OF THE PRECIP MAY CAUSE SOME BRIEF PERIODS OF FREEZING RAIN AND SNOW 
OVER NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA...WITH SOME LIGHT ICING POSSIBLE 
ON ELEVATED SURFACES IN SOME AREAS. THUS...WILL MENTION THIS 
POSSIBILITY IN THE FORECAST THIS MORNING...BUT OVERALL STILL EXPECT 
MAINLY A RAIN EVENT FOR MOST OF THE AREA WITH A WARM SOUTHERLY FLOW 
OBSERVED JUST ABOVE THE SURFACE. NAM MODEL HAS PICKED UP ON THE COLD 
AIR DAMMING SCENARIO BETTER THAN THE GFS...SO WILL CONTINUE TO TREND 
THE FORECAST TOWARD ITS WARMER SOLUTION. NAM MODEL STILL INDICATES 
THAT WET-BULB TEMPS WILL RISE ABOVE FREEZING ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST VA BY SUNRISE...SO FEEL THAT TEMPS SHOULD GRADUALLY RISE 
THIS MORNING ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. 

COLDER AIR WILL SLOWLY BEGIN TO WORK ITS WAY INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
TONIGHT...WITH SOME LIGHT SNOW POSSIBLE AS MOISTURE LINGERS ACROSS 
MAINLY NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. ANY SNOWFALL 
ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE LIGHT AND CONFINED TO THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS...SINCE THE MODELS INDICATE THAT MOISTURE WILL BE RAPIDLY 
DECREASING. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN INDICATES THAT AN ACTIVE SOUTHERN 
JET STREAM WILL BRING ANOTHER CHANCE FOR LIGHT PRECIP SATURDAY NIGHT 
INTO SUNDAY.

ITS WAY INTO CWA FROM SW. T/TDS ALONG EAST-NORTHEAST EDGE COULD

$$

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
SHORT TERM( TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
COMPARING THE 12Z MODEL INITIALIZATIONS...THE NAM WAS TOO WEAK
WITH THE CLOSED LOW OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS...WHILE THE GFS
INITIALIZED MUCH BETTER. THE GFS CONTINUES TO SHOW A STRONGER
SOUTHERN STREAM LOW DEVELOPING OVER E TX/LA/MS THIS
EVENING...RESULTING IN A COOLER THERMAL PROFILE IN THE GFS THAN THE
NAM SOME FROZEN PRECIP ACROSS NORTHEAST SECTIONS OVERNIGHT. THE GFS
KEEPS TEMPS NEAR OR BELOW FREEZING IN OUR NORTHEASTERN COUNTIES FOR
MOST OF THE NIGHT. HOWEVER...THE GFS MAY BE BLEEDING OVER TOO MUCH
COLD AIR ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS DUE TO IT POORER TOPOGRAPHICAL
RESOLUTION THAN THE NAM. IN ADDITION...CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS
ALONG THE GULF COAST COULD DELAY THE ONSET OF PRECIP AND CUT HOW
MUCH QPF WE GET...AND GIVE ENOUGH TIME FOR WARMING BEFORE PRECIP
BEGINS. OBVIOUSLY...A VERY COMPLICATED FORECAST...AND THUS
CONFIDENCE IS LOW.

LIGHT PRECIP THAT HAS BEEN APPROACHING FROM THE WEST HAS BEEN 
DISSIPATING AS IT ENCOUNTERS DRIER AIR OVER THE PLATEAU...BUT A FEW 
SNOW FLAKES HAVE BEEN HITTING THE GROUND IN SPOTS. WILL MENTION 
FLURRIES OR LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS THIS EVENING. MORE SIGNIFICANT PRECIP 
BEGINS OVER OVERSPREAD THE AREA BETWEEN 06 AND 12Z IN ASSOCIATION 
WITH THE DEVELOPING LOW NEAR THE GULF COAST. THIS TIMING IS A LITTLE 
LATER THAN PREVIOUS FORECASTS AND MODEL RUN. AS STATED ABOVE THE GFS 
IS LIKELY TOO COLD AT THE SURFACE WHEN PRECIP STARTS IN THE 
NORTHEAST...SO WILL MENTION ONLY RAIN AFTER MIDNIGHT. CATEGORICAL 
POPS CONTINUE THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING...TAPERING OFF TO A CHANCE BY 
LATE AFTERNOON. THE 850 MB TROUGH PASSES AROUND 00Z FRIDAY...AND 
COLD ADVECTION ENSUES. TEMPS DROP BELOW FREEZING...AND ANY PRECIP 
REMAINING IN THE NORTHEAST SHOULD CHANGE TO SNOW BEFORE MIDLEVEL 
DRYING SHUTS OFF PRECIP. LAYER FROM 800 MB TO THE SURFACE REMAINS 
SATURATED IN THE NORTH THROUGH THE DAY FRIDAY...AND WILL CARRY A 
MENTION OF FLURRIES IN SW VA. MIDLEVEL CLOUDS INCREASE AGAIN ON 
SATURDAY AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM.

LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
CURRENT PATTERN OF ERN US TROUGH KEEPING FAST FLOW ACROSS THE 
AREA...AND WILL PUMP A COUPLE OF SYSTEMS THROUGH DURING THE 
PERIOD...AROUND SUNDAY AND TUESDAY.  TIMING CANNOT BE EXACT AND 
SYSTEMS LOOK PRETTY WEAK SO ONLY MILD FLUCTUATIONS IN PRECIP CHANCES 
THROUGH PERIOD.  ALSO...GFS MOS HAS SHOWN WET BIAS WITH THESE WEAK 
SYSTEMS...SO GOING BELOW GUIDANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY.  TEMPERATURE 
PROFILE FOR SUNDAY QUESTIONABLE AS TO PRECIP TYPE...06Z GFS RUN WAS 
COOLER AND 12Z RUN A LITTLE WARMER. SO WILL MENTION BOTH RAIN AND 
SNOW EXCEPT ACROSS THE SOUTH WHERE JUST RAIN IS MENTIONED. HAVE NOT

DRY LOW LEVEL AIR AND A SLIGHT DOWNSLOPE EFFECT IN THE VALLEY.
HOWEVER POPS WILL NEED TO BE RAISED SLIGHTLY IN THE SOUTHWEST

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER NEW 
ENGLAND AND EXTENDING OVER MOST OF THE EASTERN PART OF THE NATION. 
SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL CLOUDS INCREASING OVER THE REGION AS WINDS 
ALOFT HAVE BECOME SOUTHWESTERLY. AREA RADARS ALSO REVEAL MID-LEVEL 
MOISTURE INCREASING FROM THE SOUTHWEST...BUT WITH A DRY AIRMASS IN 
PLACE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...THINK THAT MOST OF THIS INITIAL 
MOISTURE THIS MORNING WILL EVAPORATE BEFORE REACHING THE GROUND. 
MEASURABLE RAIN SHOULD BE DELAYED UNTIL THE AFTERNOON HOURS ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA...WHICH SHOULD ENSURE THAT 
FROZEN PRECIP WONT OCCUR AS TEMPS WARM ABOVE FREEZING. A COLD AIR 
DAMMING SCENARIO IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE CAROLINAS THROUGH 
TONIGHT...AND THUS...WILL FOLLOW THE NAM MODELS WARMER SOLUTION FOR 
THE FORECAST AREA SINCE IT ALWAYS HANDLES THESE SCENARIOS BETTER 
THAN THE GFS. EXPECT PRECIP TO BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD TONIGHT...AS 
AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEEPENS OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY. NAM MODEL 
INDICATES THAT WET-BULB TEMPS WILL RISE ABOVE FREEZING ACROSS 
NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA LATER TONIGHT...SO FEEL THAT 
EVAPORATIVE COOLING WONT BE ENOUGH TO LOWER TEMPS BELOW FREEZING IN 
MOST OF THESE AREAS. SOME VALLEY LOCATIONS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND 
NORTHEAST TN WILL LIKELY BE HOVERING AROUND THE FREEZING MARK LATE 
TONIGHT...BUT WILL FORECAST TEMPS TO REMAIN SLIGHTLY ABOVE FREEZING 
IN THESE AREAS. THUS...WILL NOT MENTION ANY POSSIBILITY OF FREEZING 
RAIN IN THESE AREAS AND STICK WITH JUST A RAIN FORECAST. 

A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY MORNING... 
WITH COLDER AIR FILTERING IN DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. SOME 
LINGERING MOISTURE MAY RESULT IN SOME LIGHT SNOW THURSDAY NIGHT... 
BUT MAINLY ACROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. ANY SNOW
ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...AND 
SHOULD BE LIGHT SINCE MOISTURE WILL BE RAPIDLY DECREASING BEHIND THE 
FRONT. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN INDICATES THAT AN ACTIVE SOUTHERN JET 
STREAM WILL BRING ANOTHER CHANCE FOR LIGHT PRECIP ON SUNDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
CLOUDS WILL BE THICKENING OVERNIGHT AS OUR NEXT SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
APPROACHES.  THE SOUTHERN STREAM VORT SEEN IN WV IMAGERY OVER 
CO/NM AREA IS PROGGED BY THE MODELS TO BECOME SHEARED AND WEAKEN AS 
IT MOVES EAST. THE GFS IS A LITTLE FASTER TO BRING PRECIP INTO 
WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY...LIKELY DUE TO ITS 
STRONGER 500 MB VORT AXIS THAN THE NAM. SINCE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF 
LOW LEVEL DRY AIR TO BE OVERCOME...AND LIFT IS WEAK IN BOTH 
MODELS...WITH HOLD OFF ANY PRECIP MENTION UNTIL WEDNESDAY EVENING 
BUT BRING IN OVERCAST SKIES IN THE AFTERNOON. THE GFS IS STRONGER 
WITH THE CYCLOGENESIS NEAR THE GULF COAST ON WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...WHILE THE NAM HAS A MUCH WEAKER COASTAL LOW DEVELOPING WITH 
MORE EMPHASIS ON THE CLOSED LOW OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS. THIS 
RESULTS IN STRONGER WARM ADVECTION IN THE NAM AND THUS A WARMER 
TEMPERATURE PROFILE. GIVEN RECENT MODEL TENDENCIES OF THE GFS BEING 
TOO COLD AND THE NAM VERIFYING SLIGHTLY BETTER...THE NAM IS 
PREFERED. THUS PRECIP WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY WILL BE ALL 
LIQUID. POPS WILL BE CATEGORICAL LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH EARLY 
THURSDAY MORNING...DECREASING TO A CHANCE THURSDAY AFTERNOON. AT 00Z 
FRIDAY THE LOW LEVEL TROUGH AXIS/SURFACE FRONT PASSES 
THROUGH...SHIFTING WINDS TO WEST AND COLD ADVECTION ENSUES. MOISTURE 
MAY BE DEEP ENOUGH AND UPSLOPE COMPONENT STRONG ENOUGH FOR SOME 
LIGHT SNOW IN SW VA AND NE TN MTNS. WILL CONTINUE A CHANCE OF SNOW 
IN THIS AREA. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE CONFINED BELOW 850 MB WILL LINGER 
THROUGH FRIDAY...THEN HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS INCREASE FRIDAY NIGHT AHEAD 
OF THE NEXT SYSTEM. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
CONDITIONS WILL REMAIN COOLER THAN NORMAL AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS INTO THE AREA FROM THE NW. SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL E-W TROUGHING 
CONTINUES ALONG THE EASTERN 2/3RD OF THE NORTHERN UNITED STATES. 
CLOUD COVER AND PCPN CHANCES WILL BE REFINED PENDING POSITIONING AND 
STRENGTH OF WESTERN SHORT WAVE THAT GETS ABSORBED INTO SW-NE LAYER 
FLOW. THIS FLOW TIGHTENS BETWEEN NORTHERN TROUGH AND BUILDING RIDGE 
OVR THE BAHAMAS. FEATURE IS CURRENTLY PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH MRX 
CWA ON SUNDAY. EXPECT RATHER THICK CLOUD COVER BUT KEPT POP CHANCES 
LOW FOR NOW. PCPN SHOULD BE LIGHT AND START OFF AS A MIX EARLY 
SUNDAY BEFORE CHANGING TO A COLD RAIN AND ENDING AS LIGHT SNOW NE 
PARTS ON MONDAY. CLIPPER-TYPE SYSTEMS EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH

.DISCUSSION...LIGHT SNOW HAS BEEN INCREASING THE PAST HOUR AS STRONG 
VORTICITY MAXIMUM GENERATES ENOUGH LIFT FOR LIGHT RAIN IN THE VALLEY 
AREAS OF NE TN AND SW VA AND SNOW SHOWERS AT HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 
ZONES WERE UPDATED TO INCREASE POPS FROM CENTRAL SECTIONS NORTHWARD 
UNTIL MOISTURE FINALLY MOVES OUT. ADDED LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS BACK IN 
THE FORECAST THIS EVENING WHICH WILL AFFECT MAINLY THE HIGHER SLOPES 
OF THE NE MOUNTAINS AND THE SMOKIES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH A WEAK AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE ALONG THE FRONT ACROSS WESTERN KENTUCKY AND SOUTHERN 
ILLINOIS. SOUTHWEST WINDS CONTINUE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
MORNING...WHICH HAS KEPT TEMPS IN THE MID TO UPPER 30S IN MANY 
AREAS. AS A RESULT...LIGHT RAIN HAS BEEN REPORTED ACROSS CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH LIGHT SNOW OCCURRING 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN WHERE TEMPS ARE COLDER. AREA 
RADARS INDICATE THAT THE BULK OF THE LIGHT PRECIP IS OCCURRING OVER 
EASTERN KY AND SOUTHWEST VA...WITH SATELLITE IMAGES REVEALING THE 
COLDEST CLOUD TOPS ACROSS THESE AREAS AS WELL. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH CONTINUING THIS LIGHT SNOW THROUGH THE MORNING 
HOURS...AS THE LOW PRESSURE AREA MOVES ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND 
NORTHEAST TN. SNOW SHOULD GRADUALLY DIMINISH DURING THE AFTERNOON 
HOURS...AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA. SOME UPSLOPE FLOW 
WILL LIKELY PRODUCE SOME LINGERING SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS THIS 
AFTERNOON...BUT THIS SHOULD COME TO AN END BY THIS EVENING AS DRIER 
AIR FILTERS INTO THE REGION. SNOW ADVISORY APPEARS TO BE IN GOOD 
SHAPE AND WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE IT THROUGH THE AFTERNOON HOURS. AS 
FOR TEMPS...WILL FOLLOW CLOSE TO THE GFS MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS TODAY 
AND TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...GFS A LITTLE FASTER THAN NAM 
ON ONSET OF NEXT PRECIPITATION EVENT BEGINNING ON WEDNESDAY. STILL 
ENOUGH UNCERTAINTY ON TIMING OF EVENT TO KEEP POPS IN THE HIGH 
CHANCE LEVEL ON WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY AND THIS EVENT WILL BE ON 
THE EDGE OF A WINTERY EVENT BUT MOST LIKELY WILL LEAN TOWARDS MAINLY 
LIQUID PRECIPITATION. SOME AREAS MAY BEGIN AS SNOW BEFORE CHANGING 
OVER TO MAINLY RAIN. BEYOND THAT...NEXT SHOT A PRECIPITATION LOOKS 
LIKE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL STAY ON THE COOL 
SIDE OF NORMAL FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.

.DISCUSSION...SOME FLURRIES AND VERY LIGHT SNOW HAS BEEN FALLING AT 
TIMES SO FAR THIS EVENING ACROSS SW VA AND EXTREME NE TN WITH 
INCREASING VORTICITY AHEAD OF ALBERTA-TYPE SYSTEM THAT IS NOW 
SPREADING THE MAIN AREA OF PRECIPITATION INTO SOUTHERN IL AND 
WESTERN KY AS SEEN ON RADAR IN THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY. TEMPERATURES 
ARE STILL ABOVE FREEZING ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA EXCEPT FOR 
MOST OF WISE AND RUSSELL COUNTIES AND PART OF WASHINGTON COUNTY IN 
VA. WINDS ARE CONTINUING TO BLOW FROM THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST AT 
NEAR 10 MPH IN MOST PLACES AND MAY KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM FALLING 
UNTIL THE SNOW SHOWERS DEVELOP LATE TONIGHT. GFS AND NAM ARE STILL 
SHOWING THIS SYSTEM MOVING QUICKLY SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE  TENNESSEE 
VALLEY LATER TONIGHT AND EARLY MONDAY. STILL THINK START TIME OF 
ADVISORY IS GOOD. THE TRACK OF THE SYSTEM STILL LOOKS TO BE ACROSS 
KY INTO SW VA AND NE TN LATE TONIGHT AND MONDAY BEFORE MOVING EAST 
ACROSS THE REST OF VA DURING THE AFTERNOON. MODELS ARE TRENDING A 
LITTLE HIGHER IN SNOWFALL AMOUNTS WITH THE 18Z RUN BUT WITH THE MAIN 
PRECIPITATION AREA STILL SEVERAL HOURS AWAY DO NOT WANT TO MAKE ANY 
MAJOR CHANGES. WILL TWEAK POPS SLIGHTLY TONIGHT WITH THE INCREASE OF

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
412 PM EST SUN DEC 11 2005

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
MAIN FORECAST CONCERN FOR THE SHORT-TERM IS ALBERTA-TYPE SYSTEM THAT 
IS CURRENTLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS/MIDWEST. BOTH THE GFS AND 
NAM SHOWS THIS SYSTEM MOVING QUICKLY SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE OHIO AND 
TENNESSEE VALLEYS LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY MONDAY. TRACK OF SURFACE LOW
WILL BE ACROSS KENTUCKY INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE 
...SO BEST SNOWFALL POTENTIAL WILL BE ALONG AND NORTH OF THE TRACK. 
PWS AHEAD OF SYSTEM IS AROUND .40 INCH. FAIRLY DECENT ISENTROPIC 
LIFT AND JET DYNAMICS TO PRODUCE A QUICK SHOT OF LIFT FROM AFTER 06Z 
TONIGHT TO MID-MORNING MONDAY...THEN NORTHWEST FLOW SNOWFALL 
ANTICIPATED FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. AFTER COORDINATION...WILL 
ISSUE A SNOW ADVISORY FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE 
MOUNTAINS WITH 1 INCH OR LESS FOR THE TRI-CITIES AND NORTHERN 
PLATEAU. FOR THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS WILL CALL FOR UP TO 2 INCHES.

SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE LIMITED SOME SINCE TEMPERATURES WILL 
NOT DROP MUCH BELOW FREEZING...EXCEPT FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS... 
DURING THE EVENT.

TIGHTENING PRESSURE GRADIENTS TONIGHT AND MONDAY WILL PRODUCE BREEZY
CONDITIONS...BUT WILL KEEP BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...ONLY CONFIDENT PERIODS 
FOR THE LONG TERM ARE THE EARLIEST PERIODS...WITH POSSIBLY A FEW 
FLURRIES LINGERING IN THE EAST MONDAY EVENING THEN GRADUAL CLEARING 
AND DRY WEATHER FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT.  THIS WAS A CHANGE 
FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST/GRIDS.  

UNCERTAINTY COMES AS EARLY AS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...WITH HPC 
FAVORING ECMWF MODEL FOR TIMING OF NEXT SYSTEM (MAINLY RAIN).  GFS 
AND NAM DELAYED ONSET OF PRECIPITATION (PCPN) ON WEDNESDAY BUT WOULD 
SUPPORT CATEGORICAL POPS BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  ECMWF WOULD ALSO BRING 
MAINLY A RAIN EVENT FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BUT A QUICKER RETURN TO 
DRY WEATHER ON THURSDAY.  FOR NOW...KEPT FORECAST/GRIDS IN LINE WITH 
NEIGHBORING OFFICES...AND CARRIED RAIN OR SNOW CHANCES INTO THURSDAY.
OUR POPS FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WERE BUMPED UP TO HIGHEST END OF CHANCE 
...AND MAY NEED HIGHER VALUES FROM LATER SHIFTS TO BE MORE IN LINE 
WITH LATEST GFSX MOS NUMBERS.  ENSEMBLE FORECASTS SHOWED A GOOD DEAL 
OF VARIANCE THESE PERIODS...ALSO LEADING TO LOW CONFIDENCE.  

KEPT FORECAST DRY FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY AS NEARLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT 
BECOMES SOUTHWEST BY LATE SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY.  NO APPARENT 
SHORTWAVE IN THIS SOUTHWEST FLOW...SO JUST ADDED LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
NOW SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY.  HPC MAX TEMP GRID FOR SUNDAY SEEMED

.DISCUSSION...
FIRST SHORT-WAVE MOVED EAST OF THE AREA EARLY THIS MORNING. WRAP-AROUND
BOUDARY LAYER MOISTURE IS PRODUCING AN AREA OF CLOUDS ACROSS MUCH OF THE
FORECAST AREA.  HOWEVER...BACK EDGE IS MOVING ACROSS THE PLATEAU COUNTIES
WITH WARM AIR ADVECTION CLOUDINESS FOLLOWING CLOSELY BEHIND OVER KENTUCKY
AND NORTHERN HALF OF TENNESSEE. WILL CONTINUE MOSTLY CLOUDY SKY NORTHERN
TWO-THIRDS WITH PARTLY CLOUDY FOR THE CHATTANOOGA AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON.

NEXT SHORT-WAVE IS EVIDENT ON WATER-VAPOR ACROSS THE FAR NORTHERN 
PLAINS. THIS WAVE WILL QUICKLY MOVE SOUTHEAST WITH ASSOCIATED SURFACE
LOW TRACKING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT AND MONDAY 
MORNING. DYNAMICS AND MOISTURE STRONGER WITH THIS NEXT WAVE WITH GOOD
ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF THE WAVE THAT WILL GIVE SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE A SHOT OF PRECIPITATION. NAM AND GFS SHOWS TEMPERATURE
PROFILE COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW WITH SEVERAL INCHES POSSIBLE.

MAY NEED TO ISSUE A SNOW ADVISORY FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS FOR LATE TONIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING. FOR TRI-CITES
AND NORTHERN PLATEAU...SNOW ACCUMULATIONS UP TO 1 INCH IS POSSIBLE.

250 AM EST SUN DEC 11 2005

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH SOUTHWEST WINDS 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA KEEPING TEMPS IN THE 30S. SATELLITE IMAGES 
REVEAL AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDINESS OVER THE OHIO AND TN RIVER 
VALLEYS ASSOCIATED WITH A DEEPENING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH. MODELS ARE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL BRING SOME LIGHT 
PRECIP ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...WITH 
THE COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE FORECAST AREA TOWARDS EVENING. A 
STRONG UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL QUICKLY MOVE ALONG THIS LONG WAVE 
TROUGH...BRINGING AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE AND A BETTER CHANCE FOR 
PRECIP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT. LATEST 
MODEL RUNS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH TRENDING TOWARD MORE MOISTURE 
WITH THIS SHORT WAVE...BUT IT STILL APPEARS THAT THERE WILL NOT BE 
ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN MINOR SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. 
WILL PLAN TO REISSUE THE SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT FOR THE AREA... 
BUT WILL NOT MAKE MANY CHANGES TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO FOLLOW CLOSE TO THE GFS MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
TODAY THROUGH MONDAY.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...SLOW MODERATING TREND 
IN STORE AS EASTERN CONUS TROUGH PULLS OUT AND SHORT WAVE RIDGING 
BUILDS INTO THE REGION BEFORE NEXT SIGNIFICANT EVENT APPROACHES ON 
WEDNESDAY. STILL SOME DOUBT ON TIMING OF PRECIP ONSET WITH THIS 
EVENT AS SERF AND CANADIAN GEM DEPICT PRECIP ENTERING THE WESTERN 
HALF OF OUR CWA BY 12Z WEDNESDAY...BUT GFS HOLDING PRECIP ONSET 
UNTIL AROUND 18Z. NAM IS EVEN SLOWER AS IT DEPICTS PRECIP JUST 
ENTERING WEST TENNESSEE BY 12Z WEDNESDAY...ITS FURTHEST PROJECTION 
FOR THE 00Z RUN. THUS HAVE OPTED NOT TO MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO 
ONGOING GRIDS/FORECAST. HOWEVER...PRECIP ONSET TIMING WILL LIKELY 
PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN INITIAL PRECIP TYPE AS AN AFTERNOON ONSET 
WOULD TEND TO FAVOR ALL RAIN. ANTICIPATE MAINLY A RAIN EVENT IN ANY 
CASE AS WAA STRENGTHENS ON SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW. SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW 
CONTINUES THROUGH THE BALANCE OF THE PERIOD WITH TEMPS CONTINUING TO 
MODERATE TO ACTUALLY ABOVE CLIMO BY LATE NEXT WEEKEND.

WEAK SHORTWAVE IS MOVING THROUGH KY AND OH WITH A FEW CLOUDS PASSING 
THROUGH EAST CENTRAL TN ON THE TAIL END. NEXT STRONGER SHORTWAVE IS 
MOVING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES SOUTHWEST INTO

NOT PRODUCE ANY PRECIPITATION BEFORE MORNING. TEMPERATURES ARE A FEW 
DEGREES LOWER THAN WHAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE GRIDS BUT DEWPOINTS ARE 
ABOUT THE SAME OR A DEGREE OR TWO HIGHER. WILL KEEP LOWS THE SAME.

343 PM EST SAT DEC 10 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MAIN ACTION THESE PERIODS
TO BE PROVIDED BY A COUPLE OF FAST MOVING SHORTWAVES IN THE
DEEPENING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. STRONGEST SHORTWAVE IS THE SECOND
ONE THAT ARRIVES LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY. THIS ONE
PROVIDES SOME BRIEF WEAK UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE...CHANNELED
VORTICITY AND A SLIGHTLY DEEPER MOISTURE PROFILE (ALTHO STILL NOT
REAL IMPRESSIVE). LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW IS PRESENT BUT INSTABILITY
IS ALSO NOT THE MOST IMPRESSIVE WEVE SEEN WITH THESE TYPE OF
EVENTS (POSITIVE CAPES OF LESS THAN 50 J/KG).  

HOWEVER...DECIDED TO HIT THE LIGHT SNOW POTENTIAL A LITTLE HARDER
WITH THE SECOND SHORTWAVE...AND WENT FOR LIKELY POPS ACROSS SWRN
VA AND EXTREME NE TN...WHICH ALSO WAS NEEDED TO BLEND IN WITH
NEIGHBORING OFFICES TO THE NORTH AND EAST. FOR NOW HAVE SOME LIGHT
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IN THE FAVORED LOCATIONS...AND ISSUED A SHORT
SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT. SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA...
INCLUDING CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES NC MAY BARELY GET A FEW SNOW
SHOWERS OR FLURRIES FROM THIS EVENT.

MOS MIN TEMPS LOOKED GOOD FOR TONIGHT AS CLOUDS INCREASE LATE...
THEN GENERALLY UNDERCUT MOS MAX TEMPS FOR BOTH SUNDAY AND MONDAY
DUE TO CLOUDS...SNOW AND COLD AIR ADVECTION. POPS ARE CLOSER TO THE
HIGHER MOS POPS FROM THE NAM GUIDANCE.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...NORTHWEST FLOW CAA 
CLIPPER MANIA ENDS BY MONDAY NIGHT WHILE AREA ENJOYS A PERIOD OF IN 
BETWEEN SYSTEM RIDGING AND DRY WEATHER DURING THE DAYTIME PERIOD 
TUESDAY. THAT NEXT SYTEM...AN UPPER LEVEL TROF AND ASSOCIATED 
SURFACE COLD FRONT DRIVE EAST THROUGH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON 
WEDNESDAY AND THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY THURSDAY EVENING. AS THE 
SYSTEM SPREADS PRECIP IN AN ISENTROPIC FASHION ACROSS THE REGION 
TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY MORNING THE PRECIP MAY TRANSITION FROM A 
SNOW/RAIN MIX BACK TO RAIN IN MOST AREAS BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON WITH 
THE RETURN OF WARMER AIR AHEAD OF THE FRONT. MIXED SOME SNOW SHOWERS 
IN WITH THE RAIN WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING DUE TO 
UNCERTAINTY WITH THE VERTICAL TEMPERATURE PROFILE AND THEN BACK TO 
RAIN MOST AREAS FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON BEFORE ENDING. ITS HARD TO 
BELIEVE BUT ACTUALLY HAVE FORECAST A DRY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AS A 
MORE ZONAL PATTERN RETURNS ALONG WITH SURFACE RIDGING.

1015 AM EST SAT DEC 10 2005

.DISCUSSION...A WEAK IMPULSE MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY IS 
PRODUCING MID TO HIGH CLOUDS...BUT MAINLY NORTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA 
LEAVING MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES FOR OUR REGION.  12Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW 
GOOD WARMING AT 850 MB LEVEL WITH TEMPS UP TO BETWEEN 3 AND 5 
DEGREES CELSIUS.  12Z OHX/RNK SOUNDINGS GENERALLY SUPPORT HIGHS THIS 
AFTERNOON IN THE 40S TO MID 50S.  FORECAST LOOKS TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE.

FOR FIRST OF SEVERAL FAST MOVING SHORTWAVES ON SUNDAY AND SUNDAY 
NIGHT...SEEMS NAM IS PRODUCING LESS LIGHT SNOW THAN GFS.  HARD TO 
GET VERY EXCITED ABOUT SNOW POTENTIAL WITH THIS FEATURE GIVEN THE 
LIMITED MOISTURE (POSSIBLY LIMITED TO 8000 FEET AND BELOW)... 
INSTABILITY OF LESS THAN 50 J/KG...AND ONLY MODERATE LOW LEVEL 
UPSLOPE FLOW.  THUS...DONT EXPECT MORE THAN UP TO 1 INCH OF SNOW 
POSSIBLY IN THE HIGHEST TERRAIN OF SWRN VA AND THE NRN MTNS OF TN
...AND THIS WOULD BE MAINLY ON THE WESTERN FACING SLOPES OR PEAKS.

MORE ON THIS IN THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEYS... 
WITH TEMPS IN THE 20S ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGES 
REVEAL SOME HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE OZARKS ASSOCIATED WITH A STRONG 
UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT MOISTURE 
WILL BE LIMITED WITH THIS SHORT WAVE...SO ONLY EXPECT A SLIGHT 
INCREASE IN HIGH CLOUDS TODAY AS IT TRACKS NORTHEAST AND WEAKENS 
OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO FOLLOW CLOSE 
TO GFS MOS GUIDANCE TODAY AND TONIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES (SREF) 
ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH UPSLOPE FLOW EVENT FOR SUNDAY THROUGH 
EARLY TUESDAY AS TWO WEAK NORTHERN STREAM WAVES APPROACH...BUT VAST 
DIFFERENCES APPEAR IN THE PROJECTED POPS VALUES OF THE RESPECTIVE 
MODEL GUIDANCE WITH NAM PROJECTING NEAR LIKELY POPS FOR THE 
NORTHEASTERN ZONES AND GFS SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OR LOWER FOR MOST 
LOCATIONS SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. MODEL TIME HEIGHTS SHOW MOISTURE 
LIMITED TO A SHALLOW SURFACE LAYER...RATHER TYPICAL OF UPSLOPE 
EVENTS. APPEARS NAM POPS ARE OVERDONE IN NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY 
LOCATIONS. HOWEVER...DUE TO UNCERTAINTY HAVE NOT MADE ANY 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO EXISTING GRIDS/FORECAST. ALSO INTRODUCED 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ON WEDNESDAY AS 00Z GFS RUN HAS SPED UP NEXT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED
SLOWLY THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THE REGION...RANGING FROM LOWER 30S
ACROSS SWRN VA TO MID/UPR 40S IN SWRN NC.  SKIES REMAIN MOSTLY CLEAR
WITH JUST SOME PASSING CIRRUS CLOUDS.  LOW CLOUDINESS OVER NRN KY
AND W VA HAS BEEN SLIPPING SOUTH SLOWLY BUT ALSO ERODING.  WILL
COUNT ON THESE LOW CLOUDS STAYING NORTH OVERNIGHT...AND GO WITH
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND AT OR BELOW THE COOLER MOS MIN TEMPS.

BRIEF PERIOD OF UPPER LEVEL RIDGING IS OVER BY EARLY SATURDAY NIGHT
AS UPPER TROUGH GETS ESTABLISHED AGAIN ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.
STRONG BUT FAST MOVING SHORTWAVE DEEPENS THE TROUGH EARLY SUNDAY
AND PASSES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON.  SEEMS TO
BE ENOUGH MOISTURE WITH THIS FEATURE TO JUSTIFY A DECENT CHANCE OF
SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN...DOWN TO JUST FLURRIES EXTREME
SRN ZONES.  THINK ANY ACCUMULATIONS WOULD BE VERY LIGHT AND MAINLY
ON WESTERN FACING SLOPES OF HIGHER TERRAIN.  WILL GO WITH OR JUST
UNDERCUT THE COOLER MOS VALUES FOR HIGH TEMPS SUNDAY DUE TO THE
CLOUDS AND COLD AIR ADVECTION.  OTHERWISE...GFS MOS OR BLEND FOR
SAT MAXES AND SAT NIGHT MINS LOOKED GOOD.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...WILL KEEP A SLGT CHC 
FOR -SHSN GOING ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
SUNDAY NIGHT AND HANG ONTO A SLGT CHC POP FOR SAME MONDAY ACROSS 
JUST SOME MAJOR TERRAIN AREAS ACROSS THIS REGION FOR CAA UPSLOPE 
CONTINUATION AND REMOVED FINALLY AT MIDNIGHT. HAD TO INTRODUCE SLGT 
CHC POP FOR -SHRA ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH 
CAROLINA TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT AS WEAK WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE 
REGION. WEDNESDAY DAY TIME PERIOD TURNS OUT TO BE ATTM THE LUCKY 
PRECIP-FREE DAY ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. BUT THE CHANCE FOR
RAIN (AND SOME SNOW MIXED WITH THE RAIN ACROSS HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS  
INCLUDING CUMBERLAND PLATEAU/SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE) WILL BE BACK IN THE FORECAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
THURSDAY NIGHT AS ANOTHER AMPLIFIED UPPER TROF/CLOSED LOW SHIFTS 
EAST INTO THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY/GREAT LAKES REGION WITH DECENT 
MOISTURE ADVECTION/LIFT PROGGED. AS USUAL...THESE LONGER RANGE TIME

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH 
COLDER AND DRIER AIR BEGINNING TO FILTER INTO THE FORECAST AREA. 
RADAR INDICATES ONLY A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS ACROSS EXTREME 
NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA...BUT THESE SHOULD EXIT THE AREA 
SHORTLY WITH NO UPSTREAM ECHOES NOTED ON AREA RADARS. WITH THIS IN 
MIND...WILL PLAN TO CANCEL THE SNOW ADVISORY EARLY THIS MORNING WITH 
DRIER AIR EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA. VAD WIND PROFILE 
FROM KMRX REVEALS THAT WINDS ALOFT ARE WEAKENING BEHIND THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE. MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS WEAKENING TREND WILL CONTINUE 
TODAY...AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE FORECAST AREA. THUS...WILL 
ALSO CANCEL THE WIND ADVISORY FOR THE MOUNTAINS EARLY THIS MORNING. 
CLOUDS SHOULD GRADUALLY DECREASE THIS MORNING...WITH MOST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA BECOMING MOSTLY SUNNY BY THIS AFTERNOON. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO FOLLOW GFS MOS NUMBERS TODAY AND TONIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...GENERALLY TRANQUIL 
WEATHER ANTICIPATED...ALTHOUGH TEMPS WILL TEND TO BE BELOW CLIMO 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD AS LONGWAVE TROUGH PERSISTS OVER THE 
EASTERN CONUS. EXCEPTIONS ARE SHORT WAVE TROUGH WHICH SWINGS THROUGH 
THE REGION ON SUNDAY AND A MORE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM WHICH APPROACHES 
ON THURSDAY. APPEARS LACK OF MOISTURE WILL PRECLUDE THE SUNDAY EVENT 
FROM BEING ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT...AND OUR NORTHERN TIER WILL BE ON 
THE SOUTHERN FRINGE OF PRECIP FIELD PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE (SREF)

OBSERVED TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE AREA HAVE BEEN HOLDING NEARLY
STEADY IN THE UPPER 30S TO MID 40S. THIS IS ABOUT 5 TO 10 DEGREES
WARMER THAN FORECAST. DEWPOINTS ARE ALSO HIGH...MID 30S TO LOWER
40S. THUS THE WET BULB ZERO DEGREE ISOTHERM IS WELL OUT OF OUR
AREA...ELIMINATING ANY POSSIBILITY OF FREEZING RAIN. TEMPS WILL NOT
DROP UNTIL A COLD FRONT NOW NEAR NASHVILLE PASSES THROUGH. BY THIS
TIME MOST OF THE PRECIPITATION WILL HAVE ENDED. RUC SHOWS VERY DRY
AIR MOVING IN FROM AROUND 850 MB AND HIGHER IN THE PLATEAU AROUND
06Z AND IN THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AROUND 09Z. THE KMRX VWP DOES SHOW
THAT WINDS ARE NOW BACKING WITH HEIGHT...INDICATING THAT COLD
ADVECTION HAS BEGUN ALOFT...AND ERODING THE WARM NOSE ALOFT. BUT
GIVEN WARM TEMPS SURFACE COOLING WILL BE SLOW UNTIL THE FROPA.

THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY WILL BE DROPPED FOR THE TN PLATEAU
COUNTIES AND LEE...SCOTT...AND WISE COUNTIES IN VA. HIGHER
ELEVATIONS IN SW VA AND NE TN STILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SEE SOME
ACCUMULATION...SO WILL KEEP THE ADVISORY GOING THERE. SPS WILL BE

WEATHER OCCURRING TONIGHT. LARGE AREA OF RAIN FINALLY REACHING
WESTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA AT THIS TIME...AS UPPER LOW HAS
EASED EAST INTO THE MID TO UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY..AND SURFACE
LOW HAS DEVELOPED OVER WESTERN PARTS OF TN AND KY. BELIEVE SOME
DOWNSLOPING HAS INITIALLY KEPT EASTERN PARTS OF THE VALLEY DRY TODAY.

TEMPS WARMED CONSIDERABLY IN ADVANCE OF THIS SYSTEM...EVEN REACHING
INTO THE LOWER 50S AT TYS AND RHP.  NAM MODEL SHOWS STRONGER LOW
LEVEL JET AND A MUCH DIFFERENT/WARMER LOW LEVEL TEMPERATURE PROFILE
THAN GFS.  KMRX VAD WIND PROFILE WOULD SLIGHTLY FAVOR THE WEAKER
GFS LOW LEVEL JET AT THIS TIME.  GFS TEMP PROFILE FAVORS MORE SNOW
THAN NAM WHICH SUPPORTS A PROLONGED RAIN OR MIXED EVENT.

COMPROMISED TOWARD THE GFS AND CONSISTENCY WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST...
ALLOWING A MIX WITH SNOW AND SLEET THEN MOSTLY LIGHT SNOW LATE
TONIGHT...BEFORE THE LIFT RATHER QUICKLY DIMINISHES.  IN LINE WITH
HPC/WWD WINTER WEATHER GRAPHICS...INCLUDED SOME VERY LIGHT ICING
AMOUNTS POSSIBLE IN PARTS OF RUSSELL...WASHINGTON COUNTIES OF SW VA
AND OUR NRN MTNS OF NE TN.  POSITION AND TIMING OF THE UPPER LOW
SEEMS TO KEEP SOME LINGERING MOISTURE AT LEAST IN EASTERN PARTS OF
THE FORECAST AREA UP TO NEAR 12Z FRIDAY. 

WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY POSTED FOR AREAS MOST LIKELY TO GET A BRIEF
LIGHT SNOW AND/OR SLEET OCCURRENCE LATE TONIGHT.  SPS ISSUED FOR
THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA.

COMMENTS ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT WILL BE LIMITED TO LITTLE IF
ANY CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS/FORECAST AS MUCH DRIER AIR MOVES IN
QUICKLY. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...RIDGING SFC AND ALOFT 
WILL DRY AND COLD WX REGIME IN PLACE SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. 
LARGE UPPER TROF BUILDS EAST ENCOMPASSING THE EASTERN HALF OF THE 
NATION BY SUNDAY WITH MODERATELY DEEP COLUMN OF MOISTURE SWINGING 
SOUTHEAST FROM THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY ON SUNDAY SO USED A 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR -SHSN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE 
WITH SOME -RA MIXED IN FOR GOOD MEASURE MAINLY NORTHEAST TENNESSEE.
DRIED IT OUT FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY DESPITE NASTY PERSISTANT UPPER 
TROF IN PLACE OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WHICH GFS MODELS TRIES TO SHOW 
CONTINUED VORTS WITH LIMITED MOISTURE DROPPING SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE 
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. 

NEXT MAIN CHANCE FOR PRECIP BACK IN THE FORECAST FOR WEDNESDAY 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA AS UPPER TROF PRESSES 
EAST THROUGH THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS WITH A SURFACE LOW AND 
INVERTED TROF EXTENDING NORTH THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. EXTENDED 
SLIGHT CHANCE PRECIP (WHICH IS A RAIN/SNOW MIX ACROSS THE NORTHERN

950 AM EST THU DEC 8 2005

.DISCUSSION...THREAT OF WINTRY PRECIPITATION (PCPN) HAS DIMINISHED 
FOR TODAY...DUE TO LOW LEVEL WARMING ALREADY UNDERWAY AND A 
SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THE ONSET OF ANY PCPN THIS MORNING.

UPPER AIR ANALYSIS SHOWS 850 MB ZERO DEGREE ISOTHERM ACROSS NE TIP 
OF TN NORTHWARD ACROSS EXTREME ERN PARTS OF WASHINGTON AND RUSSELL 
COUNTIES OF SWRN VA.  MOST SURFACE OBSERVATIONS HAVE ALREADY WARMED 
WELL ABOVE 32 DEGREES EXCEPT FOR A FEW SITES ACROSS EXTREME NE TN 
AND SWRN VA...AND MANY OF THOSE ARE SCHOOL NET SITES WHICH TYPICALLY 
RUN COOLER ANYWAY.  VISIBLE SATELLITE PICS SHOW AREAS OF MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKIES WHICH HAS AIDED THE WARM UP.

CLOSEST LIGHT PCPN IS WORKING NORTHWARD ACROSS MAINLY WESTERN PARTS 
OF MIDDLE TN...IN AN AREA OF GOOD WARM AIR ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC 
LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LOW CENTERED OVER SE NEBRASKA AT 12Z.
MODELS GENERALLY BRING THIS LIGHT PCPN INTO WESTERN PARTS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS AFTERNOON...AND ACROSS REST OF THE AREA BY 
09/00Z.  THINKING NOW IS MOSTLY LIGHT RAIN FOR THE DAYTIME HOURS 
INTO THE EARLY EVENING...ALTHO WILL MONITOR THE COOLER EXTREME NE 
AREAS WHERE HIGHER VALLEYS MIGHT STILL HAVE A POTENTIAL FOR LIGHT 
FREEZING RAIN.  

FOR TONIGHT...EXPECT A RAIN MIX WITH SNOW/SLEET THEN CHANGE TO 
MOSTLY LIGHT SNOW AFTER 03-06Z...BUT ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE HINDERED 
BY RAPID DECREASE IN THE DEPTH OF AVAILABLE MOISTURE PLUS DEPARTURE 
OF BEST LIFT.  APPEARS THAT WE MIGHT NEED A SNOW OR WINTER WEATHER 
ADVISORY FOR SWRN VA AND PARTS OF NE TN...BUT WILL DECIDE ON THIS IN 
THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE AFTER WATCHING EVENT UNFOLD AND A LOOK AT 12Z 
MODEL RUN.

SLEET FOR TODAY.  GRIDS AND WEB PRODUCTS WILL ALSO GET FRESHENED.

420 AM EST THU DEC 8 2005

.DISCUSSION...MID/UPPER LOW NEAR THE NEBRASKA/KANSAS BORDER THIS 
MORNING. THIS POSITION IS SLOWER THEN PREVIOUS MODEL PROGS. AS A 
RESULT...THE SURFACE RIDGING DOWN THE EAST SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS 
HAS NOT BEEN AS STRONG. THIS HAS ALLOW THE DEVELOPING LOW LEVEL 
INVERTED TROUGH FROM THE GLFMEX TO EXTEND FARTHER UP INTO THE EAST 
TN VLY. TEMPERATURES...ESPECIALLY ALONG SW PART OF MRX CWA ARE 
RUNNING ABOVE FREEZING. MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUD COVER STREAMING 
INTO THE AREA HAS NEGATED PROLONGED COOLING OVERNIGHT. THERE IS 
SOME SNOW VIRGA MOVING ACROSS THE AREA BUT DP DEPRESSIONS ARE NOT 
LARGE ENOUGH TO INCREASE RISK OF FREEZING RAIN. BY THE TIME PCPN 
COMMENCES...TEMPS SHOULD BE ABOVE FREEZING. SHORT PERIODS OF 
FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET ARE POSSIBLE BUT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE 
HAZARDOUS. GOOD LONG FETCH ISENTROPIC LIFT RIDES INTO AREA IN THE 
OVERNIGHT HOURS SO WIDESPREAD RAINFALL ON TRACK. A SFC LOW WILL 
DEVELOP IN THE INVERTED TROUGH OVER MID TN LATER TODAY AND MOVE NNE 
TONIGHT. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE EAST INTO THE MRX CWA LATER TONIGHT.
THE RAIN WILL CHANGE OVER TO SNOW. THE BULK OF THE MOISTURE SHOULD 
BE EAST OF THE AREA AS THIS OCCURS SO SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE NOT 
EXPECTED TO EXCEED TWO INCHES. ROADWAYS WILL BE ICY EARLY ON FRIDAY 
ACROSS THE REGION. THE TROUGHING ACROSS THE EAST U.S. DEEPENS THIS 
WEEKEND WITH CONTINUED TEMPS BELOW NORMAL. A CLIPPER SYSTEM WILL 
BRING A SMALL CHANCE OF SNOW ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS LATER IN THE 
WEEKEND. DRY HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH CONTINUED 
BELOW NORMAL TEMPS.

.DISCUSSION...MOST TIME SPENT THIS MORNING VIEWING INCOMING MODEL 
DATA FOR SIGNIFICANT EVENT EXPECTED ON THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT.
MIXED PRECIPITATION (PCPN) FOR THE MOST PART...BUT SOME POTENTIAL 
FOR AT LEAST LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SWRN VA 
AND EXTREME NE TN (ESPECIALLY HIGHER VALLEYS OF NRN MTNS) WITH THIS 
EVENT.  SMOKIES MAY GET TOO MUCH OF A MIX OR PERIODS OF RAIN DUE TO 
THE LOW LEVEL WARM AIR ADVECTION.  NAM AND GFS SEEMED SIMILAR OVERALL
...ALTHO NAM A LITTLE FASTER WITH ONSET OF PCPN ON THURSDAY.  BOTH 
NAM AND GFS SEEM TO COOL ATMOSPHERE TO ALL SNOW NRN TWO THIRDS BY OR 
JUST AFTER 06Z FRIDAY...ALTHO AT THIS POINT THE MOISTURE IS RAPIDLY 
LEAVING WRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA.  

WILL REFINE THE WEATHER/POP GRIDS FOR THIS EVENT IN THE AFTERNOON 
PACKAGE...AFTER VIEWING ALL 12Z MODEL DATA AND COORDINATION WITH 
NEIGHBORING OFFICES.  PLAN ON AT LEAST AN UPDATED SPS AT THIS POINT.


FOR TODAY...MAX TEMP FORECAST APPEARS RIGHT ON TRACK BASED ON LATEST 
OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS.  SATELLITE PICS SHOW JUST PATCHES OF HIGH 
CLOUDS WORKING NORTH WITH THE SRN STREAM UPPER JET.  THUS...FORECAST 
LOOKS GOOD FOR REST OF TODAY.  WILL NOT UPDATE ZFPMRX...BUT PLAN TO

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
STRONG SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLIDE SOUTHEAST AND CONTINUE TO 
BUILD INTO THE AREA TONIGHT. WITH CLEAR SKIES AND CALM WINDS...TEMPS 
WILL DROP INTO THE 15 TO 25 RANGE. SKIES SHOULD REMAIN CLEAR THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY...AND TEMPS SHOULD BE A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER THAN TODAY. 
MIDLEVEL CLOUDS BEGIN TO INCREASE WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

TOMORROW A CLOSED UPPER LOW DEVELOPS OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS...AND 
STRENGTHENS AS IT MOVES SOUTHEAST. THIS RESULTS IN AN INVERTED 
TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER TN AND GULF MOISTURE TRANSPORT. THE MODELS 
HAVE COME INTO MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THIS SYSTEM AND ITS 
ASSOCIATED TEMPERATURE PROFILES OVER THE AREA. BOTH SHOW PRECIP 
ARRIVING IN OUR SW THURSDAY MORNING AND SPREADING NORTHEAST THROUGH 
THE DAY...A SLIGHTLY FASTER TREND THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. SURFACE 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE ABOVE FREEZING OVER THE ENTIRE AREA THROUGH 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...INCLUDING THE MOUNTAINS AS THE TEMPERATURE 
PROFILE BECOMES NEAR ISOTHERMAL OR SLIGHTLY INCREASING WITH HEIGHT. 
THERE COULD BE A BRIEF PERIOD OF FREEZING RAIN IN THE MOUNTAINS 
BEFORE THE 850 MB WARM ADVECTION KICKS IN...BUT CONFIDENCE IS NOT 
HIGH ENOUGH TO WARRANT A MENTION OF SUCH A BRIEF OCCURRENCE. AS THE 
CLOSED LOW CROSSES THE UPPER MS VALLEY REGION...IT INDUCES 
CYCLOGENESIS OVER THE OHIO VALLEY.  THIS BRINGS COLD ADVECTION IN 
THE 750 TO 900 MB LAYER...REDUCING THE WARM NOSE AND CHANGING PRECIP 
OVER TO SNOW...FIRST ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SW VA...THEN 
GRADUALLY SOUTH AFTER MIDNIGHT. SOUTHERN AREAS COULD BRIEFLY SEE 
SNOW BEFORE THE PRECIP IS SHUT OFF BY MIDLEVEL DRYING. ALL MOISTURE 
IS CONFINED BELOW 850 MB BY 11Z FRIDAY...SO WILL END PRECIP AT THAT 
TIME. SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IN THE NORTHERN PLATEAU...SW VA...AND TN 
MTNS WILL BE LESS THAN 2 INCHES. A BIG CAVEAT IN THIS FORECAST IS IF 
TEMPERATURES ARE JUST A FEW DEGREES COOLER FROM 800 MB AND LOWER 
THAN THE MODELS SHOW. THIS COULD RESULT IN A MORE PROLONGED PERIOD 
OF SNOW AND GREATER ACCUMULATIONS...AS WELL AS FREEZING RAIN IN THE 
MOUNTAINS THURSDAY AFTERNOON. WILL CONTINUE WITH AN SPS TO HIGHLIGHT 
THIS EVENT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
THURSDAY EVENT PULLS OUT LEAVING GENERALLY DRY WEATHER THROUGH THE 
PERIOD WITH NO MAJOR FEATURES OF NOTE. HOWEVER...RIDGE WEST/TROUGH 
EAST LONGWAVE PATTERN WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE PERIOD. THIS PORTENDS 
TEMPS WILL TEND TO STAY COOL AND GENERALLY BELOW CLIMO. STAYED CLOSE 
TO GFSX GUIDANCE FOR TEMPS FOR THE MOST PART EXCEPT FOR BUMPING 
GUIDANCE TEMPS SLIGHTLY ON SUNDAY WHILE TRIMMING GUIDANCE TEMPS 
SLIGHTLY ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THIS WAS BASED ON ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS 
WHICH SUGGEST DEEPER EASTERN TROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK COMPARED TO 
OPERATIONAL GFS MODEL.

.DISCUSSION...
CLOUDS CONTINUE TO LINGER IN SW VA AND NE TN THIS MORNING. WHILE
DRIER AIR IS EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO THE AREA LATER TODAY AND
DISSIPATE THE CLOUDS...THE CURRENT MOSTLY SUNNY WORDING IN THAT
AREA IS PROBABLY TOO OPTIMISTIC. WILL UPDATE TO INCREASE CLOUDS IN
THE NORTHEAST. WILL ALSO ADJUST WIND DIRECTION TO ACCOUNT FOR A
MORE SOUTHWESTERLY COMPONENT. TEMPERATURES ARE GENERALLY ON TRACK
AND WILL BE UNCHANGED.

THOUGHTS ON 06Z MODEL RUNS REGARDING THURSDAY NIGHT PRECIP EVENT...
THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODELS ARE THE TIMING OF THE
PRECIP AND THE TEMPERATURE PROFILES. THE NAM IS FASTER TO BRING IN
PRECIP...AND SHOWS A STRONGER WARM NOSE THAN THE GFS. THIS IS
LIKELY DUE TO THE NAM SHOWING A LOW LEVEL JET THAT IS TWICE THE
STRENGTH OF THE LLJ IN THE GFS (40KTS VS 20KTS)...AS WELL AS A MUCH
STRONGER SURFACE LOW DEVELOPING OVER ERN KY AND OHIO VALLEY.
BELIEVE THAT THE NAM IS OVERDONE WITH THE LLJ AND THE SURFACE
LOW...AND THUS THE WARM ADVECTION. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE
IF THE MODELS CONTINUE THESE TRENDS WITH THE 12Z MODEL RUN.

ANTICIPATE ALL ORGANIZED PRECIP TO HAVE MOVED OUT BY EARLY EVENING 
AS MODEL TIME HEIGHTS DEPICT RAPID DRYING AT ALL LEVELS WITH 
MOISTURE CONFINED TO A SHALLOW SURFACE LAYER. COULD STILL SEE A FEW 
SNOW SHOWERS/FLURRIES IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN BUT EVEN THIS SHOULD END 
BY MID-FIRST PERIOD. THUS WILL DROP ALL ADVISORIES WITH ISSUANCE OF 
AFTERNOON PACKAGE. 

COLD ADVECTION WILL CONTINUE TO CAUSE TEMPS TO FALL OVERNIGHT... 
ESPECIALLY AS CLEARING COMMENCES FROM WEST TO EAST. REMAINDER OF 
SHORT TERM APPEARS GENERALLY TRANQUIL AS UPPER TROUGH PULLS AWAY AND
UPPER FLOW DEAMPLIFIES INTO A NEARLY ZONAL FLOW. TEMPS WILL REMAIN
SOMEWHAT BELOW CLIMO HOWEVER. GUIDANCE TEMPS ARE GENERALLY CLOSE
AND APPEAR REASONABLE.


.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AND WEAK RIDGING ALOFT WILL BUILD INTO THE 
AREA FROM THE NORTHWEST TUESDAY NIGHT...ALONG WITH A REINFORCING 
SHOT OF COLD AIR ON WEDNESDAY. MEANWHILE A CLOSED LOW WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE GREAT PLAINS. AS THE RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS EAST...A LOW TO 
MID LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW TRANSPORTS MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING 
LOW ON THURSDAY. AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE CWA IN 
RESPONSE TO THE LOW AND THE STRONG UPPER JET...AND ISENTROPIC LIFT 
STRENGTHENS THROUGH THE DAY ON THURSDAY. GFS IS SLIGHTLY FASTER WITH 
THE SYSTEM THAN THE NAM...AND COLDER AS WELL. GFS INDICATES AN ALL

MIX. GIVEN THESE DIFFERENCES THIS FAR OUT...WILL KEEP IT SIMPLE AND 
MENTION ONLY RAIN OR SNOW IN CLIMATOLOGICALLY FAVORED AREAS WITH 
CHANCE POPS. WILL END PRECIP IN ALL AREAS BY 12Z FRIDAY. 

REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST WILL REMAIN DRY. A NORTHWEST FLOW ON 
FRIDAY BACKS TO A SOUTHWEST FLOW ON MONDAY AHEAD OF ANOTHER 
DEEPENING TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS. GIVEN THE INCONSISTENCIES OF THE 
MODELS OF LATE...ESPECIALLY THAT FAR OUT...WILL INTRODUCE MONDAY

915 PM EST SUN DEC 4 2005

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT ACROSS CENTRAL AL AND 
CENTRAL GA STRETCHING NORTHEAST ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE 
APPALACHIANS. TEMPS REMAIN IN THE LOWER TO MID 40S ACROSS MOST OF 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...EXCEPT ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU WHERE TEMPS ARE ALREADY IN THE MID 30S. AN AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE HAS BEGUN TO FORM ACROSS EAST CENTRAL AL NEAR MONTGOMERY 
ALONG THE FRONT...AND THIS SURFACE LOW SHOULD CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN 
OVERNIGHT IN RESPONSE TO A DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH OVER THE LOWER MS 
RIVER VALLEY. NAM AND GFS MODELS CONTINUE TO REVEAL SOME 
DISCREPANCIES IN THEIR VERTICAL THERMAL PROFILES...WITH THE GFS 
MODEL INDICATING A COLDER PROFILE FOR NORTHERN AND WESTERN SECTIONS 
OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS COLDER GFS PROFILE APPEARS TO BE THE 
RESULT OF A MORE EASTWARD TRACK OF THE SURFACE LOW OVERNIGHT 
(COMPARED TO THE NAM SOLUTION). HOWEVER...THE NAM MODEL APPEARS TO 
HAVE INITIALIZED SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE GFS THIS EVENING 
(ACCORDING TO 00Z OBS)...AND WILL GENERALLY FOLLOW ITS WARMER 
SOLUTION TONIGHT. 

THE NAM MODEL REVEALS MORE OF A WARM BOUNDARY LAYER OVERNIGHT... 
WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN A RAIN/SNOW MIX FOR MOST OF THE VALLEY AREAS. 
A MOSTLY SNOW SCENARIO SHOULD DEVELOP AS FORECASTED ACROSS THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...NORTHEAST TN MOUNTAINS AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF 
SOUTHWEST VA TOWARDS SUNRISE...WITH SOME SLEET MIXING IN FROM TIME 
TO TIME DURING THE MORNING HOURS AFTER SUNRISE. SOME FRONTOGENETICAL 
FORCING IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP AROUND SUNRISE ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST VA...WHICH SHOULD INCREASE LIFT ACROSS THIS AREA RESULTING 
IN SOME ADDITIONAL DYNAMICAL COOLING FROM HEAVIER PRECIP. THUS... 
ALTHOUGH SURFACE TEMPS MAY BE HOVERING ABOVE FREEZING IN THE VALLEYS 
OF NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA AROUND SUNRISE...THINK THAT THIS 
HEAVIER PRECIP AFTER SUNRISE SHOULD HELP TO LOWER THESE TEMPS ENOUGH 
TO ALLOW ACCUMULATIONS OF SNOW IN THE VALLEYS. CURRENT WARNINGS AND 
ADVISORIES LOOK TO BE ON TRACK FOR THE MOST PART...BUT WILL LOWER 
TOTAL SNOWFALL AMOUNTS ACROSS THE VALLEYS OF NORTHEAST TN TO AROUND 
AN INCH OR TWO SINCE SNOW SHOULD HAVE A TOUGH TIME ACCUMULATING 
INITIALLY. DONT REALLY THINK SNOW WILL BE ABLE TO ACCUMULATE IN THE 
CENTRAL TN VALLEY WITH TEMPS EXPECTED TO REMAIN ABOVE FREEZING 
OVERNIGHT.

WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS EVENING MAINLY TO FRESHEN-UP 
THE WORDING...BUT WILL GENERALLY LEAVE TEMPS AND WINDS ALONE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...LATEST MODEL RUNS HAVE PROVIDED 
VERY LITTLE CLARIFICATION FOR UPCOMING EVENT. THERES GENERAL 
AGREEMENT ON DEVELOPMENT OF A WAVE ON COLD FRONT NEAR THE GULF COAST 
AND MOVING IT NORTHEAST TONIGHT. THERE ARE CRITICAL DIFFERENCES 
IN THE TRACK HOWEVER...SO CONFIDENCE REMAINS LOW. NAM TRACKS SURFACE 
LOW JUST SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA WHICH IS VERY FAVORABLE 
FOR A POTENTIAL HEAVY SNOW EVENT SYNOPTICALLY. HOWEVER...THE GFS 
SUPPRESSES THE TRACK FARTHER SOUTH AND EAST RESULTING IN MOST OF THE 
PRECIP OCCURRING ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS. THE 
CANADIAN GEM GENERALLY LENDS SUPPORT TO THE GFS SOLUTION. 
INCLINATION IS TO FAVOR SHORT-RANGE ENSEMBLES (SREF) WHICH APPEARS 
TO REPRESENT A REASONABLY GOOD COMPROMISE OF SOLUTIONS. BASED ON 
THIS SOLUTION...WARNING CRITERIA WOULD BE REACHED IN OUR SW VIRGINIA 
COUNTIES AND THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS. ADVISORY CRITERIA APPEARS 
POSSIBLE IN NE TENNESSEE AND NORTHERN PLATEAU AND POSSIBLY CENTRAL 
MOUNTAINS...ALTHOUGH FORECAST SOUNDINGS WOULD TEND TO FAVOR MIX. FOR 
TEMPS...GENERALLY WENT SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN GFS GUIDANCE VALUES.




.LONG TERM...(MON NIGHT THROUGH SUN)...ANY LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS 
EARLY MON NIGHT SHOULD DIMINISH AND END BY TUE MORNING.  MODELS HAVE 
COME INTO SOMEWHAT BETTER AGREEMENT FOR THE LONGER TERM...WILL 
GENERALLY FOLLOW HPC SOLUTION WHICH KEEPS THINGS DRY...WITH TEMPS 
BELOW CLIMO FOR THE MOST PART.  GFS IS SHOWING POSSIBILITY OF A 
SYSTEM BRINGING PRECIP BY SUN...BUT WITH IT BEING DAY 7 WILL LEAVE 
IT OUT FOR NOW AND WAIT TO SEE IF OTHER MODELS AND LATER RUNS 
CONFIRM.  WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM GFS MOS TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...RATHER COMPLICATED SCENARIO 
SETTING UP THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS A SERIES OF DISCRETE WEATHER 
SYSTEMS AFFECTS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. INITIAL SYSTEM CURRENT 
PASSING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA IS PROJECTED TO EXIT THE AREA BY 
EARLY FIRST PERIOD. HOWEVER...THIS WILL BE FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY NEXT 
SYSTEM WHICH AGAIN GIVES US ANOTHER EVENT IN THE OVERNIGHT TIME 
FRAME. GFS DEPICTS A SOMEWHAT LESS ORGANIZED SYSTEM THAN EITHER NAM 
OR THE SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLES. HOWEVER...CATEGORICAL POPS SEEMS 
REASONABLE IN ANY EVENT. ANTICIPATING PRECIP TO BE ALL RAIN AS WAA 
CONTINUES. MODEL TIME HEIGHTS DEPICT LOW-LEVEL WINDS INCREASING TO 
NEAR 50 KNOTS...SO WILL ISSUE WIND ADVISORY FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
FOR TONIGHT. THIS FEATURE MOVES RAPIDLY EASTWARD AND IS FOLLOWED BY 
A BRIEF RESPITE IN THE SECOND PERIOD. THE NEXT SYSTEM WILL APPROACH 
FROM THE SOUTHWEST LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY 
FAVORED GFS GUIDANCE VALUES WHICH REPRESENTED A GOOD COMPROMISE OF 
THE GUIDANCE NUMBERS.


.LONG TERM...(SUN NIGHT THROUGH SAT)...VERY INTERESTING AND
DIFFICULT FORECAST FOR SUN NIGHT AND MON. MODELS HAVE TRENDED
WETTER AND COLDER. EXACT TRACK AND STRENGTH OF LOW PRESSURE MOVING
NORTHEAST ALONG THE FRONT WILL BE KEY. FOR NOW AM GOING WITH A
GFS/NAM BLEND...BUT CLOSER TO THE GFS. THIS ALLOWS CONSIDERABLE
MOISTURE AND LIFT TO AFFECT THE REGION LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO
MONDAY...AND THERMAL PROFILES INDICATE WE MAY BE DEALING WITH SOME
WINTRY PRECIP...ESPECIALLY NORTH AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WITH
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE TO THE NORTH AND DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE
MOVING BY TO THE SOUTH AND THEN SOUTHEAST...LOW LEVEL FLOW SHOULD
BE NORTH AND NORTHEAST OVER OUR AREA...BRINGING IN COLDER AIR FROM
THE NORTH.  NAM COLDER...AND INDICATES MAINLY SNOW NORTH...AND SNOW
POSSIBLE OVER MUCH OF THE AREA DEPENDING ON HOW COOL THE BOUNDARY
LAYER GETS. GFS IS WARMER...INDICATING MAINLY A COLD RAIN CENTRAL
AND SOUTH...BUT STILL VERY CLOSE TO A SNOW PROFILE. WITH THIS BEING
MAINLY A LATE THIRD AND FOURTH PERIOD EVENT...AND GIVEN SOMEWHAT
POOR MODEL RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY SO FAR...WILL LEAVE ANY POSSIBLE
WATCH ISSUANCE FOR LATER. HOWEVER...WILL ISSUE AN SPS HIGHLIGHTING
POSSIBILITY OF ACCUMULATING SNOW. AFTER SOME LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS
MON NIGHT...WILL GO DRY REMAINDER OF FORECAST PER HPC

THIS BISECTS HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE RESULTING IN INCREASED SW FLOW 
WHICH WORKS ITS DOWN FROM 700 MB AND PEAKS NEAR 850 MB OVRNGT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...MAIN FORECAST ISSUE IS TIMING 
PROGRESS OF APPROACHING EVENT IN THE SECOND PERIOD. UPPER FLOW 
CONTINUES TO DEAMPLIFY AS UPPER TROUGH PULLS OFF THE EAST COAST. 
MINOR SHORTWAVE IS PROJECTED TO DEVELOP IN NEARLY ZONAL FLOW THAT 
RESULTS BY EARLY IN THE SECOND PERIOD. THIS WILL PROVIDE ENOUGH 
ISENTROPIC LIFT TO INCREASE CLOUDS BY LATE IN THE FIRST PERIOD...AND 
SPREAD GENERALLY LIGHT PRECIP SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA 
THROUGH THE SECOND PERIOD. THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT PRECIP COULD 
INITIALLY BEGIN AS LIGHT SNOW OR SLEET IN OUR SW VIRGINIA COUNTIES 
AS SURFACE TEMPS WET-BULB BACK DOWN CLOSE TO FREEZING AT PRECIP 
ONSET PER MODEL TIME HEIGHTS. HOWEVER...THIS SHOULD BE SHORT-LIVED 
AS GOOD WARM ADVECTION PUSHES TEMPS IN THE LOWER LEVELS TO WELL 
ABOVE FREEZING BY LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD...AND SIGNIFICANT 
ACCUMULATIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE 
VALUES FAIRLY CLOSELY FOR BOTH TEMPS AND POPS...ALTHOUGH DID TWEAK 
TEMPS IN THE SECOND PERIOD SLIGHTLY TO REFLECT ANTICIPATED 
WAA...ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN TIER.


.LONG TERM...(SAT NIGHT THROUGH FRI)...TOUGH FORECAST FOR THE LONGER 
TERM.  MODELS DIVERGE WITH TIME...BUT STILL LOOKS LIKE GFS BETTER 
THAN THE NAM THIS RUN...SO WILL GO CLOSER TO ITS SOLUTION.  THIS 
KEEPS PRECIP IN THE FORECAST THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...THEN AS WAVE OF 
LOW PRESSURE MOVES BY TO OUR SOUTHEAST...COLDER AIR PUSHES IN MONDAY 
WHICH MAY ALLOW PRECIP TO MIX WITH AND CHANGE TO SNOW BEFORE 
ENDING.  LOOKS LIKE BEST CHANCES FOR ANY ACCUMULATION MONDAY WOULD 
BE OVER THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND PARTS OF SW VA...BUT STILL A LOT OF 
UNCERTAINTY AT THIS POINT...WILL HAVE TO WATCH LATER MODEL RUNS. FOR 
NOW WILL MENTION POSSIBILITY OF SNOW MIXING IN ON MONDAY...THEN JUST 
SOME LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS IN THE COLD ADVECTION MONDAY NIGHT OVER 
THE NORTH AND SMOKIES.  POOR MODEL AGREEMENT AND POOR RUN TO RUN 
CONSISTENCY FURTHER OUT CONTINUES TO KEEP CONFIDENCE LOW. GFS 
CONTINUES TO INSIST WE MAY HAVE SOME RAIN OR SNOW SOMETIME TOWARD 
THE END OF THE PERIOD...FOR NOW WILL JUST CARRY A 20 POP FOR THU AND 
LEAVE REMAINDER OF FORECAST DRY.

FEW SPOTS UP TO AN INCH IN HIGHEST TERRAIN WHERE UPSLOPE IS A FACTOR.
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES FROM EVENING RAOBS ARE ONLY AROUND 1/4 INCH
...BUT CERTAINLY ENUFF MOISTURE FOR UPSLOPE AND COLD AIR ADVECTION 
TO WORK WITH.  SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT WAS UPDATED EARLIER.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES IN 
REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. NORTHERN STREAM 
SHORT WAVE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE RAPIDLY EASTWARD OVERNIGHT. THIS 
WILL TAKE ANY ORGANIZED PRECIP OUT OF OUR AREA...BUT LEAVE A STRONG 
UPSLOPE FLOW IN ITS WAKE. THIS COUPLED WITH SOME BOUNDARY LAYER 
MOISTURE SHOULD PRODUCE SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS MAINLY FOR THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN IN THE FIRST PERIOD. MENTIONED SNOW FLURRIES FOR THE LOWER 
ELEVATIONS IN SOUTHWESTERN VA AND NORTHEAST TN. UPPER FLOW BECOME 
NEARLY ZONAL BY LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD...CUTTING OFF ANY 
LINGERING SNOW. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE 
VALUES WHICH WILL AVERAGE BELOW CLIMO.

.LONG TERM...(FRI NIGHT THROUGH WED)...MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM AFFECTING THE REGION FOR THE WEEKEND...BUT STILL 
DIFFER ON THE DETAILS.  NAM CONTINUES TO BE FURTHER SOUTH AND FASTER 
WITH SURFACE LOW...AND QUICKER IN BRINGING PRECIP INTO THE OUR 
AREA.  PER HPC DISCUSSION...NAM APPEARS TO BE AN OUTLIER...SO WILL 
GO CLOSER TO THE GFS SOLUTION.  WILL KEEP FRI NIGHT DRY...THEN BRING 
LIKELY POPS INTO THE AREA BY SAT AFTERNOON AS WARM ADVECTION AND 
ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASE.  IF PRECIP MOVES IN QUICKLY ENOUGH 
SAT...MAY SEE SOME SNOW/SLEET OR FREEZING RAIN MIXING IN OVER 
PORTIONS OF THE NORTHEAST.  WILL ALLOW FOR THAT POSSIBILITY IN THE 
FORECAST...BUT WARMING SHOULD CHANGE ANY MIX OVER TO ALL RAIN FAIRLY 
QUICKLY.  WILL KEEP CATEGORICAL POPS FOR SAT NIGHT AS FRONT PUSHES

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...FAST WESTERLY FLOW WILL
CONTINUE THROUGH THE SHORT-TERM. RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY TODAY WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA FOR THURSDAY ALLOWING A FAST MOVING
SHORT-WAVE...CURRENTLY OVER THE HIGH PLAINS...TO MOVE INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY. MOST OF THE DYNAMIC FORCING WILL BE NORTH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA AND MOISTURE IS OVERALL LIMITED...SO PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS WILL BE
LIGHT AND GENERALLY NORTHERN SECTIONS.  

FOR THURSDAY...MODELS SHOW AREAS OF MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS MOVING
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. FROPA IS EXPECTED DURING THE AFTERNOON 
HOURS.  BOTH THE NAM AND GFS SHOW WRAP-AROUND BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE
MOVING INTO THE REGION...ESPECIALLY NORTHERN THIRD...DURING THE EVENING
HOURS AND OVERNIGHT THURSDAY. EVEN BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE COMBINED 
WITH UPSLOPE FLOW TO PRODUCE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS. PRECIPITATION WILL
START AS RAIN...THEN CHANGE OVER TO SNOW. NO SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
ANTICIPATED.


.LONG TERM...(FRI THROUGH WED)...MODELS AGREE IN SHOWING SIGNIFICANT 
PRECIPITATION PRODUCER FOR THE WEEKEND...BUT DIFFER IN THE DETAILS.  
NAM A BIT FURTHER SOUTH WITH THE SURFACE LOW THAN THE GFS...AGREE 
WITH HPC THAT A BLEND LOOKS BEST FOR NOW.  AFTER A DRY DAY 
FRI...MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE FRIDAY NIGHT AS WARMER AIR 
SURGES NORTH.  LOOKS LIKE LOWER LEVELS MAY BE TOO DRY FOR ANY 
PRECIP FRI NIGHT...SO JUST INCREASING CLOUDS.  LOOKS LIKE MAINLY A 
RAIN EVENT FOR SAT INTO SUNDAY...ALTHOUGH CAN NOT RULE OUT A BIT OF 
FROZEN/FREEZING PRECIP EARLY SAT DEPENDING ON HOW FAST PRECIP MOVES 
IN...MAINLY NORTH. LOW CONFIDENCE FURTHER OUT...AS POOR CONSISTENCY 
AND AGREEMENT IN MODELS.  GENERALLY WENT WITH HPC IDEA OF HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDING IN MONDAY AND CONTROLLING OUR WEATHER 
TUESDAY...THEN A MOISTURE STARVED COLD FRONT POSSIBLY AFFECTING THE 
AREA ON WED.

.DISCUSSION...
SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE LOWER AND 
MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.  THE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE EAST
TODAY PRODUCING LIGHT WINDS AND PLENTY OF SUNSHINE.  SATELLITE DOES
SHOW SOME COLD AIR ADVECTION STRATU-CU OVER THE FAR NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS
AND EAST KENTUCKY.  HOWEVER...AS COLD AIR ADVECTION DIMINISHES TODAY
AS RIDGE BUILDS IN...LOW CLOUDS WILL DISSIPATE...SO MOSTLY SUNNY
FORECAST LOOKS GOOD.

PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AND DRY AIRMASS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM
SOME THIS AFTERNOON...PER GOING FORECASTS. DO NOT PLAN ANY CHANGES
TO GOING FORECAST.

ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE IS MOVING ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES THIS MORNING.
THE WAVE WILL MOVE EAST TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT AND THURSDAY.
MOST OF THE ENERGY AND MOISTURE WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA...HOWEVER...NAM/GFS BOTH SHOW SOME BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE MOVING
INTO THE REGION AFTER FROPA THURSDAY EVENING...MAINLY FOR SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSSEE MOUNTAINS. SOME UPSLOPE 
PRECIPITATION ANTICIPATED THURSDAY EVENING AND NIGHT...PER GOING

.SHORT TERM...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE BUILDING OVER THE AREA TODAY. SOME 
STRATOCU OBSERVED IN THE MOUNTAINS AND SW VA SHOULD DISSIPATE THIS 
MORNING AS DRY AIR ADVECTION ENSUES. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH NOW CROSSING 
THE NORTHER ROCKIES WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST IN A FAST FLOW ALOFT...AND 
CROSS THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA ON THURSDAY. THOUGH THE 
VORTICITY AND UPPER JET STREAK ARE RELATIVELY STRONG...MOISTURE IS 
VERY LIMITED. HOWEVER BEHIND THE TROUGH AN UPSLOPE NORTHWEST FLOW 
DEVELOPS...AND MODELS SHOW NEAR SATURATION AT 800 MB AND LOWER. 
THUS WILL CONTINUE SLIGHT CHANCE OF SNOW IN SW VA AND THE TN MTNS 
FOR THURSDAY NIGHT. DRIER AIR ALOFT MIXES DOWN ON FRIDAY.

TEMPERATURES WILL BE CLOSE TO MOS GUIDANCE...THOUGH WILL LEAN TOWARD 
THE COOLER NUMBERS TONIGHT WITH GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING POTENTIAL.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
ISENTROPIC LIFT AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION INCREASE RAPIDLY 
LATE FRIDAY NIGHT. IF THE PRECIP BEGINS EARLY ENOUGH...IT COULD 
START AS SNOW IN THE NORTHERN SECTIONS BEFORE CHANGING TO RAIN. 
HOWEVER AT THIS TIME WILL KEEP FORECAST AS ALL RAIN WITH THE BULK OF 
THE PRECIP OCCURRING AFTER 12Z. UPPER DYNAMICS INCREASE WITH THE 
APPROACH OF THE JET ON SATURDAY NIGHT. SURFACE COLD FRONTAL 
PASSAGE APPEARS TO OCCUR ON SUNDAY...BUT THE UPPER TROUGH LAGS THE 
SURFACE FRONT...SO CHANCE POPS LINGER INTO MONDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...HAND ANALYSIS SHOWS COLD 
FRONT EXTENDING FROM DEEP SOUTH MS-AL LINE ACROSS NORTHEAST 
AL...EAST TN...SOUTHEAST KY...INTO CENTRAL OH AT AROUND 1 PM. THE 
ONLY REAL CHANGE IN CONDITIONS IS THE COLDER AIR BEHIND THE 
BOUNDARY...NO REAL PRESSURE CHANGES OCCUR UNTIL WAY BACK NEAR THE MS 
RIVER WHERE A WEAK SURFACE TROF EXISTS. CLOUDS RAPIDLY DIMINISHING 
IN DRIER, MORE STABLE AIR OVER TN VALLEY.

EXPECTED A LITTLE MORE WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE IN CENTRAL MOUNTAINS 
WHICH NEVER ATERIALIZED. NORTHEAST TN MTNS HAVE SOME RESIDUAL 
CLOUDINESS. HAVE KEPT PARTLY CLOUDY OVERNIGHT AS AFOREMENTIONED 
SURFACE TROF PROGRESSES TOWARD AREA AND PROVIDES A LITTLE LIFT.  
EXPECT WHAT MOISTURE THERE IS TO MOVE OUT OVERNIGHT AND WEDNESDAY TO 
BE MOSTLY SUNNY AND DRY. HAVE TWEAKED UP MIN/MAX A DEGREE OR TWO 
WITH WINDS STAYING UP SOME OVERNIGHT AND PLENTY OF SUN WEDNESDAY.  

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...A RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL GIVE WAY TO A FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVE IN STRONG 
WEST-NORTWEST FLOW ALOFT.  DUE TO LIMITED MOISTURE RETURN AND 
FAST NATURE OF SYSTEM...PRECIPITATION WILL ALSO BE LIMITED AND
MAINLY BEHIND THE FRONT. WILL INCLUDE A CHANCE OF RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS
FOR MAINLY NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS THURSDAY EVENING AND NIGHT.

FOR FRIDAY...UPPER FLOW BECOMES ZONAL WITH SURFACE RIDGING. MODELS
DIFFER IN REGARD TO NEXT SYSTEM DIGGING INTO THE EASTERN HALF OF
THE NATION.  THE GFS SEEMS TOO AGRESSIVE WITH NEXT SYSTEM. AS NEXT SYSTEM
DIGS INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL INCREASE OVER THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY BY SATURDAY PRODUCING A CHANCE OF RAIN. SYSTEM WILL
MOVE EAST ACROSS THE REGION SUNDAY CONTINUING CHANCES OF RAIN. ENOUGH
COLD AIR WILL PULL INTO THE FORECAST AREA FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY MORNING
THAT THE PRECIPITATION COULD CHANGE OVER TO SNOW OVER THE NORTHERN
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...ESPECIALLY HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

CONFIDENCE OF EXTENDED FORECAST...ESPECIALLY FROM SATURDAY THROUGH 
MONDAY...IS LOW GIVEN DIFFERENCES IN MODELS AND SPREAD OF ENSEMBLE

COLD FRONT IS SLOWLY MOVING EAST ACROSS THE CWA...WITH LIGHT TO 
MODERATE RAIN SHOWERS AHEAD OF IT AND NO LIGHTNING STRIKES OBSERVED. 
SURFACE WINDS HAVE ALSO DROPPED OFF ESPECIALLY IN THE VALLEY...AND 
THE WIND ADVISORY WILL BE CANCELLED WITH THE NEW FORECAST ISSUANCE. 
TIMING OF THE FRONT TAKES IT OUT OF THE AREA BY LATE MORNING. 
HOWEVER A CHANCE WILL BE MAINTAINED INTO THE AFTERNOON IN NE 
SECTIONS AS MOUNTAINS MAY SLOW FRONTAL PROGRESSION FURTHER. SKIES 
SHOULD BEGIN TO CLEAR THIS EVENING EXCEPT IN SW VA AND THE TN MTNS 
AS MODELS SHOW SOME 850 MB MOISTURE WRAPPING AROUND THE CLOSED LOW 
ALONG WITH AN UPSLOPE COMPONENT.   

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
A FAST-MOVING SHORTWAVE TROUGH CROSSES THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA 
ON THURSDAY. THE GFS HAS STRONG PVA OVER SW VA WITH A NEGATIVE TILT 
TO THE TROUGH. THE ETA HAS A MUCH WEAKER VORT THAT IS FARTHER NORTH 
THAN THE GFS. MOISTURE IS LIMITED IN BOTH MODELS. GIVEN THESE 
DISPARITIES AND LIMITED MOISTURE WILL NOT ADD ANY PRECIP MENTION AT 
THIS TIME. THE FLOW ALOFT DEVELOPS INTO A MODIFIED SPLIT FLOW 
PATTERN...WITH THE CONVERGENCE OF THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAMS 
IN OUR VICINITY. ISENTROPIC LIFT AND MOISTURE ADVECTION WILL BRING A 
CHANCE OF RAIN ON SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. SHORTWAVE TROUGH CROSSES 
IN THE GFS ON SUNDAY NIGHT...AND WILL INCREASE POPS TO A CHANCE AT

245 PM EST SUN NOV 27 2005

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...A WARM FRONT IS LIFTING NORTH 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND 
TEMPERATURES HAVE RESPONDED BY CLIMBING INTO THE 60S ACROSS MANY 
VALLEY LOCATIONS. A WEAK WAVE RIDING ALONG THE FRONT IS EXITING THE 
AREA AND ASSOCIATED ISOLATED PRECIP IS LIFTING OUT AS WELL. A FEW 
ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT WITH VERY WEAK RESIDUAL 
LIFT AND A MOISTENING AIR MASS. WITH THE INCREASE IN HEIGHTS AND 
850MB TEMPS...OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL BE WARM AS WELL. LATE MONDAY...A 
COLD FRONT WILL BE APPROACHING THE AREA. IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT... 
A WEAKLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL PUSH IN. THE AIR MASS WILL HAVE LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE AND GOOD VERTICAL SHEAR. AS A RESULT...SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND EVEN A FEW THUNDERSTORMS MAY REACH INTO THE AREA BY LATE 
AFTERNOON. WITH THE VERTICAL WIND FIELD...A STRAY SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A STRONG 500 MB TROUGH 
WILL COMBINE WITH FAVORABLE JET DYNAMICS (RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF A 
250 MB JET STREAK) TO SUSTAIN A LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION ALONG AND 
AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT...AS IT MOVES EAST ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
MONDAY NIGHT. SHORT-TERM MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MOVING 
THE COLD FRONT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE EVENING HOURS... 
AND WILL RAISE POPS INTO THE CATEGORICAL RANGE. A STRONG LOW-LEVEL 
850 MB JET (IN EXCESS OF 50 KTS) IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP ALONG THE 
FRONT...ALONG WITH LARGE 0-1 KM HELICITY VALUES. HOWEVER...AS IS SO 
OFTEN THE CASE DURING THE FALL AND WINTER MONTHS...THE AMOUNT OF 
INSTABILITY WILL BE IN QUESTION AND WILL LIKELY BE ONLY MARGINAL 
ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. LIFTED INDICES ARE PROGGED BY BOTH 
THE GFS AND NAM MODELS TO BECOME SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE AHEAD OF THE 
FRONT...SO WILL CONTINUE A MENTION OF TSTORMS MONDAY NIGHT. WITH A 
STRONG LOW-LEVEL JET EXPECTED...THINK THAT SOME TSTORMS ACROSS 
MAINLY SOUTHWEST PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA COULD BECOME SEVERE 
WITH DAMAGING WINDS. WILL CONTINUE A MENTION OF POST-FRONTAL SHOWERS 
ON TUESDAY MORNING...WITH RAIN GRADUALLY ENDING TUESDAY AFTERNOON. 

HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD THEN BUILD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...BRINGING DRY AND TRANQUIL WEATHER. ANOTHER 
WEAK COLD FRONT WILL QUICKLY APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING...BUT MOST OF THE UPPER DYNAMICS AND 
MOISTURE SHOULD REMAIN NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION. GFS MODEL CANT SEEM TO MAKE UP ITS MIND WITH HOW MUCH 
MOISTURE WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR PRECIP...BUT WILL GO AHEAD AND 
MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR UPSLOPE-INDUCED SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VA AND THE MOUNTAINS. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN NOW ALSO 
REVEALS A DIFFERENT SCENARIO FOR THE WEEKEND...WITH A LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. HOWEVER...WILL KEEP THE 
FORECAST DRY FOR NOW SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST INDICATIONS OF THIS 
SCENARIO...AND THE EXTENDED MODELS HAVE BEEN INCONSISTENT OF LATE.

CONVECTION IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...A DRY AND COOL AIR MASS WILL 
REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TONIGHT. FLOW 
ALOFT IS ZONAL WITH SURFACE WIND FIELD TO SLOWLY SWITCH 
SOUTHWESTERLY ON SATURDAY. INCREASING HEIGHT FIELD AND 850MB TEMP 
INCREASE WILL PUSH AFTERNOON HIGHS TO NEAR NORMAL. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...A STRONG UPPER TROUGH 
OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL DEVELOP A STRONG SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON SUNDAY. STRONG SOUTHERLY 
FLOW AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL LIFT A WARM FRONT ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA ON SUNDAY...WITH A FEW SHOWERS EXPECTED. NAM AND GFS MODELS 
REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE MOISTURE...SO 
WILL KEEP ONLY A SMALL CHANCE POP. WITH DOWNSLOPE SOUTHERLY WINDS 
EXPECTED ON SUNDAY...WILL PLAN TO RAISE MAXES ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND 
NORTHERN VALLEY AREAS. THIS WARM FRONT SHOULD MOVE NORTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA BY SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH A DRY SLOT EXPECTED OVER THE 
REGION AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY. A 
STRONG 500 MB TROUGH SHOULD COMBINE WITH FAVORABLE JET DYNAMICS 
(RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF A 250 MB JET STREAK) TO PRODUCE A LARGE 
AREA OF CONVECTION ALONG AND AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT AS IT MOVES 
EAST ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. IN ADDITION...LIFTED INDICES ARE 
PROGGED TO BECOME NEGATIVE AHEAD OF THE FRONT ON MONDAY...SO THINK 
THERE WILL BE A GOOD CHANCE FOR TSTORMS ALONG THE FRONT. HIGH 
PRESSURE SHOULD THEN BUILD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BY TUESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH THURSDAY...BRINGING DRY AND TRANQUIL WEATHER. RIGHT NOW...IT 
APPEARS ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL QUICKLY MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
BY THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...BUT MOISTURE APPEARS LIMITED AT THIS 
TIME. THUS...WILL MENTION ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS WITH THIS 
FRONT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...LOCALLY BREEZY CONDITIONS OVER 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION WILL SLOWLY DIMINISH DURING THE 
EVENING HOURS AS A WEAK COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO EXIT THE AREA. 
THEREFORE...WILL ALLOW THE WIND ADVISORY TO EXPIRE. OTHERWISE...COOL 
AND DRY AIR IS FILTERING INTO THE MRX CWA...ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO 
DROP INTO THE TEENS AND 20S OVERNIGHT. ON FRIDAY...THE UPPER TROUGH 
REMAINS POSITIONED OVER THE AREA WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING 
IN.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE 
EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY...WITH A MODERATING TEMP TREND 
DEVELOPING THIS WEEKEND AS WINDS BECOME SOUTHERLY. EXTENDED MODELS 
AGREE WITH AN OVERALL LONG-WAVE PATTERN CHANGE FOR NEXT WEEK...BUT 
DIFFER ON THE SMALLER-SCALE DETAILS. THUS...WILL TREND THE EXTENDED 
FORECAST TOWARDS THE ENSEMBLE MEANS...WHICH INDICATES ABOVE-NORMAL 
TEMPS DEVELOPING NEXT WEEK. AN UPPER TROUGH OVER THE WEST IS PROGGED 
TO DEVELOP A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE PLAINS BY SUNDAY. A 
FEW SHOWERS SHOULD DEVELOP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE SATURDAY 
NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...AS ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASES AHEAD OF A WARM 
FRONT OVER THE DEEP SOUTH. THIS WARM FRONT SHOULD MOVE NORTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA BY SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH ONLY A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS 
EXPECTED AS DRY SLOTTING DEVELOPS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY AHEAD OF 
THE COLD FRONT OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY. MOST OF THE STRONGER 
UPPER DYNAMICS WITH THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE 
NORTH TOWARDS THE GREAT LAKES REGION ON MONDAY...WHICH SHOULD SLOW 
THE EASTWARD PROGRESS OF THE COLD FRONT ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. 
LATEST GFS MODEL RUN INDICATES THAT THIS FRONT WILL STALL-OUT AROUND 
THE FORECAST AREA BY MONDAY NIGHT...WITH ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH 
QUICKLY DEVELOPING OVER THE PLAINS ON TUESDAY. THIS UPPER TROUGH 
SHOULD PUSH THE COLD FRONT THOUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY TUESDAY 
NIGHT...BUT WILL CONTINUE WITH SOME LOW CHANCE POPS THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY TO ACCOUNT FOR MODEL INCONSISTENCIES. LIFTED INDICES ARE 
PROGGED TO BECOME NEGATIVE AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT ON MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY...SO WILL MENTION TSTORMS BOTH DAYS UNTIL FRONTAL PASSAGE.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...PERIOD WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY 
SLOW DEAMPLIFICATION OF UPPER LONG WAVE TROUGH THAT HAS PERSISTED 
OVER THE EASTERN CONUS FOR THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS. SURFACE COLD FRONT 
PROJECTED TO PASS THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY MID-MORNING 
PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. NOT EXPECTING ANY SIGNIFICANT 
PRECIP WITH THIS FEATURE AS MOISTURE IS CONFINED TO LOWEST LAYER. 
CONTINUED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SOUTHWESTERN 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE HOWEVER. FRONT WILL ISSUE IN COLDER 
AIR WITH TEMPS EXPECTED TO SLOWLY FALL THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. 
REASONABLY GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO
DROP DRAMATICALLY IN THE SECOND PERIOD. GENERALLY FOLLOWED BLEND 
OF GUIDANCE TEMPS THROUGH THE SHORT TERM.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MANY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS
MADE TO FALL IN LINE WITH LATEST MOS AND NEIGHBORING GRIDS FOR
NEARLY EVERY DAY.  ALTHOUGH GENERALLY PATTERN CHANGES SEEMED
SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS...WITH A BRIEF PERIOD OF SURFACE AND
UPPER RIDGING FOR FRIDAY INTO SUNDAY.  THEN UPPER PATTERN EVOLVES
BACK TO TROUGHING TO OUR WEST...BUT NOT ENOUGH AGREEMENT ON
STRENGTH AND TIMING OF SRN STREAM SHORTWAVES TO MAKE MANY DETAILED
CHANGES TO PREVIOUS FORECAST FOR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MID NEXT WEEK.

FAVORED THE NAM FOR THE WEEKEND INTO MONDAY...AS GFS MODEL SEEEMED
A BIT TOO AGRESSIVE IN DEVELOPING PCPN AND TAKING IT SO FAR EAST.
DID INTRODUCE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SRN MOST AREAS LATE SATURDAY
NIGHT TO BE WITHIN TOLERANCE OF HIGH RAIN CHANCES TO OUR SOUTH.

TEMPS LOOK TO REBOUND WELL ABOVE CLIMO ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY...BEFORE
COOLING SLIGHTLY WEDNESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...A FAST MOVING SHORT WAVE WILL 
SWING THROUGH THE REGION TONIGHT. LIMITED MOISTURE WILL ALSO LIMIT 
PRECIPITATION. PRECIPITATION WILL LIKELY BEGIN AS LIGHT SNOW... 
PARTICULARLY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...THEN SWITCH OVER TO ALL RAIN 
BEFORE ENDING. STRONG GUSTY WINDS TONIGHT INTO TOMORROW IN THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS WILL NECESSITATE A WIND ADVISORY ALONG THE NORTH 
CAROLINA BORDER. SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE LIMITED TO GENERALLY 
LESS THAN AN INCH IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...SO NO ADVISORY OR 
WARNINGS WILL BE ISSUED. TENDED TOWARDS THE NAM FOR GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
BUILD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...BRINGING 
UNSEASONABLY COLD TEMPS BY FRIDAY MORNING (SOME FIFTEEN TO TWENTY 
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL). A MODERATING TREND WILL QUICKLY DEVELOP ON 
SATURDAY...AS SOUTHERLY WINDS DEVELOP ON THE BACK SIDE OF THIS HIGH. 
EXTENDED MODELS ARE COMING INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH AN OVERALL 
PATTERN CHANGE FOR NEXT WEEK...BY DEVELOPING AN UPPER RIDGE OVER THE 
EAST AND A STRONG UPPER TROUGH OVER THE WEST. IN RESPONSE TO THIS 
UPPER TROUGH...A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS BY SUNDAY. SCATTERED SHOWERS SHOULD 
DEVELOP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM...AS 
ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASES AHEAD OF A WARM FRONT OVER THE DEEP SOUTH. 
THIS WARM FRONT SHOULD MOVE NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA BY SUNDAY 
NIGHT...BRINGING A BRIEF BREAK IN THE SHOWER ACTIVITY. THE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE PLAINS IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTH TOWARDS THE 
GREAT LAKES REGION ON MONDAY...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT MOVING 
ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. GFS MODEL INDICATES SOME STRONG DYNAMICS 
WITH THIS FRONT ON MONDAY...AS A NEGATIVELY-TILTED UPPER TROUGH DIGS 
OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY. IN ADDITION...LIFTED INDICES ARE PROGGED 
TO BECOME NEGATIVE AHEAD OF THE FRONT...SO WILL MENTION TSTORMS ON 
MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT. GFS MODEL INDICATES A PROGRESSIVE PATTERN 
FOR NEXT WEEK...AS ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM QUICKLY DEVELOPS OVER 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND BRINGS ANOTHER CHANCE FOR SHOWERS ON 
WEDNESDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
SATELLITE SHOWS A FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVE MOVING SOUTHEAST FROM THE OHIO
VALLEY TOWARD THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. FAIRLY DECENT DYNAMICS WILL QUICKLY
MOVE ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING. INITIALLY AIRMASS IS QUITE DRY WITH DEWPOINT IN THE
TEENS OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. THE INITIAL DRY SOUNDING WILL MOIST UP
GIVING WAY TO DECENT EVAPORATIVE COOLING. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW BOUNDARY
COOLING ALLOWING INITIAL PRECIP TYPE BEING MAINLY SNOW FOR
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS WITH RAIN/SNOW
MIXTURE FOR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE VALLEY (TRI AREA). 

GROUND TEMPERATURE REMAINS FAIRLY WARM...SO ONLY EXPECT THE HIGHER TERRAIN
TO HAVE A CHANCE OF SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS BEFORE BOUNDARY WARMS
ENOUGH TO CHANGE TO A MIXTURE. WILL INCLUDE SNOW ACCUMUATIONS OF UP
TO 1 INCH FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS. FOR AREAS FROM MORRISTOWN SOUTHWARD...ONLY
EXPECT MAINLY SPRINKLES FOR THIS AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING WITH DRY CONDITIONS
SOUTH OF TYS.

BESIDES THE PRECIPITATION...WINDS WILL INCREASE OUT OF THE WEST-SOUTHWEST
TODAY APPROACHING WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA. WILL KEEP WINDS BETWEEN
THE 15 AND 30 MPH RANGE FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS REVOLVE 
AROUND NORTH TO SOUTH POP GRADIENT ASSOCIATED WITH CLIPPER SYSTEM 
TRANSLATING THROUGH THE NORTHWEST FLOW OF THE LONGWAVE TROUGH...AND 
PRECIP TYPE. MODELS AND SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLES ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THE CLIPPER SHORTWAVE. APPEARS THAT 
THIS SYSTEM WILL MAINLY AFFECT THE NORTHERN HALF OF OUR FORECAST 
AREA. ALSO APPEARS THAT THE EFFECTS WILL BE CENTERED AROUND 00Z 
THURSDAY. MODEL SOUNDINGS AND TIME HEIGHT TEMPERATURE PROFILES 
INDICATE GOOD WARM ADVECTION IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS. ANTICIPATE 
THIS TO BE MAINLY A RAIN EVENT WITH ONLY THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS 
RECEIVING ANY SNOW. DID NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO PREVIOUS 
TEMPS AS THEY AGREE QUITE WELL WITH LATEST MODEL GUIDANCE BLEND.


.LONG TERM...(THANKSGIVING DAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...LINGERING EFFECTS
OF CLIPPER SYSTEM LAST INTO THANKSGIVING DAY AND EVENING...BUT
DONT EXPECT ANY SIGNIFICANT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS.  GENERALLY RAN LOW
CHANCE POPS SW VA/NE TN DOWN TO NO POPS FOR SE TN.  PCPN TYPE IS A
MIX OR MAINLY SNOW HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN THE MORNING...THEN MAINLY
SNOW SHOWERS AFTERNOON HOURS WHERE ANY LIGHT PCPN LINGERS. 

ONE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FOR THANKSGIVING DAY WAS THE MODERATE TO
STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION ADVERTISED BY BOTH NAM AND GFS...MUCH TOO
COLD FOR MAX TEMPS ANYWHERE NEAR THE GFS MOS VALUES (ACTUALLY NEAR
CLIMO). I GENERALLY LOWERED MAX TEMP GRID DOWN BY 4 TO 8 DEGREES IN
LINE WITH THE COLDER NGM/NAM MOS HIGHS...WHICH MESHED NICELY WITH
NEIGHBORHOOD GRIDS. ALSO...LOWERED MIN TEMPS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND
BROUGHT IN SOME MUCH DRIER/LOWER DEWPOINTS INTO LATE FRIDAY.  

RIDGING LOOKS TO PROVIDE DRY WEATHER AND MODERATING TEMPS INTO THE
WEEKEND.  NEXT SYSTEM OF CONCERN IS THE UPPER LOW PRESSURE AREA
THAT DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON MONDAY.  THE OPERATIONAL
MODELS AND ENSEMBLE MEMBERS SHOW MUCH VARIANCE WITH THIS SYSTEM ON
TRACK AND TIMING...SO DID NOT TRY TO FINE TUNE ANY POP GRIDS EARLY
NEXT WEEK.  DOES NOT LOOK UNSTABLE ENOUGH FOR THUNDERSTORMS YET ON
MONDAY NIGHT OR TUESDAY...BUT DID GO WITH SHOWERS AS TYPE OF PCPN.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AREA RADAR MOSAIC SHOWS 
ORGANIZED PRECIP HAS JUST ABOUT DEPARTED OUR FORECAST AREA AS UPPER 
LOW CONTINUES TO TREK TOWARD THE EAST COAST. MID AND UPPER LEVELS 
DRY OUT RAPIDLY PER LATEST MODEL TIME HEIGHTS...BUT SIGNIFICANT 
MOISTURE REMAINS IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER THROUGH THE FIRST PERIOD AND 
MUCH OF THE SECOND. THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH STRONG UPSLOPE FLOW AND 
COOLING BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPS ARGUES FOR A GOOD UPSLOPE FLOW SNOW
EVENT IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. BASED ON THIS SITUATION...WILL CONTINUE 
CURRENT WARNINGS/ADVISORIES AND EXTEND UNTIL MIDNIGHT. EVENT 
EXPECTED TO WIND DOWN BY LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD AS BOUNDARY LAYER 
MOISTURE BECOMES SHALLOWER AND UPSLOPE FLOW RELAXES SOMEWHAT. FOR 
TEMPS...GENERALLY FAVORED COOLEST OF GUIDANCE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MAIN SYSTEM IS EARLY IN
THE LONG TERM PERIOD AS CLIPPER SHORTWAVE DROPS QUICKLY SE AND
AFFECTS MAINLY NRN 2/3RDS OF THE FORECAST AREA LATE WEDNESDAY INTO
EARLY THANKSGIVING DAY.  MODELS SEEM TO CONTINUE THE TREND OF THIS
FEATURE BEING A BIT NORTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA...ALTHO GFS SEEMS TO
BE TOO GENEROUS OR ZEALOUS IN SPREADING SO MUCH QPF AS FAR SOUTH AS
MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS LOOKS SUSPECT TO ME...SINCE
EVEN THE GFS KEEPS MOST OF THE ASSOCIATED VORTICITY NORTH OF SWRN VA.
NAM LOOKS MORE REASONABLE AND BETTER IN LINE WITH HPC QPF PROGS AND
WINTER WEATHER DESK (WWD) DAYS 1-3 SNOW PROGS. 

NAM DOES SHOW A WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN AND WEAK ISENTROPIC
LIFT DEVELOPING BY LATE WEDNESDAY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...BUT
THINK THAT THIS MAY JUST EQUATE TO AN INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER.
THIS WARM AIR ADVECTION ALSO COMPLICATES WHAT TYPE OF PCPN MAY
OCCUR...ALTHO EXPECT LIGHT QPF...POSSIBLY NEAR 0.10 OVER SWRN VA
AREAS. DECIDED TO INCREASE POPS SLIGHTLY ACROSS SWRN VA AND NE TN
MTN ZONES LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...JUST BELOW LIKELY FOR NOW.  DOWN
SOUTH OVER THE SRN THIRD OF THE AREA...LOWERED POPS TO JUST SLIGHT
CHANCE AND REMOVED SOME OF THE SNOW DUE TO THE WARM AIR ADVECTION
AND BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPS.  

OTHERWISE...LITTLE CHANGES MADE FOR NOW.  PLENTY OF WEATHER IN THE
SHORT TO MID TERM...SO WILL LET DAY SHIFT MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO LATER
PERIODS INTO THE NEW DAY SEVEN (TUESDAY).  WSW...ZFP AND ALL WEB

.DISCUSSION...A LARGE SWATH OF RAIN IS COVERING THE MRX CWA THIS 
EVENING IN RESPONSE TO A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING THROUGH 
THE AREA.  THE UPPER LOW...CURRENTLY POSITIONED OVER NORTH GA IS 
MOVING NORTHEAST WITH THE CENTER PROGGED TO TRACK TO OUR EAST.  
CURRENT TEMPERATURE PROFILE INDICATED PRECIP SHOULD REMAIN AS RAIN 
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY.  HOWEVER...AS THE

COOLER AIR.  HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU HAVE 
ALREADY SEEN RAIN MIX WITH OR CHANGE OVER TO SNOW.  THE EAST 
TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS SHOULD SEE RAIN CHANGING OVER TO SNOW ANY TIME 
AFTER 9 PM.  AS THE LOW CONTINUES TO LIFT NORTH AND EAST...UPSLOPE

SURFACE LOW PRESSURE MOVING UP EAST COAST.  COLDER AIR WILL BE 
MOVING IN ALOFT OVERNIGHT...ALLOWING RAIN TO CHANGE TO SNOW OVER

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...INITIAL AREA OF LIGHT RAIN 
CONTINUES TO SPREAD NE AT AROUND 25 MPH...WITH JUST TRACE AMOUNTS TO 
A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF AN INCH THUS FAR.  ACTUALLY NOT MUCH AT ALL 
MEASURED YET ACROSS FAR NE TN INTO EXTREME SWRN VA FORECAST AREAS. 
EVAPORATIVE COOLING INITIALLY...RAPID INCREASE IN CLOUDS/RAIN AND 
NORTHERLY SURFACE WINDS WILL REALLY HINDER TEMPS FROM RISING MUCH 
TODAY.  THUS...KEPT MAX TEMPS IN LINE WITH THE COOLER MOS CHOICES.

THE 21/00Z GFS AND NAM MODELS SEEM TO BE IN DECENT AGREEMENT OVERALL 
ON THE PCPN PATTERN AND ARRIVAL OF COLDER AIR (FOR PCPN TYPE CHANGE)
BY AROUND 09Z TUESDAY.  GFS STILL IS A LITTLE FASTER IN MOVING THE 
UPPER LOW NE AND OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA BY VERY EARLY TUESDAY 
MORNING.  ADDED A FEW SPOTS OF SNOW SHOWERS FOR SWRN VA AND NE TN 
MTN ZONES (MAINLY ABOVE 3000 FEET) IN THE 09Z TO 12Z TUESDAY WEATHER 
GRIDS.

OTHERWISE...JUST MINOR CHANGES OVERALL TO GRIDS FOR THESE PERIODS.
DID INCREASE POPS TO 90 TO 100 PERCENT ALL AREAS BY LATE MORNING 
INTO EARLY AFTERNOON.  ALSO...LOWERED MIN TEMP FORECAST IN LINE WITH 
COOLER 21/00Z MOS AS COLD AIR WRAPS AROUND INTO REGION BY DAYBREAK 
TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...COLDER AIR ARRIVING INTO 
FORECAST AREA TUESDAY WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES NEARLY STEADY AND 
POSSIBLY FALLING. STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WITH THE FLOW OUT OF THE 
NORTHWEST WILL ALSO BRING SNOW SHOWERS OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 
PROGGED SOUNDINGS OF THE NAM AND GFS SHOWS FREEZING LEVELS AROUND 
2500 TO 3000 FEET. MOST OF THE MOISTURE IS GONE ABOVE 850 MB BY 
AROUND 12Z TUESDAY. BUT NW WINDS OF 15 TO 20 KNOTS AT 2500 FEET AND 
UP TO 35 KNOTS AT ABOUT 850 MB IN NE TN WILL BE GOOD FOR UPSLOPE 
SNOW SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. HAVE ISSUED SPECIAL WEATHER 
STATEMENT FOR UP TO TWO INCHES OF SNOW BY TUESDAY EVENING ACROSS SW 
VA AND NE TN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WIND ADVISORY MAY BE NECESSARY FOR 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS TUESDAY. WINDS BEGIN DECREASING AFTER 00Z 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND MOISTURE THINS. THINK THERE WILL BE LITTLE 
ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATION TUESDAY NIGHT BUT TEMPERATURES WILL DROP 
INTO THE MID AND UPPER 20S AND WITH WINDS NEAR 10 MPH IT WILL FEEL 
QUITE COLD. UPPER RIDGE STAYS ANCHORED ACROSS THE WESTERN STATES 
LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN WITH COLD AIR COMING SOUTH FROM CANADA TOWARDS 
THE TN VALLEY. THE NEXT SYSTEM IS NOW MOVING A LITTLE FASTER SOUTH 
AND WILL BEGIN TO SPREAD CLOUDS INTO TN AS EARLY AS WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON. THIS SYSTEM WILL AFFECT MOSTLY THE NORTHERN TWO THIRDS 
WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN OR SNOW WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. IT LOOKS 
LIKE UPSLOPE CONDITIONS WILL TAKE SHAPE AGAIN ON THURSDAY IN THE 
MOUNTAINS.     

(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...PREVIOUS RUNS OF THE GFS SHOWED 
THE UPPER JET DIVING SOUTH AND PUSHING A FRONT INTO THE AREA 
THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY MORNING. THIS FEATURE HAS DISAPPEARED WITH 
THE 00Z RUN AND POPS WILL BE REMOVED THIS PERIOD. A COLD AIR MASS 
WITH ORIGINS IN NORTHERN CANADA BUILDS INTO THE AREA ON 
SATURDAY...THEN TEMPS GRADUALLY WARM AS THE CLOSED LOW SHIFTS EAST 
AND AN UPPER RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE REGION.

STRONG DEVELOPING SYSTEM TAKING SHAPE FOR THIS WEEK WITH MODELS 
COMING INTO BETTER AGREEMENT. COLD CORE LOW SLIDES SE TONIGHT TO S 
MS RVR VLY. THIS LOW IS ACCOMPANIED BY STRENGTHENING JETS AND 
DYNAMICS WHICH WILL BRING GOOD SHOT OF RAIN TO THE AREA. A SURFACE 
LOW WILL DEEPEN AS IT MOVES FROM THE NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO TO THE 
CAROLINAS ON MONDAY. GOOD ISENTROPIC LIFT IS ALREADY EVIDENT NORTH 
OF THE LOW AND WILL CONTINUE TO MATERIALIZE AS THE LOW MOVES 
NORTHWARD. THIS COUPLES WELL WITH VERY GOOD UPPER DIFFLUENCE THAT 
SETS UP OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TONIGHT NORTHEAST OF THE 
MID/UPR LEVEL LOW. WIDESPREAD STEADY RAIN WILL BEGIN LATER TONIGHT 
AND CONTINUE INTO TUESDAY MORNING. BY THEN...THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
WILL BE NE OF THE MRX CWA. CAA GETS UNDERWAY IN ERNEST WITH 
SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO ENHANCE UPSLOPE SPRINKLES AND 
FLURRIES. THE FREEZING LEVEL WILL BE AROUND 2500 FEET AT DAYBREAK 
AND LOWER THROUGHOUT THE DAY ALLOWING FOR SOME SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
ACROSS FAVORABLE ELEVATED AREAS. ANOTHER FAIRLY STRONG JET WILL 
REINFORCE THE EAST COAST TROUGH BRINGING MODERATE POTENTIAL 
VORTICITY ACROSS THE AREA. COLD MID LEVELS WILL STEEPEN THE LAPSE 
RATES AND THE SNOW SHOWERS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENHANCED BY THESE 
FEATURES.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS A BIT QUICKER ON

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FAST MOVING SHORTWAVE/VORT MAX 
IS EXITING NE PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS MORNING... 
LEAVING CLEARING SKIES BEHIND THIS FEATURE.  MORE MID DECK CLOUDS 
UPSTREAM OVER MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IN ADVANCE OF THE DEEPENING 
UPPER LOW...SO LOOK FOR INCREASING CLOUDS AGAIN LATER TODAY.  ADDED 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TO SE FORECAST AREA AND MTNS FOR LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON AS CLOUDS THICKEN AND LIFT OCCURS IN ADVANCE OF THE 
APPROACHING UPPER LOW.  EXPECT PCPN TYPE BOTH LATE TODAY AND TONIGHT 
TO BE STRATIFORM (LIGHT RAIN INSTEAD OF SHOWERS).  LOWERED QPF 
TOTALS INITIALLY DUE TO DRY AIR IN LOW LEVELS.

FOUND THE NAM AND GFS TO OVERALL BE IN BETTER AGREEMENT ON FEATURES 
SUCH AS THE DEEPENING UPPER LOW...AND GENERALLY ON LOCATION ONCE THE 
LOW CLOSES OFF.  HOWEVER...GFS IS SEVERAL HOURS FASTER IN SPREADING 
LIGHT RAIN NORTHWARD INTO THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...AND EVEN IF 
GFS IS ONLY SLIGHTLY TOO FAST...THEN MEASURABLE PCPN MIGHT DELAY 
UNTIL AFTER 12Z MONDAY.  NAM HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN SHOWING GOOD 
ISENTROPIC LIFT TO DEVELOP TONIGHT...SO PERHAPS NAM MOS POPS COULD 
BE A LITTLE LOW.  DECIDED TO COMPROMISE FOR NOW...AND GRADUALLY LEAD 
INTO THE CATEGORICAL POPS MONDAY MORNING.

TRENDED MORE TOWARD THE COOLER GFS MOS MAX TEMPS TODAY GIVEN 
INCREASING CLOUDS...WITH NO REAL PREFERENCE TONIGHT AMONGST VERY 
SIMILAR MOS MIN VALUES.  

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS IN BETTER AGREEMENT 
ABOUT RAIN ON MONDAY AND TIMING IS BECOMING CLOSER TOO. UPPER LOW 
OVER AR WITH SURFACE LOW ACROSS GA/FL WILL BRING CONSIDERABLE 
MOISTURE NORTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS WILL MEAN A RAINY DAY 
ACROSS THE EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
CLOUDS AND RAIN SHOULD HOLD TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 
50S AND AS SURFACE LOW MOVES NORTHEAST ALONG THE EAST COAST SURFACE  
WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE NORTH AND KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM RISING. 
MONDAY NIGHT COLDER AIR ALOFT WILL MOVE IN AS CLOSED UPPER LOW OR 
TROUGH MOVES ACROSS EAST TN AND UPPER FLOW COMES OUT OF THE 
NORTHWEST. NAM AND GFS SOUNDINGS SHOW FREEZING LEVEL DROPPING TO 
BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THOUSAND FEET JUST AS THE BULK OF THE MOISTURE IS 
MOVING OUT TUESDAY MORNING. THIS SHOULD GIVE THE MOUNTAINS A DUSTING 
OF SNOW AND POSSIBLY A TRACE IN THE VALLEYS. SNOW FLURRIES MAY 
LINGER IN SW VA AND NE TN TUESDAY AND MAY HAVE TO LOWER HIGHS IF 
NEXT MODEL RUNS ARE CONSISTENTLY COLD. MAY HAVE TO PUT IN A FEW 
INCHES IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS MONDAY NIGHT AND EARLY TUESDAY 
DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH MOISTURE IS LEFT MONDAY NIGHT. WILL HAVE TO 
WATCH THE UPPER LOWS TRACK AS IT MOVES EAST AND THE STRENGTH OF THE 
SURFACE LOW MOVING UP EAST COAST. COLD WEATHER WITH A TROUGH IN THE 
EAST CONTINUES ALL WEEK. THE NEXT SYSTEM WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND

.DISCUSSION...A SURFACE HIGH REMAINS POSITIONED OVER THE MRX CWA 
THIS EVENING WITH SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT.   A WEAK DISTURBANCE 
RIDING ALONG THE UPPER FLOW HAS BROUGHT IN A BAND OF CLOUDS.  A FEW 
SPRINKLES ARE POSSIBLE AS THE CLOUD BAND MOVES THROUGH...BUT WITH 
THE DRY AIR MASS AT THE LOW LEVELS...MAINLY VIRGA IS EXPECTED.  THE 
CLOUD COVER WILL LIMIT COOLING OVERNIGHT...KEEPING MOST VALLEY 
LOCATIONS ABOVE FREEZING.  AN UPPER RIDGE PUSHES IN SLIGHTLY ON 
SUNDAY FOR SLIGHTLY WARMER AND CONTINUED DRY CONDITIONS.  ALL LOOKS 
GOOD IN THE CURRENT FORECAST...NO UPDATES EXPECTED.

440 AM EST SAT NOV 19 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HEIGHTS SLIGHTLY RISE TODAY 
ACROSS THE REGION AS TROUGHING ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES DEEPENS. AT 
THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE SLIPS EASTWARD ALLOWING WEAK 
SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL WINDS AND WARM AIR ADVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. 
MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES EXPECTED AND GENERALLY ACCEPTED THE MOS BLEND FOR 
MAX TEMPS TODAY...NOTING NO CLEARLY BETTER PERFORMER FROM YESTERDAY.

KEPT THE SLIGHT INCREASING TREND IN CLOUDS LATE TONIGHT...BUT 
DEFINITELY NO THREAT OF PCPN...ACTUALLY NOT UNTIL SUNDAY NIGHT.
GUIDANCE PROGS SEEM NOW TO FAVOR THE LATEST GFS MODEL RUN OVER NAM
...WHICH IS A CHANGE FROM 24 HOURS AGO.  EITHER WAY...NOT A BIG 
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER UNTIL TOWARD SUNDAY MORNING.  MUCH MILDER 
MIN TEMPS TONIGHT...BUT TRIMMED SW VA/NE TN MINS DOWN A BIT CLOSER 
TO 19/00Z MOS VALUES (SINCE CLOUD COVER SHOULD ARRIVE THERE LATEST).

COMMENTS ON LATER PERIODS...WE WERE NOT TOTALLY SOLD ON THE GFS 
HANDLING/LOCATION OF THE DEVELOPING CLOSED UPPER LOW BY LATE 
SUNDAY.  THIS LOCATION AND STRENGTH DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE PLACEMENT 
OF THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW PRESSURE AREA.  DID NOTICE THAT ALTHO 
GUIDANCE POPS DIFFER GREATLY FROM NAM TO GFS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT...EVEN 
THE NAM DEVELOPS DECENT ISENTROPIC LIFT ACROSS THE SE STATES INTO 
SRN APPALACHIANS TOWARD EARLY MONDAY MORNING (06Z-12Z).  GOOD NEWS 
IS THAT PCPN LOOKS TO BE ALL LIQUID WITH THIS SYSTEM.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS NOW COMING INTO BETTER 
AGREEMENT WITH CLOSED UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL STATES 
SUNDAY. THIS PUTS THE FORECAST AREA IN A MOISTER SOUTHWEST FLOW 
SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. INCREASING MOISTURE AT ALL LEVELS SUNDAY 
WILL CAUSE SKIES TO BECOME MOSTLY CLOUDY. BEST CHANCE OF RAIN WILL 
BE THE SOUTHERN AREAS AS ISENTROPIC LIFT DEVELOPS FROM SOUTH TO 
NORTH. WITH DRY AIRMASS IN PLACE WILL STILL TAKE AWHILE FOR 
ATMOSPHERE TO BECOME SATURATED. THINK THIS WILL BE SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
MONDAY. INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY SOUTH AND CHANCE NORTH MONDAY. WITH 
CLOUD COVER LOWS SUNDAY NIGHT SHOULD BE SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER. A 
SURFACE LOW MOVES NORTH OUT OF THE GULF AND DEEPENS BEGINNING MONDAY 
AND THEN MOVES NORTHEAST INTO THE NE STATES. THE GFS IS MUCH FASTER 
WITH THIS FEATURE THEN THE NAM. COLD AIR ALOFT WITH UPPER LOW 
AND ON NW SIDE OF DEEPENING SURFACE LOW WILL LOWER FREEZING LEVELS 
MONDAY NIGHT AND EARLY TUESDAY. ADDED SNOW SHOWERS TO EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA MONDAY NIGHT AND EARLY TUESDAY. 
THIS COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL FOR MOUNTAINS AND LATER SHIFTS 
WILL NEED TO LOOK AT LATER MODEL RUNS TO SEE IF THEIR IS CONSISTENCY 
WITH THIS SYSTEM. RIDGE IN THE WEST AND TROUGH IN THE EAST CONTINUES 
ALL WEEK. ANOTHER SYSTEM MOVES SOUTH OUT OF SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA 
INTO THE GREAT LAKES WEDNESDAY AND THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
THANKSGIVING DAY WITH ENOUGH COLD AIR AND MOISTURE FOR A CHANCE OF 
MORE SNOW ESPECIALLY ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS.

GETTING INTO THE 40S AND 50S...FCST CLOSE TO WARMER GFS #S AND ABOUT

DPS IN THIS VERY DRY AIRMASS. EXPECT DPS TO REBOUND SOME TONIGHT. 
SAT...SFC RIDGE CONTINUES TO SHIFT NE WITH CENTER MOVING OFF TO OUR

BRING SOME MID/HIGH LVL CLDS ACROSS THE AREA IN THE AFTN...WARMING

MIDSECTION WILL AFFECT MRX CWA WEATHER SAT NGT INTO SUN NGT. EXPECT 
STRONG JET SEGMENT TO DEVELOP ON EAST SIDE OF TROUGH ON SUN 
INCREASING LIFT OVER DEPARTING LOW LEVEL RIDGE. AVAILABLE MOISTURE

ANOTHER SHOT OF SNOWSHOWERS ON LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY

ESPECIALLY SUNDAY THRU MID NEXT WEEK.  18/00Z GFS RUN IS REALLY 
OFFERING A DIFFERENT (AND VERY WET) SOLUTION...AND NOTED AS A 
RADICAL CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS RUNS AND AN OUTLIER...SO WE WILL STICK 
CLOSER TO NAM SOLUTION AND PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS.

SURFACE RIDGE JUST TO OUR WEST WILL SETTLE INTO THE REGION TODAY AND

VALLEY REGIONS...WHICH MAY SPREAD A BIT OF MID TO HIGH CLOUDS 
BRIEFLY ACROSS NRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA LATER TODAY.  OTHERWISE
...DRY AND UNSEASONABLY COOL FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT.  

PREVIOUS MAX TEMP FORECAST WAS CLOSE TO MOS BLEND AND LOOKED GOOD.
SURFACE RIDGE ACROSS REGION TONIGHT WITH CLEARING SKIES AND VERY

LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THANKSGIVING)...HIGH PRESSURE 
CONTINUES OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
SATURDAY AS ZONAL FLOW CONTINUES BUT BEGINS TO TRANSITION TO MORE 
SOUTHWEST LATER IN THE DAY. INCREASING THICKNESSES AND THE CURRENT

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY EXTENDING OVER MOST 
OF THE EASTERN U.S. SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE 
ENTIRE REGION...WHICH SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO DROP TO WELL BELOW 
NORMAL LEVELS OVERNIGHT. IN FACT...IT APPEARS THAT MINS TOMORROW 
MORNING WILL BE NEAR RECORD LOWS ACROSS CENTRAL AND NORTHERN 
PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. RECORD LOWS FOR THE 18TH ARE: 18 
(TYS)...21 (OQT) AND 16 (TRI). WASNT IT A FEW DAYS AGO WE WERE 
SETTING RECORD HIGHS? THIS HAS BEEN QUITE A CHANGE IN AIR MASSES.

WINDS TONIGHT WILL ALLOW FOR MAX COOLING OVERNIGHT. COLD AIR 
ADVECTION WEAKENS TONIGHT AND BECOMES NEUTRAL EARLY FRIDAY. WILL GO 
FOR MIN TEMPS SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN MODEL BLEND. TAIL OF MID LEVEL 
SHORT WAVES MOVES ACROSS N PART OF AREA FRI AFTN/FRI NGT. MOISTURE 
APPEARS TOO LIMITED FOR SIGNIFICANT CLOUDS SO DOWNPLAYED CLOUD COVER 
POTENTIAL. OTHERWISE SLOW WARMING TREND LATE FRI THROUGH SAT NGT.  

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...RIDGE BRINGING DRY WEATHER 
FOR SUNDAY...BUT UPPER TROUGH TRACKING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT.  
MOISTURE LIMITED...BUT WILL ADD SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SOUTHWEST VA 
AND THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS FOR LATE SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY 
MORNING.  SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOWSHOWERS.  DRY WEATHER 
RETURNS BRIEFLY FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON AND MONDAY NIGHT BEFORE A FRONT 
APPROACHES ON TUESDAY.  BEST MOISTURE AGAIN TO THE NORTH OF OUR 
CWA...SO WILL KEEP ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY 
NIGHT.  WILL KEEP THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES DRY FOR NOW.  SHOULD BE COLD 
ENOUGH FOR SNOW ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA FOR TUESDAY 
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING...THEN LIQUID PRECIP BY WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON.  SHOULD HAVE A BRIEF BREAK BEFORE NEXT SHORTWAVE BRINGS 
ANOTHER SHOT OF SNOWSHOWERS ON LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY 
MORNING ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS.  COLD FRONT

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...STEADY NWLY FLOW
CONTINUING TO PUMP IN COLDER/DRIER AIR. SHORT WAVE MOVING INTO AREA
NOW LOOKS LIKE IT MAY THICKEN UPSLOPE CLOUDS FOR NEXT FEW
HOURS...BUT AFTER IT PASSES THEN MUCH DRIER AIR BEGINS TO ADVECT
AND SUBSIDE INTO AREA...850 MB DEWPOINT TEMPS DOUBLE DIGIT BELOW
ZERO ON THE WAY INTO THE AREA. THINK CLOUDS WILL QUICKLY ERODE AT
BEGINNING OF FORECAST PERIOD. HAVE NOT PLACED ANY MENTION OF WX
SINCE CLOUD LAYER IS VERY SHALLOW WITH BASES AT 4500-5000 FT MSL.
WILL WATCH TO SEE HOW DEEP CLOUDS GET ON IR SATELLITE PICS--LATEST
CLOUD TOPS ARE ABOUT -11 TO -12 DEG C OVER SMOKIES...IF THEY GET TO
-17 WOULD LIKELY UPDATE TO PUT IN SOME FLURRIES.

AFTER UPSLOPE CLOUDS ERODE LATER THIS MORNING SHOULD BE CLEAR
ACROSS THE AREA FOR REST OF DAY AND MOST OF TONIGHT. WEAK
DISTURBANCE SWEEPS IN ON FRIDAY THAT WILL GENERATE SOME MID LEVEL
CLOUDS...BUT NO PRECIP.  

FOR TEMPS...WENT A LITTLE ABOVE GUIDANCE IN SOUTH AND A LITTLE
BELOW GUIDANCE IN THE NORTH TODAY...LOOKING UPSTREAM INTO SOURCE
REGION APPROXIMATELY SERN MO AND SRN IL...THERE WAS A PRETTY GOOD
SW-NE GRADIENT OF HIGH TEMPS ON WEDNESDAY.  THINKING MODELS
UNDERPLAYING OUR GRADIENT BETWEEN KCHA AND KTRI...MODELS AVERAGED
ABOUT 6 DEGREES DIFFERENCE...THINKING MORE LIKE 9-10 DEGREES
DIFFERENCE IN STORE TODAY. FOR OTHER 3 PERIODS...NEW GUIDANCE VALUES
VERY CLOSE TO CURRENT FORECAST...ONLY MINOR TWEAKINGS.

.LONG TERM...(SAT THROUGH WED)...MEAN EASTERN TROUGH TO PERSIST 
THROUGH THE PERIOD...WITH INDIVIDUAL SHORT WAVES MOVING THROUGH AND 
REINFORCING THE EASTERN TROUGH. ONE WAVE SHOULD ARRIVE SUNDAY...BUT 
THIS SYSTEM LOOKS MOISTURE STARVED WITH LITTLE FORCING...SO WILL 
JUST INCREASE CLOUDS AND WILL GO DRY FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT.   
NEXT WAVE IS FORECAST FOR TUESDAY/TUES NIGHT...AND THIS SYSTEM LOOKS 
LIKE IT MAY BE A LITTLE MORE SIGNIFICANT. WILL GO WITH SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS NORTH AND CENTRAL TUE...THEN SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH AND SMOKIES 
FOR TUE NIGHT INTO WED IN UPSLOPE FLOW.  GFS MOS TEMPS GENERALLY 
LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.

AND WILL MOVE NE OF THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. SFC HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING INTO THE AREA FM THE WEST. CLOUDS SHOULD ALSO DISSIPATE 
FAIRLY FAST THIS EVENING AS DRY AIR FILTERS IN. ANTICYCLONIC LOW 
LEVEL FLOW IN WAKE OF FRONT NOT VERY CONDUCIVE FOR UPSLOPE SPRINKLES 
OR FLURRIES TONIGHT. GOOD MIXING EXPECTED OVERNIGHT AND THE 
TRANSPORT OF DRY AIR WILL HINDER FOG FORMATION. SFC HIGH PRESSURE 
MOVES EAST ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH SHORT TERM. DAYTIME DPS WILL 
DIP BELOW 20F FOR THU AND FRI. COLD NIGHTS AND COOL DAYS INTO THE 
WEEKEND. BROAD TROUGH DEVELOPING ACROSS EASTERN US. A FEW SHORT 
WAVES WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MEAN TROUGH. THE TAIL END OF ONE OF 
THESE WAVES WILL MOVE ACROSS N PART OF MRX CWA BRINGING SOME CLOUD 
COVER N AREAS FRI AND FRI NIGHT. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...RECEIPT OF THE MODELS 
CAUSING SOME PROBLEMS...BUT ENOUGH CAME IN TO MAKE THE FORECAST.  
GOOD REINFORCING SHORT WAVE SWINGS THROUGH THE REGION ON SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON INTO SUNDAY NIGHT WITH A SHOT OF PRECIP POSSIBLE 
PARTICULARLY IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE PREFERRED UPSLOPE AREAS.  
SOME OF THIS PRECIP COULD BE IN THE FORM OF SNOW...HOWEVER...IT 
DOESNT LOOK LIKE HEAVY AMOUNTS AT THIS TIME.  YET ANOTHER SHORT 
WAVE SWINGS INTO THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY WITH THE SAME AREA UNDER

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT)...STRONGER CONVECTION ABOUT
OUT OF AREA NOW WITH TRAILING PRECIP HANGING BACK ACROSS MUCH OF
CWA. WAVES MOVING UP THE BACK SIDE OF LINE KEEPING WEST EDGE OF RAIN
SHIELD SWELLED PRETTY FAR WEST. HOWEVER...BETTER PUSH T0 EAST NOW
STARTED OVER PLATEAU. NAM SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THIS
SITUATION AND IT SHOWS RAINS WEAKENING AND EXITING OUR NE CORNER
AROUND 18Z. REMAINING CLOUDS/MOISTURE VERY SHALLOW...SO NOT
EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF UPSLOPE PRECIP IN SRN APPS THIS AFTERNOON.

COLD AIR WILL BE FLOWING INTO THE AREA...WITH HIGH TEMPS STILL
LOOKING TO BE EARLY MORNING READINGS. CLEARING AND QUITE COLD
TONIGHT...BUT WINDS NOT EXPECTED TO DECOUPLE...SO THAT SHOULD KEEP
IT FROM GETTING AS COLD TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(THU THROUGH TUE)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO 
BUILD IN THU...AND ATMOSPHERE WILL BE QUITE DRY THU AND THU 
NIGHT...SO WILL GO MOSTLY CLEAR/CLEAR.  MODELS INDICATE THAT THE 
EASTERN CONUS WILL GENERALLY REMAIN IN A LONG WAVE TROUGH FOR THE 
PERIOD...WITH INDIVIDUAL SHORT WAVES MOVING THROUGH MEAN EASTERN 
TROUGH.  FIRST OF THESE FORECAST FOR FRIDAY...BUT MOISTURE LOOKS 
QUITE LIMITED SO WILL JUST INCREASE CLOUDS A BIT.  NEXT WAVE AROUND 
THE SUNDAY TIME FRAME...AND RIGHT NOW THAT LOOKS LIKE IT MAY HAVE A 
LITTLE MORE MOISTURE TO WORK WITH.  WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON/SUNDAY NIGHT FOR MAINLY NORTHERN 
AREAS.  WILL GENERALLY LEAVE MONDAY AND TUESDAY ALONE FOR NOW.  WILL 
UNDERCUT MAV TEMPS A LITTLE FOR THU...THEN ONLY MINOR TWEAKS FOR THU

.DISCUSSION...SEVERE STORMS AND TORNADOES CONTINUE OVER MAINLY 
WESTERN PARTS OF MIDDLE TN THIS EVENING...WITH STORMS ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY ATTEMPTING TO OVERTAKE THE SQUALL LINE 
ACTIVITY JUST TO THE EAST OF THE FRONT.

16/00Z OHX SOUNDING SHOWS ABOUT A 60 KNOT LOW LEVEL JET WITH 0-3KM 
STORM RELATIVE HELICITY VALUES AROUND 600.  SURFACE BASED 
INSTABILITY REMAINS LOWEST ACROSS OUR PART OF THE STATE...WITH 
POSITIVE CAPES OF AROUND 500 J/KG NOTED ON LATEST OHX SOUNDING.

AREA OBSERVATIONS SHOW S-SW SURFACE WINDS HAVE DIMINISHED ACROSS OUR 
FORECAST AREA...EVEN AT TYS WHERE WINDS HAD GUSTED ALL AFTERNOON.  
THINKING THAT THE CONVECTION JUST AHEAD OF AND ALONG THE FRONT WILL 
HAVE POTENTIAL FOR DAMAGING WINDS...SO DONT SEE THE NEED FOR A WIND 
ADVISORY...ALTHO WINDS MAY GUST BEHIND THE FRONT TO NEAR AT LEAST 
LAKE WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA.  

LACK OF INSTABILITY MAY BE A LIMITING FACTOR...BUT EXPECT THE NEED 
FOR WARNINGS FOR AT LEAST OUR CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES BY LATE 
EVENING...POSSIBLY INTO EARLY MORNING HOURS IF CONVECTION REMAINS 
ORGANIZED WITH THE FRONT.  STAFFING FOR A SIGNIFICANT SEVERE EVENT 
AND HAM RADIO NETWORK HAS ALREADY BEEN ACTIVATED. 

BASICALLY CURRENT FORECAST AND GRIDS LOOK RIGHT ON TRACK...WITH AN 
UPDATE NEEDED FOR ZFP IF OR WHEN A WATCH IS ISSUED FOR OUR AREA.
WILL FRESHEN GRIDS AND WEB PRODUCTS AS WELL IF NEEDED.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WARM FRONT ACROSS THE MID WEST AND A COLD FRONT 
ACROSS WESTERN ARKANSAS...OCCURRING IN ASSOCIATION WITH A STRONG 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE OZARKS. TWO PRE-FRONTAL LINES OF 
CONVECTION HAVE EXPLODED ACROSS THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY EARLY THIS 
AFTERNOON...AND EXPECT THESE LINES OF CONVECTION TO SLOWLY ADVANCE 
EAST ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS EVENING. DOWNSLOPING SOUTHERLY 
WINDS OVER THE REGION HAVE ALREADY RESULTED IN RECORD TEMPS AT TYS 
AND TRI EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. DEWPOINTS HAVE REMAINED IN THE 50S TO 
NEAR 60 ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...SO INSTABILITY LEVELS WILL LIKELY 
REMAIN MARGINAL THIS EVENING AS THE LINE OF CONVECTION APPROACHES 
THE PLATEAU. SPECIAL 18Z SOUNDING FROM NASHVILLE ALSO ONLY INDICATES 
A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIRMASS ACROSS MIDDLE TN...BUT WITH A STRONG 
WIND FIELD AND LARGE HELICITY VALUES. WITH A STRONG LOW-LEVEL JET 
AROUND 850 MB EXPECTED ALONG THE COLD FRONT...THINK THAT A LARGE 
DAMAGING WIND EVENT WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE AS THE FRONT APPROACHES 
THE FORECAST AREA TOWARDS MIDNIGHT AND THEREAFTER. LOW LEVEL (0-1 
KM) HELICITY VALUES REMAIN LARGE AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT ACROSS 
MIDDLE TN AND NORTHEAST TN THIS EVENING...SO THINK THAT AN ISOLATED 
TORNADO MAY BE POSSIBLE AROUND THE PLATEAU BEFORE THE AIRMASS 
STABILIZES OVERNIGHT. ON WEDNESDAY...A FEW SHOWERS WILL LIKELY 
LINGER BEHIND THE FRONT DURING THE MORNING HOURS...WITH MUCH COLDER 
AIR FILTERING INTO THE FORECAST AREA. IN FACT...TEMPS WILL LIKELY 
FALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY. A FEW SNOW SHOWERS MAY BE 
POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY EVENING ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AS STRONG UPSLOPE 
FLOW SQUEEZES OUT SOME LINGERING MOISTURE.


.LONG TERM...(THU THROUGH TUE)...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
GENERALLY AGREE THAT EASTERN CONUS WILL REMAIN IN LONG-WAVE TROUGH 
THROUGH MOST OF THE LONG-TERM PERIOD. HOWEVER...POOR AGREEMENT AMONG 
MODELS AND ENSEMBLES EXISTS REGARDING TIMING AND INTENSITY OF 
INDIVIDUAL EVENTS WITH LOW CONFIDENCE IN EXTENDED FORECAST THE 
RESULT. THUS HAVE NOT MADE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO EXTENDED 
FORECAST/GRIDS. GENERALLY FOLLOWED ENSEMBLE MEAN GUIDANCE FOR TEMPS. 
AT ANY RATE...LONG-WAVE TROUGH PORTENDS BELOW CLIMO TEMPS THROUGH 
EARLY NEXT WEEK.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WARM FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY AND MIDWEST...WITH A DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER THE 
OZARKS REGION. IN RESPONSE TO THIS STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM... 
SOUTHERLY WINDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE TODAY ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA. IN FACT...EXPECT DOWNSLOPING WINDS OFF THE MOUNTAINS 
THIS AFTERNOON...RESULTING IN LESS CLOUD COVER AND MORE WARMING 
ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY AREAS. SATELLITE IMAGES

240 PM EST MON NOV 14 2005

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS A WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED WARM FRONT ACROSS CENTRAL EAST TN... 
WITH A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS AND SOME EMBEDDED THUNDER OCCURRING IN 
ASSOCIATION WITH IT ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS WARM 
FRONT SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTH THIS EVENING WITH GOOD UPPER- 
LEVEL DYNAMICS...SO EXPECT RAIN TO CONTINUE THIS EVENING BUT 
GRADUALLY DECREASE FROM SOUTH TO NORTH OVERNIGHT. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH AMPLIFYING A LONG-WAVE TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS TONIGHT 
INTO TUESDAY...WHICH WILL DEEPEN A LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER THE MID 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND CREATE BREEZY WINDS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
ON TUESDAY. WITH STRONG SOUTHWEST FLOW EXPECTED...THINK THAT TEMPS 
TOMORROW WILL RISE HIGHER THAN GUIDANCE VALUES AND POSSIBLY APPROACH 
RECORD VALUES (CHA 77...TYS 76...OQT 74...TRI 75). THE STRONGEST 
DYNAMICS WITH THIS SYSTEM ON TUESDAY SHOULD BE LOCATED NORTH AND 
WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA...SO OVERALL...IT SHOULD BE A DRY DAY 
TOMORROW FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...WILL CONTINUE WITH 
A SMALL POP TO ACCOUNT FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A FEW SHOWERS.

BY TUESDAY NIGHT...MODELS INDICATE THAT A STRONG WIND FIELD WILL 
DEVELOP ALONG THE COLD FRONT AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE TENNESSEE RIVER 
VALLEY...RESULTING IN STRONG UPPER DYNAMICS ALONG THE FRONT. IN 
ADDITION...HELICITY VALUES BECOME QUITE LARGE AHEAD OF THE FRONT... 
WHICH SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME SUPERCELLS DEVELOPING ACROSS 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY AHEAD OF THE MAIN FRONTAL BAND. THE AMOUNT OF 
INSTABILITY OVER THE FORECAST AREA REMAINS IN QUESTION...AND WILL 
ULTIMATELY DEPEND ON HOW MUCH WARMING OCCURS TOMORROW (AND HOW MUCH 
SOLAR WARMING OCCURS FROM POSSIBLE BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER). RIGHT 
NOW...IT WOULD APPEAR THAT A SIGNIFICANT SEVERE WEATHER OUTBREAK 
COULD DEVELOP AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY... 
WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A FEW TORNADOES IN THE FORECAST AREA. WILL 
GO AHEAD AND ISSUE A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT TO MENTION THIS 
POSSIBLE SCENARIO FOR TUESDAY NIGHT. STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION 
BEHIND THE FRONT WILL RESULT IN FALLING TEMPS THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON 
WEDNESDAY.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...UPSLOPE FLOW NORTHWEST 
FLOW AND WRAP-AROUND BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE WILL PRODUCE A CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS (SOME SNOW SHOWERS) ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WEDNESDAY NIGHT. OTHERWISE...A RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY AND THURSDAY 
NIGHT WITH SKIES CLEARING. CALM WINDS...CLEAR SKY AND DRY AIRMASS 
WILL PRODUCE GOOD RADITIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS FOR FRIDAY MORNING...
SO COLDEST NIGHT OF THE SEASON EXPECTED.

ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE WILL DIG SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES FRIDAY
NIGHT AND SATURDAY WITH BRUNT OF THE ENERGY STAYING WELL NORTH OF THE
REGION NEXT WEEKEND. HOWEVER...ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS
THE REGION SUNDAY BRINGING WITH IT ANOTHER SHOT OF COLD AIR WITH 850
MB TEMPERATURES DROPPING TO -5 TO -8 DEGREES. AIRMASS TOO DRY FOR 
PRECIPITATION WITH FROPA...BUT ENOUGH WRAP-AROUND BOUNDARY LAYER 
MOISTURE AND UPSLOPE FLOW TO INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN/SNOW
SHOWERS FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE SUNDAY NIGHT.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT LOCATED 
GENERALLY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...WITH DEWPOINTS REMAINING IN THE

ADDITIONAL PROGRESS SOUTHEAST...BEFORE LIFTING BACK NORTH AS A WARM 
FRONT LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT.  CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE WILL LINGER 
OVER OUR AREA...AND ANY WEAK IMPULSES IN THE FLOW WILL LIKELY 
TRIGGER SOME SHOWERS.  HOWEVER...DIFFICULT TO FIND MUCH IN THE WAY

SECTOR OF CENTRAL U.S. STORM SYSTEM DURING THE DAY TUESDAY AND KEPT 
SMALL CHANCE POPS GOING WITH FAIRLY DECENT MOISTURE ADVECTION 
PASSAGE OF A COUPLE WEAK IMPULSES AND SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT. MAIN 
EVENT OCCURS TUESDAY NIGHT FROM AROUND 05Z THROUGH 12Z WEDNESDAY AS

THE FROPA WHICH FEATURES A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS 
COMPLIMENTS OF SPC ALTHOUGH MODEL INSTABILITY WAS NOT TOO 
IMPRESSIVE. HELD ONTO POPS IN THE MORNING WEDNESDAY AS POWERFUL

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...SURPRISINGLY DIFFICULT FORECAST, 
ESPECIALLY ON THE POP PART. CURRENTLY COLD FRONT LIES ACROSS 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY MOVING SLOWLY EAST. DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS 
HAVE LOWERED DRAMATICALLY TODAY, AND HELD OUT THE HOPE FOR SOME RAIN 
OVER THE ENTIRE AREA. LIFTING MECHANISMS HAVE BEEN WEAK AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE SO EVEN AS UPPER TROF MOVES ACROSS AREA TONIGHT AND 
TOMORROW. TROUBLE IS, THAT THE COLDEST AIR ALOFT IS WELL NORTH, WITH 
ONLY -14C OR SO AT H5. THIS NOT BE ENOUGH TO GENERATE THUNDERSTORMS, 
AND EVEN THE H7 LIFT IS DEBATABLE OVERNIGHT. FRONT WEAKENS AS IT 
MOVES EAST AND BECOMES BARELY DISCERNABLE. MOS GUIDANCE IS QUITE 
UNREALISTICALLY HIGH, WITH LIKELIES AND EVEN CATEGORICAL POPS 
OVERNIGHT, WITH VERY LOW QPF LIKELY. THIS PRESENTS A DILLEMA: HIGH 
POPS GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF A DELUGE FORECAST. HAVE COUNTERED THE 
MODEL GUIDANCE WITH HIGH CHANCES TO LOW LIKELIES AND SERIOUSLY 
LOWERED THE QPF THROUGH MONDAY. WENT BASICALLY WITH BLEND TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF MOISTURE BUT LIFTING MECHANISMS WILL BE 
LACKING FOR PRECIP MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. MOS POPS ARE LIKELY TO 
CATEGORICAL...WHICH SEEMS WAY TOO HIGH AS THE ONLY LIFT IN THE NAM 
IS WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT. THE GFS SUFFERS FROM CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK 
PROBLEMS SO ITS HIGH POPS AND QPF WILL BE MOSTLY IGNORED. WILL HAVE 
CHANCE POPS MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...RISING TO LIKELY POPS IN THE 
WEST TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE NEXT FRONT APPROACHES. THE MODELS HAVE 
SLOWED DOWN THIS SYSTEM...AND TIME FRAME OF GREATEST LIFT LOOKS TO 
BE BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z. DYNAMICS WITH THE TROUGH/JET ARE IMPRESSIVE SO 
THUNDER WILL CONTINUE TO BE MENTIONED THOUGH THE FRONT COMES THROUGH 
OVERNIGHT. WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS EAST/CHANCE WEST THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
MORNING...DECREASING QUICKLY TO SLIGHT CHANCES EAST WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON. BEHIND THE FRONT...THE GFS HAS TRENDED FARTHER NORTH WITH 
THE UPPER TROUGH VORTICITY AND WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE. WILL REMOVE 
POPS AND SNOW MENTION ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BUT KEEP MOSTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES IN THE NORTHEAST AS MOISTURE IS CONFINED BELOW 850 MB. 

FORECAST WILL REMAIN DRY WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES THURSDAY 
THROUGH SUNDAY. A SERIES OF SHORTWAVE TROUGHS DIVE SOUTHEAST OUT OF 
CANADA...BRINING REINFORCING SHOTS OF COLD DRY AIR. MOISTURE IS 
LIMITED WITH EACH SYSTEM AND MAY ONLY INCREASE CLOUDS.

DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS OVER AREA RANGING FROM 10 TO 30 DEGREES AT 10 
PM LAST NIGHT. AT 9 AM TODAY, THEY RANGED FROM 7 TO ABOUT 20 DEGREES 
WITH A CLEAR LOWERING TREND CONTINUING. MOST NOTICABLE ON THE 
PLATEAU, RAIN SHOWERS ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT TO THE GROUND. POPS LOOK 
HIGH RIGHT AT THE MOMENT BUT AS LOWER ATMOSPHERE MOISTENS, THEY WILL

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODELS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR 
THE SHORT TERM...ALTHOUGH SOME DISCREPANCIES IN THE DETAILS.  THINK 
A NAM/GFS BLEND OFFERS A REASONABLE SOLUTION.  SLOW MOVING FRONT 
SHOULD APPROACH FROM THE NORTHWEST TODAY...AND MOVE INTO THE AREA 
TONIGHT.  MODELS AGREE ON BRINGING DEEP MOISTURE INTO THE AREA...BUT 
FORCING IS FAIRLY LIMITED...ESPECIALLY OVER THE EASTERN ZONES...AND 
INSTABILITY MINIMAL.  WILL GO WITH CHANCE POPS MOST ZONES 
TODAY...ALTHOUGH LIKELY FAR WEST...THEN MAINLY 70 TO 80 POPS FOR

LOOK REASONABLE...SO ONLY A FEW MINOR TWEAKS.    

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...COOL FRONT STALLS OVER THE 
APPALACHIANS EARLY ON MONDAY AND THEN MOVES SLOWLY NORTH ACROSS THE

FROM THE WESTERN CANADIAN PROVINCES INTO THE NORTH CENTRAL U.S. 
MODELS PROG A FAIR AMOUNT OF ISENTROPIC LIFT WITH INCREASING 
MOISTURE ADVECTION MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT AS LOW LEVEL FLO 
STRENGTHENS. USED CHANCE POPS FOR THIS PERIOD. UPPER TROF AND 
ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM PRESS STEADILY EAST ON TUESDAY AND KEPT 
POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE FOR THIS PERIOD RAISING TO LIKELY TUESDAY 
NIGHT FOR FROPA. LIS AND CAPE INDICATIVE OF CONVECTION AND STAYED 
WITH SHRA/TSRA FOR THE EVENT TUESDAY NIGHT WHICH FEATURES HIGHER 
PWS FOR MORE SUBSTANTIAL RAINFALL THAN INITIAL FRONT AFFECTING THE 
AREA SUNDAY NIGHT. FROPA OCCURS A LITTLE BEFORE 12Z WED WITH MORE 
ENERGY DROPPING INTO TRAILING UPPER LEVEL TROF ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES/MIDWEST. SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE/LIFT FOR THE PRODUCTION 
OF SCATTERED -SHRA AND -SHSN IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY EVENING. LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATION EXPECTED ATTM.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...CURRENTLY WEAK RIDGE OVER EASTERN 
CONUS IS RAPIDLY MOVING EAST. UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT 
OUT OVER THE MISSOURI VALLEY WILL APPROACH EAST TENNESSEE SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON. EXPECT SLOW MOVEMENT OF BROAD FRONTAL ZONE TO ENTER THE 
FORECAST AREA BETWEEN 18-21Z SUNDAY. VIRTUALLY NO CAPE ASSOCIATED 
WITH THIS ZONE, AND SOME CIN WILL KEEP MUCH STRONG UVV FROM 
HAPPENING. HOWEVER K INDEX VALUES ARE IN THE UPPER 20S-LOW 30S AND 
INDICATE THAT LAYER HUMIDITY WILL INCREASE IN RESPONSE TO RETURN 
FLOW FROM SFC HIGH AND FROM COLD TEMPS ALOFT INCREASING OVERALL 
SFC-H5 RH. THIS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO INCREASE POPS DRAMATICALLY 
LATE TOMORROW MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS. WITH ADEQUATE SFC 
HEATING TODAY AND SOME OVERNIGHT CLOUDS INHIBITING COOLING, EXPECT 
THAT PRESENCE OF WEAK FRONT WILL BE ENOUGH TO TRIGGER ISOLATED 
THUNDER TOMORROW, WITH CHANCES INCREASING AS DAY PROGRESSES. HAVE 
KNOCKED MAX TEMPS DOWN A HAIR, AND OVERNIGHT MINS UP A HAIR, DUE TO 
INCREASING CLOUD COVER AND POPS. DONT EXPECT MUCH IN THE WAY OF 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS, AS ATMOSPHERE IS SO DRY, POPS AND QPF ARE NOT 
NECESSARILY DEPENDANT ON ONE ANOTHER.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...COLD FRONT STALLS 
OVER THE AREA ON SUNDAY NIGHT...AND A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSES 
OVERHEAD. WILL RAISE POPS TO LIKELY BEFORE MIDNIGHT WITH A MENTION 
OF ONLY ISOLATED THUNDER...AS INSTABILITY IS VERY WEAK. ON MONDAY 
THE 850 MB FLOW TURNS TO THE SOUTH AND INCREASES IN RESPONSE TO AN 
APPROACHING CLOSED LOW COMING OUT OF CANADA. RESULTING ISENTROPIC 
LIFT WILL RESULT IN CHANCE POPS MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. PRECIP WILL 
LIKELY BE LIGHT HOWEVER TO DUE A LACK OF OTHER FORCING MECHANISMS. 
GFS APPEARS TO HAVE CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK PROBLEMS DURING THIS TIME 
AND ITS OMEGA MAXES WILL BE IGNORED. 

DIGGING UPPER TROUGH AND STRONG UPPER JET WILL BRING STRONG LIFT TO 
THE AREA ON TUESDAY EVENING. POPS WILL BE RAISED TO LIKELY. COLD 
FRONT WILL BE THROUGH THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH THE UPPER 
TROUGH AXIS LINGERING BEHIND. SOME WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE...A 
NORTHWEST UPSLOPE FLOW...AND VORTICITY WITH THE TROUGH AXIS COULD 
PROVIDE SOME PRECIP ACROSS SW VA ON WEDNESDAY. TEMPS MAY BE COLD 
ENOUGH FOR SNOW...AND WILL MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE ABOVE 2KFT. HIGH 
PRESSURE AND A WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT PROVIDE DRY AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPS 
THROUGH FRIDAY. A LONGWAVE TROUGH DEEPENS OVER THE EASTERN CONUS ON 
SATURDAY WITH ANOTHER FROPA...BUT IT APPEARS TO BE DRY AT THIS TIME.

OVERALL THEY LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...TIS THE SEASON OF NUMEROUS 
FROPA AS AN UPPER TROF DRIVES EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES DRAGGING A 
COLD FRONT TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA. NUDGED POPS UP TEN PERCENT 
ACROSS THE BOARD FOR SUNDAY WITH LIKELY POPS ON THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU NEAR THE KENTUCKY BORDER AND CHANCE POPS ELSEWHERE. FRONT 
BECOMES A SLOW MOVER AS MORE ENERGY BUILDS INTO THE BACK SIDE OF 
BROAD TROF ACROSS THE U.S. CAUSING UPPER LEVEL FLOW TO TURN MORE 
SOUTHWESTERLY WHICH EVENTUALLY STALLS FRONTAL BOUNDARY NEAR THE 
APPALACHIANS ON MONDAY REQUIRING THE CONTINUED USE OF POPS FOR 
-SHRA/-TSRA DURING THE DAY AND EVENING AS LOW LEVEL WINDS BECOME 
SOUTHERLY AHEAD OF AMPLIFYING TROF OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. MODELS 
INDICATE SUFFICIENT MOISTURE WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT DEVELOPING. UPPER 
TROF STRENGTHENS WITH ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT BUILDING THROUGH THE 
REGION ON TUESDAY. USED 50 PERCENT POPS FOR SHRA/TSRA FOR EVENT. 
MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW TRAILING S/WV ENERGY DROPPING INTO THE BACK 
SIDE OF EASTERN GREAT LAKES UPPER TROF WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND 
CAA/UPSLOPE COMPONENT FOR CHANCE -SHRA ACROSS TERRAIN AREAS 
INCLUDING THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINA 
AS WELL AS TENNESSEE/NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. DRIER WEST NORTHWESTERLY

206 PM EST FRI NOV 11 2005

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE AREA WILL ONCE AGAIN GIVE GOOD RADIATIONAL 
COOLING CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT. WILL UNDERCUT MOS GUIDANCE BY A COUPLE 
DEGREES...AND HAVE LOWS IN THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S. DEWPOINTS 
SHOULD RECOVER AFTER SUNSET FROM THE SINGLE DIGITS CURRENTLY 
OBSERVED IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS. SKIES REMAIN CLEAR THROUGH SATURDAY 
NIGHT...AND HIGH TEMPS SATURDAY SHOULD REACH THE 65 TO 70 RANGE.

A DEEP SOUTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS SATURDAY NIGHT AS THE RIDGE AXIS 
SHIFTS EAST. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION KICKS IN ON SUNDAY 
MORNING...AND THE MID LEVEL VORT AXIS AND UPPER JET PROVIDE LIFT ON 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON. INSTABILITY LOOKS LIMITED BUT LIFT SHOULD BE 
STRONG ENOUGH TO CONTINUE MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS. WILL HAVE HIGH 
CHANCE POPS SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH MIDNIGHT. THE SURFACE FRONT 
APPEARS TO STALL SOMEWHERE NEAR THE MOUNTAINS ACCORDING TO THE 
GFS...SO WILL LEAVE A LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE MENTION IN FOR MONDAY IN 
THE EAST.  

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
A LONGWAVE TROUGH DIGS SOUTH OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS ON MONDAY 
NIGHT...PUSHING A COLD FRONT INTO THE AREA ON TUESDAY. 12Z GFS 
PLACES THE GREATEST LIFT OVER THE AREA AT 18Z...AND GIVEN THE 
STRENGTH OF THE UPPER JET JUST TO THE NORTH THE LIFT COULD BE QUITE 
STRONG. WILL NUDGE POPS UP A BIT AND CONTINUE MENTION OF 
THUNDERSTORMS. THE GFS SEEMS TO BE THE FASTEST OF THE MODELS SO WILL 
KEEP A POP IN ON TUESDAY NIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SLIGHTLY SLOWER 
DGEX AND ECMWF. SOME WRAP AROUND MOISTURE AND COOLING ALOFT COULD 
PRODUCE SOME SHOWERS IN SW VA ON WEDNESDAY...AND WILL HAVE A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP THERE. AIR MASS BEHIND THIS FRONT IS QUITE COLD AND 
DRY...WITH DROPPING TEMPS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY BELOW NORMAL. GFS 
SHOWS ANOTHER FRONT APPROACHING FOR FRIDAY...BUT WITH A WESTERLY 
FLOW ALOFT AND LIMITED MOISTURE...WILL BEGIN FRIDAY DRY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
COLD FRONT ACROSS SRN IN/WRN KY WILL CROSS THE AREA TONIGHT. SHOWERS 
THAT HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS MIDDLE TN DO NOT APPEAR TO BE VERY DEEP 
DUE TO THE STRONG MIDLEVEL INVERSION IN THE OHX SOUNDING THIS 
MORNING. 850 MB THETA-E RIDGE WILL EXTEND OVER THE AREA AROUND 
03Z...AND THE DIGGING UPPER JET WILL CREATE UPPER DIVERGENCE AROUND 
THE SAME TIME. HOWEVER THE INSTABILITY APPEARS MARGINAL AT BEST AS 
MOISTURE IS LACKING. SURFACE HEATING WILL ALSO BE LOST AT THE TIME 
OF FROPA. THUS THE SEVERE THREAT APPEARS TO BE MINIMAL...AND 
THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE WILL BE MAINLY ISOLATED. MOS GUIDANCE POPS ARE 
ALL LIKELY OR HIGHER OVERNIGHT...BUT WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS ONLY IN 
THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SW VA WITH CHANCE POPS ELSEWHERE. 

FRONT WILL BE THROUGH THE AREA BEFORE 12Z TOMORROW. A MUCH DRIER AIR 
MASS WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 20S. WINDS WILL 
ALSO INCREASE TO 15 TO 25 MPH...WITH GUSTS IN THE MOUNTAINS UP TO 
35. HOWEVER AFTER SUNSET WE SHOULD DECOUPLE NICELY AS THE HIGH 
PRESSURE CENTER MOVES OVERHEAD. WILL UNDERCUT MOS TEMPS A BIT AND 
HAVE LOWS MAINLY IN THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S. A LARGE HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGE WILL BE CROSSING THE AREA FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY...GIVING CLEAR SKIES AND GRADUALLY WARMING TEMPS...WITH 
HIGHS INTO THE MID/UPPER 60S BY SATURDAY. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
RIDGE AXIS WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA ON SATURDAY NIGHT...GIVING A 
DEEP SOUTHWEST FLOW AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. THE MODELS 
ARE IN BASIC AGREEMENT ON THE FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE AREA SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON AND SUNDAY NIGHT. FLOW ALOFT IS NEARLY PARALLEL TO THE 
FRONT...SO ONCE IT HITS THE MOUNTAINS IT BECOMES NEARLY STATIONARY. 
THUS WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS IN THE MOUNTAINS THROUGH MONDAY. A 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH PUSHES THE FRONT FARTHER EAST ON MONDAY 
NIGHT...THEN A SECOND FRONT APPROACHES ON TUESDAY/TUESDAY NIGHT. 
THIS FRONT LOOKS MOISTURE STARVED BUT WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. 
FRONT SHOULD BE THROUGH BY WEDNESDAY WITH CLEARING SKIES AND COOLING

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST 
U.S. WITH A COLD FRONT LOCATED ACROSS THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER 
VALLEY. SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL SCATTERED CONVECTION OCCURRING ALONG 
A WARM FRONT NORTH OF THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...AND THINK THAT THIS 
CONVECTION WILL STAY NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THE LOCAL AIRMASS REMAINING CAPPED UNTIL 
LATER THIS AFTERNOON WHEN THE COLD FRONT NEARS THE FORECAST AREA. 
THIS FRONT SHOULD RAPIDLY MOVE SOUTHEAST TODAY AND APPROACH THE 
PLATEAU BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON. NAM MODEL REVEALS SOME MODERATE 
INSTABILITY DEVELOPING AHEAD OF THIS FRONT...AND EXPECT CONVECTION 
TO RAPIDLY DEVELOP AROUND 00Z OVER SOUTHEAST KY AS AN UPPER TROUGH 
DEEPENS OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY JUST AS THE COLD FRONT ARRIVES 
NEAR THE NORTHERN PLATEAU. SOME SEVERE WEATHER APPEARS TO BE 
POSSIBLE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...WITH A STRONG WIND 
FIELD EXPECTED ALONG THE FRONT. 

MUCH COLDER TEMPS (BUT ACTUALLY CLOSER TO NORMAL) WILL MOVE INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA BEHIND THE FRONT ON THURSDAY. A MODERATING TREND WILL 
THEN QUICKLY DEVELOP BY THE WEEKEND...AS AN UPPER RIDGE BUILDS 
ACROSS THE REGION. GFS MODEL INDICATES THAT THE NEXT COLD FRONT WILL 
MOVE INTO THE AREA BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...WITH ANOTHER CHANCE FOR 
CONVECTION THROUGH MONDAY MORNING. 

ANOTHER DAY OF UNSEASONABLY WARM TEMPS IS EXPECTED TODAY...AND WILL 
TREND WARMER THAN GUIDANCE TEMPS. RECORD HIGHS ARE AGAIN EXPECTED... 
POSSIBLY AT ALL FOUR OBSERVATION SITES. THE RECORD HIGHS FOR TODAY 
ARE 79 (CHA)...78 (TYS)...77 (OQT)...AND 78 (TRI).

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...ANOTHER DAY OF 
EXTREMELY MILD TEMPERATURES EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY AS THE PRESSURE 
GRADIENT TIGHTENS AHEAD OF THE NEXT UPPER TROF/FRONTAL SYSTEM TAKING 
SHAPE OVER THE PLAINS STATES. IN FACT RECORDS COULD BE BROKEN YET 
AGAIN AT CHA AND TYS PRIOR TO AN INCREASE IN MEAN RH OVER THE AREA. 
TIMING OF THE FRONT EVEN FASTER THAN YESTERDAYS THINKING WITH 
ARRIVAL ON THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST 
KENTUCKY/VIRGINIA BORDER AROUND 01Z-03Z THU. POSITION OF LOW LEVEL 
RIDGING ELONGNATED IN AN W-E FASHION ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH/GULF

WEDNESDAY NIGHT FOR THE FRONT WHICH DEPARTS SOUTHEAST SECTIONS OF FA 
CLOSE TO DAYBREAK THU. USED TSRA WITH THE FRONT ALTHOUGH BEST 
DYNAMICS AND INSTABILITY NORTH OF THE REGION AND EVENT TIMING AT

SOUTH BEHIND THE FRONT FOR THU/THU NITE WITH MAX TEMPS BACK TO 
NORMAL IN THE UPPER 50S NORTH AND LOW TO MID 60S SOUTH. SHOULD BE 
QUITE A BIT COLDER THURSDAY NIGHT WITH MINS AROUND 5 TO 10 DEGREES 
BELOW NORMAL DUE TO RADIATION IN CALM WIND DRY AND ATMOSPHERE 
ENVIRONMENT.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A WARM FRONT STRETCHING FROM WEST TN 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS NORTHERN AL AND CENTRAL GA. DEWPOINTS WERE IN THE 
50S SOUTH OF THIS WARM FRONT...AND EXPECT THESE HIGHER DEWPOINTS TO 
ADVECT INTO THE FORECAST AREA TODAY AS THIS WARM FRONT MOVES NORTH. 
THIS WARM FRONT SHOULD COMBINE WITH SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY AND A 
SHORT WAVE OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY TO PRODUCE SOME ISOLATED 
CONVECTION ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA TODAY. AFTER THIS 
WARM FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA...THE LOCAL AIRMASS SHOULD BE 
CAPPED ON WEDNESDAY...PREVENTING ANY CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE 
AFTERNOON DESPITE A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIRMASS. UNSEASONABLY WARM 
TEMPS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE REGION TODAY AND 
WEDNESDAY...WITH NEAR RECORD HIGHS EXPECTED AGAIN ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BRINGING SCATTERED CONVECTION. 
IN FACT...THINK THAT SOME SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH A 
STRONG WIND FIELD EXPECTED ALONG THE FRONT. MUCH COLDER TEMPS (BUT 
ACTUALLY CLOSER TO NORMAL) WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA BEHIND 
THE FRONT ON THURSDAY. A MODERATING TREND WILL QUICKLY DEVELOP BY 
THE WEEKEND...AS AN UPPER RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS THE REGION. GFS MODEL 
INDICATES THAT THE NEXT COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA BY SUNDAY 
NIGHT INTO MONDAY...WITH ANOTHER CHANCE FOR CONVECTION.

PRESSURES BUILD INTO THE FORECAST AREA. CU SHOULD FADE AWAY ACROSS 
MUCH OF THE AREA WITH SOME LOW CLOUDS REMAINING FOR A FEW HOURS

BIT OF SUNSHINE RETURNS ON MONDAY IN THE FAIR WEATHER REGIME. STAYED 
CLOSE TO A BLEND OF GUIDANCE TEMPS WHICH WAS A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE 
NAM NUMBERS. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER FLOW BECOMES
ZONAL INTO MID WEEK...WITH NAM AND GFS SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE WEAK
IMPULSE IN THIS FLOW (AIDED BY WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT) MAY GENERATE
SOME SPOTTY VERY LIGHT RAINS VERY LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY.
NAM SEEMS TO SLIGHTLY OVERDO THIS FEATURE WITH GFS MOS POPS STAYING
BELOW 20 PERCENT ACROSS THE BOARD. DECIDED TO TREND MORE WITH THE
GFS SOLUTION AND ONLY MENTION SPRINKLES FOR CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND
EXTREME SWRN VA ZONES FOR NOW...AND THIS ALSO MESHES WITH JKL GRIDS.

OTHERWISE...TIMING OF EAST TO WEST ORIENTED COLD FRONT LOOKS
SIMILAR FOR A BETTER CHANCE OF SHOWERS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO
THURSDAY NIGHT. SO NO CHANGES MADE FOR THOSE PERIODS...ALTHO DID
ADJUST DEWPOINT TEMPS A BIT FROM MONDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY NIGHT.

SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS IN ON FRIDAY AND FELT THAT JUST A POSSIBLE
LINGERING WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY DID NOT JUSTIFY KEEPING LOW POPS
FOR FRIDAY.  A SLIGHTLY MORE AMPLIFIED SHORTWAVE AND BETTER COLD
FRONT LOOK TO BRING AT LEAST CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY...AND I
INCLUDED A MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS AS INSTABILITY APPEARED TO BE
SIMILAR TO TODAYS CONDITIONS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE NEAR CHICAGO WITH ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT 
EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. THIS FRONT WILL 
CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...BUT THE 
MAIN DYNAMICS WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL MOVE NORTHEAST INTO THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION. THUS...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT CONVECTION 
ALONG THE FRONT WILL DIMINISH IN AREAL COVERAGE AS THE FRONT MOVES 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA AROUND NOON. MODELS REVEAL SOME MARGINAL 
INSTABILITY WITH THE FRONT AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
TODAY...AND THINK A FEW ISOLATED SEVERE TSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE DUE 
TO THE STRONG WIND FIELD ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT. HIGH PRESSURE 
THEN QUICKLY MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...WITH CLEARING 
SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS EXPECTED. TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO BE AROUND 5 
TO 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL TODAY AND TONIGHT. 


.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...EARLY WORK WEEK FEATURES 
GENERALLY TRANQUIL CONDITIONS WITH WELL-ABOVE-CLIMO TEMPS RETURNING 
AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS BACK INTO THE REGION. BOTH THE NAM AND GFS 
SUGGEST A MINOR NORTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE MAY AFFECT THE NORTHERN 
TIER OF OUR FORECAST AREA EARLY TUESDAY...BUT THE SHORT-RANGE 
ENSEMBLES AND CANADIAN GEM DO NOT SUPPORT THIS EVENT. WILL LEAVE 
FORECAST/GRIDS DRY FOR NOW. GFS HAS ALMOST COMPLETELY BACKED OFF THE 
VIGOROUS UPPER TROUGH/SURFACE COLD FRONT IT HAD BEEN ADVERTISING FOR 
THURSDAY. WILL NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES AT THIS TIME WITH THE

STILL TRYING TO SHOW CONVERGENCE BEGINNING AROUND 6Z TONIGHT WELL 
AHEAD OF MAIN AREA OF PRECIPITATION AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT THAT IS 
EXPECTED TO BE APPROACHING THE MS RIVER AT THAT TIME. CURRENTLY A 
LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS ARE MOVING EAST ACROSS MO AND EXTREME NW AR 
WHERE DYNAMICS ARE BEST. AS THIS AREA MOVES EAST BELIEVE IT WILL

INTO MI TONIGHT. THE BEST COVERAGE OF PRECIPITATION WITH ADVANCING 
UPPER TROF/COLD FRONT STILL LOOKS TO BE LATE TONIGHT AND SUNDAY

NORTHWEST OF THE REGION ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST AND GREAT LAKES.

237 AM EST SAT NOV 5 2005

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES 
REGION...WITH A DEEP LAYER OF SOUTHWEST FLOW AHEAD OF THIS FRONT. 
SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL SOME HIGH CLOUDS MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA...AS MOISTURE CONTINUES TO SLOWLY INCREASE AHEAD OF THE FRONT. 
MODELS INDICATE THAT A WEAK SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA TODAY...BUT WILL CONFINE A MENTION OF ISOLATED SHOWERS TO THE 
PLATEAU WHERE SOME WEAK INSTABILITY MAY DEVELOP. INSTABILITY 
INCREASES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT AS THE COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES...BUT IT APPEARS THIS INSTABILITY WILL ONLY BE MARGINAL 
AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH EARLY IN THE MORNING. THIS FRONT 
WONT BRING MUCH OF A COOL DOWN FOR THE AREA...AS TEMPS REMAIN 
AROUND 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL TODAY AND AGAIN ON SUNDAY.


.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...NEXT SIGNIFICANT EVENT 
APPROACHES ON THURSDAY AS UPPER TROUGH MIGRATES FROM THE CENTRAL 
PLAINS AND AMPLIFIES ZONAL FLOW OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 00Z 
GFS DEPICTS A VIGOROUS COLD FRONT WITH RELATIVELY HIGH QPFS 
ACCOMPANYING THIS SYSTEM. HOWEVER...THIS IS NOT SUPPORTED BY VARIOUS 
MODEL ENSEMBLES AT THIS TIME. THUS HAVE LEFT POPS IN CHANCE 
CATEGORY. THIS SYSTEM BEARS WATCHING HOWEVER. MADE ONLY MINOR TWEAKS 
TO REMAINDER OF LONG TERM FORECAST.

.DISCUSSION...A BROAD TROUGH IS DEVELOPING OVER THE MIDDLE OF THE 
COUNTRY WITH SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AS A 
RESULT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS GRADUALLY INCREASING THIS EVENING WITH 
DEWPOINTS RISING TO THE MID TO UPPER 40S NORTH AND LOWER TO MID 50S 
SOUTH. INTERMITTENT MID AND HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE IS ALSO SPREADING 
ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FROM THE WEST 
AND SOUTHWEST. THE NAM SHOWS A VORTICITY MAXIMUM OVER THE ARKLATEX 
THIS EVENING MOVING NORTHEAST AND STRENGTHENING WHEN IT REACHES EAST 
TN SATURDAY. THIS DOES NOT REACH THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL AROUND 
DAYBREAK SO DO NOT EXPECT ANY SHOWERS OVERNIGHT. EXPECT CLOUDS TO 
VERY SLOWLY INCREASE BUT STILL REMAIN IN THE PARTLY CLOUDY RANGE. 
LOWS SHOULD CONTINUE TO DROP TO NEAR DEWPOINTS WHICH IS WHAT IS IN 
THE FORECAST NOW. WITH SOME CLOUD COVER DO NOT EXPECT ANY 
SIGNIFICANT FOG. NO CHANGES TO CURRENT FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO 
GRADUALLY INCREASE TONIGHT INTO SATURDAY WHEN THE COLUMN WILL BE 
ALMOST MOIST ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A FEW SPRINKLES ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
TWO THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH THE AID OF A SMALL VORT CENTER 
WHICH THE MODELS HAVE BEEN ADVERTISING FOR SEVERAL DAYS. THE GFS 
GENERALLY DOWNPLAYS THE EVENT WHILE THE NAM DEPICTS A SITUATION 
WHERE SOME LIGHT RAIN COULD DEVELOP. WENT AHEAD AND USED SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR ALL BUT SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. 
IT LOOKS LIKE THE SYSTEM WILL BE RIPPING ALONG AND CHANCE FOR RAIN 
WILL BE ABOUT OVER IN MOST AREAS BY 3 PM. STAYED CLOSE TO 
CONVERGENCE OF GUIDANCE TEMPS TONIGHT AND ADJUSTED DOWN A COUPLE 
DEGREES ALL BUT CHA FOR SATURDAY DUE TO PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED 
SYSTEM.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEAK SHORTWAVE ROTATES 
THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP LOW CHANCE POPS GOING FOR 
SATURDAY NIGHT.  BETTER CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION WILL HOLD OFF 
UNTIL SUNDAY AS COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA.  WILL KEEP CHANCE 
POPS FOR SUNDAY.  FRONT EXITS AREA LATE SUNDAY...WILL KEEP SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR THE EVENING HOURS AS DRY WEATHER EXPECTED AFTER 
MIDNIGHT.  HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS ON MONDAY...BRINGING DRY WEATHER 
FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.  GFS INDICATING A WEAK WAVE MOVING 
THROUGH ON TUESDAY...BUT THINK MOISTURE LIMITED SO WILL CONTINUE A 
DRY FORECAST.  ANOTHER FRONT MOVES INTO REGION ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  
WILL ADD SLIGHT CHANCES POPS FOR WEDNESDAY AND KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR 
THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT.  FRONT SHOULD BE EAST OF AREA...BUT 
UPPER TROUGH STILL LINGERING SO WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE CAROLINA COAST...WITH AN AREA OF 
LOW PRESSURE AND ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER 
VALLEY. THIS COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN NORTH OF THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY THROUGH TONIGHT...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW REMAINS 
NEARLY ZONAL. THE HIGH OVER THE SOUTHEAST WILL CONTINUE TO BRING 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...INCREASING 
MOISTURE LEVELS WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN CLOUDS. TEMPS SHOULD BE 
AROUND 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL TODAY FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
WARMER TEMPS ARE EXPECTED AGAIN TONIGHT ACROSS THE PLATEAU AND 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA...WHERE CLOUDS AND STEADY WINDS 
WILL PREVENT TEMPS FROM FALLING TOO RAPIDLY.


.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN FORECAST ISSUE REMAINS 
TIMING AND INTENSITY OF UPCOMING WEEKEND EVENT. MODELS CONTINUE TO 
BE ONLY IN FAIR AGREEMENT WITH GFS PROJECTING A SIGNIFICANTLY 
STRONGER SHORT WAVE THAN THE NAM. ENSEMBLES TEND TO INITIALLY 
SUPPORT THE NAM BEFORE SUPPORTING A BLEND OF THE TWO MODEL 
SOLUTIONS. HOWEVER...SPREAD AMONG ENSEMBLE MEMBERS BECOMES QUITE 
LARGE BY 18Z SUNDAY. CANADIAN GEM TENDS TO SUPPORT THE GFS TIMING 
BUT NOT THE INTENSITY. WITH NO CLEAR CONSENSUS YET WITH THIS

INCH OF PRECIPITATION WITH THESE OVERNIGHT SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS

SCATTERED SHOWERS. RUC AND NAM SHOW THESE FEATURES MAXIMIZING 
LIFT OVER THE AREA AROUND 21Z...AND MOVING EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS 
AROUND 00Z.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THRU WEDNESDAY)...APPROACHING COLD FRONT ON 
TUESDAY WILL BRING INCREASING CLOUD COVER AND A SOMEWHAT LARGER 
CHANCE OF RAIN...HOWEVER...IT APPEARS THE THE GREATEST ENERGY WITH 
THE SYSTEM WILL SHUNT TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE AREA SO HAVE 
KEPT POPS GENERALLY IN THE SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE.  WE CALL THIS A COLD 
FRONT...HOWEVER...TEMPERATURES BEHIND THE FRONT WILL BE ABOUT THE 
SAME AS BEFORE FRONTAL PASSAGE...AND POSSIBLY A FEW DEGREES HIGHER.  
WEDNESDAY WILL SEE A RETURN OF SUNNY SKIES.


.LONG TERM...(WED NIGHT THROUGH MON)...RETURN TO DRY WEATHER IN 
STORE PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS AS BROAD UPPER RIDGE BUILDS 
BACK INTO AREA. ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH/COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH IN THE 
LATE SUNDAY TIME FRAME. GFS IS SOMEWHAT MORE AMPLIFIED WITH THE 
UPPER TROUGH THAN THE OTHER MODELS. HAVE INTRODUCED POPS LATE 
SUNDAY/EARLY MONDAY...BUT ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY AT THIS TIME 
DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY IN INTENSITY. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY STAYED

236 PM EST SUN OCT 30 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...TRANQUIL WEATHER WITH 
MODERATING TEMPERATURE TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE 
SHORT TERM. UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL CONTINUE TO DRIFT EAST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS WHILE AN AMPLIFYING UPPER TROUGH MIGRATES EASTWARD FROM 
THE CENTRAL PLAINS. THIS WILL CREATE A SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. 
MODEL TIME HEIGHTS SHOW SOME INCREASE IN MOISTURE AT HIGH LEVELS 
WHICH SHOULD MATERIALIZE AS ONLY SCATTERED HIGH CLOUDS ON MONDAY. 
GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS PERSIST IN THE FIRST PERIOD 
HOWEVER. INCLINATION IS TO USE COOLEST OF MODEL GUIDANCE VALUES AS 
GUIDANCE MINS HAVE TENDED TO BE TOO WARM UNDER THIS REGIME. GUIDANCE 
MAX TEMPS FOR MONDAY ARE CLOSE AND APPEAR REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM...(MON NIGHT THROUGH SUN)...WAS HOPING THAT THE 
TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY TIMEFRAME WOULD BECOME MUCH CLEARER BY NOW...BUT 
CONFIDENCE STILL VERY LOW GIVEN POOR MODEL RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY 
AND DICHOTOMY OF MODEL SOLUTIONS.  LATEST RUNS HAVE MODELS IN TWO 
CAMPS WITH HANDLING OF UPPER LOW THAT MOVES ACROSS SOUTHERN STATES.  
GFS NOW SHOWS A MORE NORTHERLY AND QUICKER UPPER LOW...WHILE THE NAM 
LEADS THE MORE SOUTHERLY/SLOWER CAMP.  NEITHER CAMP OVERLY BULLISH 
FOR PRECIP FOR US...AND FOR NOW THINK COURSE OF LEAST REGRET IS TO 
KEEP THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT.  
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AND AN UPPER RIDGE SHOULD KEEP US DRY THROUGH 
FRIDAY ONCE ANY EFFECTS OF THE UPPER LOW ARE GONE. A WEAK 
FRONT MAY APPROACH DURING THE WEEKEND...BUT GIVEN HOW UNIMPRESSIVE 
IT LOOKS AT THIS POINT AND THE UNCERTAINTY THAT FAR OUT...WILL 
CONTINUE DRY FORECAST THROUGH SUNDAY AND JUST INCREASE THE CLOUDS A 
BIT FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...BENIGN WEATHER PATTERN 
REMAINS IN PLACE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THROUGH THE 
SHORT TERM.  A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL SHIFT EAST ACROSS THE AREA 
TODAY...PUTTING US UNDER SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT ON MONDAY.  THE 
RESULT WILL BE CONTINUED DRY WEATHER AND A WARMING TREND.

.LONG TERM...A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL REACH INTO THE AREA ON 
TUESDAY.  HOWEVER...MODELS STILL TRENDING TOWARD SLITTING THE 
SYSTEM...CARRYING THE MAIN DYNAMICS AND MOISTURE TO OUR NORTH WHILE 
THE REMAINING MOISTURE AND ENERGY FORM A LOW THAT TRACKS TO OUR 
SOUTH.  THIS WILL LIMIT THE POTENTIAL FOR PRECIP OVER THE MRX CWA...
SO WILL CONTINUE WITH ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY AND

223 PM EDT SAT OCT 29 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...DRY AND STABLE ATMOSPHERE 
PROJECTED TO REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. UPPER RIDGE AXIS EXPECTED TO PASS THROUGH 
THE FORECAST AREA BY AROUND 12Z SUNDAY. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
ALSO DRIFT EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS BY THE SECOND PERIOD RESULTING 
IN SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW. BOTH OF THESE FACTORS SUGGEST WARMING 
TREND WILL CONTINUE. HOWEVER VERY GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING 
CONDITIONS WILL AGAIN EXIST DURING THE FIRST PERIOD...WHICH WILL 
TEND TO NEGATE THE WARMING INDUCED BY THE HEIGHT RISES AND RETURN 
SURFACE FLOW. GFS GUIDANCE TEMPS APPEAR AGAIN TO BE TOO WARM IN THE 
FIRST PERIOD AND AM INCLINED TO FAVOR COOLER NAM GUIDANCE WHICH 
SEEMS TO BE A REASONABLE COMPROMISE. EXPECT ANOTHER FROSTY NIGHT BUT 
OVERALL TEMPS NOT ANTICIPATED TO BE QUITE AS COLD AS PRECEDING NIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(SUN NIGHT THROUGH SAT)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT 
THAT THE ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN QUITE DRY INTO MON NIGHT...THEN 
UPPER TROUGH APPROACHING FROM THE WEST AND WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
WILL AFFECT THE AREA TUE/TUE NIGHT. MODELS APPEAR TO BE CONVERGING 
ON THE IDEA THAT THE ENERGY WILL SPLIT...WITH A PORTION MOVING 
SOUTHEAST AND STAYING TO OUR SOUTH...AND THE MUCH OF THE REMAINDER 
MOVING BY TO OUR NORTH...WITH LITTLE PRECIP FOR OUR AREA.  NAM IS A 
BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THE MOISTURE FOR OUR AREA...BUT IT IS ALSO 
GOING THAT ROUTE.  WILL JUST KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN FOR TUE AND 
TUE NIGHT FOR NOW.  WHAT HAPPENS TO THE UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTH IS 
PROBLEMATIC.  LATEST GFS MOVES IT CLOSE ENOUGH TO OUR AREA TO AFFECT 
AT LEAST SOUTHERN AREAS WED/THU...BUT WILL GO MORE WITH EARLIER 
IDEA/HPC SOLUTION AND KEEP THINGS FURTHER SOUTH.  REMAINDER OF 
FORECAST PRECIP FREE...AS NEXT WEAK FRONT NOT FORECAST TO ARRIVE 
UNTIL NEXT SAT NIGHT OR SUNDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...MODELS AND SHORT RANGE 
ENSEMBLES PROJECT DRAMATIC HEIGHT RISES OVER THE SHORT TERM AS 
HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH/CLOSED LOW DEPARTS AND UPPER RIDGE 
BUILDS INTO THE REGION FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS. MODEL TIME HEIGHTS 
SHOW A VERY DRY ATMOSPHERE AT ALL LEVELS THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. AS 
A RESULT...PLEASANT CONDITIONS WITH A CONTINUATION OF THE WARMING 
TREND IS ANTICIPATED. DRY MOISTURE PROFILE COUPLED WITH LITTLE IN 
THE WAY OF WIND SUGGESTS GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS THROUGH 
THE FIRST PERIOD HOWEVER. GUIDANCE MIN TEMPS HAVE BEEN RUNNING SOMEWHAT TOO 
WARM RECENTLY UNDER THESE CONDITIONS AND AM INCLINED TO UNDERCUT 
THOSE VALUES SLIGHTLY. THUS WILL ISSUE A FREEZE WARNING IN THE 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEYS AS SOME AREAS MAY REACH THOSE 
CRITERIA...ESPECIALLY IN RURAL VALLEY LOCATIONS. FREEZE WARNING IS 
NOT NECESSARY FOR THE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREAS SINCE 
THOSE AREAS HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED A HARD FREEZE AND HAVE BEEN
REMOVED FROM THE FREEZE PROGRAM FOR THIS FALL.


.LONG TERM...(SAT NIGHT THROUGH FRI)...ATMOSPHERE QUITE DRY OVER OUR

THEN SHIFTS EAST.  STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IN TIMING AND IMPACT 
OF UPPER TROUGH/WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY THAT IS FORECAST TO BE IN THE 
VICINITY TUESDAY/TUESDAY NIGHT.  GFS HAS BEEN INCONSISTENT WITH 
TIMING AND DETAILS OF THIS SYSTEM. THE LATEST 12Z RUN SPLITS THE 
ENERGY...WITH SOME DIVING SOUTHEAST AND SOME MOVING BY TO OUR

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...TROUGH AXIS CONTINUES TO TRACK 
THROUGH TO OUR NORTH THIS MORNING.  EXPECT A FEW BANDS OF CLOUDS TO 
CONTINUE TO DRIFT ACROSS THE AREA...MAINLY OVER NORTHERN TIER.  THE 
TROUGH WILL EXIT THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON AS HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO 
BUILD IN...USHERING IN CLEARING SKIES.

.LONG TERM...QUIET WEATHER PATTERN DEVELOPING FOR THE EARLY PART OF 
THE EXTENDED AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE REGION.  AS A RESULT 
...WILL SEE DAYTIME TEMPERATURES WARM...VALLEY READINGS SHOULD CLIMB 
INTO THE 60S AND LOWER 70S FOR THE WEEKEND AND MONDAY.  THE NEXT

A BIT MORE CLOUD COVER OVERALL THAN LAST NIGHT...WHICH SEEMS TO BE 
THE MAJOR REASON FOR WARMER MINS SO FAR THIS EVENING.  THERE HAS A 
BEEN JUST A SLIGHT DECREASE IN THIS CLOUD LAYER (ROUGHLY 5000 TO 
7000 FT) UPSTREAM...BUT EXPECT PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES TO LINGER 
OVERNIGHT.  THIS MAY HELP TO REDUCE THE PATCHY DENSE FOG THAT WAS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER AIR FLOW 
CONTINUES THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS RIDGING DOMINATES THE CENTRAL 
PLAINS WHILE TROUGHING COVERS BOTH COASTS. A SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL 
APPROACH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS IN THE FIRST PERIOD THROUGH THE 
LONG WAVE TROUGH FLOW. THERE IS A DECIDED LACK OF MOISTURE WITH THIS 
FEATURE...BUT ENOUGH IS AVAILABLE TO CAUSE SCATTERED TO BROKEN CLOUD 
DECK THROUGH MUCH OF THE FIRST PERIOD. BIGGEST ISSUE IS TIMING 
CLOUD DECK DEPARTURE AND ITS EFFECT ON MIN TEMPS. MODELS INDICATE 
THAT SHORT WAVE TROUGH AXIS SHOULD BE EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 
LATE IN THE FIRST PERIOD. HOWEVER...MOST OF THE SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLE 
MEMBERS ARE SLIGHTLY SLOWER WITH THE PROGRESSION. THUS...DO NOT 
ANTICIPATE TEMPS TO BE QUITE AS COLD AS LAST NIGHT AS RADIATIONAL 
COOLING APPEARS LESS FAVORABLE. SKY CONDITIONS SHOULD GENERALLY 
CLEAR IN THE SECOND PERIOD ALLOWING A MODEST WARMING TREND IN TEMPS. 
GENERALLY USED A BLEND OF GUIDANCE VALUES FOR TEMPS.


.LONG TERM...(FRI NIGHT THROUGH THU)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE 
OVER THE REGION THROUGH FRI NIGHT THROUGH THE WEEKEND...AND THE 
UPPER LOW OVER THE NORTHEAST PULLS AWAY AND RIDGING BUILDS IN 
ALOFT.  SHOULD SEE CLEAR/MOSTLY CLEAR SKY...AND AFTER A COLD NIGHT 
FRI NIGHT...WILL HAVE A GRADUAL WARMING TREND THROUGH MONDAY. STILL 
NOT A HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE ON TIMING OF NEXT TROUGH AND WEAK 
COLD FRONT.  LATEST RUNS HAVE BEEN LESS AMPLIFIED AND QUICKER.  FOR 
NOW WILL LEAVE SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN FOR TUE AND TUE 
NIGHT...BUT IF LATER RUNS CONTINUE THE FASTER TREND MAY NEED TO MOVE 
UP 12 HOURS. DRY WED AND THU AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN AGAIN.

LIKELY BE SOME PLACES OUTSIDE OF THE FREEZE WARNING AREA THAT WILL 
SEE A KILLING FREEZE...BUT AT THIS POINT WILL LEAVE THE WARNING AS 
IS FOR THE MORNING HOURS AS PREPARATIONS TO PROTECT PLANTS HAVE 
ALREADY BEEN MADE.

CYCLONIC CIRCULATION SEEN IN SATELLITE IMAGERY OVER THE STL AREA IS 
PROGGED BY THE MODELS TO BECOME SHEARED...AND A CHANNELED VORTICITY 
AXIS CROSSES THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING. EXPECT ONLY A 
SLIGHT INCREASE IN CLOUDS WITH THIS FEATURE MAINLY ACROSS THE NORTH 
AS MOISTURE IS VERY LIMITED AND LIFT IS VERY WEAK. EVEN THOUGH WINDS 
WILL GO CALM TONIGHT THESE CLOUDS MAY BE JUST ENOUGH TO KEEP TEMPS 
UP ABOVE FREEZING IN MOST LOCATIONS. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
HEIGHTS BEGIN TO RISE FRIDAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE DRIFTS SLOWLY 
EAST. WITH THE SURFACE HIGH AND 850 MB RIDGE OVERHEAD ON FRIDAY 
NIGHT...TEMPS MAY DROP TO NEAR FREEZING ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA. WILL 
UNDERCUT MOS GUIDANCE BY A COUPLE DEGREES DUE TO EXCELLENT 
RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS. AREAS THAT HAVE NOT SEEN A FREEZE 
YET WILL LIKELY SEE ONE FRIDAY NIGHT. SAME SET UP FOR A FREEZE WILL 
BE IN PLACE SATURDAY NIGHT AS WELL. 

RIDGING ALOFT WILL PROVIDE CLEAR SKIES THROUGH MONDAY. TEMPS 
GRADUALLY WARM...AND HIGHS MAY REACH INTO THE LOWER 70S ON SUNDAY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER LOW THAT BROUGHT
WINTER LIKE WEATHER TO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY MONDAY AND TUESDAY HAS
NOW MOVED INTO EASTERN MAINE AND NE CANADA THIS AFTERNOON. CLOUDS
BROKE UP ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA LATE THIS MORNING AND THEN
CONSIDERABLE STRATOCUMULUS FORMED KEEPING SKIES PARTLY TO MOSTLY
CLOUDY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. TEMPERATURES
WARMED INTO THE UPPER 40S TO NEAR 60 ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH
THE ABUNDANT SUNSHINE ABOUT 5 TO 7 DEGREES WARMER THAN TUESDAY.

MAIN FORECAST PROBLEM TONIGHT IS TEMPERATURES. SOME LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE AT AROUND 850 MB WILL STAY OVER THE FORECAST AREA
ESPECIALLY NORTH AND EVEN THOUGH CLOUDS WILL LIKELY DECREASE AS THE
SUN GOES DOWN LOW CLOUDS WERE MOVING SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST FROM THE
OHIO VALLEY TOWARD E TN AND SW VA. 850 MB TEMPERATURES ARE FROM
ABOUT 0C TO 2C TOMORROW MORNING WHICH IS SLIGHTLY WARMER FOR MOST
OF THE AREA EXCEPT EXTREME NORTH. GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE LOWER TO MID
30S NORTHEAST AND MID TO UPPER 30S ELSEWHERE. THINK TRI CITIES
AIRPORT MAY DROP TO NEAR 32 BRIEFLY BUT NOT STAY DOWN LONG ENOUGH
FOR A FREEZE WARNING. NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO ISSUE FREEZE WARNING
FOR MOST OF NE TN AND SW VA EXCEPT WHERE ALREADY ISSUED IN THE MOUNTAINS.
MODELS BRING SHORTWAVE FROM IL THIS AFTERNOON AND ELONGATE TROUGH
THAT EXTENDS FROM THE NE UPPER LOW INTO THE TN VALLEY TONIGHT AND
THURSDAY. EXPECT MORE CLOUDS TO THE NORTH IN OHIO VALLEY AND KY AS
SHORTWAVE APPROACHES BUT SOME CLOUDS WILL MOVE IN FROM THE NW
OVERNIGHT AND THURSDAY ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN TWO THIRDS.
THIS SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES ABOUT THE SAME AS TODAYS. THERE MAY
BE SOME PATCHY FOG TONIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY BUT CLOUD COVER
SHOULD LIMIT ANY SIGNIFICANT DROPS IN VISIBILITY LATER TONIGHT.
WILL CONTINUE SPS FOR FROST FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA
TONIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY.

.LONG TERM...(THU NIGHT THROUGH WED)...MODELS INDICATE SOME SHORT 
WAVE ENERGY ROTATING THROUGH BASE OF NORTHEAST TROUGH/UPPER LOW WILL 
BE OVER THE REGION THU NIGHT INTO FRI.  WHILE THEY DIFFER A BIT ON 
THE DETAILS...THE AGREE MOISTURE WILL BE VERY LIMITED.  SHOULD SEE 
SOME CLOUDS ESPECIALLY NORTHEAST THU NIGHT...THEN DECREASING THROUGH 
FRIDAY TO A MOSTLY CLEAR FRI NIGHT.  HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE 
OUR WEATHER FOR THE WEEKEND INTO MONDAY...THEN QUITE A BIT OF 
UNCERTAINTY FOR TUE AND WED AS POOR MODEL AGREEMENT AND RUN TO RUN 
CONSISTENCY REARS ITS HEAD.  WHILE TIMING IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS

THROUGH NEW ENGLAND AND THE CANADIAN MARITIMES IN THE SHORT TERM 
ALLOWING HEIGHTS TO BUILD ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS FOR A BRIEF TIME BEFORE NEXT S/WV DROPS SOUTH THROUGH 
THE OHIO VALLEY IMPACTING THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY. MAIN 
PROBLEM IN THIS PERIOD IS HOW FAST TO ERODE LOW CLOUDS. ATTM APPEARS 
THAT CLOUDS ARE THINNING QUICKLY ACROSS THE REGION WITH CLEAR SKIES 
ALREADY EVIDENT ACROSS MUCH OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE. BELIEVE LOW DECK SHOULD ERODE ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE BY LATE MORNING LEAVING SKIES PARTLY CLOUDY 
THROUGH REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON. STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS 
TODAY/TONIGHT WHICH FEATURES CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND LIGHT 
WIND ALLOWING FOR RADIATION WELL INTO THE MIDDLE AND LOWER 30S. NPW 
AND SPS WERE ISSUED FOR FREEZE WARNING NRN/CNTRL MTNS OF TENNESSEE 
AND PATCHY FROST FORMATION ELSEWHERE ACROSS THRE FORECAST AREA FOR 
TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A TROUGH DIVES SOUTH OUT OF CANADA ON THURSDAY AND BECOMES A CLOSED 
CIRCULATION OVER THE MID ATLANTIC ON FRIDAY. THERE IS SOME STRONG 
VORTICITY WITH THE SYSTEM BUT VERY LITTLE MOISTURE. WHAT LITTLE 
MOISTURE THERE IS IS CONFINED TO THE 850 MB LAYER ACROSS OUR 
NORTHERN SECTIONS. SLIGHT CHANCE MENTION WILL BE REMOVED FOR 
THURSDAY. SW VA MAY SEE A PERIOD OF MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES THURSDAY 
NIGHT...BUT THE REST OF THE AREA WILL REMAIN PARTLY CLOUDY TO MOSTLY

THEREFORE BETTER SNOW MACHINE TO STAY NORTH OF OUR VA COUNTIES...AND 
WELL NORTH OF SMOKIES.  MOST OF OUR MOISTURE WARMER THAN -10 DEG

.SHORT TERM...
TODAYS WEATHER INFLUENCED BY CENTRAL APPALACHIANS UPPER LOW WHICH 
SLOWLY MAKES ITS WAY EAST ACROSS THE ANCIENT MOUNTAIN RANGE BY LATE 
TONIGHT. A FAIR AMOUNT OF VORTICITY DROPPING INTO THE BACK SIDE OF 
UPPER LOW CIRCULATION WITH SUFFICIENT DEPTH OF MOISTURE TO TREND 
TOWARD THE SUGGESTED MOS POP BLEND WITH LIKELY POPS TODAY ACROSS 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WITH 
POPS RANGING FROM TEN PERCENT ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY IN 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE TO FORTY AND FIFTY PERCENT IN THE SMOKY 
MOUNTAINS. PRECIP TYPE WILL BE FLURRIES ABOVE 3000 FT AND RAIN AND 
FLURRIES FROM 2500 TO 3000 FT. WHILE UPPER LOW MAKES ITS DEPARTURE 
THROUGH THE EVENING...GRADUALLY DROP OFF POPS AS DEEPER 
MOISTURE/LIFT EXIT. WILL KEEP THIS COMPLEX ELEVATION PRECIP TYPE 
FORECAST GOING INTO THE EVENING IN THESE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. AT ANY 
RATE...NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF ACCUMULATION EXPECTED. STAYED CLOSE TO 
GUIDANCE TEMPS WHICH WERE SIMILAR TODAY/TONIGHT FEATURING MAXES 
AROUND 15 TO 20 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. BELIEVE PRES GRAD TIGHT ENOUGH 
AND LOW CLOUD LAYER PERSISTANT ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION TO KEEP 
FROST FROM FORMING TONIGHT.    

.LONG TERM...
AS THE CLOSED UPPER LOW EXITS NEW ENGLAND...WRAP AROUND MOISTURE 
WILL LIFT OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. A SECOND TROUGH DIVES SOUTH OUT OF 
CANADA...AND TAKES SOME CHANNELLED VORTICITY ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
PORTIONS OF THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. MOISTURE IS 
VERY LIMITED WITH THE SYSTEM...AND MODEL TRENDS HAVE BEEN FASTER AND 
FARTHER NORTH. DUE TO THE FASTER MODELS TRENDS THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP 
ON FRIDAY WILL BE REMOVED. EVEN THE SLOWER GFS HAS THE TROUGH AXIS 
THROUGH THE AREA BY FRIDAY WITH RIDGING BUILDING IN ALOFT. WITH THE 
BUILDING RIDGE THERE SHOULD BE A WARMING TREND THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...WITH HIGHS GOING FROM 55 TO 60 ON FRIDAY TO 65 TO 70 BY 
MONDAY. RASIED TEMPS A BIT OVER THE WEEKEND TO BE MORE IN LINE WITH 
THE LATEST GFS ENSEMBLE MOS GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
MID LEVEL CLOUDS CROSSING THE AREA ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A VIGOROUS 
VORT AXIS EXTENDING FROM THE CLOSED LOW OVER THE OHIO VALLEY. 
EXTRAPOLATION TAKES THE BACK EDGE OF THE CLOUDS OUT OF THE AREA 
AROUND SUNRISE. THUS EXPECT A PERIOD OF CLEARING SKIES AROUND 
SUNRISE...BUT WITH COLD ADVECTION ALOFT EXPECT BROKEN STRATOCU TO 
DEVELOP BY MID TO LATE MORNING...KEEPING MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES THROUGH 
THE DAY. MAY SEE SOME GUSTY WINDS THIS MORNING BEFORE THE CLOUDS 
FILL BACK IN AS WINDS ALOFT MIX DOWN TO THE SURFACE. DEEPER MOISTURE 
WILL WRAP AROUND THE CLOSED LOW TONIGHT...AND WITH UPSLOPE FLOW 
THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF PRECIP. BEST CHANCES WILL BE IN THE NORTH 
CLOSER TO THE DEEPER MOISTURE. WILL MAINTAIN MENTION OF SNOW ABOVE 3 
KFT. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MADE SOME LITTLE CHANGES TO 
TUESDAY MORNING AS ABOVE MENTIONED VIGOUROUS VORT VENTURES ALONG. 
WILL KEEP COLD AIR INTO EARLY TUESDAY MORNING, THUS KEPT SOME MIX OF 
SNOW/RAIN ABOVE 3000 FEET AS IN SHORT TERM. WILL ADD WORDING TO 
ZONES. TROF MOVES OUT BUT LEAVES MUCH COLDER THAN NORMAL TEMPS IN 
ITS WAKE, BUT WITH CLOUDS IN PLACE, WILL LIMIT NIGHTTIME RADIATION 
SO NO ADVISORIES THOUGH SOME PLACES WILL HIT THE LOWER 30S OR SO IN 
THE LOWER ELEVATIONS. MOUNTAIN IN THE 20S IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. 
SOME WARMING AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY-THURSDAY AS SOME SUN MAKES IT 
THROUGH, BUT GFS SHOWS A RATHER LARGE CONCENTRIC OCCLUDED LOW 
DIRECTLY OVERHEAD FRIDAY INTO LATE SATURDAY. NATURALLY, FLIP 
FLOPPING BY MODELS GIVE LITTLE CONDIFENCE THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN AS 
ADVERTISED, BUT YOU HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS POSSIBILITY. HAVE ADDED 
SOME SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE RAIN POPS FOR FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY, 
WITH VERY LOW QPF.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...AN UPPER L0W POSITIONED OVER IL 
THIS AFTERNOON HAS A SHORT WAVE MOVING ALONG AN ATTACHED WEAK 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THIS WAVE IS GENERATING ISOLATED LIGHT RAIN 
SHOWERS OVER PORTIONS OF KY AND MIDDLE TN. AS THE WAVE TRACKS TO THE 
SOUTH AND EAST...THE LIGHT PRECIP WILL DRIFT INTO THE MRX CWA... 
PROVIDING SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS THE AREA OVERNIGHT. THE BEST 
CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL BE OVER NORTHERN ZONES. UPSLOPE FLOW WILL ALSO 
AID PRECIP CHANCE OVER EASTERN MAINTAINS. A COOL AIR MASS CONTINUES 
TO FILTER INTO THE AREA TONIGHT. OVERNIGHT LOWS SHOULD BE IN THE 40S 
ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY...WITH 30S OVER HIGHER TERRAIN. THE 
HIGHEST ELEVATIONS...AT LEAST OVER 3000 FEET...TEMPERATURES MAY 
LOWER ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR BRIEF PERIODS OF A RAIN/SNOW MIX. THE WAVE 
WILL EXIT ON MONDAY...ENDING PRECIP OVER MUCH OF THE AREA. 
HOWEVER...CONTINUED UPSLOPE FLOW MAY KEEP ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE 
NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS INTO THE AFTERNOON. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...ANOTHER STRONG SHORT WAVE 
IS PROGGED TO ROTATE AROUND THE LONG WAVE TROUGH MONDAY NIGHT INTO 
TUESDAY...WITH SOME ADDITIONAL LIGHT PRECIP POSSIBLE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA. WILL CONTINUE THE PREVIOUS FORECAST WORDING OF A 
CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS ABOVE 3000 FEET...AS 850 MB TEMPS FALL BELOW 
FREEZING. GFS MODEL CONTINUES TO REVEAL A 500 MB CUT-OFF LOW 
DEVELOPING NEAR THE TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEY BY THE END OF THE WEEK... 
BUT THERE CONTINUES TO BE LARGE DISCREPANCIES FROM RUN TO RUN WITH 
THE STRENGTH AND POSITIONING OF THIS UPPER LOW. IT STILL APPEARS 
THAT THERE WILL BE A DRY AIRMASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE END 
OF THE WEEK...SO WILL KEEP THE EXTENDED FORECAST DRY FOR NOW.

TONIGHT WITH FLOW ALOFT BECOMING BRIEFLY ZONAL. LOW CLOUDS WILL 
CONTINUE TO SLOWLY ERODE FROM WEST TO EAST THROUGH THE NIGHT. THIS 
COMBINED WITH DECOUPLED WINDS...RECENT RAINS AND LOWERING DEW POINTS

VALLEY WILL ONLY REACH INTO THE 60S. AN APPROACHING SHORT WAVE WILL 
BE APPROACHING THE AREA LATE SUNDAY. CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON TIMING AND 
WILL KEEP POPS LOW FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH AMPLIFYING A DEEP UPPER TROUGH OVER THE APPALACHIANS 
BY SUNDAY NIGHT. BOTH THE GFS AND NAM MODELS INDICATE ENOUGH 
MOISTURE FOR SOME LIGHT PRECIP OVER MAINLY SOUTHWEST VA AND 
NORTHEAST TN...BUT THE NAM MODEL IS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THE AMOUNT 
OF AVAILABLE MOISTURE AND RESULTING PRECIP AMOUNTS. WILL TREND THE 
FORECAST ON SUNDAY NIGHT TOWARD THE MORE CONSISTENT AND DRIER GFS 
MODEL. BOTH MODELS INDICATE SUB-FREEZING 850 MB TEMPS OVER SOUTHWEST 
VA AND NORTHEAST TN FOR SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT WITH A WARM BOUNDARY 
LAYER...SURFACE TEMPS SHOULD HAVE A TOUGH TIME FALLING INTO THE 
LOWER 30S EXCEPT ACROSS THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. WILL CONTINUE THE 
PREVIOUS FORECAST OF MENTIONING A CHANCE OF SNOW ABOVE 3000 FEET FOR 
SUNDAY NIGHT AND AGAIN ON MONDAY NIGHT. ANOTHER STRONG SHORT WAVE 
WILL ROTATE AROUND THE LONG WAVE TROUGH ON MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY...WITH SOME ADDITIONAL LIGHT PRECIP POSSIBLE...MAINLY ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. ANOTHER WEAKER SHORT WAVE ON 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT LOOKS TO BE DRY AT THIS TIME FOR THE FORECAST AREA.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...A LINE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE MOVED OUT AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT AND ARE TRACKING 
ACROSS THE MRX CWA THIS AFTERNOON. WITH WEAK INSTABILITY IN PLACE 
AND LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPROACHING FRONT...THESE STORMS SHOULD 
CONTINUE OVER THE REGION INTO THE EVENING HOURS. THE FRONT SHOULD 
REACH INTO THE AREA OVERNIGHT CONTINUING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS THROUGH 
THE NIGHT. SHOWERS WILL LINGER OVER THE AREA INTO SATURDAY AS THE 
FRONT EXITS THE REGION AND THE TROUGH AXIS MOVES THROUGH. GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS LOOK GOOD WITH COOLER TEMPS EXPECTED BEHIND THE FRONT...SO 
WILL KEEP TEMPS CLOSE TO GUIDANCE. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS INDICATE A 
HIGHLY AMPLIFIED PATTERN WILL DEVELOP THIS WEEKEND...AS A STRONG 
UPPER TROUGH DEEPENS ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. THIS 
PATTERN LOOKS TO LINGER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE MIDDLE 
OF NEXT WEEK...BRINGING A DRAMATIC DROP IN TEMPS TO BELOW-NORMAL 
LEVELS THROUGH WEDNESDAY. MODELS REVEAL SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE 
DETAILS WITH A SERIES OF SHORT WAVES EXPECTED TO ROTATE AROUND THIS 
LONG WAVE UPPER TROUGH. MOISTURE LOOK TO BE LIMITED THROUGH EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...BUT IT APPEARS THAT A FEW SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE 
(ESPECIALLY IN THE UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE MOUNTAINS). GFS MODEL 
CONTINUES TO INDICATE THAT 850 MB TEMPS WILL BE COLD ENOUGH SUNDAY 
NIGHT AND MONDAY NIGHT FOR SOME SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS (GENERALLY ABOVE 3000 FEET). THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL 
EVENTUALLY MOVE OUT OF THE REGION BY THURSDAY...WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING INTO THE REGION THROUGH FRIDAY.

INCREASING CLOUD COVER. A SMALL BAND OF SHOWERS HAS FORMED AHEAD OF 
THE FRONT. A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS MAY HOLD TOGETHER LONG ENOUGH TO

MO SLOWLY TRACKS TO THE EAST.  THE WEAK RIDGING OVER THE AREA HAS 
INCREASE HEIGHT FIELDS AND 850MB TEMPS HAVE REACHED INTO THE MID

TEMPERATURES FOR THE AFTERNOON.  HOWEVER...AS THE LOW APPROACHES THE

FLOW HAD INCREASE DEWPOINTS INTO 55 TO 60 DEGREE RANGE.  SO...WITH 
SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IN PLACE AND WEAK LIFT FROM THE APPROACHING

.SHORT TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
STATIONARY FRONT DISSECTING KENTUCKY (NORTH-SOUTH).  THIS FRONT MAY 
MOVE SLOWLY SOUTH APPROACHING SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA DURING THE 
AFTERNOON... SO HAVE INCLUDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS THERE FOR 
LATE TODAY. ELSEWHERE...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL HOLD ON ONE 
MORE DAY PRODUCING DRY WEATHER. SOUTHWEST WINDS...PLENTY OF 
SUNSHINE...AND RELATIVELY DRY GROUND...WILL ONCE AGAIN PRODUCE 
UNSEASONABLY WARM DAY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. RECORD HIGHS ARE THE 
FOLLOWING: TRI 84 (1993)...TYS 86 (1941)... CHA 88 (1941). FORECAST 
HIGHS TODAY WILL BE JUST SHY OF THESE RECORDS.  WILL INCLUDE NEAR 
RECORDS HIGHS IN THE FORECAST.

STATIONARY FRONT REMAINS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/EXTREME NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE TONIGHT...SO WILL INCLUDE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS THERE WITH 
MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE.

FOR FRIDAY...NAM AND GFS DIFFER GREATLY ON THE DEWPOINT 
TEMPERATURE OVER THE REGION.  THE NAM KEEPS DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 
AND MID 60S WHILE THE GFS TENDS TO DRY THEM INTO THE 50S DURING THE 
DAY. LIKEWISE...THE NAM IS MUCH MORE UNSTABLE WITH LIFTED INDICES 
DROPPING DOWN TO -4 TO -6...PER MODEL SOUNDINGS. WILL NOT GO AS 
AGGRESSIVE AS THE NAM...BUT DO EXPECT SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. WOULD GO HIGHER WITH POPS...BUT MAIN DYNAMICS IS NOT 
OF THE FORECAST AREA.

FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...COLD FRONT WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS THE REGION WITH 
COLDER AIR FILTER IN BEHIND FROPA. NAM AND GFS SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF 
COLD AIR STRATO-CU SPREADING INTO THE FORECAST AREA FOR FRIDAY NIGHT 
AND SATURDAY. WILL KEEP SKIES CLOUDY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY THROUGH 
SATURDAY. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MINOR CHANGES MADE 
TO THE EARLIER PERIODS OF THE LONG TERM.  COLD AIR ADVECTION IN THE 
LOW LEVELS AND CYCLONIC MID AND UPPER LEVEL FLOW AS THE UPPER LOW 
DEEPENS AND CLOSES OFF...SHOULD LEAD TO MORE CLOUDINESS THAN MOS 
INDICATES FROM SATURDAY NIGHT WELL INTO MONDAY.  GENERALLY INCREASED 
SKY COVER IN NRN AREAS AND ESPECIALLY ALL HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS WHERE 
LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW WILL BE A FACTOR.  KEPT A BIT OF PARTLY 
CLOUDY SKIES FOR CENTRAL AND SRN VALLEY LOCATIONS...BUT MAINLY IN 
THE DAYTIME PERIODS.  

QUITE A CHANGE IN OUR VERY TRANQUIL AND MORE SUMMERLIKE PATTERN...
LEADING TO AT LEAST A POSSIBILITY OF A FEW SNOW SHOWERS LATE SUNDAY 
NIGHT...MAINLY ABOVE 3500 FEET OR SO AS 850 MB TEMPS TUMBLE BELOW 
ZERO DEGS CELSIUS BY 06Z MONDAY INTO EARLY MONDAY MORNING.  BOUNDARY 
LAYER TEMPS AND PARTIAL THICKNESSES MUCH TOO WARM FOR ANY SNOW AT 
ELEVATIONS BELOW 3500 FEET...ALSO WE ARE LOOKING AT MAINLY VERY 
LIGHT AMOUNTS OF PRECIPITATION AS FORCING GRADUALLY BECOMES JUST 
COLD AIR ADVECTION AND LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE WINDS.

OTHERWISE...VERY MINOR MAX/MIN TEMP ADJUSTMENTS MADE IN LINE WITH 
LATEST MOS...GENERALLY DOWNWARD A FEW DEGREES WHEN THE COLDEST AIR 
IS FILTERING IN COURTESY OF THE NW-N LOW LEVEL WINDS AND CLOUD COVER 
LINGERS TO INHIBIT MUCH SUNSHINE.  ADDED SOME PRELIMINARY GRIDS FOR 
THE NEW DAY SEVEN (THURSDAY).

NORTHEASTERN U.S. UPPER TROF CONTINUES TO DRIVE EAST PUSHING 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AROUND 12Z THURSDAY. 
HOWEVER...NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF WEATHER EXPECTED ALONG THIS 
BOUNDARY DUE TO DRY ATMOSPHERE IN PLACE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AS WELL 
AS S/WV RIDGING AHEAD OF WESTERN PLAINS UPPER LOW. STAYED CLOSE TO 
LARGE DIURNAL RANGE MIN/MAX GUIDANCE TEMPS FOR SHORT TERM FORECAST.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A QUASI-STATIONARY 
FRONT SHOULD BE LOCATED ACROSS EASTERN KY AND SOUTHWEST VA BY 
THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION POSSIBLE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA AS AN UPPER TROUGH BEGINS TO DEEPEN ACROSS THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY. THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL HELP TO PUSH A COLD FRONT 
THROUGH THE AREA ON FRIDAY...WITH THE GFS MODEL INDICATING A FASTER 
FRONTAL PROGRESSION COMPARED TO THE NAM MODEL. WILL PLAN TO TREND 
THE FORECAST TOWARD THE NAM MODEL...SINCE ITS SOLUTION IS MORE 
CONSISTENT WITH EARLIER MODEL RUNS. BOTH MODELS INDICATE THAT SOME 
MARGINAL INSTABILITY WILL DEVELOP AHEAD OF THIS FRONT ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...SO WILL PLAN TO MENTION THUNDER UNTIL 
FRONTAL PASSAGE FRIDAY EVENING. 

GFS MODEL CONTINUES TO INDICATE THAT A LARGE UPPER TROUGH WILL DIG 
ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION BY THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...BRINGING MUCH COOLER TEMPS AS WE GO FROM NEAR-RECORD ABOVE- 
NORMAL TEMPS THIS WEEK TO BELOW-NORMAL TEMPS FOR NEXT WEEK. A FEW

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...TRANQUIL WEATHER CONTINUES WITH 
TEMPS CLIMBING TO MUCH ABOVE CLIMO AS HEIGHTS CONTINUE TO RISE IN 
RESPONSE TO AMPLIFYING TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. MODEL TIME 
HEIGHTS SHOW LITTLE IN THE WAY OF MOISTURE THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. 
THUS ANTICIPATE VERY SPARSE CLOUD COVER. GUIDANCE TEMPS ARE AGAIN IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT AND HAVE NO COMPELLING REASON TO SIGNIFICANTLY 
DEVIATE FROM THOSE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...NO CHANGES NEEDED FOR 
THE MOST PART...ESPECIALLY WITH EARLY AND LATE PERIODS OF THE LONG 
TERM.  I DID INCREASE POPS SLIGHTLY FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY 
MORNING...WITH THE SLOW FRONTAL PASSAGE.  WENT UP TO 50% AND 40% FOR 
THOSE PERIODS...ALTHO COVERAGE OF SHOWERS MAY BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH 
TO JUSTIFY LIKELY POPS LATE FRIDAY NIGHT.  WILL LOOK AT THIS AGAIN 
TONIGHT OR DAYSHIFT MAY VERY WELL NUDGE POPS UP IN AFTERNOON PACKAGE.

19/00Z GFSX MOS TEMPS GENERALLY FELL RIGHT IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS 
GRIDS AS MUCH COOLER AIR FLOWS INTO THE REGION SUNDAY INTO TUESDAY.
THINKING THAT THE COLD AIR ADVECTION AND CYCLONIC UPPER LEVEL FLOW 
MAY VERY WELL KEEP SKIES IN THE MOSTLY CLOUDY CATEGORY.  SO...I MADE 
SLIGHT INCREASES IN CLOUD COVER IN SPITE OF GFSX MOS SUGGESTING 
LITTLE CLOUDINESS FROM LATE SUNDAY INTO TUESDAY.  TOUGH TO TIME ANY 
INDIVIDUAL SHORTWAVES THAT MIGHT ROTATE AROUND THE DEEP UPPER 
LOW...BUT ANY RAIN LOOKS TO BE LIGHT WITH LOW POPS REASONABLE FOR 
NOW.  ALL LIQUID PCPN TYPE...EVEN ON THE COOLEST PERIOD OF TUESDAY 
MORNING.

UPPER LOW LOOKS TO LIFT NE BY WEDNESDAY...BRINGING PARTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES AND TEMPS BACK UP TO NEAR CLIMO.  SOME PRELIMINARY GRIDS MADE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
333 AM EDT TUE OCT 18 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DRY WEATHER REGIME TO CONTINUE 
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. MODEL TIME 
HEIGHTS DO DEPICT SOME INCREASE IN MID-LEVEL MOISTURE IN RESPONSE TO 
A LOW-AMPLITUDE SHORT WAVE TROUGH WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS TODAY. HOWEVER...ONLY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER 
IS EXPECTED WITH THIS FEATURE. WEAK FRONT ALSO MEANDERS AROUND THE 
NORTHEASTERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA. HAVE SLIGHTLY RAISED 
CLOUDS IN FIRST PERIOD. FOR TEMPS...SOUTHWESTERLY SURFACE FLOW 
AROUND RETREATING HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO CLIMB SEVERAL 
DEGREES OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. GUIDANCE TEMPS ARE GENERALLY CLOSE 
AND APPEAR REASONABLE. GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO THOSE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...STILL SOME SLIGHT 
DIFFERENCES ON TIMING THE APPROACH AND PASSAGE OF COLD FRONT FOR 
LATE FRIDAY OR EARLY SATURDAY.  BETTER DYNAMICS MAY STAY TO OUR 
NORTH CLOSER TO THE TRACK OF THE SHORTWAVE AND SURFACE LOW...SO NO 
CHANGES MADE TO RAIN CHANCES FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS/FORECAST AT THIS 
POINT.  OUR AREA STAYS IN THE WARM SECTOR SOUTH OF WARM FRONT AND 
EAST OF THE COLD FRONT FOR THURSDAY...SO NUDGED MAX TEMPS UP TO THE 
WARMER NEW MOS VALUES.

ONE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR CONSIDERABLE COOLING 
FROM SUNDAY INTO TUESDAY...AS MODELS (FAIR AGREEMENT AND ALSO WITH 
ENSEMBLES) ADVERTISE A DEEP AND CLOSED UPPER LOW DEVELOPING OVER THE 
OHIO VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES REGION FOR THOSE PERIODS.  THIS LOOKS TO 
SEND MUCH COOLER 850 MB TEMPS SOUTHWARD...WHICH SEEMS REASONABLE AND 
COULD EASILY LOWER TEMPS TO THE 18/00Z GFSX VALUES (8 TO 12 DEGREES 
BELOW CLIMO ON MAXES).  KEPT THESE LATER PERIODS DRY FOR NOW...BUT A 
SHORTWAVE COULD ROTATE AROUND THE UPPER LOW AND BRING MORE 
CLOUDINESS AND LOW CHANCE POPS AS WELL.  

LOWERED TEMPS...ESPECIALLY MAX TEMPS...STARTING SAT AND THRU MON
FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS.  NEXT SHIFT MAY VERY WELL NEED TO LOWER TEMPS A 
BIT MORE AFTER VIEWING 12Z MODEL DATA FOR CONSISTENCY...AND UPDATED 
GRIDS FROM NEIGHBORING OFFICES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BE 
THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE FOR OUR AREA THIS AFTERNOON INTO 
TONIGHT.  BY LATE TONIGHT/EARLY TOMORROW...TAIL END OF WEAK COLD 
FRONT MOVING BY TO OUR NORTH APPROACHES...AND MODELS INDICATE SOME 
INCREASE IN MOISTURE MAINLY BETWEEN 850 AND 700 MB. AFTER LOOKING AT 
LATEST SATELLITE AND MODEL MOISTURE PROFILES...NOT CONVINCED WE WILL 
SEE A WHOLE LOT OF CLOUDS FROM THIS...BUT MAY SEE SOME MID CLOUDS 
MAINLY ACROSS THE NORTH LATE TONIGHT/EARLY TOMORROW.  WILL INCREASE 
CLOUDS A BIT IN THE GRIDS FOR THIS PERIOD.  OTHERWISE...MAINLY A

GENERALLY REASONABLE MAV TEMPS.  SHOULD BE WARMER THAN PAST FEW 
NIGHTS...SO NO FROST MENTIONED.

MORE MOISTURE THAN GFS.  WITH THE DRY AIRMASS IN PLACE OVER OUR

408 AM EDT MON OCT 17 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
GENERALLY EXTENDS ACROSS TN VALLEY NWD INTO OHIO VALLEY REGION THIS 
MORNING.  SCHOOL NET OBSERVATIONS INDICATE PLENTY OF UPPER 30S 
ACROSS THE AREA THIS MORNING...BUT ASOS/AWOS/FIRE WX SITES GENERALLY 
SHOW LITTLE WARMER READINGS AT 07Z FROM NEAR 40 TO UPPER 40S.  KEPT 
IN THE PATCHY FROST EARLY THIS MORNING IN WEATHER GRIDS UP TO 12Z.  

SINCE WE WILL EXPERIENCE NEARLY FULL SUNSHINE TODAY...AND MODELS 
ADVERTISE NEUTRAL TO WEAK WARM AIR ADVECTION THIS AFTERNOON...
WOULD EXPECT HIGHS TO TOP OUT AROUND 2 TO 4 DEGREES ABOVE SUNDAY 
MAXES.  THUS...TRENDED TOWARD THE SLIGHTLY WARMER MOS VALUES.  

FOR TONIGHT...EXPECT LIGHT TO CALM WINDS AGAIN AND A CONTINUED DRY 
AIRMASS FOR THE MOST PART.  HOWEVER...TIME HEIGHT SECTIONS SHOW A 
SLIGHT INCREASE IN MOISTURE FROM AROUND 850 TO 700 MB LEVEL AS A 
WEAK TROUGH/COLD FRONT DRAWS NEAR.  NOT CONVINCED THAT A SOLID CLOUD 
LAYER WILL DEVELOP...BUT SEEMS WORTH BRINGING SLIGHTLY HIGHER CLOUD 
COVER VALUES TO NRN MOST AREAS LATE TONIGHT (ALMOST UP TO PARTLY 
CLOUDY).  ALSO...THIS MOISTURE SHOULD HELP TO RAISE DEWPOINT TEMPS 
SLIGHTLY AS SUGGESTED FROM MOS OUTPUT...BUT PREFERRED TO STAY CLOSE 
TO PREVIOUS MIN TEMP GRID AND COOLER MOS VALUES FOR NOW.  

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...EXPECTING ONLY LIMITED HIGH 
AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FROM THE WEAK TROUGH THAT PASSES BY ALONG THE 
NORTHERN EDGE OF THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY. HAVE ADDED A FEW MORE 
CLOUDS ACROSS MAINLY SW VA TUESDAY. RIDGING BUILDS BACK IN TUESDAY 
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY WITH UPPER FLOW BECOMING MORE ZONAL. 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM A FEW DEGREES TUESDAY AND REMAIN WARM 
WEDNESDAY AS HEIGHTS RISE. THE NEXT TROUGH/FRONT SHOULD APPROACH 
THURSDAY WITH SOME ADDED CLOUD COVER BUT TEMPERATURES STILL ABOVE 
NORMAL. BOTH GFS AND NAM/DGEX KEEP THE DEEPEST MOISTURE NORTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA UNTIL LATE FRIDAY. BEST CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE FRIDAY 
NIGHT AND SATURDAY AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH ALTHOUGH DOES NOT LOOK 
LIKE ANY BIG AMOUNTS AT THIS TIME. NEW TROPICAL DEPRESSION IN THE NW 
CARIBBEAN EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO THE GULF COULD AFFECT THE SOUTHEAST 
US THIS WEEKEND. TOO EARLY TO TELL IF IT COULD GIVE THE TN VALLEY 
ANY RAINFALL NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...DRY AIRMASS HAS 
FILTERED INTO THE FORECAST AREA WITH DEWPOINTS GENERALLY IN THE 
UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S. DRY NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AND SURFACE RIDGING
WILL DOMINATE THROUGH THE SHORT-TERM. SOUNDING SHOW LIMITED MOISTURE
SO CLEAR SKIES WILL BE THE RULE. GIVEN CLEAR SKY AND CALM WINDS WITH
SURFACE RIDGING WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO DROP NICELY OVERNIGHT WITH
LOWS IN THE 30S ANTICIPATED OVER NORTHEAST AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS. WILL
CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT WITH A SPS CONCERNING POTENTIAL FROSTY CONDITIONS
IN THESE AREAS BY MONDAY MORNING. 

GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE COLDER MINS DUE TO FAVORABLE RADIATIONAL COOLING
CONDITIONS. HOWEVER...DUE TO DRY AIRMASS AND ABUNDANT SUNSHINE GOOD
DIURNAL RANGE IN TEMPERATURES WILL ALLOW FOR FAIRLY RAPID WARMING DURING
THE DAY.

FIRE WEATHER PURPOSES...DRY AIRMASS WILL PRODUCE LOW AFTERNOON HUMIDITIES
IN THE 20S MOST LOCATIONS THE NEXT TWO DAYS. HOWEVER...WINDS WILL BE
LIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...RIDGE ACROSS REGION 
BRINGING DRY WEATHER INTO THE END OF THE WEEK.  GFS INDICATING A

PRESSURE IN OUR AREA SHOULD KEEP ACTIVITY WELL TO THE NORTH OF OUR 
CWA.  A BETTER ORGANIZED UPPER TROUGH AND FRONT PUSHING INTO REGION 
ON FRIDAY NIGHT WHICH IS A LITTLE SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS.  STILL 
ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE WITH IT.  WILL REMOVE THE POPS FROM FRIDAY AND 
KEEP THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...ONLY CONCERNS CONTINUE TO BE THE 
POSSIBILITY FOR PATCHY FROST AND HOW LOW TEMPS FALL TONIGHT UNDER 
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND NEAR CALM WINDS.  NORTHERLY SURFACE WINDS 
STAYING UP THIS MORNING ARE CERTAINLY KEEPING MIN TEMPS UP 
CONSIDERABLY...AND HAD TO RAISE 06Z TEMPS BY 3 TO 7 DEGREES IN GRIDS.
THUS...NO PATCHY FOG OR FROST EXPECTED ANYWHERE THIS MORNING.

WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION INDICATED FOR TODAY...BUT THE DRY AIR SHOULD 
ALLOW TEMPS TO REBOUND CLOSER TO THE WARMER VALUES WHERE ONLY SLIGHT 
DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED IN MOS MAX TEMPS.

SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE REGION LATE TONIGHT WITH ONLY PATCHY 
HIGH CLOUDS INDICATED...KEEPING THE POTENTIAL FOR MUCH COOLER TEMPS 
TONIGHT.  ADJUSTED MIN TEMPS JUST A BIT IN LINE WITH LATEST MOS 
VALUES.  KEPT IN PATCHY AREAS OF FROST LATE TONIGHT IN THE SHELTERED 
VALLEYS AND HIGHEST ELEVATIONS...AND WE WILL LIKELY ISSUE SPS AGAIN.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)... SUBTROPICAL RIDGE IN GULF
OF MEXICO LOOKS STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP MAIN STORM TRACK TO OUR
NORTH. STILL HAVE POPS IN FOR THE END OF THE WEEK...BUT SHOULD ONLY
HAVE A GLANCING BLOW FROM THAT SYSTEM AS IT TRACK NORTH OF AREA AS
WELL.

SURFACE RIDGE THAT WILL BE OVER THE AREA MONDAY MORNING WILL SETTLE
INTO THE GULF COAST STATES FOR A FEW DAYS LEAVING US IN A FAIRLY
DRY WEST OR SOUTHWEST LOW LEVEL FLOW.

TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TO REBOUND TO READINGS WELL ABOVE AVERAGE
AGAIN BY MID WEEK.  MADE ONLY MINOR TWEAKS TO TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WARM DRY TODAY...COOL DRY TONIGHT. 
COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM CENTRAL MI TO SRN IL TO SW MO. ONLY REAL 
INDICATION IS WEAK SFC PRESSURE RISES AND SOME LIGHT WINDS BEHIND 
IT. AIRMASS BEHIND THE FRONT IN THE UPPER MIDWEST IS NOT THAT COLD 
AND DRY AND EVEN IF THIS ADVECTS IN OVERNIGHT DO NOT EXPECT 
DRASTICALLY COLD TEMPS SUNDAY MORNING...ALTHOUGH THERE MIGHT BE SOME 
TEMPS DROP TO THE MID 30S IN SECLUDED HOLLERS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND 
SW VA.  THIS ALL DUE TO MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND THE RAPID DECOUPLING 
OF WINDS TONIGHT. HAVE DROPPED MIN TEMPS TONIGHT A DEGREE OR TWO 
BELOW MAV EVERYWHERE.

THERE WILL BE SOME ISSUE OF WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS THIS AFTERNOON AS 
925-700 THICKNESS GRADIENT TIGHTENS. HAVE INCREASED WINDS IN 
MOUNTAINS AND ALONG VA-KY BORDER TO TEENS WITH SOME GUSTINESS. LAST, 
HAVE NUDGED MAX TEMPS IN THE SRN HALF A DEGREE-ISH WITH AMPLE SUN 
EXPECTED, BUT HAVE NUDGED THEM DOWN A HAIR IN THE NRN HALF WHERE IT 
WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH SIGNIFICANT RADIATION AND BURN OFF OF FOG IN 
MANY AREAS. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...DRIER AIR LOCATED IN THE 
DAKOTAS NOW SHOULD BE FILTERING INTO THE AREA DURING THE EARLY PARTS 
OF THE PERIOD.  HIGH TEMPS ON SUNDAY LOOK RESONABLE CONSIDERING 
HIGHS WERE MAINLY IN THE 60S IN THE DAKOTAS ON FRIDAY.  LOOKING AT 
FRIDAYS LOWS AND CURRENT TEMPS UP IN THAT AREA...HAVING A LITTLE 
CONCERN THAT GUIDANCE LOW TEMPS MAY BE A LITTLE TOO COOL MONDAY 
MORNING.  PRESENT 06Z FARGO TEMP IS 41 DEG...NAM MOS FORECAST IN 48 
HOURS (06Z) AT KTRI IS 41 DEG...SUGGESTING THAT AIRMASS WONT MODIFY 
ON ITS WAY SEWD...HMMM.  ALSO...DEWPOINTS ARENT OVERLY DRY...AROUND 
FREEZING.  FROST MAY BE LIMITED TO HIGHEST ELEVATIONS SUNDAY AND

.DISCUSSION...
A SURFACE RIDGE REMAINS NORTHWEST OF THE AREA WHILE FARTHER 
NORTHWEST A COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS NORTHERN IL AND MO. A MID LEVEL 
TROUGH AS MOVED EAST OF THE AREA. THE SURFACE RIDGE WILL BE SHIFTING 
SOUTH AND WINDS SHOULD BE NEAR CALM AT MOST LOCATIONS...AND SKIES 
WILL BE MOSTLY CLEAR. THIS SHOULD PRODUCE GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING 
CONDITIONS...HOWEVER LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS LESS THAN PREVIOUS 
NIGHTS. FOG DEVELOPMENT WILL BE MOST LIKELY OVER AREA LAKES AND 
STREAMS. WILL RETAIN MENTION OF PATCHY FOG AND REDUCE CLOUD COVER IN 
THE GRIDS. FORECAST TEMPERATURES AND DEWPOINTS ARE STAYING CLOSE TO 
OBSERVED VALUES...SO NO CHANGES NEEDED THERE.

WINDS WILL BECOME CALM OVERNIGHT SETTING THE STAGE FOR AREAS OF STEAM
FOG DEVELOPMENT NEAR AREA LAKES AND STREAMS.

327 AM EDT FRI OCT 14 2005


.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...PROBLEM OF THE DAY IS WHAT TO DO 
ABOUT THE FRONT AND ASSOCIATED SHORT WAVE NOW OVER MS VALLEY. THE 
GFS AND NAM ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON TIMING OF WAVE OVER AREA, AND 
BOTH MOVE IT OUT OF HERE AROUND 00Z SATURDAY. THE GFS IS A LITTLE 
STRONGER, SHARPER ON THE TROF AND SEEMS TO MOVE IT JUST A HAIR 
FASTER. LL MOISTURE, ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHEAST, WILL ALLOW FOR A 
LITTLE SLOWER BURN OFF IN THE NORTHEASTERN HALF OF FORECAST AREA. A 
LITTLE MORNING FOG PERHAPS TODAY AND SATURDAY EARLY MORNING IN AREAS 
WITH CLEARER SKIES. HAVE INCREASED CLOUD COVER TODAY A LITTLE IN THE 
NORTHEAST TO ACCOUNT FOR EXTRA MOISTURE THERE, AND PRESENCE OF WAVE. 
ALSO, HAVE RAISED TEMPS A DEGREE OR SO OVER MAV IN SOUTHWEST 
PORTIONS, AND EITHER KEPT THE SAME OR LOWERED THEM A DEGREE UNDER 
MAV IN NORTHEAST PORTIONS. OVERNIGHT LOWS I DROPPED A DEGREE OR TWO 
AS SKIES CLEAR, WAVE MOVES OUT, WINDS DIE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
CONTINUES TO SLOWLY BUILD INTO THE REGION OVER THE WEEKEND WITH DEW 
POINTS BOTTOMING OUT AROUND MONDAY MORNING.  HAVE LOWERED LOW TEMPS 
FOR SUNDAY NIGHT ABOUT 4-6 DEGREES DUE TO EXPECTATIONS OF DRY AIR 
AND LIGHT WINDS.

LOOKS TO REMAIN DRY THROUGH ENTIRE LONG TERM PERIOD AS MOST
SYSTEMS STAY TO OUR NORTH. ANOTHER MINOR SHORT WAVE RACES THROUGH AREA
ON TUESDAY...BUT NO RAIN EXPECTED WITH IT FOR NOW EITHER.

THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CHANGE IN THE AIR MASS OVER THE AREA IN THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...PERSISTENT UPPER RIDGE 
PROJECTED TO HANG ON OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS THROUGH THE SHORT 
TERM PER MODEL AND SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. AS A 
RESULT...EXPECTING LITTLE CHANGE IN THE SENSIBLE WEATHER FOR OUR 
AREA. DEGREE OF CLOUD COVER WILL AGAIN MAKE TEMPS PROBLEMATIC 
ESPECIALLY MAX TEMPS FOR THURSDAY. RELATIVELY WIDE VARIATION IN

LESS CLOUD COVER ANTICIPATED. INCLINATION IS TO NOT MAKE ANY 
DRAMATIC CHANGES TO PREVIOUS FORECAST WHICH TENDS TO AGREE WITH 
WARMER GFS GUIDANCE VALUES.



.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...COLD FRONT MOVES
THROUGH THE AREA ON FRIDAY WITH ASSOCIATED SHORTWAVE...
HOWEVER... NOT ENOUGH MOISTURE TO GENERATE SHOWERS SO HAVE BACKED
POPS BELOW 15 PERCENT AND REMOVED SHOWERS FROM THE FORECAST. THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SKIES HAVE STAYED RELATIVELY CLEAR

COMPONENT IN DETERMINING HIGH TEMPS FOR THE AFTERNOON.  THEREFORE...

CLOUDY DURING THE AFTERNOON.  AS SUCH...WILL KEEP TEMPS CLOSE TO

OVER AREA WEATHER FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS FOR GENERALLY DRY 
CONDITIONS.  THE ONLY POSSIBLE EXCEPTION TO THIS MAY BE IN RESPONSE 
TO A VERY WEAK IMPULSE MOVING THROUGH THE UPPER FLOW.  AT MOST... 
BELIEVE THIS MAY GENERATE A STRAY LIGHT SHOWER OVER OUR EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS...WILL KEEP POPS QUITE LOW FOR THIS.


.LONG TERM...(THU THROUGH TUE)...MODELS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT 
WEAK UPPER RIDGING ON THU GIVES WAY TO A SHORT WAVE/COLD FRONT

OVER MOST OF THE NORTHERN 2/3 OF THE FORECAST AREA AND MORE 
ADVECTING IN ALL THE TIME. THIS HAS PROVED TO BE THE PROBLEM O THE 
DAY, WITH ITS ATTENDANT SINK/SWIM ON TEMPS. NAM SEEMS TO BE THE BEST 
MODEL WITH SHORT RIDGING AND LIMITED POPS OVERNIGHT AND ESPECIALLY 
ON WEDNESDAY. HAVE ADJUSTED CLOUD COVER TO ALLOW STRATUS DECK TO 
REFORM OVERNIGHT EVERYWHERE, THEN BURN OFF TOMORROW IN THE CENTRAL 
VALLEY, BUT IT WILL LIKELY EITHER STAY PUT ALONG THE PLATEAU, 
MOUNTAINS, AND NORTHEAST, OR IT WILL BURN OFF JUST ENOUGH TO ALLOW 
SOLAR GENERATED STRATOCU TO REFORM. SOME CU MAY ACTUALLY BECOME 
TOWERING IN THE SUNNIER AREAS IN THE SOUTH. A MINOR PIECE OF ENERGY 
MOVE OVER THE RIDGE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON WHICH WILL WORK WITH LL 
MOISTURE AND PRODUCE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS EARLY ALONG THE 
MOUNTAINS, GROWING TO INCLUDE MOST OF THE AREA EAST OF THE PLATEAU 
BY THE END OF THE PERIOD. ADJUSTED MIN TEMPS UP A DEGREE IN THE 
SOUTHERN TWO THIRDS AS CLOUDS WILL REFORM AND HOLD THEM UP A LITTLE. 
BETWEEN THE MINOR SHORT WAVE AND THE SUN, GAPS IN THE CLOUD COVER 
WEDNESDAY WILL ALLOW MAX TEMPS TO BE A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE MAV 
NUMBERS SOUTHERN TWO-THIRDS AND ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.


.LONG TERM...(WED NIGHT THROUGH TUE)...GENERALLY BENIGN WEATHER WITH 
ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS IN THE OFFING FOR MUCH OF THE REMAINDER OF THE

APPROACH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON FRIDAY...BUT MODEL TIME 
HEIGHTS DEPICT VERY UNIMPRESSIVE MOISTURE PROFILE ACCOMPANYING THIS 
FEATURE. WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ON FRIDAY...BUT 
PROSPECTS DO NOT LOOK PROMISING AT THIS TIME.

FURTHER OUT...MODEL SOLUTIONS BECOME INCREASINGLY DIVERSE BY THE END 
OF THE PERIOD...RESULTING IN RATHER LOW CONFIDENCE. CANADIAN GEM 
MODEL TENDS TO SUPPORT THE ECMWF MAKING THE 00Z GFS AN OUTLIER.

.DISCUSSION...NO UPDATE THIS MORNING. ALTHOUGH CLOUDS APPEAR TO BE 
CLEARING OUT OVER THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PORTIONS AND RADAR IS 
PRETTY QUIET...A CLOSER LOOK WILL SHOW SUBTLE BOUNDARIES IN THE 
AREA. LL LIFT WILL BE WEAK UNLESS THE CLOUD COVER PERMITS ENOUGH SUN 
TO DRIVE INITIATION OF CONVECTION. ALSO...A SURFACE THETA E RIDGE 
EXTENDS FROM NE GA THROUGH WRN NC INTO NE TN AND SW VA WITH A TIGHT 
GRADIENT ON THE WEST SIDE OVER E TN. CURRENT POPS INCREAS FROM 
AROUND 20 IN THE SOUTHWEST PORTIONS TO 30 OVER CENTRAL TO 40 IN THE 
NORTHEAST. THIS SOUNDS REASONABLE CONSIDERING THE ABOVE FACTORS.

NORTHERN PLATEAU TO OUR WEST...AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME LIGHTNING 
STRIKES WITH THIS ACTIVITY.  MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW UPPER LOW 
LIFTING NORTHEAST TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH CENTER STAYING TO OUR 
NORTH.  LOOKS LIKE FORCING WILL BE ON THE WEAK SIDE FOR OUR AREA AND 
BETTER MOISTURE WILL BE TO OUR NORTH.  WILL GO WITH SLIGHT CHANCE

SOUTH...SLIGHT CHANCE CENTRAL AND LOW CHANCE NORTH FOR TONIGHT.  
WITH SOME MID LEVEL COOLING...APPEARS THERE WILL BE ENOUGH 
INSTABILITY TO MENTION THUNDER...AT LEAST IN THE CENTRAL AND

THE TROF BY FRIDAY RESULTING IN SOME AMPLIFICATION. LOW LEVEL 
FEATURES NOT TERRIBLY IMPRESSIVE IN GFS MODEL WITH WEAK TROF/FRONT 
SLIDING EAST THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. USED SLIGHT CHC POPS FOR 
THIS TWO DAY PERIOD DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN STRENGTH OF UPPER TROF AND 
ABILITY TO ADVECT SUFFICIENT MOISTURE INTO THE REGION FOR WIDESPREAD 
DEVELOPMENT OF PRECIP. KEPT WEEKEND DRY AND MILD WITH RIDGING

HAS LINGERED ACROSS PART OF THE FORECAST AREA. THE SUN DID COME OUT 
ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA AROUND NOON AND CLEARING GRADUALLY WORKED 
SOUTHWEST DOWN THE TN VALLEY TOWARD KNOXVILLE. TEMPERATURES VARIED 
WIDELY DEPENDING ON SUN AND CLOUDS...RANGING FROM THE UPPER 50S TO 
THE MID 70S. CLOSED UPPER LOW OVER AR THIS AFTERNOON IS CAUSING 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS WEST TN AND NORTH 
MS THIS AFTERNOON. THIS FEATURE WILL MOVE NE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY 
TONIGHT AND MONDAY. LOOKS LIKE ENOUGH INSTABILITY AND COLDER AIR 
ALOFT FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS NE TN AND SW VA DURING 
MAX HEATING ON MONDAY. THIS AREA WILL BE CLOSEST TO THE CENTER OF 
THE LOW. MODELS KEEP LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AROUND TONIGHT AND MONDAY SO 
EXPECTING CLOUDS TO COME BACK IN OVER THE NORTHEAST HALF. INCREASING 
LIFT TONIGHT AHEAD OF LOW SHOULD CREATE A FEW SHOWERS WESTERN 
SECTIONS THEN SPREAD INTO ENTIRE AREA MONDAY. KEPT LOWS TONIGHT AND 
SUNDAY NIGHT ABOUT THE SAME AS THIS MORNINGS IN THE MID 50S TO NEAR 
60. HIGHS MONDAY SHOULD BE WARMER SOUTH THAN TODAY WITH PARTIAL 
SUNSHINE IN THE AFTERNOON. SKIES SHOULD BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY SOUTH 
SUNDAY NIGHT AS MOISTURE WITH UPPER LOW MOVES NORTHEAST.
      
.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER TROUGH MOVES WELL 
NORTHEAST OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR TUESDAY WITH UPPER RIDGE BUILDING 
INTO THE REGION FOR MID-WEEK. MAIN CONCERN EARLY THE EXTENDED IS HOW 
LOW STRATUS REMAINS OVER THE AREA. NAM IS FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE WITH 
KEEPING LOW CLOUDS OVER THE NORTHERN PLATEAU...MOST OF SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA...AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. UPPER RIDGE BREAKS DOWN FOR 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH A UPPER TROUGH DIGGING SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE 
OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. WILL 
CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT.

PER NCEP...A MUCH DEEP UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL 
MOVE ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION FOR THE LATER HALF OF THE 
NEXT WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. SINCE EFFECTS FROM NEXT SYSTEM WILL
BE ON THE TAIL END OF THE EXTENDED AND TIMING OF FROPA UNCERTAIN...WILL

.SHORT TERM...
TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...THE RAIN HAS ENDED ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON WITH A FEW AREAS OF DRIZZLE STILL 
POSSIBLE. LOW CLOUDS STILL BLANKET ALMOST ALL OF THE AREA WITH SOME 
BREAKS ACROSS SW NC AND ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY. THE COLD FRONT 
HAS NOW MOVED ALMOST TO THE EAST COAST AT MID AFTERNOON. COLD AIR 
ADVECTION IS CONTINUING WITH STRONGEST WINDS NEAR 15 MPH OVER THE 
SOUTHERN VALLEY. TEMPERATURES ARE STILL COOL AND RANGE FROM THE MID 
50S IN PARTS OF SW VA AND THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU TO THE 
LOWER AND MID 60S EXCEPT THE UPPER 60S SOUTHERN VALLEY AND LOWER 70S 
SW NC. 

CURRENT SATELLITE PICTURES AND SHORT TERM RUC MODEL SHOWING UPPER 
LOW OVER OHIO BRINGING SOME LOW CLOUDS SOUTH TOWARD THE OHIO RIVER. 
ANOTHER MID LEVEL LOW NOW OVER THE ARKLATEX IS ALREADY SPREADING 
HIGH AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS NE INTO MIDDLE TN AND NORTH AL ABOVE THE 
LOW CLOUD DECK THAT IS STILL THERE THIS AFTERNOON. THIS UPPER LOW 
WILL MOVE NORTHEAST INTO WEST TN BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. FOR TONIGHT 
AND SUNDAY THE MAIN PROBLEM WILL BE LINGERING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND 
ITS AFFECT ON LOW AND HIGH TEMPERATURES. THE GFS MODEL IS SCOURING
OUT THE MOISTURE SOME TONIGHT AND SUNDAY AND THE GUIDANCE DROPS 
TEMPERATURES INTO THE UPPER 40S...THEN SUNDAY WITH BREAKS WARMING 
MOST PLACES INTO THE 70S. WILL FOLLOW THE WARMER NAM NUMBERS TONIGHT 
IN THE LOWER 50S AND FOR SUNDAY A BLEND WITH TEMPERATURES A FEW 
DEGREES BELOW MAV. CROSS SECTION RH DATA BELOW 850 MB STAYS ABOVE
90 PERCENT THROUGH SUNDAY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.

.LONG TERM...
SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...THE MIDLEVEL LOW WILL LIFT NORTHEAST
AND CROSS THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY. IN RESPONSE THE 850
MB WINDS TURN TO A MORE UPSLOPE COMPONENT AND INCREASE. LOW LEVEL
WARM THETA-E ADVECTION WILL BE OCCURRING BELOW 500 MB
COOLING...RESULTING IN 850-500 LAPSE RATES OF 6 TO 7 C/KM. NAM ALSO
SHOWS SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE LI ON MONDAY ALONG WITH SURFACE CONVERGENCE
IN THE TN VALLEY WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER/MID 60S. THUS WILL ADD
A MENTION OF ISOLATED THUNDER. WV IMAGERY INDICATES THAT DEEP
MOISTURE IS LIMITED WITH THIS SYSTEM...AND THE GFS SHOWS VERY
LITTLE LIFT DESPITE A 28/S VORT MAX...SO WILL KEEP POPS AT A LOW
CHANCE. HEIGHTS RISE ON MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY AS THE SYSTEM
EXITS AND A SHORTWAVE RIDGE BUILDS OVERHEAD. TEMPS SUNDAY NIGHT
WILL LEAN TOWARD THE WARMER MET GUIDANCE...IN THE MID/UPPER 50S.
SOUTHWEST SECTIONS MAY SEE ENOUGH SUN MONDAY TO REACH 80 WHILE
CLOUDS CENTRAL AND NORTHEAST WILL HOLD TEMPS IN THE 70S. WITH MORE
SUNSHINE ON TUESDAY HIGHS SHOULD REACH THE MID 70S TO LOWER 80S.

TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...MID LEVEL RIDGE AXIS WILL BE OVER 
THE AREA ON TUESDAY NIGHT...AND SHIFT TO THE EAST ON WEDNESDAY. 
THE RESULTING SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL INCREASE MOISTURE...AND AN
APPROACHING UPPER TROUGH WILL INCREASE LIFT ON THURSDAY. MODELS
DIFFER WITH THE STRENGTH AND TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM...WITH THE DGEX
SHOWING A SLOW CLOSED CIRCULATION AND THE GFS SHOWING A PROGRESSIVE
POSITIVELY-TILTED TROUGH. GIVEN THESE DISPARITIES WILL NOT MAKE
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AND POPS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WILL BE KEPT AS
LOW CHANCES. BEHIND THIS TROUGH A LARGE RIDGE CROSSES THE EASTERN
CONUS...GIVING DRY WEATHER FOR THE WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM...
TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE 
EXTENDS FROM THE NORTHEAST GULF TO THE NORTHEAST OVER THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA AND EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS THIS 
AFTERNOON. LOW CLOUDS AND LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN CONTINUES ACROSS 
MOST OF THE EASTERN TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. AN UPPER 
TROUGH WAS OVER THE UPPER MS VALLEY AND AHEAD OF THIS TROUGH A 
SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT HAD MOVED TO THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS AFTERNOON WITH A NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERATURES 
ACROSS THIS BOUNDARY. CURRENT TEMPERATURES IN SCOTT AND BLEDSOE 
COUNTIES ARE NEAR 60 WITH SOME COLD AIR SPREADING IN TO THE PLATEAU. 
THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA IS IN THE MID 60S TO LOWER 70S. A 
WEAK UPPER LOW WAS LOCATED OVER THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE EXTENDING INTO 
SOUTHERN GA AND AL. DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS MODELS BRING THIS UPPER 
LOW NORTHEAST AND MOVES THE FRONT VERY SLOWLY EAST. A COUPLE 
IMPULSES MOVE NORTH NORTHEAST TONIGHT AND SATURDAY ACROSS GA INTO NC 
AND VA BRUSHING NORTHEAST TN AND SW VA. THIS AREA MAY GET ANOTHER 
ONE TO TWO INCHES OF RAIN ESPECIALLY OVER THE MOUNTAINS. GFS IS 
FASTER WITH MOVING THE FRONT EAST BUT THINK THE SLOWER NAM IS MORE 
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CURRENT SPEED. MODELS START TO DRY OUT THE 
UPPER LEVELS SATURDAY BUT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE GETS TRAPPED WHICH WILL 
KEEP CLOUDS AROUND. TEMPERATURES WERE TRICKY WITH THE FRONT SO 
CLOSE. FOLLOWED CLOSER TO THE WARMER MET NUMBERS TONIGHT AND HAD A 
RANGE FROM LOWER TO MID 60S PLATEAU TO UPPER 60S IN THE VALLEYS 
SATURDAY.     

.LONG TERM...
SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE TROUGH 
CROSSING THE MIDWEST BECOMES CUT OFF OVER THE SOUTHERN MS VALLEY ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT. MID AND UPPER LEVELS DRY LATE SATURDAY BEHIND THE 
EXITING SHORTWAVE TROUGH...BUT BOTH THE NAM AND GFS INDICATE PLENTY 
OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINING IN PLACE. THUS WILL HAVE CLOUDY 
SKIES WITH NO POP FOR SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING. ON 
SUNDAY THE CLOSED LOW BEGINS TO LIFT NORTHEAST. VORTICITY ADVECTION 
AND UPPER DIVERGENCE INCREASE IN RESPONSE...AND WILL BEGIN POPS 
ACROSS THE AREA ON SUNDAY EVENING. GFS IS STRONGER WITH THE VORT 
AXIS BUT BOTH NAM AND GFS HAVE SIMILAR TIMING. STRONG DYNAMICS IN 
THE GFS SUGGEST THUNDER MAY BE POSSIBLE...BUT INSTABILITY IS TOO 
LIMITED AT THIS POINT TO ADD A MENTION. THE VORT LIFTS OUT OF THE 
AREA LATE TUESDAY...ENDING POPS AND DRYING OUT THE COLUMN. 

MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...RIDGE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL 
BUILD NORTH ON MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. WILL KEEP A DRY 
FORECAST THIS PERIOD WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES. THE RIDGE AXIS 
WILL SHIFT EAST OF THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY AS A TROUGH APPROACHES FROM 
THE WEST. UPPER DIVERGENCE AHEAD OF A JET STREAK AND INCREASING 
MOISTURE WILL BRING A CHANCE OF RAIN BEGINNING WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. 
SURFACE FRONT APPEARS TO STALL NEAR THE MOUNTAINS...AND RAIN CHANCE 
WILL CONTINUE THROUGH FRIDAY. THE POSITIVE TILT TO THE TROUGH AND 
RELATIVELY LIGHT WINDS IN THE LOW LEVELS WILL KEEP POPS IN THE 
SLIGHT/LOW CHANCE RANGE. A SECOND TROUGH THAT DIVES OUT OF CANADA 
MAY LEAD TO HIGHER POPS LATE FRIDAY BUT WILL LEAVE AS A CHANCE THIS 
FAR OUT.

955 AM EDT FRI OCT 7 2005

.DISCUSSION...MOISTURE IS CONTINUEING TO STREAM NORTH ALONG AND 
AHEAD OF A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY LOCATED FROM CENTRAL 
OHIO SOUTH SOUTHWEST TO NEAR MOBILE AL. TEMPERATURES ON THE OTHER 
SIDE OF THE FRONT IN MIDDLE AND WEST TN ARE 10 TO 15 DEGREES COOLER. 
THE UPPER TROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT IS OVER THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS AND WILL MOVE VERY SLOWLY EAST TODAY. ANOTHER UPPER 
LOW WAS OVER THE NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO AND MOISTURE WAS MOVING 
NORTH AHEAD OF THE FRONT. THE HEAVIEST PRECIPITATION STILL LOOKS TO 
STAY TO OUR EAST AND NORTHEAST. CROSS SECTION DATA STILL SHOWING 
SOME POSSIBLE HEAVIER PRECIPITATION THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON SW 
SECTIONS OF FORECAST AREA AND SPREADING NE INTO NE TN AND SW VA 
THROUGH PART OF THE EVENING. NEW HPC GUIDANCE SHOWING BETWEEN ONE TO 
TWO INCHES OF RAIN ACROSS THE NORTHEAST TN MOUNTAINS IN 24 HOURS AND 
MUCH SMALLER AMOUNTS ACROSS WESTERN AREAS. HIGH TEMPERATURES TODAY 
WILL BE ONLY A FEW DEGREES ABOVE CURRENT READINGS WITH CLOUDS AND 
PRECIPITATION. NO CHANGES TO CURRENT FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODELS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT 
MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO STREAM NORTH ALONG A NEARLY STATIONARY 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY...AND SHOW THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS MOVING 
EAST TODAY AND TONIGHT.  LOOKS LIKE BULK OF PRECIPITATION WILL STAY 
TO OUR EAST AND NORTHEAST WHERE BETTER FORCING WILL EXIST...BUT WILL 
HAVE TO GO WITH HIGH POPS BOTH TODAY AND TONIGHT AS WE SHOULD SEE AT 
LEAST SOME PRECIPITATION...WITH THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS FOR OUR AREA IN 
SW NC AND THE MOUNTAIN ZONES. INSTABILITY LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE 
LIMITED...WHILE CAN NOT RULE THUNDER OUT COMPLETELY...DO NOT THINK 
IT IS WORTH A MENTION IN THE FORECAST SO WILL LEAVE OUT FOR NOW.  
SHOULD NOT SEE MUCH OF A RISE IN TEMPS TODAY WITH CLOUDS AND SOME 
PRECIP.  WILL GO A BIT ABOVE MAV TEMP FOR CHA TODAY...BUT OTHERWISE 
MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE MOST LOCATIONS BOTH TODAY AND TONIGHT SO 
WILL NOT STRAY FAR.   

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...THE EARLY PART OF THIS 
FORECAST PERIOD WILL BE UNSETTLED AS LOWER PRESSURES REMAIN 
ACROSS/NEAR THE REGION COMPLIMENTS OF TAMMY AND FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
WHICH DOES NOT MAKE MUCH PROGRESS EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. UPPER 
LEVEL TROFFING STAGNATES TO THE WEST ACROSS THE OHIO AND LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. AN ABUNDANCE OF TROPICAL MOISTURE WILL BE 
AVAILABLE FOR LIFTING EARLY ON SATURDAY AND ADJUSTED POPS UP TO A 
RANGE OF LIKELY SW VA/NE TN TO MEDIUM CHC CENTRAL EAST AND SOUTHEAST 
TN TAPERING BACK TO CHC/SLGT CHC BY LATE AFTERNOON INTO SATURDAY 
EVENING AS DEEP MOISTURE AND BETTER DYNAMICS SHIFT NORTH AND EAST OF 
THE REGION. WENT AHEAD AND INTRODUCED A SLGT CHC POP FOR -SHRA ON 
SUNDAY AS S/WV IN THE BASE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TROF SWINGS NORTHEAST 
TOWARD THE TN VLY AND SRN APPALACHIANS. GFS/NAM INDICATE SUFFICIENT 
DEPTH OF MOISTURE IN PLACE AHEAD OF THE S/WV FOR THIS POSSIBILITY. 
KEPT SKY COVER PESSIMISTICALLY MOSTLY CLOUDY AS WELL. KEPT THE DRY 
AND IMPROVING WX TREND GOING MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY DAYTIME PERIOD 
AS UPPER RIDGE AMPLIFIES AHEAD OF NEXT TROF. THIS FEATURE PRESSES 
EAST INTO THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY WITH 
INCREASING MOISTURE ADVECTION AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT WHICH DRIVES 
INTO THE MIDWEST DURING THE DAY THURSDAY. MAINTAINED SLGT/SMALL CHC 
POPS FROM PREVIOUS FCST AS THIS TROF APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA. 
ADJUSTED MAX/MIN TEMPS UP A FEW DEGREES THROUGH MOST OF THE LONG 
TERM FCST BUT NOT AS RADICALLY AS GFS MOS DUE TO SLOWER PROGRESSION 
OF FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND EXTENDED PERIOD OF SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT.

.DISCUSSION...BULK OF SHOWERS MOVING RAPIDLY ACROSS AREA THIS
EVENING, WITH THE SOUTHWEST AND NORTHEAST PORTIONS STILL AFFECTED
BY THEM, BUT THIS, TOO, IS A MATTER OF TIME. WILL BE DECREASING
POPS TO CHANCE IN THE CENTRAL PORTIONS AND LIKELY IN THE SOUTHWEST
AND NORTHEAST FOR REMAINDER OF NIGHT. FORECAST FOR TOMORROW
UNAFFECTED. ALSO, HAVE PUBLIC REPORTS OF WINDS A LITTLE STRONGER
THAN FORECAST, SO HAVE INCREASED THE RANGES ON WINDS. LOOKING AT
SURFACE GRADIENT, SEE THAT AN INVERTED TROF ASSOCIATED WITH
REMNANTS OF TAMMY IS ROTATING WESTWARD ACROSS AREA AND PRESSURE
GRADIENT HAS REMAINED TIGHTER THAN ORIGINALLY THOUGHT AND THAN THE MODELS
FORECAST. THIS SHOULD REMAIN A PLAYER THE REST OF THE NIGHT. AS A
RESULT, WILL NOT UPDATE TEMPS AS THE MIXING WILL MAINTAIN HIGHER
TEMPS OVERNIGHT.

316 PM EDT THU OCT 6 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MOISTURE HAS BEEN STREAMING 
NORTH AND NORTHWEST ALL DAY FROM TROPICAL DEPRESSION TAMMY AS SHE 
DIES OUT IN AL. MOSTLY LIGHT RAIN HAS BEEN FALLING WITH SOME 
MODERATE RAIN IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS TO THE EAST. TEMPERATURES 
HAVE BEEN HELD NEARLY STEADY SINCE LATE MORNING IN THE UPPER 60S TO 
THE LOWER 70S AS LOW CLOUDS AND RAIN HAVE MOVED NORTH ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA. THE SURFACE AND UPPER LOW REMAINS OF TAMMY WERE OVER 
SOUTHERN AL AND A COLD FRONT IS CURRENTLY MOVING SOUTHEAST INTO THE 
LOWER OHIO VALLEY AND HAS CROSSED THE MS RIVER IN WEST TN. THE COLD 
FRONT WILL SLOW TONIGHT AND FRIDAY AS IT PICKS UP THE MOISTURE FROM 
TAMMY. RAINFALL TONIGHT WILL NOT BE CONTINUOUS UNTIL A SHORTWAVE 
AHEAD OF THE FRONT APPROACHES LATE TONIGHT. CROSS SECTION DATA 
INDICATES COPIOUS MOISTURE WITH LIFT INCREASING LATE TONIGHT IN THE 
SOUTH AND THEN FRIDAY FARTHER NORTH AND NORTHEAST. PRECIPITABLE 
WATER VALUES WILL BE NEAR 2.00 INCHES. EXPECT RAINFALL TO BECOME 
HEAVY AT TIMES LATE TONIGHT AND FRIDAY WITH AMOUNTS FROM TWO TO 
THREE INCHES IN SW NC AND THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS BY THE TIME THE RAIN 
ENDS FRIDAY NIGHT OR EARLY SATURDAY WITH MOST OTHER AREAS ONE TO TWO 
INCHES. DO NOT THINK ANY SERIOUS FLOODING WILL DEVELOP WITH THE 
FLASH FLOOD VALUES AROUND TWO INCHES FOR ONE HOUR AND THREE TO FIVE 
INCHES FOR A SIX HOUR PERIOD. ALSO THE RAIN WILL BE SPREAD OUT OVER 
A 24 TO 36 HOUR PERIOD. TONIGHTS MODEL RUN WILL NEED TO BE LOOKED AT 
TO DETERMINE IF AMOUNTS COULD BE HIGHER. DID NOT LIKE THE HUGE GFS 
BULLEYES OF PRECIPITATION AND PREFERRED THE MORE GENERAL NAM WHICH 
SPREADS THE AMOUNTS OVER TWO DAYS. FOR TEMPERATURES LIKED THE COOLER 
MAV NUMBERS OF LOW TO MID 60S TONIGHT AND WITH NO SUN AND RAIN 
FRIDAY THINK HIGHS WILL BE IN THE UPPER 60S TO AROUND 70 
DEGREES.        

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL 
COLLIDE WITH MOISTURE STREAMING NORTHEAST FROM REMAINS OF TAMMY. 
FAIRLY DECENT UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT IS EVIDENT WITH Q-VECTOR FORCING 
NOTED AT THE 850-700 MB AND 700-500 MB LEVELS FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
THROUGH EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. ALSO...NOTED FORECAST AREA WILL BE 
UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT REAR QUADRANT OF THE JET (JET AXIS OVER THE 
OHIO VALLEY). WILL CONTINUE HIGH POPS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT (HIGHEST FOR 
TYS AND TRI). 

WILL GENERALLY TREND REST OF THE FORECAST WITH THE GFS MODEL...EVEN 
THOUGH I HAVE LOW CONFIDENCE ON THE MOISTURE STARVED SHORT-WAVE 
MOVING ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. OHIO 
VALLEY SHORT-WAVE IS MORE PROGRESS WITH THE GFS THAN THE NAM MODEL 
WHICH WILL ALLOW RAIN TO END GENERALLY SATURDAY MORNING. GFS SHOWS 
925-850 MB RELATIVE HUMIDITY HANGING TOUGH THROUGH SATURDAY WITH 
DECREASING RH SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY.

UPPER RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE AREA FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. RIDGE FLATTENS 
FOR MID-WEEK ALLOWING FOR A FRONTAL PASSAGE FOR WEDNESDAY OR 
THURSDAY. WILL INTRODUCE POPS FOR THE END OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HPC PREDICTING REMNANTS OF TAMMY 
TRACKING INTO WESTERN GA BY THIS EVENING.  INVERTED TROUGH AND 
INCREASED MOISTURE AHEAD OF IT SHOULD BRING SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS 
THE AREA TODAY.  THINK ONSET OF PRECIP WILL BE DELAYED A BIT WITH 
THE DRY LOWER LEVELS AND SOME DOWNSLOPING.  BEST CHANCES SHOULD HOLD 
OFF UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON AND ESPECIALLY TONIGHT AS TAMMY NEARS.  
WILL GO WITH 70/80 POPS FOR TONIGHT WITH THE HIGHEST POPS IN THE 
MOUNTAINS.  WITH OUR DRY CONDITIONS...NOT EXPECTING MUCH FLOOD 
PROBLEMS.  GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE...SO STAYED PRETTY 
CLOSE.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...PRIMARY FLOW AROUND TAMMY
AND MAIN PRECIP AREA EXPECTED TO HAVE TO CROSS MOUNTAINS TO GET TO
MUCH OF AREA...SO KEEPING TIGHT GRADIENT ON QPF...WITH ONLY VERY
LIGHT AMOUNTS WEST OF MOUNTAINS. ALSO KEEPING AT OR BELOW GUIDANCE
ON POPS DUE TO MOUNTAINS STEALING MOISTURE. 

TIMING OF FRONT TO ENTER AREA FRIDAY MORNING WITH NEARLY STEADY
TEMPERATURES ON FRIDAY. PRECIP LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE STARTING TO
EXIT THE REGION FRIDAY NIGHT.

BIGGEST TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE IN GUIDANCE IS FOR SATURDAY WHERE
MAX TEMPS VARIED BY AS MUCH AS 14 DEG. AM GOING ON COOL SIDE OF
WARMER GFS...THINK THAT CLOUD COVER IS OVERDONE ON NAM MOS FOR
SATURDAY AFTERNOON. DIDNT MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO CURRENT PACKAGE
AFTER SUNDAY MORNING.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...CONFIDENCE IS LOW IN THE SHORT 
TERM FORECAST.  MODELS ARE IN VERY POOR AGREEMENT AND THE RUN TO RUN 
CONSISTENCY IS OFF AS WELL.  MODELS MAIN DIFFICULTY IN THE SHORT 
TERM IS THEIR HANDLING OF TROPICAL SYSTEM TAMMY.  NOT PARTICULARLY 
TAKEN WITH CURRENT RUNS OF THE NAM OR GFS...AND BELIEVE MAIN 
MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS WILL STAY TO OUR SOUTH AND EAST.  FOR NOW... 
WILL KEEP POPS ON THURSDAY ON THE LOW SIDE...RANGING FROM AROUND 20 
PERCENT WEST TO 40S EAST.  ALSO...WILL GO BETWEEN GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
FOR HIGH TEMPS...THROUGH TRENDED TOWARD THE WARMER MET. 


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SEEMS THAT MODELS
HAVE BEEN INCONSISTENT PLUS THE SUDDEN DEVELOPMENT OF TROPICAL
STORM TAMMY...WHICH HAS LED TO SOME DRASTIC CHANGES IN THE FORECAST
FOR THE EARLY PARTS OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST.  NAM MODEL USUALLY
PERFORMS POORLY WITH TROPICAL SYSTEMS (ALSO NOTING COMMENTS ABOUT
POOR INITIALIZATION IN THE NAM CONCERNING T.S. TAMMY).  THUS...
CONTINUED TO GENERALLY FAVOR THE GFS MODEL FOR HANDLING OF THE
REMNANTS OF TAMMY PLUS THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT AND UPPER TROUGH
PASSAGE THAT LAGS BEHIND THE FRONT.  

FELT THAT MOST SIGNIFICANT RAINS FROM TAMMY WILL AFFECT AREAS TO
OUR EAST AND SOUTHEAST.  THIS LEAVES THE COLD FRONT WHICH ARRIVES
WITHOUT MUCH UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT.  SINCE BOTH THE GFS AND NAM SHOW
A DEEPER UPPER LEVEL TROUGH BEHIND THE FRONT...HAD TO CARRY AT
LEAST CHANCE POPS INTO SATURDAY AND INCREASE CLOUD COVER
CONSIDERABLY. LITTLE TO NO INSTABILITY INDICATED SO KEPT TYPE AS
SHOWERS WITH NO THUNDER.  KEPT THE DECREASE IN CLOUDS BY SATURDAY
NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...BUT LATER SHIFTS MAY NEED TO HOLD ON TO CLOUDS
LONGER.

BASED ON THESE CHANGES...DEW POINT TEMPS AS WELL AS MAX/MIN TEMPS
WERE ADJUSTED CONSIDERABLY. OTHERWISE...NO CHANGES MADE FOR MONDAY
AND TUESDAY...WITH NEW DAY 7 (WEDNESDAY) INTRODUCED AS PARTLY
CLOUDY AND DRY. TEMPS ACTUALLY LOOK TO BE NEAR NORMAL VALUES SUNDAY
THRU WEDNESDAY. MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MOS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...
DUE TO MODEL DIFFS FROM NAM TO GFS...SO TRENDED VALUES TO THE BLEND.
DGEX LOOKED EXTREMELY DIFFERENT FROM GFS...OTHER LONG RANGE MODELS
AND ENSEMBLES BEYOND SUNDAY...SO DGEX DATA WAS PRETTY MUCH IGNORED.

ADVERTISING A SYSTEM MOVING UP FROM SOUTH LATE TONIGHT.  GFS TAKING 
DISTURBANCE AND BEST MOISTURE TO THE EAST OF OUR CWA TONIGHT...WHILE 
NAM TRACKS IT TO THE SOUTH.  WENT WITH THE GFS AND INTRODUCED SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR THE MOUNTAINS FOR LATE TONIGHT.  


.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...GREAT DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN
NAM AND GFS THIS MORNING. SUPPORT FROM MANY OTHER MODELS TO GO WITH
GFS SOLUTION AND TO GIVE NAM NO WEIGHT IN THIS FORECAST. THIS
GFS SOLUTION IS MUCH DRIER THAN THE NAM WITH THE BULK OF THE PRECIP
STAYING EAST OF AREA. WITH DIRECTION PRECIP IS COMING FROM...MOST OF
OUR AREA WOULD BE IN A RAIN SHADOW WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS...EXCEPT
FOR THE PEAKS AND OUR 2 NC COUNTIES. SO GOING WITH A PRETTY GOOD
GRADIENT OF POPS AND QPF ACROSS THE EASTERN PARTS OF THE AREA. SOME
ADDITIONAL PRECIP MAY BE STOLEN WHEN CONSIDERING THAT THE SURFACE
TROUGH SHOULD BE LOCATED WELL EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS.

NO MAJOR CHANGES TO TEMPS THIS TIME...EXCEPT THAT IVE COOLED DOWN
HIGHEST TERRAIN FOR FRIDAY HIGHS DUE TO SOCKED-IN COLD AIR
ADVECTION SCENARIO--NO DOWNSLOPING THERE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...NAM AND GFS IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT ON BRINGING FRONT THROUGH THE AREA ON THURSDAY, SO 
THE MAIN FORECAST ISSUES FOR THE NEAR TERM PERIOD IS WHAT TO DO 
ABOUT CLOUDS, TEMPS, AND WINDS. WITH MAIN WEAK VORT CENTERS 
FOLLOWING BEHIND THE FRONT, AND DRY AIRMASS IN ADVANCE, NO THREAT OF 
PRECIP THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  HAVE MADE SOME VERY MINOR 
ADJUSTMENTS TO CLOUDS ALONG THE WESTERN SLIVER OF THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU IN THE MRX FORECAST AREA TO REDUCE OVERALL COVER FOR TONIGHT 
AND WEDNESDAY, AND ALSO REDUCED HIGH TEMPS (ONLY BY 1-2 DEGREES) FOR 
WEDNESDAY IN MOST PLACES AS BELIEVE HIGH CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO 
OBSCURE SUN JUST A LITTLE. ALSO, RAISED WINDS SPEEDS SOME AND 
ADJUSTED DIRECTIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR APPROACH OF FRONT, ESPECIALLY IN 
HIGHER TERRAIN. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...EASTERLY WAVE WILL CONTINUE 
TO PRESS TOWARD FL EMERGING IN THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO BY 12Z 
THURSDAY WHILE UPPER TROF/COLD FRONT MAKE PROGRESS THROUGH THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY. KEPT 
POPS IN LOW TO MEDIUM CHC CATEGORY FOR THE ARRIVAL OF UPPER 
TROF/COLD FRONT AS THE INVERTED SURFACE TROF ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
EASTERLY WAVE ABSORBS MUCH OF THE INFLOW INTO THE FRONTAL SYSTEM DUE 
TO THE EAST-NORTHEASTERLY COMPONENT TO THE LOW LEVEL FLOW IN

AS FRONT MAKES SLOW PROGRESS AWAY FROM THE APPALACHIANS. COOLER WX 
WITH RIDGING BUILDS BEHIND THE FRONT FOR THE WEEKEND AS ANOTHER

BRINGING WARM AND DRY WEATHER TODAY AND TONIGHT.  ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN THE SHORT TERM.  GUIDANCE 
TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE...SO DIDNT STRAY TOO FAR.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MAINLY CONCENTRATING ON
FRONTAL PASSAGE AND RAINFALL POTENTIAL BAHAMA TROUGH. LOOKING LESS
AND LESS LIKELY THAT OUR AREA WILL GET SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION
LATER THIS WEEK. AS FRONT MOVES INTO REGION...WINDS AHEAD OF FRONT
ARE BACKING IN RESPONSE TO INTENSIFYING BAHAMA DISTURBANCE AS IT
CROSSES INTO GLFMEX. AS THE WINDS BACK...THE FRONT LOOKS LIKE ITS
NWLY WINDS MAY SIMPLY BLEND INTO THE PRE-FRONTAL NELY WINDS. MAYBE
APPROACH OF FRONT WILL VEER WINDS LOCALLY ENOUGH TO GET SOME DECENT
CONVERGENCE...BUT OVERALL DOESNT LOOK LIKE A VERY EVENTFUL FROPA.
MODELS MAY NOT BE IN GREAT AGREEMENT ON THE SPECIFICS OF BAHAMA
DISTURBANCE...BUT THERE IS GOOD AGREEMENT THAT MOST OF THE DEEP LIFT
AND MOISTURE WILL BE EAST OF THE APPS FOR THIS ENTIRE MID-LATE WEEK EVENT.

FOR TEMPS HAVE WARMED UP HIGHS ON THURSDAY...PLANNING ON SLOWER
FRONTAL MOVEMENT AND DOWNSLOPING WINDS INTO TENN BASIN. ALSO WARMED
UP THU NIGHT LOWS A FEW DEGREES AS CLOUD COVER HAMPERS INITIAL
COOLING OF POST-FRONTAL AIR MASS.

LASTLY...BUMPED UP WINDS ON FRIDAY AND POPULATED WIND GUST GRIDS.
WINDS WILL LIKELY BE BLOWING ALONG THE MAIN MOUNTAIN RIDGES...SO
DOUBT THAT ADVISORY CRITERIA WILL BE MET IN THIS EVENT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...595 DM H5 RIDGE IN 
PLACE OVER SE US. FAIRLY POTENT FRONT ACROSS PLAINS, WITH 20 DEG F 
TEMPS DIFFS ACROSS BOUNDARY. WV IMAGERY SHOWS SHORT WAVE OVER NE OK 
TO NW MO MOVING GENERALLY EAST. THIS WILL BEGIN TO DEPRESS RIDGE BY 
LATER THIS EVENING. SFC HIGH EAST OF APPALACHIANS WILL CONTINUE TO 
DROP DOWN EAST OF MOUNTAINS, WITH MINOR WEDGE MAKING ITS WAY INTO 
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. ALL THIS WILL DO IS CAUSE SOME LIGHT EASTERLY 
WINDS ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS WHICH WILL GENERALLY DOWNSLOPE INTO THE 
AREA, DRYING THE LOWER ATMOS SOMEWHAT. NO CHANCE OF PRECIP THIS FAR 
AHEAD OF FRONT THROUGH WEDNESDAY 12Z. TEMPS ARE A BLEND, BUT 
ADJUSTED A LITTLE JUST TO COINCIDE WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES. ALSO 
TWEAKED WIND DIRECTIONS A LITTLE MORE TO NORTHEAST, BUT SPEEDS STILL 
LIGHT.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...SLOW MOVING UPR TROF AND 
ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM MAKES PROGRESS INTO THE GREAT 
LAKES BY 12Z WED WHILE THE FA ENJOYS MORE DRY AND WARM WEATHER. USED 
SLGT CHC POPS FOR POSSIBILITY OF A SHRA OR TSRA DEVELOPING WELL 
AHEAD OF COLD FRONT WED NITE. TIMING OF FRONT WITH THIS PACKAGE 
DOESNT OCCUR UNTIL AROUND 12-16Z FRI AND SO MAINTAINED HIGHEST CHC 
POPS THU NITE FOR SHRA/TSRA. ENERGY CONTINUES TO SPILL INTO THE BACK 
SIDE OF GREAT LAKES UPR TROF WITH UPPER LEVEL WINDS REMAINING SW 
KEEPING FRONTAL MOVEMENT AND A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH 
ONSET/END OF PRECIP THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF THE EXTENDED. FOR NOW 
WRAPPED UP THE EVENT WITH POPS TAPERING TO CHC/SLGT CHC ON FRI AND 
LINGERED SLGT CHC ALONG THE TN/NC BORDER FRI NITE. ALLOWED HIGHER 
PRESSURES AND DRIER NW-N FLO FOR MUCH OF THE REMAINDER OF THE FCST. 
ALONG WITH VARIOUS NEIGHBORING WFOS STRAYED SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER 
THAN NATIONAL GUIDANCE CONCERNING MAX TEMPS THU DUE TO SLOW MOVEMENT 
OF FRONT BUT OTHERWISE STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO GFS MOS.

UPPER TENN BASIN.  THIS FLOW INDUCING WEAK SURFACE LEE TROF ON WEST 
SIDE OF MOUNTAINS AND ALSO INDUCING DOWNSLOPING.  AS RIDGE CONTINUES 
TO BUILD-IN PLUS DOWNSLOPING ABLE ENTRAIN SOME DRIER AIR...DEW 
POINTS SHOULD FALL OFF DURING THE DAY ALLOWING ENHANCED SURFACE 
HEATING.  HAVE BUMPED UP HIGH TEMPS 1-2 DEGREES ACROSS AREA...EXCEPT 
IN NC COUNTIES WHERE DOWNSLOPING WILL NOT BE OCCURRING.  WILL LEAVE 
IN PATCHY FOG FOR THIS MORNING NEAR LAKES...FIRST FOG SATELLITE 
IMAGE AFTER ECLIPSE SHOWS SOME FOG/LOW CLOUDS FORMING IN A FEW SPOTS.

LIGHT WINDS ALL DAY TODAY...SHOULD GO CALM TONIGHT FAVORING FAST 
COOLING THIS EVENING.  MINIMAL CHANGES TO TEMPS TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER RIDGE REMAINS DOMINATE 
FEATURE FOR THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH MID-WEEK. SHORT WAVE 
TROUGH/SURFACE COLD FRONT STILL PROJECTED TO APPROACH AREA ON 
THURSDAY...BUT EXACT TIMING STILL UNCERTAIN AS ENSEMBLES AND 
OPERATIONAL MODELS BECOME DIVERGENT WITH PROGRESSION OF SHORT WAVE. 
BASED ON THIS UNCERTAINTY...MADE NO CHANGES TO GRIDS/FORECAST PAST 
DAY THREE (WEDNESDAY) AND ONLY MINOR TWEAKS PRIOR TO THAT. 
ANTICIPATE DRY WEATHER WITH WELL ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS UNTIL FRONTAL 
PASSAGE SOMETIME ON THURSDAY. TEMPS PROJECTED TO AVERAGE SLIGHTLY

.DISCUSSION...NOT MUCH CHANGE FROM LAST NIGHTS PATTERN EXCEPT 
TEMPERATURES ARE A FEW DEGREES WARMER AT THIS TIME. I THINK PARTLY 
BECAUSE OF A LITTLE WIND BLOWING AND SOME BROKEN CLOUDS AROUND CHA 
THIS EVENING. DEWPOINTS TONIGHT ARE ALSO A LITTLE LOWER IN THE 
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY AREAS. THIS WILL HELP TEMPERATURES DROP 
INTO THE 50S THERE. CURRENT FORECAST HAS LOWS ABOUT THE SAME MONDAY 
MORNING AS THEY WERE THIS MORNING. SKIES SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR OVER 
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEYS WITH SOME LOW CLOUDS AT TIMES 
EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHERN VALLEY WHERE EASTERLY FLOW IS DEEPER.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...WEAK SHORTWAVE CONTINUES
TO LIFT NE ACROSS THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION THIS AFTERNOON.
ONLY EFFECT THUS FAR FOR OUR REGION HAS BEEN A SLIGHT INCREASE IN
MOISTURE/CLOUDS PER SATELLITE PICS.  KEPT FORECAST DRY FOR TONIGHT
AND TOSSED IN SOME PATCHY VALLEY FOG AGAIN.  EXPECT WESTERN AND
SOUTHERN AREAS TO KEEP MORE OF A PARTLY CLOUDY SKY...WITH MOSTLY
CLEAR GENERALLY FOR NE AREAS.  CLOSE TO GFS OR BLEND FOR MIN TEMPS.

OVERALL THERE IS A SLIGHT DECREASE IN RH FOR MONDAY...WITH TIME
HEIGHT SECTIONS SHOWING THAT MOISTURE IS MAINLY FROM AROUND 800 MBS
TO SURFACE INTO TUESDAY.  THIS LOOKS TO PRODUCE MOSTLY CLEAR TO
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND NO RAIN.  THE E TO SE FLOW AROUND THE RIDGE
GRADUALLY DEEPENS BY LATE TUESDAY...WHICH SHOULD HELP TO ADVECT
MOISTURE IN ADVANCE OF THE COLD FRONT THAT SLOWLY APPROACHES IN THE
EXTENDED PERIODS.  MOS MAX AND MIN TEMPS QUITE CLOSE AND ACCEPTED
WITH A TWEAK OR TWO BASED ON PATTERN OF PAST FEW DAYS.   


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...BACKED OFF ON TIMING OF 
PRECIP WITH UPR TROF/CD FNT UNTIL WED NITE AS SYSTEM PROGRESSES 
SLOWLY E WHILE HI PRES MAINTAINS PRESENCE EARLY IN THE EXTENDED 
FCST. CONTINUED WITH SLGT/SMALL CHC POPS WED NITE INCREASING TO 
MEDIUM CHC FOR THU AS CD FNT MOVES THRU THE REGION. HELD ONTO SMALL 
CHC POPS THU NITE AS WAVE DEVELOPS ALONG FNT ACROSS GA/CAROLINAS 
POSSIBLY SLOWING FRONTAL PASSAGE. DRIED OUT THE AREA AGAIN FRI THRU 
SUN AS DRIER AIR ADVECTS INTO THE REGION WITH MOST OF THE ACTIVE WX 
OCCURRING E OF THE APPALACHIANS. GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO GFS MOS

THE WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSING EAST INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI

.SHORT TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL REMAIN. AREAS OF UPSLOPE CLOUDS PULLING 
NORTHWEST ACROSS THE CAROLINAS...BUT DOWNSLOPE INTO THE VALLEY WILL 
LIMIT CLOUDS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SOME PATCHY FOG AGAIN 
DEVELOPING...SOME MAY BE LOCALLY DENSE.

MOS GUIDANCE HAS BEEN TRENDING TOO COOL THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. 
BELIEVE DOWNSLOPE FLOW INTO THE VALLEY AND STILL RELATIVELY DRY 
GROUND...WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB NICELY AGAIN TODAY. WILL 
TREND TOWARD THE WARMER MET GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...PERSISTENT UPPER RIDGE HOLDS 
OVER THE EASTERN CONUS THROUGH MUCH OF EARLY WORK WEEK WHICH 
SUGGESTS A CONTINUATION OF THE WARM AND DRY WEATHER. LATEST MODEL 
RUNS DELAY PROGRESSION OF UPPER TROUGH/COLD FRONT UNTIL LATE 
THURSDAY NOW. HOWEVER...MOISTURE ADVECTION AROUND WESTERN PERIPHERY 
OF RIDGE KEEPS LOW CHANCE POPS FOR WEDNESDAY REASONABLE. TEMPS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THRU MONDAY)...MORNING LOW CLOUDS DISSIPATED
AND GAVE WAY TO DEVELOPING CUMULUS CLOUDS MAINLY OVER THE HIGHER
TERRAIN AREAS.  CONSIDERABLE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE/RH GENERALLY FROM
SFC TO 800 MB LEVEL...SO WOULD EXPECT SOME AMOUNT OF LOW CLOUDINESS
AGAIN OVERNIGHT.  FOG HAS BEEN ALMOST TOTALLY ABSENT ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA...BUT SEEMS REASONABLE TO KEEP PATCHY FOG IN THE
GRIDS MAINLY FOR VALLEY FOG LATE.  MOS MINS WERE ABOUT ONE CATEGORY
TOO HIGH LAST NIGHT...SO GIVEN THIS PLUS CURRENT DEW POINTS THINK
THAT GOING A LITTLE ABOVE GFS MINS LOOKS BEST.

FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...SHORTWAVE STILL EXPECTED TO MOVE
EAST ACROSS THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION...BUT MOST LIFT
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE (INCLUDING WEAK ISENTROPIC) SHOULD
STAY TO OUR W AND NW. WEAK UPSLOPE INTO SRN MTNS AND PLATEAU IS
NOTED...BUT CANT SEE MORE THAN A SPRINKLE OR TWO.  KEPT DRY
FORECAST FOR NOW PER CONSENSUS FROM NEIGHBORS.  STAYED CLOSE TO GFS
MOS FOR MAX TEMPS SUNDAY AND NEAR OR JUST ABOVE GFS FOR MINS.

MONDAY...AFTER SLIGHT DRYING SUNDAY NIGHT...EASTERLY FLOW DEEPENS
AND INCREASES OFF THE MID ATLANTIC BY MONDAY MORNING/AFTERNOON.
HOWEVER...DONT SEE THE NEED FOR RAIN CHANCES AT THIS POINT.
DOWNSLOPING EASTERLY WINDS COULD SEND MAX TEMPS TO NEAR THE WARMER
NAM MOS VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...LOTS OF ACTION WITH 
EASTERLY FLO AROUND THE BASE OF RIDGE BRINGING ATLANTIC MOISTURE 
ACROSS THE CAROLINAS EARLY IN THE PERIOD BUT THE EASTERLY FLO BRINGS 
ADIABATIC COMPRESSION WHICH LEADS TO WARMING AND DRYING ACROSS THE 
FA TUE AND TUE NITE. HOWEVER MOISTURE BECOMES DEEP ENOUGH ON WED 
AHEAD OF UPR TROF/CD FNT TO BRING A CHANCE FOR SHRA/TSRA. WITH BEST 
CHANCE WED NITE AS CD FNT SWINGS THRU THE FA. UPR FLO FLATTENS 
FAIRLY QUICKLY ON THU AND FNT SLOWS DOWN WITH WAVE DEVELOPING ON FNT 
S OF THE REGION. MAINTAINED SLGT/CHC TYPE POPS ON THU FOR POSSIBLE 
SLOWER MOVEMENT OF SFC FNT. KEPT REMAINDER OF FCST DRY.

MOS.  12Z OHX SOUNDING SHOWS THE GREATEST INCREASE IN PRECIPITABLE 
WATER (UP TO AROUND 1 INCH)...ALTHO RNK SOUNDING ALSO SHOWS THIS LOW

CAROLINAS. NAM DEPICTS THIS MOISTURE QUITE WELL WITH HIGH 850 AND 
925 MB RELATIVE HUMIDITY WRAPPING AROUND THE SPINE OF THE

SKIES FOR THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
MORNING...THEN GOING PARTLY CLOUDY. SOME PATCHY FOG NOTED AS WELL.

UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS KEEPING CONDITIONS DRY. 
MODELS SHOW 850-925 MB ADVECTING WEST AND NORTH OF THE AREA FOR 
TONIGHT ALLOWING SKIES TO BECOME CLEAR. NAM DEPICTS NEARLY SATURATED 
SURFACE RH FOR EARLY SUNDAY MORNING. GIVEN CLEAR SKY AND CALM 
WINDS...PATCHY FOG MAY BE A LITTLE MORE WIDESPREAD...ESPECIALLY THE 
FAVORED LAKES AND STREAMS DUE TO STEAM FOG DEVELOPMENT.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...DRY WEATHER PERSISTS THROUGH 
THE MIDDLE OF THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK AS UPPER RIDGE 
STRENGTHENS/AMPLIFIES OVER THE EASTERN CONUS. MAIN CHANCE OF PRECIP 
STILL ON TRACK FOR WEDNESDAY AS MOISTURE INCREASES IN ADVANCE OF

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SO FAR THIS AFTERNOON ONLY 
SCATTERED CUMULUS CLOUDS OVER SMOKIES AND SRN MTNS...AND LATELY A 
FEW OVER NE PARTS OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU.  FOR TONIGHT...EXPECT 
THESE CLOUDS TO GRADUALLY DISSIPATE WITH SOME RE-DEVELOPMENT OR 
ADVECTION POSSIBLE LATE TONIGHT FOR MAINLY SW NC AND SE TN AREAS.
FOG THIS MORNING WAS VERY LIMITED...SO DOWN PLAYED FOG A BIT TO JUST 
PATCHY VALLEY FOG.  DEW POINT TEMPS HAVE RISEN SLIGHTLY TODAY WHICH 
WOULD FAVOR THE GFS MOS OR BLEND WHERE MINOR DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED.

FOR SAT THRU SUN...MAIN ITEM OF CONCERN WAS HOW MUCH DO CLOUDS 
INCREASE FROM THE SE AND SW.  THE EAST TO SOUTHEAST FLOW IS 
INITIALLY VERY SHALLOW WITH 850 MB FLOW STAYING MORE SW EARLY.  SOME 
WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT GENERALLY LOOKS TO STAY PRIMARILY TO OUR S AND 
SW...SO DID NOT SEE THE NEED FOR ANY RAIN CHANCES OR EVEN DRIZZLE ON 
OUR SIDE OF THE MTNS.  WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT MAY EVENTUALLY BRUSH SE 
TN AREAS...BUT OVERALL FELT IT WAS WISE TO JUST SHOW A GRADUAL 
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER FOR NOW.  IF CLOUDS INCREASE BY SAT NIGHT
THEN I DID NOT SEE JUSTIFICATION TO INCLUDE ANY FOG IN THE FORECAST 
AT THIS POINT.  AS A SHORTWAVE LIFTS NE INTO THE MID/UPR MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY REGIONS ON SUNDAY...WOULD EXPECT MID TO HIGH CLOUDS TO ALSO 
SLOWLY APPROACH FROM THE WEST LATE SUN AFTERNOON.  THIS MADE ME 
FAVOR UNDERCUTTING GFS MOS MAX TEMPS A BIT ON SUN.  OTHERWISE...FOR 
SAT AND SAT NIGHT TRENDED TOWARD A MOS BLEND FOR TEMPS.  


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...RIDGING SFC AND ALOFT 
KEEPS THE FA CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY AND DRY DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 
THE PERIOD ALTHOUGH LOW LVL ELY FLO CONTINUES TO ADVECT ALANTIC 
MOISTURE ACROSS THE CAROLINAS WITH INCREASING DEPTH INTO WED WHICH 
SETS THE STAGE FOR THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN. USED SLGT CHC/CHC POPS 
FOR WED INCREASING TO LOW CHC POPS FOR THE MAIN EVENT WED NITE AS 
COLD FRONT APPROACHES. FROPA OCCURS AROUND 12-18Z THU SO TAPERED 
BACK POPS DURING THE DAY AND USED A DRY FCST FOR FRI. STAYED CLOSE

APPALACIANS WITH SURFACE RIDGING EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. NAM SHOWS 
A WEAK INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
TODAY HELPING TO POOL LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BACK INTO EAST TENNESSEE 
WITH SURFACE DEWPOINTS CLIMBING.  END RESULT WILL BE HIGHER MINS AND 
A GREATER POTENTIAL OF FOG DEVELOPMENT FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY

MORE CLOUD COVER ANTICIPATED FOR SATURDAY WITH INCREASING 
MOISTURE...ESPECIALLY FOR PLATEAU...SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE...AND 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA.

UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGE REMAINS OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FRIDAY
THROUGH SUNDAY KEEPING CONDITIONS DRY.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...SURFACE HIGH REMAINS
JUST OFF THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES WITH BOUNDARY LAYER EASTERLY WINDS
STRENGTHENING OVER THE SOUTHEAST.  THE EASTERLY BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW WILL
PULL MOISTURE INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...GENERALLY EAST OF THE
FORECAST AREA ACROSS THE CAROLINAS. DOWNSLOPING INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA...ESPECIALLY NORTH AND CENTRAL SECTIONS...WILL LIMIT BOUNDARY 
LAYER MOISTURE INTO FORECAST AREA INITIALLY. PLAN ON CALLING FOR CHANCE
OF SHOWERS FOR THE FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS...SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE...AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA BEGINNING TUESDAY.  ONLY ISOLATED
SHOWERS AT BEST FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA.

BY WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...A COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS
THE FORECAST AREA...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS AREA-WIDE FOR

PIEDMONT THIS AFTERNOON. SHOWERS PRETTY MUCH GONE AND CLOUDS ARE ON
THEIR WAY OUT. HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER MO WILL MOVE EAST AND BE
CENTERED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC REGION BY FRIDAY EVENING. THIS WILL BRING
OUR FIRST REAL TASTE OF FALL WX TO THE REGION. SKIES WILL CLEAR TONIGHT
AND A FEW SHELTERED AREAS MAY SEE PATCHY FOG...BUT NOTHING WIDESPREAD
WITH DRIER AIR AND SOME WINDS. TEMPERATURES WILL DIP INTO THE 40S MOST
AREAS TONIGHT. THIS TASTE OF FALL WX WILL BE BRIEF...RISING HEIGHTS WILL
BRING QUICK RETURN TO ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES OVER THE WEEKEND AND
THROUGH THE EXTENDED FORECAST.

MODELS SUGGEST SOME RETURN OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LATE FRIDAY THROUGH
THE WEEKEND. MOISTURE LOOKS RATHER SHALLOW...BUT MAY BE ENOUGH FOR
ISOLATED SHOWERS ESPECIALLY LATE SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AS A DISTURBANCE
MOVES FORM EAST TO WEST ACROSS THE REGION. APPEARS HIGHER RAIN CHANCES
WILL STAY TO OUR SOUTH AND WEST AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE FROM NEW
ENGLAND NOSES INTO OUR AREA.

NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN WILL ARRIVE LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AS ANOTHER
DISTURBANCE FROM THE EAST DRAWS ATLANTIC MOISTURE TOWARD THE AREA. RAIN
CHANCES WILL PEAK EARLY THURSDAY WITH THE PASSAGE OF A COLD FRONT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...A DISSIPATING BOUNDARY AND UPSLOPE
FLOW IS PRODUCING MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS
THE PLATEAU...SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE...AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA.  
MODEL SOUNDING SHOW PWS INCREASING OVERNIGHT WITH AMPLE MOISTURE AVAILABLE
FOR FROPA...AROUND 09-13Z TIME-FRAME. BEST DYNAMICS WITH UPPER TROUGH
SWING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES WILL BE NORTH OF THE 
REGION...HOWEVER...GOOD Q-VECTOR FORCING ALONG FRONT AS WELL AS MARGINAL
INSTABILITY. GIVEN STRENGTH OF FRONT...EXPECT NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND 
SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WITH FROPA.

HAVE INCREASED THE WINDS TO NEAR LAKE WIND ADVISORY LEVELS. BOTH THE
850 AND 925 MB WINDS INCREASED TO THE 20 TO 30 MPH LEVELS JUST BEFORE
AND AFTER FROPA.

NAM SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF WRAP-ARND COLD AIR ADVECTION STRATU-CU FOR
MOST OF THURSDAY WITH CLOUDS SCATTERING OUT ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST
HALF OF THE FORECAST DURING THE AFTERNOON. NORTHWEST FLOW AND LEFT
OVER MOISTURE WILL HELP KEEP A CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR FAR EASTERN 
TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THROUGH
THE EARLY AFTERNOON. ELSEWHERE...RAIN WILL BE OVER BY MID TO LATE
MORNING.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AFTER STRONG COLD 
FRONT PASSES THE ATMOSPHERE DRYS OUT CONSIDERABLY OVER THE WEEKEND.  
MODELS DO TRY TO DEVELOP WEAK E TO SE LOW LEVEL FLOW OVER THE 
WEEKEND...BUT I DID NOT SEE ENOUGH MOISTURE RETURN OR INSTABILITY TO 
JUSTIFY KEEPING LOW POPS IN FOR SAT NIGHT AND SUNDAY.  ALSO... 
CONSENSUS FROM NEIGHBORING OFFICES WAS TO GO DRY FOR THOSE PERIODS.
NOT GOOD AGREEMENT FROM MOS AS TO HOW MUCH MIN TEMPS FALL THU NIGHT 
OR RISE FRI...AND I GENERALLY FAVORED A BLEND OF THE NAM/GFS MOS.

WEATHER LOOKS TO STAY MAINLY DRY FOR EARLY TO MID NEXT WEEK AS 
RIDGING HOLDS ACROSS MOST OF EASTERN U.S.  SOME DEGREE OF UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGHING DOES DEVELOP ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES...AND GFS 
INDICATES POSSIBLE MOISTURE RETURN ON SE LOW LEVEL FLOW BY LATE 
WEDNESDAY.  ANOTHER FROPA POSSIBLE AS EARLY AS THURSDAY MORNING... 
THUS I HAVE INTRODUCED LOW POPS FOR SE TN AND THE ERN MTN ZONES FOR 
WEDS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  CAN ADJUST THIS EITHER WAY OVER THE

A FAIRLY DECENT COLD FRONT MOVING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE PLAINS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR ABOUT
DONE ADVECTING INTO AREA AS SURFACE HIGH SLIDES PAST US TO THE
NORTH. TIMING OF RETURN FLOW GOOD FOR FOG FORMATION TONIGHT IN
NORTHEASTERN SECTIONS AS MOIST ADVECTION STARTS UP ACROSS
RADIATIONALLY COOLED GROUND. TO THE SOUTHWEST SAME SITUATION
OCCURRING EXCEPT THAT FLOW AT TOP OF BOUNDARY LAYER MAY BE ALREADY A
LITTLE FAST TO ALLOW AS MUCH RADIATION COOLING. MAY BE QUITE THICK
IN LOCAL VALLEYS AND MINIMAL IN EXPOSED/ELEVATED AREAS.

HAVE GONE A LITTLE COOLER THAN PREVIOUS FORECAST IN NORTHEAST
TONIGHT DUE TO EXCELLENT RADIATIONAL SETUP. ALSO THINKING THAT
UPSLOPE FLOW IN OUR SW NC COUNTIES WILL FAVOR FOG DEVELOPMENT AS
WELL.

FOR WEDNESDAY...MOISTURE RETURNING BUT LOOKS LIKE DEEP CONVECTION
IS CAPPED FOR MOST OF AREA. AM INSERTING SOME SLGT POPS IN HIGHER
TERRAIN IN SRN APPS...OTHERWISE KEEPING DAYTIME DRY. ONLY MINOR
TWEAKING TO HIGH TEMPS. WITH EXPECTED FOG...HAVE SLOWER THAN NORMAL
DIURNAL WARMING IN HOURLY TEMP GRIDS. WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON OFFERS
THE HIGHEST COMBINATION OF LOWER RELATIVE HUMIDITY AND BREEZIER
WINDS IN A WHILE. 

.LONG TERM (WED NIGHT THROUGH TUE)...MOISTURE CONTINUES TO INCREASE
IN ADVANCE OF AN APPROACHING SHORT WAVE/SURFACE COLD FRONT. FRONT
STILL PROJECTED TO PASS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA EARLY THURSDAY.
NOT EXPECTING A MAJOR EVENT WITH THIS SYSTEM AS MOISTURE PROFILE
REMAINS RATHER UNIMPRESSIVE. NEVERTHELESS...SCATTERED CONVECTION
EXPECTED TO ACCOMPANY PASSAGE OF FRONT. COOLER...DRIER AIR MASS
ADVECTS INTO THE FORECAST AREA BEHIND FRONT. SOME CLEARING POSSIBLE
BY LATE THURSDAY WITH DRY AIR INTRUSION.

FURTHER OUT...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES BECOME INCREASINGLY DIVERGENT IN 
THEIR SOLUTIONS...THUS CONFIDENCE IS NOT ESPECIALLY HIGH. 
HOWEVER...GENERAL CONSENSUS DEPICTS UPPER RIDGE BUILDING BACK OVER 
VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE SOUTHERN TIER OF THE CONUS AS WELL AS 
AMPLIFYING INTO THE UPPER PLAINS. THIS SUGGESTS ANOTHER ROUND OF 
TEMPS WARMING TO WELL ABOVE CLIMO BY LATE IN THE UPCOMING WEEKEND

MID/UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE SUPPLYING REINFORCING SUPPORT FOR COOL
AIR PUSH. THIS EVENING DECIDED TO GO WITH JUST A FEW SHOWERS EARLY
AND SOME DRIZZLE LATER THIS EVENING...MAINLY NORTHEAST. ALSO HAVE
FOG IN GRIDS FOR LATE TONIGHT AS WINDS DECOUPLE. DIDNT THINK THAT
THE 06Z SHORT WAVE WOULD HAVE ENOUGH LIFT AND MOISTURE TO DO MUCH
MORE THAN HELP SOME DRIZZLE OR VERY LIGHT RAIN (TRACE AMOUNTS) FORM.
WITH NIGHTTIME LACK ON MIXING AND FAIRLY ROUGH TERRAIN...HAVE KEPT
WINDS FAIRLY LIGHT TONIGHT EXCEPT IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. LOW TEMPS
OVERNIGHT HAD JUST A FEW TWEAKS FROM CURRENT VALUES--GUIDANCE TEMPS
RIGHT IN LINE WITH THOSE NUMBERS AS WELL.


.LONG TERM (TUE THROUGH MON)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES REMAIN IN
REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE PERIOD. NEXT SIGNIFICANT
FEATURE IS SHORT WAVE/COLD FRONT COMBO WHICH TREKS THROUGH THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...MAIN FORECAST ISSUE FOR THE 
SHORT TERM REMAINS TIMING AND DEGREE OF IMPACT OF REMNANT MOISTURE 
FROM RITA FOR OUR FORECAST AREA. MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT WITH 
TIMING MAIN BAND OF MOISTURE...WHICH GETS CAUGHT UP BY AN UPPER 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH AND SURFACE COLD FRONT...INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY 
LATE FIRST PERIOD/EARLY SECOND PERIOD. DISAGREEMENT OCCURS MAINLY ON 
PRECIP AMOUNTS...WITH GFS PROJECTING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE QPF THAN 
NAM. SHORT-RANGE ENSEMBLES GENERALLY SUPPORT NAMS LOWER QPF...BUT 
INCLINATION IS TO COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO OPERATIONAL MODELS 
SINCE DOWNSLOPE EFFECT BECOMES LESS OF A FACTOR AS FLOW BECOMES MORE 
SOUTHWESTERLY IN NATURE. TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO COOL AS HEIGHTS FALL 
IN RESPONSE TO APPROACHING UPPER TROUGH.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUN)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT 
THAT BULK OF MOISTURE WILL BE TO OUR EAST BY MONDAY NIGHT AS SHORT 
WAVE MOVES ACROSS EARLY AND THEN EXITS...AND WEAK COLD FRONT PUSHES 
OFF TO OUR EAST.  WILL STILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS 
FOR EARLY MONDAY NIGHT. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE FORECAST TO BUILD IN FOR 
TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY. THEN A MORE SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT
FORECAST TO PUSH THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT OR EARLY THURSDAY.
MOISTURE LOOKS LIMITED WITH THIS SYSTEM...BUT STILL WILL CARRY
BRIEF PERIOD OF LOW CHANCE POPS EARLY THU...WITH SLIGHT CHANCE WED
NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE...AND MUCH COOLER AIR FORECAST TO PUSH INTO
THE AREA BEHIND THE FRONT. SHOULD BE DRY AND MORE FALL LIKE FOR
FRIDAY INTO SUNDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...MAIN FORECAST ISSUE IS 
WHEN/IF MOISTURE FROM RITA WILL PROGRESS EASTWARD FAR ENOUGH FOR 
PRECIP TO ENTIRE OUR FORECAST AREA IN THE SHORT TERM. DOMINANT UPPER 
RIDGE IS PROJECTED TO FINALLY MOVE EAST RESULTING IN FALLING HEIGHTS 
OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. 
MOISTURE FROM RITA IS PROJECTED TO GET PICKED UP BY ADVANCING TROUGH 
OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND SHUNTED EASTWARD. NAM AND GFS ARE 
SIMILAR WITH THIS PROCESS. ANTICIPATE PRECIP TO BEGIN TO INVADE OUR 
SOUTHWESTERN COUNTIES BY LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD...WITH DECREASING 
POPS TOWARD THE NORTHEAST. ALSO ANTICIPATE THAT STRENGTHENING 
SOUTHEASTERLY (DOWNSLOPE) FLOW WILL TEND TO INHIBIT PRECIP IN THE 
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEYS. TEMPS SHOULD BEGIN A COOLING TREND IN 
THE SECOND PERIOD WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED HEIGHT FALLS AND 
INCREASING CLOUDINESS. GENERALLY FAVORED GFS GUIDANCE VALUES HERE.

.LONG TERM...(SUN NIGHT THROUGH SAT)...LOOKING AT MODEL DATA...STILL
NOT REAL CLEAR ON THE DETAILS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE REMNANTS OF
RITA. LACK OF CONSISTENCY LENDS UNCERTAINTY...WILL GENERALLY GO
WITH A MODIFIED GFS SOLUTION...WHICH ALLOWS SOME MOISTURE TO SWING
ACROSS THE AREA MAINLY LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF
A WEAK COLD FRONT. WILL RAISE POPS TO HIGH CHANCE FOR MON AND MON
NIGHT. FOR LATER PERIODS...GENERALLY FOLLOWED HPC IDEA...BUT
BLENDED IN A BIT OF THE DRIER GFS SOLUTION FOR TUESDAY INTO WED. A

A FEW PATCHES OF HIGH CLOUDS ARE MOVING EAST JUST TO OUR NORTH

MUCH INTEREST OF COURSE WITH THE TRACK OF HURRICANE RITA AND ITS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...SURFACE ANALYSIS CURRENTLY 
DEPICTS A COLD FRONT STRETCHING FROM UPPER MIDWEST TO THE CENTRAL 
PLAINS. MODELS AND ENSEMBLES GENERALLY AGREE THAT THIS FEATURE WILL 
SLOWLY SINK INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY BY LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD. 
MAIN FORECAST ISSUE BECOMES WHETHER OR NOT THIS FRONT COMES CLOSE 
ENOUGH TO OUR NORTHERN TIER TO GENERATE ANY PRECIP BY LATE IN THE 
SHORT TERM. AT THIS TIME...AM INCLINED TO LEAVE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA 
DRY BASED ON THE DRY WEATHER REGIME THAT HAS BEEN EXPERIENCED ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS RECENTLY. FAR ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS ARE 
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TOMORROW...WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF THE 
NORTHERN TIER WHERE MORE CLOUD COVER MAY PREVENT TEMPS FROM CLIMBING 
QUITE AS MUCH.

.LONG TERM...(FRI NIGHT THROUGH THU)...CONFIDENCE STILL LOWER THAN 
AVERAGE FOR THE LONG TERM.  TRACK OF RITA STILL A SIGNIFICANT 
FACTOR...WITH THE RECENT TREND FURTHER EAST THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT 
SOME OUTER BANDS OF PRECIP COULD AFFECT OUR AREA BY SATURDAY.  
HOWEVER...FOLLOWING CURRENT OFFICIAL TRACK...WILL KEEP FRI NIGHT 
THROUGH SAT NIGHT DRY AS UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA SHIFTS EAST.

.DISCUSSION...EARLY THIS MORNING...PATCHY DENSE FOG AND LOW STRATUS
WERE DEVELOPING ACROSS SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA INTO PARTS OF THE FAR
EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS. OTHERWISE...MOSTLY CLEAR.

MODELS IN AGREEMENT WITH UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGING REMAINING IN PLACE
OVER THE SOUTHER APPALACHIANS TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY. A WEAK COLD
FRONT WILL TRY TO MOVE TOWARD THE AREA FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY
NIGHT...BUT WILL STALL NORTH OF THE REGION. EVEN THOUGH AIRMASS WILL
ONCE AGAIN BE QUITE UNSTABLE FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND THURSDAY AFTERNOON...
MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW A CONTINUED CAPPING INVERSION NEAR 700 MB WITH
A RELATIVELY DRY ATMOSPHERE (PWS 1-1.25 INCH). WILL CONTINUE WITH
DRY FORECAST THROUGH SUNDAY. 

AS HURRICANE RITA PUSHES INLAND ACROSS SOUTHEAST TEXAS AND FRONT
APPROACHES THE AREA FROM THE NORTHWEST. INCREASING HIGH AND MID-
LEVEL CLOUDS WILL INVADE THE TENNESSEE VALLEY SUNDAY AND SUNDAY
NIGHT. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION FOR MONDAY THROUGH
TUESDAY PROVIDING THE FORECAST AREA WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. BIG QUESTION FOR THE MEDIUM RANGE FORECAST INTO MID-WEEK
NEXT WEEK IS IF/HOW MUCH MOISTURE FOR RITA WILL MOVE INTO THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY.

FROPA FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO COME CLOSER TO 
MORE NORMAL READINGS FOR LATE SEPTEMBER. HOWEVER...RAINFALL AMOUNTS WITH
FRONT DOES NOT SEEM GENEROUS ENOUGH TO HELP MUCH WITH CURRENT DROUGHT/
FIRE DANGER CONDITONS OVER THE REGION.

GENERALLY NORTH OF AREA FRIDAY AND SATURDAY FOR NOW...ALLOWING IT TO 
BACKDOOR AREAS EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS BUT LEAVE OUR CWA WARM AND 
DRY.  ALSO NOT BUYING POPS IN NAM...FEELING THAT GFS HAS BETTER IDEA 
OF DEFLECTING MOST ORGANIZED POPS TO OUR NORTH.  WITH

.LONG TERM...(SUN THROUGH WED)...LOWER THAN AVERAGE CONFIDENCE FOR 
THE LONGER TERM...AS MODELS OFFER DIFFERING SOLUTIONS.  HAVE 
GENERALLY FOLLOWED HPC GUIDANCE...WHICH VARIES FROM THE WETTER GFS 
IDEA.  HPC SOLUTION HAS REMAINS OF RITA STALLING IN THE SOUTHERN

MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT.  WILL KEEP SUNDAY DRY FOR NOW...THEN SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS SUN NIGHT...CHANCE POPS MONDAY AND SLIGHT CHANCE

.DISCUSSION...
RIDGING SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL BE MAIN PLAYER IN THE FORECAST TODAY THROUGH
SATURDAY. MODEL SOUNDING DO SHOW A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS
TODAY AND FRIDAY WITH CAPES OF 2000-2500 J/KG...BUT ATMOSPHERE WILL
BE RELATIVELY DRY WITH PWS BETWEEN 1 AND 1.25 INCH. MOST IMPORTANTLY...
MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW A FAIRLY DECENT 700 MB INVERSION WHICH WILL
TEND TO CAP ANY THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT THE NEXT TWO DAYS.

THERE ARE SOME DISAGREEMENTS IN RESPECT TO FRONT PULLING SOUTH FROM
THE OHIO VALLEY TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY
TIME-FRAME. NAM IS MUCH MORE AGRESSIVE IN BRINGING A WEAK FRONT
INTO THE REGION ALONG WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. GFS
KEEPS THE CONVECTION TO OUR NORTH WITH WASHING OUT A FRONT JUST TO OUR
NORTH AND EAST. GIVEN THE PRESENT TREND OF MAINLY DRY WEATHER FOR
NEARLY A MONTH...WILL TEND TOWARD THE DRY SOLUTION AND KEEP POPS
OUT OF THE FORECAST.

NEXT BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT AS LATEST MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE SHOWING MOISTURE
FROM HURRICANE RITA (OVER TEXAS) PULLING EAST ALONG A COLD FRONT.
THIS FRONT IS SHOWN TO MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY AND
MONDAY NIGHT. HAVE INCREASED CLOUDS AND RAIN CHANCES FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY.

HAVE A GOOD DAY...

.SHORT TERM...   (TONIGHT THROUGH WENDESDAY)...
UPPER SHORTWAVE MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH AREA AT THIS TIME.  VORT 
CENTER NOW IN SWRN WV HAS LOBE ROTATING NW-SE THRU NE TN AND SW VA 
NOW SHOULD BE EAST OF FORECAST AREA BY 21Z.  SURFACE DEWPOINTS HAVE 
ENDED UP BEING FAIRLY DRY THIS AFTERNOON...THEREBY CUTTING DOWN ON 
INSTABILITY.  PLANNING TO GO WITH DRY FIRST PERIOD (<15% POPS) SINCE 
IT STARTS AT 22Z AND AFOREMENTIONED VORT LOBE EXITS BY 21Z.  (IF WE 
HAVE THIS MUCH DIFFICULTY GETTING STORMS TO FIRE IN CURRENT 
LIFT...CANT IMAGINE TOO MANY STORMS AFTER 22Z AS LIFT MOVES AWAY 
FROM AREA.)

EVEN THOUGH WE MAY HAVE WINDS VEER AROUND TO A NORTHERLY 
COMPONENT...THINK THIS IS A REFLECTION OF UPPER RIDGE MIXING DOWN 
NWLY WINDS RATHER THAN A FRONT.  WITH THIS SCENARIO...SHOULDNT BE 
MUCH IN THE WAY OF CONVERGENCE TONIGHT OR WEDNESDAY EITHER.  
DIFFERENT STORY EAST OF APPS WHERE FRONT BACKDOORS WELL INTO VA.  

HAVE COOLED OFF LOW TEMPS ABOUT 2-3 DEGREES FROM PREVIOUS RUN MAINLY 
DUE TO LOWER SURFACE DEWPOINTS.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE STILL 
IN CONTROL OF AREA WEATHER THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK.  AS SUCH... 
WILL CONTINUE TO SEE DRY CONDITIONS AND SEASONABLE WARM TEMPERATURES 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  POOR MODEL TO MODEL...AND RUN TO RUN 
CONSISTENCY FOR THE MONDAY/TUESDAY TIME FRAME.  MAIN CONCERN IS 
POSITION AND STRENGTH OF A FRONTAL BOUNDARY DROPPING IN FROM THE 
NORTH AND THE POTENTIAL OF THE REMNANTS OF A LOW COMING IN FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST.  FOR NOW...WILL CONTINUE WITH A 20 TO 30 POP FOR THIS

CURRENTLY...FAIRLY STRONG CONVECTION CONTINUES NEAR THE OHIO RIVER WITH
AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY HEADING SOUTH OVER SOUTHERN KENTUCKY.  FARILY STRONG
UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE ALOFT AND Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE OVER THE OHIO RIVER
VALLEY HAS KEPT STORMS GOING OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...MODELS SHOW BEST UPPER
DYNAMICS WITH PASSAGE OF UPPER SHORT-WAVE WILL REMAIN WELL NORTH OF THE
FORECAST AREA TODAY. WILL KEEP BEST POPS GOING FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
(AROUND 40 PERCENT) WITH LEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES (BELOW
20 PERCENT). NAM DOES SHOW AIRMASS MODERATELY UNSTABLE WITH CAPES
IN THE 1500-2000 J/KG RANGE THIS AFTERNOON...BUT MOISTURE REMAINS LIMITED.

MODELS SHOW FRONT MOVING INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY TODAY AND
TONIGHT BEFORE WASHING OUT. SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGING ONCE AGAIN
BECOMES THE MAJOR PLAYER FOR REST OF THE WEEK THROUGH THE WEEKEND.
MOSTLY DRY CONDITIONS AND CONTINUED UNSEASONABLY WARM WEATHER WILL
PREVAIL. EVEN THOUGH FALL OFFICIALLY STARTS THIS WEEK...
TEMPERATURES WILL BE FAR FROM AUTUMN LIKE. 

PERSISTENT DRY AND UNSEASONABLY WARM CONDITIONS COMBINED WITH
FALLING LEAVES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE CONCERN FOR FIRES
THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK AND BEYOND.

GFS AND NAM MODELS BRING FRONT INTO TN TUESDAY. THE BEST DYNAMICS 
STAY NORTH IN THE MID ATLANTIC AREA. WITH STRONG RIDGING FROM THE TN 
VALLEY SOUTH THE FRONT SHOULD WEAKEN AND POSSIBLY SLOW DOWN ITS 
SOUTHEAST PROGRESS. NAM IS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH POPS AND GFS A 
LITTLE SLOWER WITH BRINGING PRECIPITATION INTO THE AREA. SOUTHERN 
AREAS MAY NOT GET ANY MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION IF FRONT SLIDES EAST 
THROUGH THE TN VALLEY INTO NC LATE TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT. KEPT

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA
THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. MAIN FRONTAL PASSAGE AND ASSOCIATED
PRECIP SHOULD REACH INTO THE AREA TOWARDS MORNING...AND CONTINUE TO
MOVE THROUGH INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON HOURS. POPS WILL DECREASE BY
LATE AFTERNOON AS THE FRONT EXITS THE AREA.


.LONG TERM...DRIER AIR MOVES IN BEHIND FRONT FRIDAY EVENING
SILENCING CONVECTION. RETURN TO HIGH AND DRY WITH RETURN OF RIDGING
OVER EASTERN CONUS. TEMPS WILL MODERATE A LITTLE AS SLIGHTLY COOLER
AIR ADVECTS IN, BUT WILL WARM BACK UP TO ABOVE NORMAL BY EARLY PART
OF WEEK. HAVE INCREASED POPS MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY TO 10%
(FROM ZERO) DUE TO PASSAGE OF VERY WEAK FRONT AND ASSOCIATED
WEAKENING SHORT WAVE. MOST AREAS WILL SEE LITTLE RAIN WITH CURRENT
SYSTEM AND THEN WE GET A WEEK OF MORE DRYING. LOOKS LIKE IT COULD

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SUGGESTS THAT A WEAK COLD FRONT IS DRAPED ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY EXTENDING INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS BOUNDARY AND 
ASSOCIATED UPPER SHORT WAVE TROUGH IS PROJECTED TO MAKE ONLY SLOW 
PROGRESS TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AS UPPER RIDGE OVER THE

NOT ANTICIPATE ANY DRAMATIC CHANGES TODAY. THUS HAVE TENDED TO FAVOR 
DRIER GFS GUIDANCE POPS WHICH KEEPS FORECAST AREA MOSTLY DRY WITH 
THE EXCEPTION OF THE PLATEAU. MODEL TIME HEIGHTS DEPICT MOISTURE 
BECOMING DEEPER...ALBEIT STILL NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE...BY THE SECOND

STAYED CLOSE TO MOS BLEND CONCERNING TEMP FCST IN THE SHORT TERM. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODEL ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH DEVELOPING AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ACROSS THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY THURSDAY NIGHT IN RESPONSE TO AN UPPER TROUGH OVER THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL PUSH A COLD FRONT 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY AROUND 18Z. MODEL SOUNDINGS 
REVEAL ONLY A SHALLOW AND LIMITED LAYER OF MOISTURE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA ALONG THIS FRONT...SO THINK THAT ONLY SCATTERED 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WILL DEVELOP THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. THUS... 
ONLY A FEW LOCATIONS SHOULD EXPERIENCE MUCH RAIN WITH THIS COLD 
FRONT.

.DISCUSSION...OUTFLOW BOUNDARY EVIDENT IN SAT/RADAR IMAGERY EARLIER 
THIS MORNING PROGRESSING E ACROSS MID TN APPEARS TO HAVE WEAKENED 
SUFFICIENTLY AS IT PRESSED INTO STABLE AIRMASS ACROSS THE EASTERN 
PORTION OF THE STATE. SOME CI AND AC ACROSS EXTREME NE TN AND A 
SMALL PART OF EXTREME SW VA. BUT EXPECT THE BALANCE OF THE DAY IN 
THIS AREA SHOULD BE JUST PARTLY CLOUDY. FEEL INCREASING CLOUDS A 
LITTLE TOO PESSIMISTIC A FCST HERE. WILL KEEP THE INCREASING CLOUDS 
IN THE OTHER ZONES BUT WILL UPDATE TO USE PARTLY CLOUDY FOR NE TN 
AND WILL REMOVE TREND WORDING FOR WIND SPEED AND DIRECTION.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODEST CHANGES IN STORE BY THE 
END OF THE SHORT TERM PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE DATA AS UPPER TROUGH 
APPROACHES THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FROM THE WEST. ATMOSPHERE 
BECOMES INCREASINGLY MOIST AS UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES WITH PW VALUES 
INCREASING FROM LESS THAN AN INCH EARLY IN THE FIRST PERIOD TO 
NEARLY 1.75 INCHES BY LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD PER MODEL SOUNDINGS. 
HOWEVER...ANY PRECIP EXPECTED TO BE WIDELY SCATTERED AS UPPER RIDGE 
HOLDS ON OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS. APPEARS BEST CHANCE WILL BE ON 
NORTHERN PLATEAU AND HAVE INTRODUCED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THAT 
AREA IN THE SECOND PERIOD. TEMPS AGAIN WILL AVERAGE WELL ABOVE 
CLIMATOLOGY. A BLEND OF GUIDANCE VALUES AND PERSISTENCE WAS 
GENERALLY USED.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SLIGHT MODEL DIFFERENCES 
NOTED BETWEEN GFS AND NAM WITH THE FRONTAL SYSTEM THAT AFFECTS THE 
REGION INTO FRIDAY EVENING.  NAM HAS A MORE AMPLIFIED SHORTWAVE 
TROUGH AND DEVELOPS MORE ORGANIZED CONVECTION AND HEAVIER RAINS...
WHILE GFS SOLUTION HAS A WEAKER LESS AMPLIFIED SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
(LEADING TO BEST DYNAMICS AND VORTICITY JUST TO OUR NORTH) AND 
A MORE RANDOM AND LIGHTER CONVECTIVE PCPN PATTERN.  TENDING TO FAVOR 
THE GFS SOLUTION AT THIS POINT...AND ALSO FELT THAT ENOUGH RIDGING 
WILL HOLD INTO THURSDAY NIGHT TO KEEP CONVECTIVE PCPN SUPPRESSED A 
BIT.  BEST RAIN CHANCES LOOK TO COME INTO NE PLATEAU AND SWRN VA 
VERY LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY DAYTIME...THEN PERHAPS SOME 
LINGERING SCATTERED CONVECTION AT LEAST FOR FRIDAY EVENING.

ONLY MINOR CHANGES MADE TO THE ASSOCIATED GRIDS FOR THE PERIODS 
NOTED ABOVE...AND ALSO ADDED NEW DAY 7 (WEDS) PRELIMINARY GRIDS.
OTHERWISE...JUST MINOR TEMP ADJUSTMENTS IN LINE WITH 14/00Z MOS 
GUIDANCE.  RAINS ON THU AND FRI WILL BE THE FIRST MEASURABLE PCPN 
FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER...FOLLOWED BY SEVERAL DAYS OF MORE DRY 
WEATHER.  QUITE A DRY SEPTEMBER IN THE MAKING.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO 
DOMINATE THE WEATHER PATTERN OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS...HOWEVER A 
WEAKENING WILL BEGIN TO OCCUR BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON.  THE BIGGEST 
HINDRANCE TO PRECIPITATION IS THE EXCESSIVE DRYNESS IN THE LOWER 
LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE.  IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO MOISTEN UP 
THESE LEVELS...SO HAVE HELD BACK ON ANY MENTION OF RAIN IN THE 24 
HOUR PERIOD.  TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN ON THE WARM SIDE UNTIL BEYOND 
24 HOURS.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS BRINGING 
FRONT INTO REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  LOW LEVELS WILL STILL BE 
DRY...SO THINK THE ONSET OF PRECIP WILL BE DELAYED...WILL LEAVE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT DRY FOR NOW.  MOISTURE WILL INCREASE BY THURSDAY... 
WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR BOTH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WITH FROPA... 
BEST CHANCES SHOULD BE THURSDAY NIGHT.  SOME INSTABILITY EXPECTED... 
SO WILL KEEP THUNDER IN THE FORECAST FOR BOTH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.  
DRIER WEATHER RETURNS FRIDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
ONLY THE EVENING HOURS.  RIDGE BUILDS IN FOR THE WEEKEND...WILL KEEP 
DRY WEATHER FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY.  GFS INDICATING A WEAK 
FRONT MOVING THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...BEST MOISTURE STAYING NORTH... 
SO WILL CONTINUE THE DRY FORECAST FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY... 
BUT A FEW MORE CLOUDS EXPECTED WITH THE FRONT.  MEX GUIDANCE 
TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE...DIDNT STRAY TOO FAR.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES DEPICT 
UPPER RIDGE AXIS REMAINING OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH 
THE SHORT TERM...SIGNIFYING A CONTINUATION OF THE DRY WEATHER 
PATTERN. UPPER TROUGH/SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE 
NORTHWEST BY LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD. NEVERTHELESS...EFFECTS FROM 
THIS FEATURE NOT ANTICIPATED THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. GUIDANCE TEMPS 
GENERALLY AGREE WELL WITH PERSISTENCE AND HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED CLOSELY 
FOR THE MOST PART.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...ONLY MINOR CHANGE MADE 
EARLY IN THE LONG TERM PERIODS WAS TO ADD SLIGHT CHANCE POPS WEDS 
NIGHT FOR NE PLATEAU AND LEE/WISE COUNTIES OF SW VA.  THIS WAS FOR 
THE POSSIBILITY OF PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION...ALTHO HAVE A STRONG 
FEELING THAT GFS AND NAM MAY BOTH BE OVER DOING THE DEVELOPMENT AND 
EXTENT OF CONVECTION IN ADVANCE OF THE WEAK COLD FRONT.  THERE IS 
STILL SOME LINGERING RIDGING ALOFT ACROSS OUR REGION WEDS NIGHT INTO 
EARLY THU...AIDED SOMEWHAT BY OUR AREA BEING ON THE WRN SIDE OF 
OPHELIA.  ANY LINGERING SUBSIDENCE ALOFT PLUS ONLY MARGINAL 
INSTABILITY SHOULD WORK TO SUPPRESS CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT.  

JUST CHECKED THE CLIMATE BOOKS AND APPEARS NO RAIN HAS FALLEN FOR 
THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...WHICH HAS US 
RUNNING FROM ABOUT 1.20 TO 1.75 INCHES BELOW NORMAL RAINFALL FOR THE 
MONTH.  MORE REASONS TO AT LEAST INITIALLY BE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT 
SIGNIFICANT RAINS WITH THE APPROACHING WEAK COLD FRONT.

OTHERWISE...STILL ACCEPTING A FRONTAL PASSAGE FRIDAY NIGHT AND A 
RETURN OF DRY WEATHER (SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPS?) FOR THE WEEKEND.  
SOME PRELIMINARY GRIDS MADE FOR NEW DAY SEVEN (TUESDAY).

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEATHER PATTERN LOOKS TO REMAIN 
VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED FROM THE WEEKEND...WITH LARGE RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE DOMINATING AT ALL LEVELS OVER THE TN AND OHIO VALLEY 
REGIONS.  HURRICANE OPHELIA ALSO CONTINUES TO SPIN OFF THE SC/NC 
COASTS WITH A SLOW WESTWARD DRIFT. 

A FEW PATCHES OF MID DECK CLOUD PASSING OVERHEAD...AND VERY LIKELY 
SOME AREAS OF HAZE WHICH HAVE TRANSITIONED TO FOG...ESPECIALLY NEAR 
BODIES OF WATER IN THE VALLEYS.  HAVING PERSONALLY ENCOUNTERED SOME 
OF THIS VALLEY FOG NEAR NORRIS LAKE AFTER SUNRISE SATURDAY MORNING 
...I DECIDED TO INCLUDE SOME PATCHY VALLEY FOG FOR THIS MORNING.   

ANOTHER WARM AND DRY DAY IN STORE...WITH DRY GROUND HELPING TO 
CREATE A LARGE DIURNAL RANGE FROM THIS MORNINGS MIN TEMPS TO 
AFTERNOON HIGHS.  PREVIOUS MAX TEMP GRID AND MOS FOR A FEW SPOTS 
LOOKED A BIT LOW...SO NUDGED VALUES BACK TO AROUND SUNDAYS HIGHS.
MY FORECASTED HIGHS WONT BE NEAR RECORD HIGHS FOR THIS DATE.  
DEW POINT TEMPS HAVE CREPT UPWARDS SLIGHTLY...AND GENERALLY FOUND 
MOS BLEND ACCEPTABLE FOR LOWS TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MOSTLY SUNNY WITH ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES TUESDAY AS UPPER RIDGE STILL IN PLACE. HURRICANE 
OPHELIA IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO SPIN OFF THE SOUTH CAROLINA 
COAST. WEDNESDAY OPHELIA BEGINS TO MOVE TOWARDS THE COAST OF NORTH 
CAROLINA. AT THE SAME TIME THE RIDGE BEGINS TO BE PUSHED SOUTH AND 
EAST AS A COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE MID MS VALLEY AHEAD OF A 
DEEPENING TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN TWO THIRDS OF THE COUNTRY. KEPT 
TEMPERATURES SIMILAR TO MONDAYS THROUGH MID-WEEK. CLOUDS AND 
MOISTURE INCREASE LATE WEDNESDAY AHEAD OF THE FRONT MOVING INTO THE 
LOWER MS AND TN VALLEYS. THE BEST DYNAMICS STAY TO THE WEST 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY AS FRONT HAS A HARD TIME PUSHING SOUTH 
DUE TO RIDGE SETTLING ALONG GULF COAST. A STRONG SHORTWAVE MOVES 
ALONG FRONT AND THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. 
THIS MAY BE THE BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN EAST TN HAS HAD IN TWO WEEKS 
ALTHOUGH DID NOT INCREASE RAIN CHANCES YET AS TIMING IS STILL 
UNCERTAIN. FRONT MOVES SOUTH OF TN FRIDAY NIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS IN FROM THE NORTH. IT LOOKS LIKE A NICE DROP IN TEMPERATURES 
WITH HIGHS ONLY IN THE 70S TO LOWER 80S.

SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY BUT SHOULD BRING ONLY A FEW 
MID AND HIGH CLOUDS TODAY. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING OVER THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS 
SLOWLY MOVING INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
THIS AFTERNOON. VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW SOME LOW LEVEL 
CLOUDINESS WITH MOISTURE POOLING AHEAD OF THE FRONT. MAIN CONCERN 
TONIGHT AND SATURDAY IS TEMPERATURES. WITH LOWER DEWPOINTS MOVING IN 
FROM THE NORTHWEST IT WILL FEEL EVEN MORE COMFORTABLE SATURDAY. 
STATIONS IN SE KY HAVE A NW WIND OF ABOUT 10 MPH RIGHT NOW SO THERE 
MAY BE A NORTHERLY WIND BEHIND THE FRONT FOR A FEW HOURS TONIGHT. 
BELIEVE TEMPERATURES SHOULD DROP A FEW DEGREES BELOW THIS MORNINGS 
LOWS IN THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S. HIGHS SATURDAY SHOULD BE SIMILAR 
TO TODAYS WITH MORE SUN AND DRY AIR OFFSETTING THE COOLER START.  

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...QUIET WEATHER PATTERN 
REMAINS IN PLACE THROUGH THE EXTENDED WITH HIGH PRESSURE AT THE 
SURFACE AND ALOFT.  RESULTING NORTHERLY FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO PULL 
IN DRY AND STABLE AIR.  MODELS INDICATE A COUPLE OF WEAK IMPULSES IN 
THE UPPER FLOW DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT THESE SHOULD HAVE 
LITTLE EFFECT ON AREA WEATHER...EXCEPT FOR A FEW CLOUDS.  SO WILL 
KEEP FORECAST DRY THROUGH THE PERIOD.  MINOR COOLING ALOFT WILL 
TRANSLATE TO SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPS AND WILL STAY NEAR GUIDANCE.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS THE CENTER OF THE REMNANTS OF KATRINA

SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL THAT CLOUDS ARE GRADUALLY DECREASING FROM 
THE SOUTHWEST AS DRIER AIR FILTERS INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY. THIS 
DRIER AIR...COMBINED WITH A STRONG CAPPING INVERSION ALOFT...SHOULD 
LIMIT ANY POSSIBLE RAIN WITH A SHORT WAVE THAT IS PROGGED TO SWING

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
340 AM EDT TUE AUG 30 2005

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS THE CENTER OF TROPICAL STORM KATRINA 
NEAR TUPELO MISSISSIPPI WITH WINDS AROUND 30 TO 35 MPH GUSTING TO 45 
MPH BEING REPORTED AROUND NORTHERN MS AND WEST TN. THE CENTER OF 
KATRINA APPEARS TO BE MOVING A LITTLE FASTER AND LITTLE FARTHER EAST 
THAN EARLIER FORECASTED...AND THE 00Z MODEL RUNS HAVE INITIALIZED 
AROUND 30 MILES TOO FAR SOUTH OF THE ACTUAL CENTER. THUS...WILL 
TREND THE FORECAST TOWARD A FASTER OVERALL MOVEMENT OF THIS SYSTEM 
COMPARED TO THE MODELS AND PREVIOUS FORECAST. OVERALL..THE MODELS 
APPEAR TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE DETAILS OF KATRINA FOR THE 
FORECAST AREA THROUGH TONIGHT. SURFACE WINDS ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND 
NORTHERN VALLEY AREAS CONTINUE TO BE LIGHT THIS MORNING...BUT VAD 
WIND PROFILES FROM KMRX AND KHTX INDICATE WINDS OF 30 TO 40 KNOTS 
AROUND 3000 FT AGL. WINDS AT CHA AND CSV INCREASED TO AROUND 20 MPH 
WITH GUSTS UP TO 30 MPH AS THE RAIN BANDS MOVED THROUGH AND LOWERED 
THE STRONGER WINDS ALOFT. WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE THE LAKE WIND 
ADVISORY TODAY AND MENTION THAT THE STRONGEST WINDS WILL BE REACHED 
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND IN THE VALLEY AREAS DURING THE 
STRONGER RAIN BANDS.

WILL CONTINUE THE FLOOD WATCH FOR THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SOUTHEAST 
TN AND SOUTHWEST NC THROUGH TONIGHT...WHERE RAIN COULD BE HEAVY AT 
TIMES. SATELLITE IMAGES AND REGIONAL RADAR MOSAICS REVEAL DRIER AREA 
CIRCULATING AROUND THE WESTERN AND SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE CENTER OF 
KATRINA...SO THINK THAT RAIN WILL RAPIDLY DIMINISH IN COVERAGE 
BEGINNING THIS AFTERNOON AND BECOME MAINLY SCATTERED IN NATURE BY 
TONIGHT. HOWEVER...HEAVY RAIN WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE WITH SOME OF 
THESE SHOWERS UNTIL THE SYSTEM COMPLETELY EXITS THE AREA TONIGHT. 
WITH A STRONG SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW...THINK A STRONG UPSLOPE/DOWNSLOPE 
COMPONENT TO THE RAINFALL WILL CONTINUE TODAY...BUT SLOWLY END 
TONIGHT AS WINDS SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST WITH KATRINA MOVING NORTH OF 
THE REGION. THIS SOUTHERLY FLOW SHOULD CREATE STRONG DOWNSLOPE FLOW 
ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY AREAS TODAY...WHICH SHOULD 
NOTICEABLY LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF RAINFALL IN THESE AREAS. A SHORT WAVE 
THEN ROTATES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BEHIND KATRINA ON WEDNESDAY... 
PRODUCING A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS. AS WITH MOST 
TROPICAL SYSTEMS...INSTABILITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE WEAK THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY...AND WILL PLAN TO MENTION MAINLY SHOWERS WITH SCATTERED 
TSTORMS. IN ADDITION...STRONG HELICITY VALUES ARE PROGGED TO MOVE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...SO THINK THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF 
ISOLATED WEAK TORNADOES FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA.

ONCE PAST WEDNESDAY...MOSTLY CLEAR AND DRY CONDITIONS RETURN WITH 
NEAR NORMAL TEMPS.

TSTMS WILL CONTINUE TO SPIRAL ARND THE LOW CNTR. THESE BANDS WILL 
BEGIN AFFECTING THE MRX CWA TONIGHT AND CONTINUE THROUGH TUESDAY. 
THE EARLIEST FLOOD THREAT WILL BE FOR SW NC WHERE THE UPSLOPE FLOW 
WILL LIKELY RESULT IN WIDESPREAD LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. LLVL WIND 
PROFILES ARE SLIGHTLY FAVORABLE FOR TORNADO DEVELOPMENT TNGT AND 
EARLY TUE. MAINLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE MRX CWA. THIS 
THREAT WILL DIMINISH ON TUE AS THE LOW CENTER MOVES NORTH AND LOCAL 
SFC WINDS BECOME SWRLY. DOWNSLOPE FLOW WILL BE A MAJOR PLAYER IN 
RESULTING PCPN AMOUNTS BUT AREAS OUTSIDE THE NORTHERN VALLEY WILL BE 
VULNERABLE TO FLOODING.

1015 AM EDT MON AUG 29 2005

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. CURRENT FLOOD WATCHES BEST APPROACH 
TO HANDLE EXPECTED RAINFALL TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. WINDS FOR TNGT WILL 
BE MONITORED FOR POSSIBLE UPWARD ADJUSTMENT...MAINLY ACROSS HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. FOR TODAY...CLOUDY CONDITIONS WITH WIDESPREAD MAINLY 
LIGHT RAINFALL. MAX TEMPS ON THE COOL SIDE OF THE MOS BLEND ALSO 
APPEARS A GOOD CHOICE. 

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION

SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS THE CENTER OF HURRICANE KATRINA NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER...WITH THE LATEST TPC FORECAST TRACK CONTINUING TO 
BRING THE REMNANTS INTO WESTERN MIDDLE TN BY SUNRISE TUESDAY 
MORNING. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE TRACK AND INTENSITY 
OF THE STORM...WITH KATRINA EXPECTED TO BE A TROPICAL STORM WITH 
WINDS AROUND 45 MPH AS IT ENTERS MIDDLE TN. RIGHT NOW...IT APPEARS 
THAT WINDS WILL BE BREEZY ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN (ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS)...BUT THEY SHOULD REMAIN WITHIN WIND ADVISORY 
CRITERIA LATE TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING. SINCE WINDS WILL NOT 
RISE INTO ADVISORY CRITERIA UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...WILL HOLD 
OFF ON ISSUING A WIND ADVISORY FOR NOW. MODELS INDICATE THAT A 
DEFORMATION ZONE WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY TODAY AHEAD 
OF KATRINA...WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN A GOOD CHANCE FOR SHOWERS ACROSS 
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. AS WITH MOST TROPICAL SYSTEMS... 
INSTABILITY WILL BE WEAK AND WILL PLAN TO MENTION MAINLY SHOWERS 
WITH SCATTERED TSTORMS THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A 
FLOOD WATCH FOR THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST 
NC...WHERE RAIN COULD BE HEAVY AT TIMES TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY 
NIGHT. UPSLOPE FLOW FROM THE STRONG SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL LIKELY 
PRODUCE SOME LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND 
EXTREME SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. THIS SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL ALSO 
CREATE STRONG DOWNSLOPE FLOW ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY 
AREAS...WHICH SHOULD NOTICEABLY LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF RAINFALL IN 
THESE AREAS. THUS...WILL NOT INCLUDE THESE AREAS IN THE FLOOD WATCH. 
IN ADDITION...STRONG HELICITY VALUES ARE PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY...SO THINK THERE WILL BE A 
CHANCE OF ISOLATED WEAK TORNADOES FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE IN FORECAST. 
EXPECT KATRINA TO MOVE OUT TO THE NORTHEAST PER GFS AND LEAVE OPEN 
H5 WAVE IN PLACE WHICH HAS A PRETTY STRONG DRY SLOT BEHIND IT. SOME 
COOLING AS TROF CROSSES THE AREA THROUGH THE PERIOD. EVEN ON 
WEDNESDAY WITH TAIL END OF KATRINA EXPECT CHANCE OF STORMS AND 
SHOWERS TO DIMINISH AS SYSTEM MOVES NORTHEAST. HAVE CHANGED WORDING 
FROM COVERAGE TO CHANCES TO REFLECT LESS LIKELIHOOD AND FAIRLY RAPID 
MOVEMENT OF SYSTEM OUT OF AREA. ONCE PAST THURSDAY, EXPECT SUNNY AND 
SOME RETURN TO WARMER TEMPS.

EVENING. AS DAYTIME HEATING RAISED TEMPERATURES TO THE UPPER 80S 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FORMED IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE 
APPALACHIANS EAST OF MRX AND THEN MOVED NORTH NORTHEAST ACROSS NE TN 
AND INTO SW VA. WEAK BOUNDARY OVER THE OHIO VALLEY ENHANCED 
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY ACROSS KY AND MIDDLE TN. THIS CONVECTION 
SPREAD ONTO THE NORTHERN PLATEAU THIS EVENING. SOME TRAINING HAS 
OCCURRED WITH HEAVY RAIN ACROSS SCOTT AND CAMPBELL COUNTIES. THINK 
CONVECTION WILL DIMINISH SOON WITH LOSS OF HEATING SO WILL GRADUALLY 
LOWER POPS NORTH AND NORTHWEST. MAIN AREA OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WITH KATRINA WILL MOVE NORTH ACROSS AL AND GA TONIGHT 
BUT NOT EXPECTED TO AFFECT SE TN UNTIL MONDAY. NEXT SHIFT MAY NEED

332 PM EDT SUN AUG 28 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...MAIN STORY IS OF
COURSE THE APPROACH OF POWERFUL HURRICANE KATRINA TOWARD THE LA/MS
COASTS. DISCARDED THE NAM MODEL AS IT WAS SOLE OUTLIER FROM THE
REST OF MODELS WHICH CLOSELY RESEMBLED THE OFFICIAL NHC TRACK. GFS
MODEL WAS VERY CLOSE AND FOLLOWED FOR THE MOST PART...ESPECIALLY IN
TIMING THE ONSET OF CONVECTIVE PCPN AND STRONG SE WINDS FOR MAINLY
JUST OUR SRN AND WRN MOST PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. STUDIED THE
NWS DIRECTIVES AND THOUGHT BRIEFLY ABOUT ISSUING AN INLAND TROPICAL
STORM/WIND WATCH FOR LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. THIS IS A
VIABLE PRODUCT FOR US...BUT SINCE WIND SPEEDS SEEM TO BE JUST
GETTING INTO THE UPPER ENDS OF A WIND ADVISORY AT THIS TIME...OPTED
TO FOLLOW-UP OUR SPS AND INCREASE WIND SPEEDS AND GUSTS FOR SE TN...
NE PLATEAU...SMOKIES AND SW NC AREAS FOR NOW.

INCREASED POPS GENERALLY FROM MONDAY AFTERNOON INTO TUESDAY NIGHT
IN LINE WITH GFS...BUT DID TRY TO CARRY LOWER POPS AND QPF WHERE I
FEEL THAT THOSE STRONG SE WINDS WILL KEEP SOME DOWNSLOPE EFFECTS
GOING AT LEAST INITIALLY.  MODIFIED HPC QPF GRIDS A BIT.  

OTHERWISE...FOR TONIGHT...BEST COVERAGE SO FAR OF DEVELOPING
CONVECTION IS MIDDLE TN NEAR THE WEAK FRONT...AND ACROSS SE TN AND
SW NC. MOVEMENT IS SLOWLY NORTH. KEPT THE PREVIOUS LOOK OF GRIDS
WITH CHANCE POPS FOR SRN AND WRN AREAS EARLY TONIGHT AND SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS ELSEWHERE.

GFS MODEL AND MOS LOOKED GOOD...SO DID NOT STRAY FAR FROM GFS MOS
TEMPS. 


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...REMNANTS OF KATRINA WILL
BE EXITING AT A MODERATE PACE NORTHEAST AWAY FROM THE FA ON WED
WITH TROF SWINGING EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS DURING THE DAY. A
GRADATION OF LIKELY POPS NRN SECTIONS TO LOWER CHC POPS SOUTHERN
SECTIONS SHOULD SUFFICE FOR THE END OF KATRINAS EFFECTS ON THE FA.
HOWEVER WILL STILL CARRY A SLGT CHC POP ACROSS THE NRN/CNTRL MTNS
WED NIGHT FOR POSSIBILITY OF SOME WEAK UPSLOPE WITH TRAILING
MOISTURE ALIGNED WITH TROF. KEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE FCST DRY AS
NW FLO BUILDS IN ALOFT AND SFC HI PRES STRENGTHENS OVR THE ERN U.S.

.DISCUSSION...MUCH TIME SPENT MONITORING HURRICANE KATRINA 
DEVELOPMENTS AND WORKING AROUND DATABASE PROBLEMS.  FORTUNATELY 
TODAYS FORECAST APPEARS ON TRACK WITH A FEW AREAS OF LOW CLOUDS AND 
FOG HAVING ALMOST DISSIPATED ACROSS THE REGION.  THE WEAK COLD FRONT 
DOES NOT SEEM TO BE MUCH OF A FACTOR (NOTING THAT IT DID LITTLE TO 
ENHANCE OR FOCUS CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT YESTERDAY)...SO THE 20-30 
PERCENT POPS LOOK FINE FOR THIS AFTERNOON.  CLOUDS AROUND EARLY 
TODAY SHOULD LIMIT HOW HIGH MAX TEMPS REACH AND ALSO KEEP 
INSTABILITY DOWN.

CONCERNING HURRICANE KATRINA...JUST LISTENED TO THE 10 AM EDT 
CONFERENCE CALL.  MOST MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH LITTLE CHANGES 
EXPECTED ON THE LATEST TRACK.  OF THE SHORT RANGE MODELS THE NAM 
(FORMERLY KNOWN AS ETA) SEEMS TO HAVE THE POOREST TRACK AND WONT BE 
FOLLOWED.  HOWEVER...MAY CONSIDER INCREASING WIND SPEEDS FOR SE TN 
AND SW NC AREAS STARTING MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY.  WOULD PREFER TO 
LOOK OVER MODEL DATA AND COORDINATE WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES BEFORE 
ISSUING ANY TYPE OF WIND WATCH AT THIS POINT.  THANKS TO HUNTSVILLE 
FOR EARLIER COORDINATION CALL.

WILL FRESHEN UP THE GRIDS AND WEB PRODUCTS...AND ALSO AT LEAST 
REMOVE THE AFTERNOON WORDING FROM THE ZFPMRX.

313 AM EDT SUN AUG 28 2005

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING ALONG THE EAST COAST WITH ANOTHER WEAK COLD 
FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THIS COLD FRONT SHOULD SLOWLY 
MOVE TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...BUT WILL LIKELY WASH-OUT AS 
IT MOVES INTO THE AREA THIS EVENING. MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE 
ONLY A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIRMASS DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON...SO WILL MENTION ONLY ISOLATED CONVECTION WITH A 
LITTLE BETTER COVERAGE EXPECTED ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC 
WHERE MOISTURE IS A LITTLE DEEPER. SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT COMBINED 
WITH INCREASING MOISTURE AHEAD OF KATRINA MAY PRODUCE SOME SHOWERS 
TOWARDS SUNRISE TOMORROW...SO WILL LEAVE POPS IN THE FORECAST 
THROUGHOUT TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...TODAY SHOULD BE WARMER THAN 
YESTERDAY WITH SOME MORE SUNSHINE EXPECTED...AND WILL PLAN TO FOLLOW 
CLOSE TO THE GFS MOS NUMBERS.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MAIN FORECAST ISSUE FOR THE 
LONG TERM CONTINUES TO BE TRACK AND TIMING OF KATRINA. LATEST NAM 
AND GFS STILL SHOWING SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITH NAM PROJECTING A 
MORE EASTERLY TRACK. GFS SIMILAR TO OFFICIAL TRACK AND RECEIVES 
SUPPORT FROM SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLES. THUS...GFS WILL BE MAIN SOURCE 
OF GUIDANCE. TIME HEIGHTS DEPICT DEEP MOISTURE PROFILE AS KATRINA 
APPROACHES WITH PW VALUES APPROACHING TWO INCHES. HOWEVER...STRONGLY 
DOWN-SLOPING FLOW SUGGESTS QPF VALUES WILL BE HELD DOWN SOMEWHAT 
OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA. NEVERTHELESS...HIGH POPS APPEAR 
APPROPRIATE AND HAVE BUMPED UP POPS SLIGHTLY FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY AREA-WIDE. REMAINDER OF LONG TERM CHARACTERIZED BY TROUGH 
OVER THE EASTERN CONUS WITH NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT PREDOMINATING 
OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. GENERALLY DRY WEATHER PROJECTED AT 
THIS POINT...WITH TEMPS NEAR CLIMO.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...NOT IMPRESSED WITH 
CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL THIS LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH SO FAR 
JUST A NARROW BAND OF PRE-FRONTAL PCPN NOTED.  IN SPITE OF BEST 
INSTABILITY ACROSS MIDDLE TN...SO FAR LITTLE DEVELOPMENT NOTED.  
DECIDED TO RE-DRAW THE POP/WX GRIDS AND JUST PAINT IN CHANCE POPS 
WRN AREAS AND SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ERN AREAS FOR TONIGHT.  TAPERED 
POPS OFF TO LOW SLIGHT CHANCE EVERYWHERE AFTER MIDNIGHT...AND ALSO 
DROPPED THE MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS.

FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...DID NOT SEE MUCH FOCUS FOR CONVECTION
SO UNDERCUT MOS POPS.  HOWEVER...MOSTLY CLOUDY OVERALL WHICH FAVORED 
THE COOLER MAX TEMPS.

FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...I DID NOT LIKE THE GFS TIMING ON 
HURRICANE KATRINA OR REMNANTS...ALTHO 12Z GFS MODEL DID GET MORE IN 
LINE WITH THE REST OF THE MODELS.  THE NAM AND ECMWF SEEMED MUCH 
CLOSER TO THE OFFICIAL NHC TRACK OF KATRINA...AND GRIDS WERE OVERALL 
DRAWN THAT WAY.  A BIT WORRIED THAT WE MAY BE RUSHING IN THE PCPN 
FOR SRN AREAS THOSE PERIODS...BUT HAD TO MESH WITH HIGHER FFC AND 
GSP POP GRIDS.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CONVECTIVE BANDS MIGHT REACH OUR 
SRN AREAS AT THAT TIME...OR PERHAPS DAYTIME HEATING AND UPSLOPE E-SE 
WINDS MAY AID DEVELOPMENT.  IN SPITE OF NOT FAVORING GFS MODEL WITH 
KATRINA...I DID FAVOR THE GFS/MAV MOS COOLER HIGH TEMPS MONDAY.


.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...EARLY PART OF FCST PAINTED 
WX CONDITIONS IN LINE WITH TPC OFFICIAL KATRINA TRACK WHICH BRINGS 
WEAKENING TS INTO MID MISSISSIPPI AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD. 
USED LIKELY POPS FOR TUE THROUGH TUE EVENING TAPERING BACK TO 
CHC/SLGT CHC POP FOR MOST OF THE FA BY 12Z WED AS KATRINA DEPARTS N 
THRU THE OH VLY. MAINTAINED SOME CHC POPS WED/WED NIGHT FOR 
POSSIBILITY OF HIGHER MEAN RH AND LIFT BEHIND DEPARTING TROPICAL 
SYSTEM. REMAINDER OF THE FCST DRY AS RIDGING SFC AND ALOFT 
ESTABLISHES ITSELF ACROSS EASTERN U.S.

955 AM EDT SAT AUG 27 2005

.DISCUSSION...MOST CONVECTION THIS MORNING IS WELL TO OUR WEST NEAR 
THE WEAK COLD FRONT...AND MUCH OF THIS ACTIVITY IS WEAKENING AT THIS 
TIME.  12Z OHX SOUNDING REMAINS VERY MOIST (PRECIPITABLE WATER JUST 
OVER 2 INCHES) WHILE STILL CONSIDERABLY DRIER ON 12Z RNK WITH JUST 
1.40 INCHES.  THUS...MUCH BETTER INSTABILITY WILL BE NOTED THIS 
AFTERNOON ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES.  CONVECTIVE 
DEBRIS CLOUDINESS PLUS DAYTIME CUMULUS CLOUDS SHOULD KEEP MAX TEMPS 
DOWN A BIT.

CURRENT FORECAST AND GRIDS LOOK ON TRACK.  WILL NEED TO UPDATE THE
ZFPMRX AND REMOVE MORNING WORDING IN A COUPLE OF GROUPS...AND ALSO 
WILL CHECK THE GRIDS FOR ANY NEEDED SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS.

OTHERWISE...HURRICANE KATRINA REMAINS WELL TO OUR SOUTH AND MOVING 
WEST NEAR 7 MPH.  NOTED THAT 06Z GFS MODEL IS CONSIDERABLY DIFFERENT
(MUCH MORE NORTH AND EAST) THAN THE OFFICIAL LATEST TRACK TOWARD THE 
LA/MS COASTS ON MONDAY.  GFS MODEL DID APPEAR TO BE AN OUTLIER 
AMONGST SEVERAL MODELS VIEWED.  MORE ON THIS IN THE AFTERNOON 
DISCUSSION...BUT FOR NOW EFFECTS ON OUR REGION LOOK TO BE NO EARLIER 
THAN TUESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE ALONG THE EAST COAST WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER DEWPOINTS 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA COMPARED TO YESTERDAY MORNING. A WEAK COLD 
FRONT OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE 
TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEY TODAY...AND INTO THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT. 
THIS FRONT SHOULD TRIGGER A LITTLE BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION 
TODAY...BUT WILL ONLY MENTION SCATTERED COVERAGE SINCE THE LOCAL 
AIRMASS IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN ONLY MARGINALLY UNSTABLE. THE BEST 
INSTABILITY TODAY SHOULD REMAIN OVER MIDDLE TN...SO WILL PLAN TO 
MENTION SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS ACROSS THE PLATEAU. CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY 
SHOULD GRADUALLY DIMINISH AFTER SUNSET TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
PLAN TO GO WITH A PERSISTENCE FORECAST DUE TO THE EXPECTED CLOUD 
COVER FROM CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MAIN ISSUE REMAINS TRACK AND 
TIMING OF KATRINA AS MODELS CONTINUE TO DEPICT A WIDE ARRAY OF 
SOLUTIONS. INCLINATION IS TO NOT MAKE ANY PROFOUND CHANGES TO THE 
CURRENT FORECAST/GRIDS DUE TO THIS UNCERTAINTY. HAVE SCALED BACK 
POPS SLIGHTLY FOR SUNDAY AS MODEL TIME HEIGHTS DEPICT SIGNIFICANT 
DRYING AT VIRTUALLY ALL LEVELS WITH GENERAL SUBSIDENCE DURING THAT 
TIME FRAME. ALSO BUMPED UP TEMPS SLIGHTLY IN ANTICIPATION OF GOOD 
INSOLATION IN THE RELATIVELY DRY REGIME.

.DISCUSSION...A WEAK SHORTWAVE IS MOVING ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA THIS 
EVENING CONTRIBUTING TO A FEW SHOWERS. ALSO A LARGE CONVECTIVE 
COMPLEX MOVING ACROSS SOUTH CENTRAL KY AND WESTERN TN APPEARS TO BE 
SPLITTING WITH THE LARGER PART TURNING SOUTHEAST INTO MIDDLE TN 
WHERE THE AIRMASS IS MORE STABLE. THE OTHER AREA IS MOVING EAST INTO 
NORTH CENTRAL KY. THE THUNDERSTORMS MOVING ACROSS MIDDLE TN WILL 
GRADUALLY WEAKEN AFTER SUNSET BUT MAY BRING A FEW SHOWERS AND STORMS 
TO THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN VALLEY OVERNIGHT. WILL UPDATE 
CURRENT FORECAST TO INCREASE CLOUD COVER AND CHANGE WORDING TO 
SLIGHT CHANCE THUNDERSTORMS. WILL ALSO ADJUST LOWS UP SLIGHTLY WITH 
THE INCREASED CLOUD COVER. RAIN CHANCES LOOK OK FOR THE REST OF THE 
NIGHT. THE OFFICIAL TRACK FOR HURRICANE KATRINA HAS SHIFTED WEST AND 
MAY NOW MOVE FROM AL NORTHEAST OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU LATE 
TUESDAY. THIS COULD GIVE THE FORECAST AREA POTENTIALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL AND HIGH WINDS SO KATRINAS PROGRESS THIS WEEKEND BEARS

246 PM EDT FRI AUG 26 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...FORECAST IN THE SHORT TERM 
NOT REAL STRAIGHT FORWARD AS CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE LINGERS OVER THE 
AREA...AND THE POSSIBILITY OF WEAK DISTURBANCES IN THE FLOW WHICH 
COULD INCREASE PRECIP COVERAGE. THE BATCH OF CONVECTION OVER KY AND 
MIDDLE TN HAS HAD TROUBLE MOVING INTO THE AREA...TENDING TO DIMINISH 
AS IT MOVES INTO MORE STABLE AIR.  SECOND DISTURBANCE AFFECTING IL 
AND MO MAY MISS US TO THE NORTH...BUT PRECIP ON THE TAIL END 
BUILDING SOUTH MAY AFFECT SOME OF THE AREA ESPECIALLY FOR PLATEAU 
AND NORTH.  WILL LOOK AT LATEST RADAR RIGHT BEFORE RELEASE...BUT 
PLAN TO GO WITH SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTHEAST TONIGHT...CHANCE ELSEWHERE.  
THEN CHANCE ALL ZONES SAT. WILL GO NEAR TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE MAV TEMPS 
BOTH PERIODS.  


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE BIGGEST HEADACHE 
IS THE TRACK KATRINA WILL TAKE.  THE NAM MODEL HAS IT GOING ON-SHORE 
AROUND APPALACHICOLA FLA TRACKING NORTHEAST FROM THERE...WHICH WOULD 
GIVE OUR FORECAST AREA VERY MINIMAL IMPACT.  THE LATEST GFS MODEL 
HAS LANDFALL AROUND NEW ORLEANS AND TRACKING NORTHWARD ACROSS WEST 
TENNESSEE...AGAIN MINIMAL IMPACT.  

THE TROPICAL PRECICTION CENTER TRACK HAS LANDFALL MONDAY WITH A 
NORTH-NORTHEAST TRACK WITH THE CENTER GOING JUST EAST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS WHICH COULD BRING RAINS INTO THE AREA WITH SIGNIFICANT 
RAINS POSSIBLE IN THE HEADWATER AREAS OF SOME OF OUR RIVERS THAT 
FLOW FROM NORTH CAROLINA.  IF THE TRACK GOES JUST A LITTLE WEST OF 
THE CURRENT OFFICIAL TRACK...THE AREA COULD SEE SIGNIFICANT 
RAINS...AND HIGH WINDS PARTICULARLY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

NEEDLESS TO SAY...THIS IS A POTENTIALLY SIGNICANT WEATHER MAKER AND 
WE WILL BE KEEPING A CLOSE WATCH TO THE TRACK AND IMPACTS ON OUR 
WEATHER.

PLAYED THE RAINFALL CHANCES ON THE HIGH END OF CHANCE WITH THE 
UNCERTAINTIES OF THE TRACK.  LATER FORECASTS WILL NEED TO RAISE OR 
LOWER BASED ON FUTURE FORECAST TRACKS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN U.S. AND CENTERED OVER THE DELMARVA 
REGION. MSAS THETA-E AND DEWPOINT DATA REVEAL A DIFFUSE STATIONARY 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY ORIENTED FROM NORTH-TO-SOUTH ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU...WITH A SLIGHTLY DRIER AIRMASS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
COMPARED TO THAT OBSERVED FARTHER WEST OVER THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
AND OHIO RIVER VALLEYS. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD AGAIN BECOME 
THE FOCUSING MECHANISM FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT LATER TODAY...WITH 
OUTFLOW FROM A CONVECTIVE COMPLEX OVER THE LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL TRIGGERING MECHANISM. WITH ALL OF THIS IN 
MIND...WILL PLAN TO RAISE POPS A LITTLE TODAY WITH THE HIGHEST POPS 
LOCATED ALONG THE PLATEAU. CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SHOULD GRADUALLY 
DIMINISH AFTER SUNSET TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO GO WITH 
SLIGHTLY LOWER TEMPS TODAY COMPARED TO YESTERDAY DUE TO THE EXPECTED 
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER FROM CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODEL TIME HEIGHTS DEPICT 
DEEP MOISTURE PERSISTING OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. HOWEVER...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES PROJECT ONLY 
SCATTERED CONVECTION AT BEST...IN SPITE OF WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
APPROACHING BY SUNDAY. REMNANTS OF KATRINA APPROACH EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...BUT OFFICIAL TRACK STILL KEEPS SYSTEM EAST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS WHICH IMPLIES MINIMAL IMPACT FOR OUR AREA. GUIDANCE 
TEMPS GENERALLY AGREE AND APPEAR REASONABLE BASED ON RECENT 
PERSISTENCE. DID NOT DEVIATE TOO MUCH FROM THOSE VALUES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THRU SATURDAY)...HIGHEST POPS (ALTHO NO 
GREATER THAN CHANCE) IN THE WESTERN AREAS IS WORKING QUITE WELL THIS 
AFTERNOON AS ATMOSPHERE IS MUCH MORE UNSTABLE ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU REGIONS.  CARRIED THIS PATTERN INTO THE 
EVENING...BUT ALSO SPREAD A BROAD AREA OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EAST TO 
INCLUDE THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA...DUE TO SLOW EAST MOVEMENT AND 
POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT.  LATER TONIGHT CONTINUED THE PATTERN OF TSRA 
POSSIBLY SPREADING SE FROM KY...AND DIURNAL CONVECTION ELSEWHERE 
DISSIPATING.  NEXT SHIFT MIGHT WANT TO ADD PATCHY FOG TO THE 
MIX...ALTHO VSBYS THIS MORNING WERE GENERALLY 3 MILES OR BETTER AT 
MOST LOCATIONS. 

OTHERWISE...GENERALLY THE BEST RAIN CHANCES FOR FRIDAY THRU SATURDAY 
APPEAR TO BE MAINLY NE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND WRN MOST COUNTIES OF 
SWRN VA.  THESE AREAS STAND THE BEST CHANCE OF MCS ACTIVITY...AND 
ALSO THE BEST INSTABILITY EACH DAY.  NUDGED SKY COVER CLOSER TO 
MOSTLY CLOUDY ACROSS THE BOARD FOR FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY.  
FAVORED THE COOLER GFS/MAV MOS HIGHS EACH DAY DUE TO INCREASING 
MOISTURE AND RAIN CHANCES.

CANT RULE OUT ISOLATED CONVECTION JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON...BUT DECIDED TO KEEP POPS AT 14 PERCENT OR LESS FOR NOW.
SHORT RANGE MODELS ALL GENERALLY AGREE THAT WEAK SHORTWAVES/IMPULSES

THREAT OF CONVECTION LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH 
THIS ACTIVITY MOVING ESE FROM THE MID MISSISSIPPI AND SRN OHIO

GFS AND NAM WERE NOT EXTREMELY ZEALOUS WITH COVERAGE (BEYOND NE

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT JUST SOUTH 
OF THE SOUTHERN TN BORDER OVER NORTHERN AL AND NORTHERN GA...WHERE A 
PRE-FRONTAL LINE OF TSTORMS HAS DEVELOPED. THETA-E ANALYSIS REVEALS 
SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR OVER THE FORECAST AREA...BUT THE BULK OF THE 
DRIER AIR REMAINS NORTH OF THE AREA OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. 
LOCAL RADARS INDICATE SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION LINGERING ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VA AND SOUTHWEST NC THIS EVENING...BUT THINK THAT THIS 
CONVECTION SHOULD GRADUALLY DISAPPEAR WITH THE SETTING OF THE SUN. 

WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO REMOVE MENTION OF 
PRECIP OVERNIGHT...EXCEPT ACROSS SOUTHWEST NC WHERE DEEPER MOISTURE 
RESIDES. WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER DEWPOINTS OBSERVED TONIGHT...WILL PLAN 
TO MENTION PATCHY FOG IN ALL ZONES. TEMPS LOOK TO BE ON TRACK AND 
WILL NOT PLAN TO CHANGE.

237 PM EDT TUE AUG 23 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WED)...CURRENTLY STATIONARY FRONT IS 
LOCATED NEAR THE TENNESSEE/ALABAMA/GEORGIA LINE. A FEW WEAK 
SHORT-WAVES ARE MOVING ALONG AND NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY. MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIRMASS WITH CAPES OF 1500-2000 J/KG AND LIFTED INDICES OF 
-3 TO -5 OVER THE AREA. SCATTERED CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE TO 
DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH BEST 
CONCENTRATION OF STORMS OVER THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN COUNTIES WHERE 
MOISTURE IS A LITTLE DEEPER.

IF CLOUDS DO BREAK TONIGHT...SOME PATCHY FOG IS POSSIBLE FOR THE 
NORTHERN SECTIONS...MAINLY NEAR AREA LAKES AND STREAMS DUE TO THE 
POTENTIAL OF STEAM FOG. CONFIDENCE TOO LOW TO INCLUDE...BUT WILL 
INFORM EVENING SHIFT OF POTENTIAL.

MODELS SHOW FRONT SAGGING FARTHER SOUTH FOR WEDNESDAY WITH UPPER 
RIDGE BEGINNING TO BUILD BACK INTO THE REGION. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW 
SOME MID-LEVEL WARMING WHICH WILL HELP TO CAP OFF AND LIMIT ANY 
CONVECTION FOR TOMORROW. WILL DROP POPS TO ONLY 2O PERCENT OR LESS 
MOST LOCATIONS WITH DRY CONDITIONS ANTICIPATED FOR TRI AREA.

.LONG TERM...(WED NIGHT THROUGH TUE)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
GENERALLY AGREE ON A RATHER TRANQUIL WEATHER PATTERN THROUGH THE END 
OF THE WORK WEEK. UPPER FLOW TRANSITIONS FROM CYCLONIC TO 
ANTICYCLONIC AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS BACK INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION. ANTICIPATE GENERALLY DRY CONDITIONS ON THURSDAY 
BEFORE WIDELY SCATTERED CONVECTION BECOMES MORE PROBABLE BY FRIDAY. 
FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE FAIRLY CLOSELY.

FURTHER OUT...MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE AND ENSEMBLES BECOME 
CHAOTIC...SO CONSENSUS SOLUTION DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN AT THIS TIME. 
APPEARS MAJORITY OF GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS BUILDS A RIDGE INTO THE 
EASTERN CONUS BY LATE IN THE PERIOD. HOWEVER...MAJORITY OF THE 
CANADIAN ENSEMBLE MEMBERS DEPICTS TROUGHING OVER THE EASTERN CONUS 
DURING THE SAME TIME FRAME. DUE TO THIS UNCERTAINTY...HAVE TENDED TO 
FAVOR PERSISTENCE THROUGH MOST OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD...FEATURING 
MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION AND NEAR CLIMO TEMPS.

COOLER AIR FROM THE NORTH WILL GRUDGINGLY RETREAT THROUGH THE SHORT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...A FEW CHANGES IN STORE AS SURFACE 
COLD FRONT IS STILL PROJECTED TO APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE

OPPRESSIVE HEAT AND HUMIDITY OF THE PAST FEW DAYS WILL BE SUPPRESSED 
SOUTH BY AN AMPLIFYING UPPER TROUGH CURRENTLY DIGGING INTO THE 
WESTERN GREAT LAKES REGION. HOWEVER...FRONTAL PROGRESSION SLOWS AND

FOR TEMPS. ANTICIPATE SCATTERED CONVECTION TO ACCOMPANY COLD FRONT. 
THUS CONTINUED CHANCE POPS THROUGH MOST OF THE PERIOD.

.LONG TERM...(SUN NIGHT THROUGH SAT)...MODELS IN POOR AGREEMENT IN 
HANDLING UPPER TROUGH THAT MOVES INTO THE NORTHEAST. NAM IS MORE 
PROGRESSIVE...WHILE GFS BRINGS A LOT MORE VORT ENERGY THROUGH THE

THE CWA TODAY.  850MB TEMPS REMAIN IN THE LOW 20C WHICH WILL 
TRANSLATE INTO LOWER TO MID 90S ACROSS MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS THIS 
AFTERNOON.  WITH DEW POINTS CONTINUING IN THE LOWER 70S...HUMID 
CONDITIONS WILL PUSH HEAT INDEX NUMBERS INTO THE UPPER 90S AND LOW

ABILITY FOR CONVECTION...AS WILL THE LACK OF A GOOD TRIGGER.  
HOWEVER...WITH A MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIR MASS IN PLACE...CAN NOT RULE 
OUT CONVECTION COMPLETELY SO WILL KEEP 20-30 CHANCE POPS IN FORECAST

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES GENERALLY 
AGREE THAT ZONAL FLOW WILL AMPLIFY OVER THE PERIOD AS UPPER RIDGE 
BUILDS OVER THE CENTRAL GULF COAST REGION. THIS SHOULD PUSH THE WEAK 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY CURRENTLY DRAPED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
TO THE NORTH BY LATE IN THE FIRST PERIOD. ANTICIPATE RETURN TO MORE 
SCATTERED/DIURNAL CONVECTION AS BOUNDARY EXITS THE AREA. MODEL TINE 
HEIGHTS SHOW GOOD DRYING IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS WHICH SUPPORTS 
THIS CONCLUSION. HAVE NO REASON TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE EXISTING 
GRIDS WHICH APPEAR TO HAVE THIS SCENARIO CAPTURED QUITE WELL.

.LONG TERM...(FRI NIGHT THROUGH THU)...MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE A 
CONVECTIVE COMPLEX MAY AFFECT MAINLY NORTHERN PARTS OF THE AREA LATE
FRI NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. WHILE CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH THAT THIS WILL 
HAPPEN...WILL BUMP POPS UP NORTH INTO THE LOW CHANCE RANGE FOR FRI
NIGHT...THEN WILL RUN WITH 20 POPS SW TO 50 POPS NE MTNS SAT.
SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT FORECAST TO SWING THROUGH THE AREA ON SUNDAY.
DYNAMICS AND MOISTURE LOOK LIKE THEY WILL BE LIMITED...SO JUST CHANCE
POPS FOR NOW SUNDAY. WITH DRIER AIR MOVING IN AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN
FROM THE NORTH...WILL GO DRY SUN NIGHT AND MONDAY. LOOKS LIKE HIGH
PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN CONTROL THROUGH THU...WITH DRY WEATHER
EXPECTED.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FRONTAL BOUNDARYS TRAVELS WILL 
CONTINUE TODAY WITH A SLOW NORTHWARD SHIFT INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
BY THIS EVENING. YET ANOTHER S/WV PRESSING THROUGH THE LOWER OHIO 
VALLEY WITH CONVECTION ONGOING ATTM PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA TODAY. MODELS GO WILD WITH THE SCENARIO PUMPING UP 
POPS TO CATEGORICAL RANGE. DECIDED TO USE HIGH LIKELY POPS FOR 
NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH LOWER RANGE LIKELY ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. ITS HARD TO 
IMAGINE SUCH EXTENSIVE COVERAGE OF PRECIP IN A CONVECTIVE EVENT. AT 
ANY RATE BEST CHANCE FOR SHRA/TSRA SHOULD BE ACROSS NORTHERN 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA IN 
AREA OF WAA ASSOCIATED WITH FRONT. DROPPED POPS OFF TONIGHT AS S/WV 
BUILDS E AND FRONT PUSHES AWAY TO THE NORTHEAST. TEMP GUIDANCE WAS 
BETTER YESTERDAY AND STAYED CLOSE TO BLEND OF SUGGESTED MAXES/MINS 
1ST TWO PERIODS OF THE FCST.



.LONG TERM...FRIDAY THRU DAY 7)...MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON FRIDAY BUT
SOME DISAGREEMENT BEGINNING FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. NAM BRINGING
MODERATELY STRONG SHORT WAVE THROUGH THE NORTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST
AREA WITH ACCOMPANING HIGHER POPS. THIS IS A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY AND
HAVE INCREASED POPS IN THOSE AREAS TO COVER THIS POTENTIAL. KEEP THE
POPS IN TIL SUNDAYS FRONTAL PASSAGE. MODEL NUMBERS FINALLY BEGINNING TO
COME DOWN ON BOTH TEMPS AND POPS BEHIND THIS FRONT AND AGREE WITH THIS

.SHORT TERM...ONGOING SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH FOR 4 OF OUR VA COUNTIES
UNTIL EARLY EVENING. CONVECTION CONTINUES MOVING E ACROSS SE KY...BUT
CONVECTION HAS DIMINISHED IN INTENSITY AS IT MOVES INTO AN AREA WHERE
THE AIR MASS IS NOT AS STABLE AS FURTHER W. ADDITIONAL CONVECTION MOVING
E ACROSS PARTS OF W AND CENTRAL MIDDLE TN. SOME OF THIS CONVECTION MAY
MOVE INTO OUR W AREAS LATE THIS AFTERNOON OR EARLY EVE.

A WEAK COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO MOVE SE ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA LATER
TONIGHT. SOME OF THE PRECIPITATION MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY SHOULD UNDERGO
SOME DISSIPATION AFTER DAYTIME HEATING ENDS THIS EVENING. HOWEVER...WITH
WNW UPPER LEVEL FLOW OVERNIGHT ALONG WITH SOME WEAK VORTICITY
AROUND...EXPECT THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS TO
PERSIST OVERNIGHT.

FRONTAL SYSTEM MAY MOVE JUST S OF OUR AREA BY DAYBREAK WED MORNING
...THEN REMAIN STATIONARY UNTIL IT BEGINS MOVING N AS A WARM FRONT 
WED NIGHT INTO THU. SO CHANCES OF RAIN WILL CONTINUE.

.LONG TERM...EARLY IN THE WEEKEND...A MORE SUMMER TYPE PATTERN TAKES HOLD
AGAIN BRIEFLY...AS UPPER LEVEL HEIGHTS ARE FORECAST TO INCREASE ACROSS
THE AREA IN RESPONSE TO UPPER LEVEL RIDGING THAT EXPANDS NE FROM
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES.

UPPER FLOW HOWEVER DOES BEGIN TURNING MORE FROM THE W TO WNW OR NW 
BY SUNDAY MORNING AND CONTINUES THAT WAY THROUGH REST OF FORECAST
PERIOD...SO A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CAN BE EXPECTED
THROUGH THE PERIOD.

.DISCUSSION...EXPECT MUCH MORE COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
TODAY...GIVEN THE APPARENT UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF A 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH (MCV) MOVING EAST ACROSS CENTRAL KY AND NRN MIDDLE 
TN.  THIS FEATURE LOOKS TO MOVE ACROSS THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY STILL 
STALLED E-W ACROSS SRN TIP OF IL AND NR KY AND W VA.  MODIFIED 12Z 
OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW MODERATE INSTABILITY TODAY AND STEEP LOW

NRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH STORMS LIKELY TO MOVE EAST AT 
10 TO 15 MPH.  SOME ISOLATED STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS SEEM POSSIBLE 
WITH DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS THE MAIN THREAT.

WILL UPDATE THE ZFPMRX TO REMOVE MORNING WORDING...AND ALSO ADD 
SCATTERED QUALIFIER WHERE LESS THAN LIKELY POPS ARE FORECAST FOR 
THIS AFTERNOON.  MOST OF FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK FOR TODAY...BUT 
WILL FRESHEN THE GRIDS AND WEB PRODUCTS AS WELL.

SOUTH INTO TENNESSEE DURING THE NEXT 24-36 HOURS AND WILL AID IN
FOCUSING CONVECTION ESPECIALLY ACROSS NRN PART OF THE FA INCLUDING THE
NRN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU/SW VA AND NE TN. S/WV PRESSING EAST ACROSS THE
LWR OH VLY WILL BUILD ONTO THE PLATEAU EARLY THIS AFTERNOON AND WILL
SHIFT TWD SW VA/NE TN BY LATE AFTERNOON. LIS/CAPE LOOK RATHER DECENT
FOR CONVECTION THIS AREA TODAY AND WITH S/WV FEATURE LIKELY POPS LOOK
GOOD 1ST PD. BUMPED UP POPS 2ND PD AS IT APPEARS THAT CONVECTION WILL BE
ONGOING AROUND 00Z AND WILL WEAKEN/DISSIPATE BY 04Z WITH LOSS OF
INSOLATION. STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO PREVIOUS PACKAGE MAX/MIN TEMP 1ST TWO
PDS.


.LONG TERM...PERSISTENCE WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE 
FORECAST THROUGH MOST OF THE PERIOD.  GFS INDICATES A WEAK FRONT 
MOVING INTO THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY AND HAVE INCREASED POPS BASED ON 
THIS FOCUS POINT.  THE FRONT LINGERS INTO THE WEEKEND AND HAVE KEPT 
POPS ABOVE SEASONAL NORMS BASED ON THIS. 

EVEN WITH THE SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS...THERE SHOULD BE AMPLE SUNSHINE 
THROUGH THE PERIOD FOR WARMER THAN NORMAL VALUES.  WENT WITH HIGHS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...MOST CONVECTION CONTINUES TO 
DEVELOP ACROSS MIDDLE TN/CUMBERLAND PLATEAU REGION...AND ALSO JUST 
EAST OF THE TN/NC STATE LINE.  MOVEMENT IS EAST OR SOUTHEAST AT 
AROUND 10 MPH.  WITH THE WEAK COLD FRONT STILL TO OUR NORTH...I 
DONT EXPECT ANY ORGANIZED CONVECTION IN OUR REGION OVERNIGHT.  
STILL MIGHT SEE ISOLATED STRONG STORMS BRIEFLY.  CARRIED CHANCE POPS 
ACROSS THE BOARD THIS EVENING...THEN SLIGHT CHANCE OVERNIGHT...WHICH 
WAS LITTLE CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST/GRIDS.  

FOR TUESDAY...WEAK FRONT LOOKS TO SAG SOUTHWARD TOWARD OR INTO NRN 
PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA...SO NUDGED POPS UP TO LIKELY IN THE 
NORTH AND CONTINUED HIGH CHANCE ELSEWHERE.  

FOR TEMPERATURES...WENT FOR PERSISTENCE TONIGHT AND FAVORED WARMER

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...WEAKENING FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY REMAINS ACROSS THE REGION WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY FOR

EXPECT NORMAL SUMMERTIME AFTERNOON/EVENING CONVECTION.  A FRONT 
PUSHES INTO THE THE REGION ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY.  CONFIDENCE IS LOW

959 AM EDT MON AUG 15 2005

.DISCUSSION...PATCHY AREAS OF FOG AND STRATUS ARE GRADUALLY 
DISSIPATING AT MID MORNING PER VISIBLE SATELLITE PICS.  THIS SHOULD 
LEAVE AMPLE SUNSHINE TO ALLOW TEMPS TO REACH INTO MAINLY THE 80S TO 
LOWER 90S.  MODIFYING THE 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS INDICATES 
MODERATE INSTABILITY WITH POSITIVE CAPES OF 1500 TO 2000 J/KG FOR 
THE AFTERNOON.  

SHORT RANGE MODELS SUGGEST A POSSIBLE WEAK SHORTWAVE IN THE ZONAL 
FLOW JUST TO OUR NORTH...BUT SATELLITE PICS DONT YET INDICATE THIS
FEATURE.  OTHERWISE...THE WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY GENERALLY SEEMS TO 
EXTEND EAST TO WEST ACROSS SRN IL/IN INTO NE KY AT THIS TIME.

THINKING IS THAT CHANCE POPS OF 40 PERCENT SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR 
TODAY...WITH HIGHER RAIN CHANCES FOR TOMORROW AS WEAK COLD FRONT 
SAGS SOUTH INTO THE FORECAST AREA.

WILL DO AN UPDATE TO THE ZFPMRX PRODUCT TO REMOVE ANY MORNING 
WORDING...AND ALSO CHECK GRIDS FOR ANY NEEDED FRESHENING AS WELL.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...LOW CLOUDS PERSISTED OVER THE MRX 
CWA FOR MUCH OF THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY...LIMITING HEATING. 
HOWEVER...THE AIR MASS IS WEAK TO MODERATELY UNSTABLE WITH LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE IN PLACE. SOME CONVECTION IS FORMING TO OUR WEST AND AS WE 
APPROACH CONVECTIVE TEMPERATURES...EXPECT SCATTERED CONVECTION TO 
DEVELOP OVER EAST TN. WEAK WAVES ALOFT AND OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM 
YESTERDAY/S CONVECTION SHOULD AID DEVELOPMENT. DUE TO DIURNAL NATURE 
OF EXPECTED CONVECTION AND LATE START TO DEVELOPMENT...THUNDERSTORMS 
FORMATION MAY BE MORE LIMITED THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. FOR NOW... 
WILL LOWER POPS A BIT FOR THE EVENING...BUT MAY MAKE FURTHER 
ADJUSTMENTS...WILL MONITOR CUMULUS AND THUNDERSTORM INITIATION AND 
MAKE CHANGES AS RADAR AND SATELLITE IMAGERY DICTATE. AN APPROACHING 
BOUNDARY CURRENTLY POSITIONED OVER THE OHIO VALLEY REGION WILL VERY 
SLOWLY PUSH SOUTHWARD TOWARD THE MRX CWA ON MONDAY. MAIN FOCUS WILL 
REMAIN NORTH OF THE AREA THROUGH MONDAY...BUT CONVECTION OUT AHEAD 
OF THE BOUNDARY MAY BEGIN TO EFFECT NORTHERN ZONES BY THE AFTERNOON. 
THIS...COMBINED WITH EXPECTED NORMAL SUMMERTIME CONVECTION...WILL 
KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY. PERSISTENCE LOOKS BEST WAY TO GO WITH 
TEMPS AND GUIDANCE IN LINE WITH THIS. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...LATEST SHORT-RANGE MODEL 
RUNS INDICATE THAT A WEAK SHORT WAVE WILL NUDGE A QUASI-STATIONARY 
FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY CLOSER TO THE FORECAST AREA ON 
TUESDAY. THIS SCENARIO SHOULD RESULT IN A LITTLE BETTER COVERAGE OF 
CONVECTION ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA 
AND NORTHEAST TN. OTHERWISE...UPPER-LEVEL FLOW SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY 
ZONAL THROUGH THE WEEK WITH A STAGNANT MOIST AND MARGINALLY UNSTABLE 
AIRMASS CONTINUING THROUGH THE WEEK. THUS...EXPECT SCATTERED 
CONVECTION TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP EACH DAY...MAINLY DURING THE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. ALSO...EXPECT A LITTLE BETTER COVERAGE 
OF CONVECTION OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS DUE TO DIFFERENTIAL 
HEATING. 

LATEST GFS MODEL RUN NOW INDICATES THAT A STRONGER UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH WILL DEVELOP ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA BY THE END OF THE WEEK... 
WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN A STRONGER COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE WEEKEND 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THE ENSEMBLE MEANS TEND TO SUPPORT THE GFS 
SOLUTION...SO WILL LOWER POPS A LITTLE ON SUNDAY WITH THE ASSUMPTION 
OF A FRONTAL PASSAGE BY THEN. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO GO WITH A 
PERSISTENCE FORECAST THROUGH MOST OF THE WEEK...BUT WILL LOWER TEMPS 
A LITTLE ON TUESDAY WITH AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS AND CONVECTIVE 
ACTIVITY EXPECTED.

WITH UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE THE MAIN WEATHER FEATURE AND AN EMBEDDED AREA 
OF LOW PRESSURE TO OUR SOUTH.  AIR MASS HAS BECOME UNSTABLE ONCE 
AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON WITH LI/S OF -3 TO -4.  MOISTURE REMAINS IN 
PLACE AND LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH WAVES CIRCULATING WITH THE LOW...AS A 
RESULT...SCATTERED CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED IN AND AROUND THE MRX 
CWA.  THIS CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING HOURS.  DAYTIME 
HEATING IS A STRONG INGREDIENT OF THE THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT AND 
WITH SUNSET...ACTIVITY SHOULD DIMINISH.  HOWEVER...WEAK SHORT WAVES 
IN THE UPPER FLOW MAY KEEP SOME LIMIT CONVECTION GOING INTO THE 
OVERNIGHT HOURS.  MORE OF THE SAME EXPECTED FOR SUNDAY...WITH THIS 
NORMAL SUMMERTIME PATTERN IN PLACE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION.  GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOKS GOOD AND WILL NOT STRAY FAR FOR HIGH 
AND LOW TEMPS.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...DOG DAYS OF SUMMER WILL 
CONTINUE THROUGH NEXT WEEK WITH A STAGNANT SYNOPTIC PATTERN EXPECTED 
FOR THE MOST PART. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN INDICATES THAT A WEAK SHORT 
WAVE ON TUESDAY MAY NUDGE A WEAK STATIONARY FRONT OVER THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...THINK THAT THIS 
FRONT SHOULD STAY NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGHOUT THE WEEK... 
AS UPPER-LEVEL FLOW REMAINS MOSTLY ZONAL. A MOIST AND MARGINALLY 
UNSTABLE AIRMASS WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...WITH 
SCATTERED CONVECTION EXPECTED TO DEVELOP EACH DAY NEXT WEEK...MAINLY 
DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. ALSO...EXPECT A LITTLE 
BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS DUE TO 
DIFFERENTIAL HEATING. GFS MODEL ALSO INDICATES THAT A STRONGER 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL DEVELOP LATER IN THE WEEK AND FINALLY PUSH A 
COLD FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY. HOWEVER...ENSEMBLE 
MEANS INDICATE THAT THIS SOLUTION IS TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH THE 
SOUTHWARD FRONTAL MOVEMENT...SO THINK THAT FRONTAL PASSAGE SHOULD BE 
SLOWER (SOMETIME NEXT WEEKEND). OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO GO WITH A

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...SHORTWAVE TRACKING OVER THE 
RIDGE TODAY ALONG WITH MARGINAL INSTABILITY AND ADEQUATE MOISTURE 
FOR SCATTERED AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS.  WILL BUMP UP 
POPS TO 40/50 FOR THIS AFTERNOON.  SCATTERED CONVECTION SHOULD 
CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING HOURS...THEN DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET.  
ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH ON SUNDAY...BUT MOISTURE NOT AS 
DEEP AS TODAY...BUT STILL ENOUGH FOR MORE SCATTERED ACTIVITY ON 
SUNDAY...MAINLY DIURNAL.  SIMILAR CONDITIONS ON MONDAY.  GUIDANCE 
TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE...SO STAYED CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...IMPULSES CONTINUE TO TRACK

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...CURRENT WEATHER PATTERN SHOWS A 
BROAD DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT WITH A WEAK LOW OVER THE GULF 
STATES. ROTATION AROUND TO LOW IS FEEDING IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND 
PROVIDING LIFT FOR THUNDERSTORMS FORMATION. CONVECTION IS DEVELOPING 
OVER OUR SOUTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND AREAS SOUTH. AIR MASS IS 
WEAKLY UNSTABLE WITH LI/S -1...LOCALLY -2 SOUTH. MAIN AXIS OF 
INSTABILITY IS SOUTH AND WEST OF THE MRX CWA. THROUGH THE EVENING 
HOURS...SCATTERED TO ISOLATED CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE...MAINLY OVER 
SOUTHERN ZONES. ACTIVITY SHOULD DIMINISH AFTER SUNSET...BUT ENERGY 
FROM THE LOW MAY KEEP SOME CONVECTION GOING INTO THE OVERNIGHT 
HOURS. ON SATURDAY...HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS THE DOMINANT WEATHER 
FEATURE AND WILL SEE ANOTHER HOT AND HUMID DAY. HOWEVER...MINOR 
HEIGHT FALLS SHOULD TRANSLATE INTO A DEGREE OR TWO COOLER THAN 
TODAY/S HIGHS. AIR MASS WILL AGAIN BECOME AT LEAST WEAKLY UNSTABLE 
IN THE AFTERNOON...AND THERMALLY DRIVEN THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD ONCE 
AGAIN DEVELOP.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS INDICATE THAT 
THE DOG DAYS OF SUMMER WILL CONTINUE THROUGH NEXT WEEK WITH A 
STAGNANT PATTERN EXPECTED. A MOIST AND MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIRMASS 
WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH NEXT WEEK...WITH 
SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING EACH DAY...MAINLY DURING THE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. ALSO...EXPECT A LITTLE BETTER COVERAGE 
OF CONVECTION ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. A COLD FRONT OVER THE 
MID WEST SHOULD REMAIN QUASI-STATIONARY OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
THROUGH NEXT WEEK...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW REMAINS ZONAL AND AN 
UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE SLOWLY BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHEAST. LATEST TPC TRACK 
INDICATES THAT TROPICAL STORM IRENE WILL REMAIN OFF THE NORTH 
CAROLINA COAST ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...WITH NO EFFECT ON THE 
FORECAST AREA. THUS...WILL PLAN TO GO WITH A PERSISTENCE FORECAST 
THROUGH FRIDAY WITH NO CHANGE IN THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN EXPECTED.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...ISOLATED CONVECTION DEVELOPING TO 
OUR NORTH AND EAST. DEW POINTS HAVE CLIMBED BACK TO NEAR 70 AND THE 
AIR MASS IS MARGINALLY UNSTABLE. MAIN FOCUS OF THE CONVECTION SHOULD 
REMAIN NORTH AND EAST...BUT LIMITED DEVELOPMENT OVER THE THE MRX CWA 
IS POSSIBLE. SO...WILL INCREASE POPS ACROSS THE AREA TO AT LEAST 20 
PERCENT. THE ACTIVITY SHOULD BE DIURNAL IN NATURE AND EXPECT THE 
CELLS TO DISSIPATE WITH LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. ON FRIDAY...WE WILL 
BECOME WEAKLY UNSTABLE WITH STRONGER INSTABILITY EXPECTED TO OUR 
WEST. A MINOR WAVE WILL TRACK THROUGH TO OUR SOUTH AIDING THE 
POTENTIAL FOR AFTERNOON/EVENING CONVECTION. MAIN AREA FOR POSSIBLE 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN ZONES...SO 
WILL INCREASE THOSE POPS TO CHANCE CATEGORY. 850MB TEMPS CONTINUE TO 
RISE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION INTO FRIDAY AFTERNOON FOR 
ANOTHER HOT AND HUMID DAY. GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOK REASONABLE AND WILL 
STAY CLOSE TO THESE.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS INDICATE THAT 
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL SLOWLY INCREASE FOR THE WEEKEND..WITH 
A LITTLE BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION EXPECTED IN THE AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING HOURS. A COLD FRONT OVER THE MID WEST SHOULD REMAIN QUASI- 
STATIONARY OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT 
WEEK...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW REMAINS ZONAL. HOWEVER...GFS MODEL 
INDICATES THAT A SHORT WAVE WILL HELP TO NUDGE THIS FRONT TOWARDS 
THE FORECAST AREA NEXT WEEK. LATEST TPC TRACK INDICATES THAT 
TROPICAL STORM IRENE WILL APPROACH THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST BY 
TUESDAY MORNING...BUT SHOULD BE MOVING NORTH BY THAT TIME. THUS...IT 
APPEARS AT THIS TIME THAT THERE WILL BE LITTLE IMPACT ON THE 
FORECAST AREA OTHER THAN TO KEEP THE QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT OVER THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY WEST AND NORTH OF THE AREA. WILL PLAN TO KEEP A 
CHANCE OF MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION THROUGH THURSDAY...WITH A MOIST 
AND MARGINALLY UNSTABLE REMAINING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THE BEST 
COVERAGE OF CONVECTION SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE ALONG THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GO WITH A PERSISTENCE FORECAST 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND WITH THE STAGNANT AIRMASS...BUT WILL LOWER MAXES 
FOR NEXT WEEK AS CLOUDS AND MOISTURE INCREASE AHEAD OF THE COLD 
FRONT AND IRENE.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RELATIVELY DRY PERIOD CONTINUES 
AS FORECAST AREA REMAINS SITUATED BETWEEN WEATHER FEATURES TO THE 
NORTH AND SOUTH. ONCE AGAIN...GFS GUIDANCE POPS SEEM OVERDONE BASED 
ON ITS OWN TIME HEIGHT DEPICTION OF DRY MOISTURE PROFILE AND GENERAL 
SUBSIDENCE. THUS WILL UNDERCUT GFS GUIDANCE AND REMOVE POPS FROM 
MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS AND CONFINE LOW POPS TO HIGHER TERRAIN. THE 
EXCEPTION WILL BE THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AS IT REMAINS CLOSER TO 
STALLED SURFACE BOUNDARY ACROSS GEORGIA. NAM PROJECTS ANOTHER FRONT 
WILL APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE NORTH LATE IN THE SECOND 
PERIOD. HOWEVER...TIMING REMAINS QUESTIONABLE AND GFS AND 
SHORT-RANGE ENSEMBLES PROJECT BOUNDARY TO REMAIN NORTH OF THE AREA 
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE VALUES GENERALLY AGREE 
QUITE WELL. TENDED TO FAVOR BLEND FOR THE MOST PART.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...CHALLENGING TO PICK A 
PERIOD WHERE ANY BETTER THAN ISOLATED (MAINLY DIURNAL) CONVECTIVE 
PRECIPITATION (PCPN) WOULD OCCUR THURSDAY INTO THE WEEKEND.  SHORT 
RANGE MODELS...MAINLY ETA/NAM...SUGGEST A WEAKENING MCS MAY DROP SE 
ACROSS MUCH OF KY INTO MIDDLE AND NE TN AROUND OR AFTER 12Z THURSDAY.
NOT SURE IF I WANT TO BUY INTO THIS COMPLETELY WITH ZONAL FLOW TO 
OUR NORTH AND RIDGE BUILDING OVER SE STATES AT THAT TIME.  FOR NOW 
...DID TOSS IN SOME VERY MINIMAL POPS (15-20%) FOR OUR NE PLATEAU 
COUNTIES AND LEE/WISE OF VA TO MESH BETTER WITH JKL AND RLX LATEST 
GRIDS.  OTHERWISE...DECIDED BEST COURSE WAS TO GENERALLY STICK WITH 
THE 20 TO 30 PERCENT POPS AS IN CURRENT GRIDS THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...UPPER TROUGH DEVELOPING ACROSS PLAINS STATES 
WILL HELP TO CREATE MORE OF A SW FLOW IN THE MID TO UPPER LEVELS...
AND LIKELY INCREASE THE DEPTH OF MOISTURE FOR MORE INSTABILITY.  
HOWEVER...THE WEAK COLD FRONT LOOKS TO LIKELY REMAIN TO OUR NORTH.
THUS...I LIKED THE CHANCE POPS FOR NOW MONDAY THRU WEDNESDAY.  SOME
PRELIMINARY GRIDS WERE MADE FOR THE NEW DAY 7 (WEDNESDAY). 

FOR TEMPS...MAX TEMPS NEAR THE BLEND OF MOS LOOKED GOOD FOR THU AND

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SLOW DRYING TREND IS EXPECTED TO 
CONTINUE TODAY AS WEAK UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES TO DRIFT EAST. GFS IS 
SLOWER WITH THIS PROCESS AND THUS THE WETTEST...WHILE NAM IS 
FASTER/DRIER. SHORT-RANGE ENSEMBLES DEPICT MAINLY DIURNAL PRECIP 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. DIFFERENCES ARE REFLECTED IN HIGHER POPS 
PROJECTED BY GFS GUIDANCE. MID-LEVEL DRYING DEPICTED BY GFS TIME 
HEIGHTS CASTS SOME DOUBT ON THE RELATIVELY HIGH POPS PROJECTED BY 
ITS GUIDANCE. NEVERTHELESS...MORE BREAKS IN OVERCAST AS SUGGESTED BY 
MID- AND UPPER-LEVEL DRYING WILL ALLOW BETTER SURFACE HEATING. THUS 
DIURNAL COVERAGE AS DEPICTED BY SHORT-RANGE ENSEMBLES SEEMS MOST 
APPROPRIATE. AS A RESULT...GENERALLY FAVORED BLEND OF GUIDANCE 
VALUES FOR POPS. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FAVORED GFS GUIDANCE BASED ON 
RECENT HISTORY.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...RAIN CHANCES WERE LOWERED 
SLIGHTLY FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...SINCE THE WEAK UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGD TO LIFT NE OF THE REGION BY WEDS AFTERNOON... 
AND ALL SHORT RANGE MODELS KEEP THE WEAK COLD FRONT TO OUR NORTH.
GENERALLY GAVE THE WX/POP GRIDS A DIURNAL LOOK FOR THOSE PERIODS
DONT SEE THE MAX TEMPS CLIMBING AS FAST AS THE ETA/NAM MOS INDICATES
...AND AS MENTIONED IN SHORT RANGE THE MAV/GFS MOS HAS PERFORMED 
BEST OF LATE.  POSSIBLY AT LEAST SOME PATCHY AREAS OF FOG LATE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...IF SKIES CLEAR SUFFICIENTLY UNDER VERY LIGHT 
WINDS...BUT DID NOT ADD TO GRIDS JUST YET.    

OTHERWISE...LEFT FRIDAY INTO MONDAY GRIDS UNCHANGED FOR NOW.  BY THE 
NEW DAY 7...ALL LONG RANGE MODELS CURRENTLY INDICATE UPPER TROUGH TO

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
UPPER TROUGH AND UPPER LOW WITH A FEW MINOR SHORTWAVES IN FLOW
CURRENTLY OVER AREA. AIR MASS OVER MUCH OF AREA IS SATURATED AND STABLE.
SHOULD BE TRANSITIONING OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS UPPER LOW BEGINS TO
LIFT OUT OF REGION AND SHEAR AXIS/TROUGH CURRENTLY FROM LAKE ERIE TO
KMEM SAGS INTO AREA. CONDITIONS SHOULD BE MORE UNSTABLE ON TUESDAY AS
UPPER LEVELS START TO DRY OUT. THINKING PRETTY GOOD SHOT AT GOOD
COVERAGE OF PRECIP TUESDAY WITH SHEAR AXIS MOVING INTO PLENTIFUL
MOISTURE. ALSO THINK BETTER CHANCE OF STORMS TUESDAY VERSUS
TODAY...STILL AWAITING FIRST CG TODAY IN OUR CWA.

CLOUDS SHOULD HANG IN MOST OF THE NIGHT TONIGHT TO KEEP FOG FROM GETTING
TOO THICK OVER MUCH OF THE AREA.

SHOULD GET WARMER TUESDAY AS WELL AS SOUPY AIR MASS STARTS TO RETREAT.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY

MOISTURE BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP LOW CHANCE POPS FOR EARLY 
WEDNESDAY EVENING...THEN 20 POPS AFTER MIDNIGHT.  RIDGE BUILDS IN

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWING A COUPLE OF LITTLE DISTURBANCES 
AFFECTING AREA THIS MORNING.  SEEMS TO BE A WEAK CIRC NEAR KBNA WITH 
DRY SLOT PUSHING INTO BACK SIDE OF CONVECTION NEAR KCSV.  ANOTHER 
SMALL CIRC NEAR KCHA WITH DRY SLOT ARCHING FROM NEAR KTYS SWD TO 
NEAR KGVL.  BOTH OF THESE CIRCS APPEAR TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH 
ON-GOING CONVECTION...AND ARE WORKING TO NE AT ABOUT 17 KT.  WOULD 
THINK THAT BEST CHANCES OF ORGANIZED CONVECTION WITH THESE FEATURES 
THIS AFTERNOON WOULD BE IN OUR NORTHWESTERN COUNTIES WITH FEATURE #1 
AND GOING UP APPALACHIAN CHAIN THIS AFTERNOON WITH #2 TO NEAR NE TIP 
OF TN BY 22Z.  BETWEEN THE TWO FEATURES AND FARTHER

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A SLIGHTLY SOGGY NIGHT CONTINUES 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA...ALTHO GENERALLY VERY LIGHT RAINS 
AND NO THUNDER.  THE 08/00Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW THE MID TO UPPER 
LEVEL LOW PRESSURE CENTER LOCATED BETWEEN BMX AND FFC...WHICH WILL 
PROVIDE ANOTHER DAY OF OCCASIONAL SHOWERS FOR OUR REGION.  DID 
CONTINUE JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EARLY EVENING.  THE E-SE LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL PROVIDE EXTRA LIFT AND 
CONVERGENCE FOR HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS...ESPECIALLY SRN MTNS AND 
PLATEAU.  CONCERNING THE PREVIOUS FFA FOR CHEROKEE AND CLAY NC...
I GENERATED 24 HR PCPN ESTIMATES FROM BOTH KHTX AND KMRX.  RADAR 
ESTIMATES OVER ERN CLAY COUNTY NC WERE AROUND 1.5 TO 2.0 INCHES FOR 
24 HRS ENDING AT 04Z TODAY...AND MUCH LESS FROM WRN CLAY COUNTY INTO 
CHEROKEE COUNTY.  THESE AREAS HAVE EXPERIENCED A FEW HOURS BREAK 
WITH NO PCPN AT ALL...AND THINK THAT RAINS TODAY AND EARLY TONIGHT 
WONT BE EXCESSIVE ENOUGH TO CAUSE ANY SIGNIFICANT FLOOD PROBLEMS.

OTHERWISE...RAISED POPS ABOUT 10 TO 20 PERCENT GENERALLY ACROSS THE 
BOARD TODAY...ENDING UP WITH CATEGORICAL VALUES FOR THE SRN 3/4THS 
OF THE FORECAST AREA BY THIS AFTERNOON.  THE UPPER LOW DRIFTS NORTH 
AND THE ESE LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW WEAKENS CONSIDERABLY...SO I 
CONTINUED WITH A DECREASING TREND IN POPS FOR LATE TONIGHT.  CLOUDS 
AND PCPN YESTERDAY REALLY PUT A LID ON MAX TEMPS...ALTHO MAV MOS WAS 
NOT TOO FAR OFF THE MARK.  TEMPTED TO UNDERCUT EVEN THE COOLER MAV 
HIGHS FOR TODAY...BUT THOSE NUMBERS WERE REASONABLE SO I STAYED NEAR 
OR JUST A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW MAV MAX TEMPS.  MINS LOOKED JUST ABOUT 
IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS.  FWC MOS WINDS CAPTURED THE CURRENT 
WEAK NE OR E SURFACE WINDS BEST AND WERE USED.


.LONG TERM...UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE CONTINUES TO INFLUENCE THE REGION
THROUGH TUESDAY BEFORE EXITING THE REGION WEDNESDAY. KEPT POPS ABOVE
SEASONAL NORMS TUESDAY DROPPING BACK TO NORMAL LEVELS BY THURSDAY.
TEMPERATURES WILL QUICKLY REBOUND TO LOWER 90S/UPPER 80S BY MID WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...AREA POISED BETWEEN SYSTEMS WITH WEAK FLOW ALOFT.
MODELS ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH PCPN SOLUTIONS. LOW TO THE SW LOOKS 
TO EJECT AN IMPULSE ALOFT ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTN ALONG EDGE OF 
UPR DIFFLUENT FLOW. LOW LEVEL FLOW SHOULD BECOME CONFLUENT AT OUTER 
EDGES OF EASTERN RIDGE AND SW LOW. CLOUD COVER WILL HINDER HEATING 
BUT FEEL HIGHER POPS ACROSS SOUTHERN AREAS WARRANTED. BOUNDARY TO THE 
NORTH SHOULD BECOME BETTER DEFINED THIS AFTERNOON AND PUSH SLIGHTLY 
SOUTHWARD THIS AFTERNOON AS HIGH PRESSURE NUDGES SOUTH. GOOD SUNSHINE AND 
INCREASED INSTABILITY SHOULD AID IN AFTN TSTM DEVELOPMENT SO WILL 
RAISE POPS ALONG PLATEAU WHERE OROGRAPHIC LIFT HAVE BEEN GENERATING 
SHWRS IN WEAK SFC FLOW.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WHICH 
APPEARS TO BE LOCATED ROUGHLY ACROSS THE SRN THIRD OF KY INTO SW VA 
THIS MORNING...MAY HELP TO FOCUS CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT THIS 
AFTERNOON.  HOWEVER...SHORT RANGE MODELS ALSO DEPICT CONTINUED WEAK 
ESE LOW LEVEL FLOW INTO THE MTN AREAS...DUE TO FLOW BETWEEN THE 
SURFACE RIDGE TO THE NE AND WEAK SURFACE LOW THAT IS PROGD TO 
DEVELOP OVER THE GULF COAST STATES (MAINLY MS/AL).  I WOULD EXPECT 
BEST CONVERGENCE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FRONT OVER NRN MOST 
AREAS AND IN THE MTNS.  MOS POPS SEEMED A BIT LOW...SO NUDGED THESE 
FAVORED AREAS UP TO THE HIGHEST END OF CHANCE POPS WITH SCATTERED 
WORDING FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING.  VALLEY POPS MAY NOT 
BE HIGH ENOUGH CONSIDERING THAT STORM MOTION SHOULD BE W OR NW AT 10 
MPH OR LESS...WHICH SHOULD LET STORMS DRIFT OUT OF THE MTNS TOWARD 
THE VALLEY.  THE WEAK UPPER LOW TO OUR SOUTH...WHICH HPC STATES IS 
HANDLED BETTER BY GFS THAN NAM...MIGHT KEEP CONVECTION GOING 
OVERNIGHT...ALTHO STILL THINK THAT CONVECTION WILL FAVOR DIURNAL 
HOURS. 

YESTERDAYS PCPN PATTERN FOR 24 HOUR RAINFALL FROM MIDNIGHT TO 
MIDNIGHT ONCE AGAIN GENERALLY SHOWED BEST COVERAGE OVER PLATEAU...
SWRN VA AND ERN MOST HIGH TERRAIN AREAS.  ONE SURPRISE AREA OF HEAVY 
RAINS OCCURED IN CENTRAL EAST TN OVER PARTS OF ROANE AND LOUDON 
COUNTIES...WHERE BOTH HTX AND MRX RADARS ESTIMATED AS HIGH AS 4 TO 6 
INCHES OF RAIN MAY HAVE FALLEN.  LOCAL STORM REPORTS ALSO INDICATED 
SOME WET DOWNBURSTS DOWNED A FEW TREES YESTERDAY.  WILL LIKELY 
MENTION SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS TODAY AND ISOLATED DAMAGING WINDS 
WITH STRONGEST STORMS IN THE HWO PRODUCT.

OTHERWISE...THINKING THAT COOLER MOS MAX TEMPS FOR TODAY SHOULD BE 
FAVORED GIVEN THE INCREASE IN MOISTURE CONVERGENCE OVER A LARGE AREA.
MIN TEMPS TONIGHT IN GRIDS WERE CLOSE TO LATEST MOS VALUES AND 
GENERALLY FOLLOWED.  CARRIED A MENTION OF PATCHY FOG EARLY THIS 
MORNING GIVEN THE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS AND LACK OF CLOUDINESS AT THIS 
TIME.   

.LONG TERM...WEAKENING FRONT WILL LINGER TO THE NORTH OF THE REGION WITH
CONTINUED MOISTURE CONVERGENCE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WILL HAVE
CONTINUED ELEVATED PRECIPITATION CHANCES MAINLY IN THE AFTERNOON AND
EVENING HOURS. VERY LITTLE FOCUS OTHER THAN AFTERNOON SCATTERED
CONVECTION SO LIMITED DEVIATION FROM GUIDANCE VALUES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...DIFFERENTIAL HEATING 
AND OROGRAPHIC FLOW PULSING GOOD UPDRAFTS DURING PEAK HEATING ONCE 
AGAIN THIS AFTN/EVE. A PATTERN SHIFT HAS EVOLVED WHICH WILL AFFECT 
WEATHER THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE SHORT TERM. WEAK BOUNDARY AT 
EDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE TO THE NORTH WILL SINK DOWN INTO N MRX CWA ON 
SAT. LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ALONG N GLFMEX BECOMING BETTER DEFINED 
THROUGH SUNDAY. SYSTEM WILL DRIFT N IN TN VLY AND WEAKEN BY LATER IN 
THE PERIOD. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL ENHANCE UPR DIFFLUENCE OVR THE

HIGHER POPS ARE IN THE OFFERING. MODEL THICKNESS VALUES APPEAR TO 
DROP EXCESSIVELY ACROSS THE AREA AND CLOUD COVER LOOKS OVERDONE. 
STAYED ON THE HIGH SIDE OF MOS TEMP GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...GFS INDICATING FRONT LIFTING 
SLOWLY NORTH FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE WEEK.  SHOULD BRING SCATTERED

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. NO UPDATE PLANNED. 

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHORT RANGE MODELS OVERALL SEEM 
TO BE REASONABLE IN KEEPING MAIN CONVECTIVE PCPN TO OUR NORTH CLOSER 
TO THE WEAK COLD FRONT (CURRENTLY ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY REGION) 
TODAY AND EVEN SO AGAIN TONIGHT.  GENERATED USER SELECTABLE PCPN 
PRODUCTS FROM KHTX AND KMRX FOR 24 HOURS ENDING AT 05/00Z...AND 
BELIEVE CONVECTION WILL PROBABLY STICK CLOSE TO THESE SAME AREAS 
AGAIN.  BEST COVERAGE WAS ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU INTO LEE AND 
WISE COUNTIES OF SW VA...AND OTHERWISE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
ALONG THE TN-NC STATE LINE.  PREVIOUS WX/POP GRIDS LOOKED QUITE GOOD 
FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH JUST A SLIGHT DECREASE MADE OVER NRN 
MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS.  DO FEEL THAT BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE NEAR ENOUGH...POSSIBLY NUDGING 
JUST INTO THE FORECAST AREA...TO BE MORE OF A FOCUS FOR DEVELOPMENT 
OF SHRA/TSRA.  

OTHERWISE...LATEST OBSERVATIONS DONT SEEM TO BE TRENDING DOWNWARD 
ENOUGH IN VSBY TO JUSTIFY MENTIONING PATCHY FOG IN THE GRIDS/ZFP
THIS MORNING...SO WILL JUST MONITOR AND COVER WITH SHORT TERM 
FORECASTS IF NEEDED.  MAX TEMPS NUDGED JUST UP A DEGREE OR TWO... 
CLOSER TO YESTERDAYS MAX TEMPS AND GENERALLY A BLEND OF THE MAV/FWC 
VALUES.  MIN TEMPS FOR TONIGHT LOOKED QUITE GOOD AND CLOSE TO LATEST 
MOS VALUES.


LONG TERM...BEST ESTIMATES KEEP FRONT JUST NORTH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. IT WILL REMAIN A FOCUS POINT FOR MOISTURE CONVERGENCE BUT WITH 
LIMITED LIFT FOCUS. THIS MOISTURE IS ENOUGH TO KEEP MODERATE POPS 
THROUGH PERIOD AND SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPS WITH INCREASED CLOUD COVER. 
STAYED NEAR GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS AND OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND AN 
ABSENCE OF CONVECTION ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS AREA OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL LINGER ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH THURSDAY...WITH A 
STAGNANT AND DRY PATTERN EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. WITH THE LACK OF ANY 
STRONG TRIGGERING MECHANISMS EXPECTED...THINK THAT ISOLATED DIURNAL 
CONVECTION SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THE MOUNTAINS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
GENERALLY FOLLOW A PERSISTENCE FORECAST THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH 
OHIO VALLEY FRIDAY AND THEN TRIES TO APPROACH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
LATE AFTERNOON AND FRIDAY NIGHT BEFORE GETTING HUNG UP WITH RIDGING 
OVER THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTH CENTRAL STATES. THE FRONT BECOMES 
STATIONARY OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS THIS WEEKEND AND THEN DISSIPATES
EARLY NEXT WEEK AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHEAST. MOISTURE
INCREASES WITH THE PROXIMITY OF THE FRONT SO WILL INTRODUCE POPS INTO
THE VALLEYS AND INCREASE FOR THE MOUNTAINS FRIDAY. MORE CLOUD COVER AND
RAIN WILL LOWER HIGHS SEVERAL DEGREES ESPECIALLY IN THE MOUNTAINS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
CURRENTLY SCATTERED ACROSS THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND WIDELY 
SCATTERED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS 
WERE LOCATED ACROSS SW VA AND A FEW ALONG THE NORTHERN PLATEAU. NOT 
MUCH CHANGE TO THE CURRENT FORECAST EXPECT TO LOWER POPS SLIGHTLY IN 
THE CHA AREA FROM 50 TO 40 PERCENT EARLY. WITH STORMS MOVING SLOWLY 
SOUTHWEST IT LOOKS LIKE THE BEST COVERAGE WILL BE ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA. DRIER AIR THAT WAS LOCATED TO 
THE WEST HAS BEEN REPLACED BY MORE HUMID CONDITIONS. DEWPOINT 
BOUNDARY HAS SHIFTED NORTH FROM SOUTHERN WV ACROSS CENTRAL KY TO 
SOUTHERN MO. STRONG UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES OVER THE WESTERN AND SOUTH 
CENTRAL STATES WITH WEAK TROUGHING OVER THE NORTHEAST. THE BERMUDA 
HIGH REMAINS OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST. SURFACE HIGH LIES OVER THE 
EASTERN GREAT LAKES AND MOST OF THE OHIO VALLEY. A WEAKNESS WILL 
CONTINUE BETWEEN THE BERMUDA HIGH AND RIDGE TO THE WEST AND CONTINUE 
TO BRING MOISTURE INTO THE FORECAST AREA AS LIFT OCCURS NEAR THE 
MOUNTAINS DURING THE HEATING OF THE DAY FORMING SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS AND THEN MOVES THEM WEST TO SOUTHWEST INTO THE VALLEYS 
OR IN OTHER WORDS ABOUT THE SAME AS YESTERDAYS ACTIVITY. LOCALIZED 
HEAVY RAINFALL AND A FEW STRONG STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MED RANGE MODELS SHOWED RIDING
BUILDING INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS EARLY WEEK WITH SOME DRYING TAKING
PLACE INITIALLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. 
ALSO...EASTERLY WINDS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CENTRAL APPALACHIAN HIGH 
WILL PRODUCE WEAK DOWNSLOPE WINDS INTO THE NORTH AND CENTRAL VALLEY. END
RESULT WILL BE MINIMAL CHANCES OF AFTERNOON/EVENING CONVECTION FOR 
TRI AND TYS AREAS THROUGH WEDNESDAY. BEST CHANCES OF CONVECTION WILL 
BE ACROSS THE SOUTH...FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS (GENERALLY 
SMOKYS SOUTHWARD)...AND PLATEAU WHERE MOISTURE WILL BE A LITTLE 
DEEPER AND SOME UPSLOPE FLOW IS ANTICIPATED.

FOR LATE FRIDAY INTO NEXT WEEKEND...MODELS HINT OF A WEAK/DISSIPATING
FRONT MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA WITH INCREASING PWS. WILL 
INCREASE POPS TO CHANCE AREA-WIDE FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. 
HOWEVER...CONFIDENCE OF FRONT MAKING IT INTO THE REGION LOW GIVEN 
TIME OF THE YEAR.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...MORE SEASONAL HIGHS AND LOWS ANTICIPATED. DOWNSLOPE
INTO THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE GREAT TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL ADD A FEW 
DEGREES.

AIRMASS IS QUITE UNSTABLE BUT MAIN FOCUS IS EAST OF THE

BORDER OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH LESS CLOUD COVER IN THE DRIER AIR

ISOLATED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY FROM DIFFERENTIAL 
HEATING IN THE VALLEYS WITH A BIT MORE COVERAGE IN THE EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS CLOSER TO WEAKENING UPPER TROUGH OVER THE CAROLINAS. 
MODELS STRENGTHEN BERMUDA HIGH AS TROUGH WEAKENS. DEEP MOISTURE MAY 
SHIFT A LITTLE FARTHER WEST ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC SUNDAY SO RAISED 
POPS AT CHA ABOUT 10 PERCENT. LOWS TONIGHT AND HIGHS SUNDAY ABOUT 
NORMAL. SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL MOVE SLOWLY AND A FEW AREAS MAY HAVE 
MINOR FLOODING PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY ACROSS SW VA.  


.LONG TERM...THE FORECAST AREA REMAINS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE
BERMUDA HIGH FOR MOST OF THE NEXT 7 DAYS...BEGINNING TO WEAKEN TOWARDS

318 PM EDT FRI JUL 29 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY AND A WEAK 
COLD FRONT OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES. THE FRONT LOOKS TO BE 
SOMEWHERE NEAR THE APPALACHIAN CREST. DRIER AIR IS LAGGING BEHIND 
THE FRONT ABOUT 150 MILES WITH LOWER DEWPOINTS FROM THE PLATEAU 
WEST. TEMPERATURES ARE ABOUT 5 DEGREES COOLER TODAY AT THE SAME TIME 
AS YESTERDAY AND CLOUDS HAVE HELD IN KEEPING CONVECTION MORE 
LIMITED. RUC MODEL INDICATES MAIN SHORTWAVES ARE ACROSS NORTH AL AND 
WESTERN NC. RADAR INDICATING MAINLY SHOWERS OVER HIGHER TERRAIN OF 
SW VA AND NE TN AND ALSO THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS OF 
SOUTHEAST TN AT MID AFTERNOON. AGREE MORE WITH NAM GUIDANCE WITH  
LESS PRECIPITATION COVERAGE TONIGHT THAN YESTERDAY AND ONLY SLIGHT 
CHANCE SHOWERS IN THE FOOTHILLS AND CHANCE IN THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS 
TOMORROW AS BEST LIFT AND SHORTWAVES WILL BE EAST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE A LITTLE WARMER SATURDAY WITH 
LESS CLOUD COVER TOO. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...DEEPER MOISTURE STAYS 
JUST TO OUR E AND S...ALTHO SUFFICIENT LINGERING MOISTURE AND 
INSTABILITY FOR SOME CONCERN THAT CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION (PCPN) 
COULD DEVELOP OUTSIDE OF THE MTN AREAS OVER THE WEEKEND.  THE UPPER 
FLOW IS NEARLY ZONAL ACROSS THE NRN MOST STATES...WITH RIDGING 
ACROSS THE WRN STATES...WHICH PLACES OUR FORECAST AREA IS THE 
USUALLY TROUBLESOME WEAK NW FLOW ALOFT.  GFS AND NGM MODELS DEPICT 
AT LEAST LIGHT QPF SPREADING BACK WEST INTO OUR AREA BY SUNDAY... 
WHILE ETA/NAM WOULD KEEP ANY PCPN CONFINED TO OUR ERN MTNS 
EASTWARD.  AT THE SURFACE...MODELS EITHER SHOW A WEAK SURFACE LOW 
DEVELOPING ALONG THE MAIN FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO OUR SOUTH...OR PERHAPS 
JUST A WEAK TROUGH AXIS NWD INTO WRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA.  
CURRENT GRIDS ARE MORE IN LINE WITH ETA/NAM...WITH GENERAL AGREEMENT 
AND FIT WITH NEIGHBORING GRIDS (DID MAKE SLIGHT POP ADJUSTMENTS TO 
MESH WITH FFC...GSP AND RNK INTO MONDAY).

OTHERWISE...UPPER RIDGE DOES NOT SEEM TO BUILD INTO THE REGION INTO 
NEXT WEEK (KEEPING WEAK NW FLOW ALOFT)...AND TIME HEIGHT SECTIONS 
SHOW CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE...SO I KEPT OUR MAX TEMPS A LITTLE BELOW 
HPC VALUES.  WENT CLOSE TO HPC POPS FOR THU AND FRI...BUT IF UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH DOES DEVELOP BY LATE THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY...THEN POPS 
WILL NEED TO BE RAISED.  HOWEVER...BOTH THE UPPER LEVEL AND SURFACE 
PATTERNS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO FORECAST WITH A GOOD DEGREE OF 
CONFIDENCE AT THIS POINT.

.DISCUSSION...WEAK COLD FRONT IS STALLED OVER EASTERN TN THIS 
MORNING. CONVECTION HAS BEEN OCCURRING OUT AHEAD OF THE BOUNDARY 
OVER SW NC AND EXTREME SE TN THE PAST FEW HOURS WITH HEAVY RAINFALL 
AMOUNTS IN NORTH GA. THE CONTINUING QUESTION IS...WHERE WILL 
CONVECTION FIRE ACROSS FORECAST AREA AS THE FRONT GET PUSHED EAST.  
ONE SHORTWAVE IS CAUSING ACTIVITY RIGHT NOW OVER SW NC. ANOTHER WEAK 
SHORTWAVE SHOULD MOVE OFF THE PLATEAU INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY BY 
EARLY TO MID AFTERNOON AND MOVE INTO THE MOUNTAINS BY LATE AFTERNOON 
OR EARLY EVENING. THE AIRMASS EAST OF THE PLATEAU IS ALREADY WEAKLY 
UNSTABLE...ABOUT THE SAME AS YESTERDAY. A FEW SEVERE STORMS ARE 
AGAIN POSSIBLE AND ISOLATED FLOODING PROBLEMS ESPECIALLY EASTERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA AND ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. CURRENT 
SATELLITE SHOWS SHARP EDGE TO CLOUDINESS ON WEST SIDE OF PLATEAU 
WITH SOME BREAKS OVER THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND PLATEAU. CURRENT 
FORECAST HAS HIGHS TODAY ABOUT 5 DEGREES COOLER. WILL RAISE HIGHS A 
COUPLE DEGREES AND WILL RAISE POPS TO LIKELY SW NC AND SE TN AND

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT)...FRONT STALLED WEST OF AREA ALONG
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. BIG QUESTION IS...WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO FRONT TODAY
AND THEREFORE THE STABILITY OF THE AIR MASS IN THE REGION? TO ANSWER
THAT QUESTION...THINKING WHAT WOULD PLAY ROLE IN FRONTAL MOVEMENT? A
COUPLE OF SHORT WAVES MOVE THROUGH THE AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT THAT ARE
EXPECTED TO NUDGE UPPER TROUGH FARTHER EAST. GENERAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN
MODELS THAT BY 12Z SAT UPPER TROUGH WILL BE EAST OF MOUNTAINS. GETTING
BACK TO FRONTAL LOCATION...THINK THAT FRONT WILL HOLD WEST AT LEAST
UNTIL AFTER EARLY AFTERNOON DEEP CONVECTION STARTS...THEREFORE HAVE
BUMPED UP THE POPS ON THE PLATEAU FOR THIS AFTERNOON. AFTER INITIAL
STORMS MOVE TO EAST THINK SHOW WILL BE OVER FOR THE MOST PART FOR
WESTERN AREAS. THINKING FRONT WILL SETTLE SOUTH AND EAST OF AREA BY SAT
12Z. MADE ONLY 1-2 DEGREE TWEAKS TO PRFEVIOUS TEMP/DEWPOINT GRIDS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...SFC BOUNDARY LINGERS JUST S 
AND E OF THE FA EARLY IN THE PERIOD BUT MOVES AWAY JUST OFF THE 
SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC COAST BY SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY. LOWERED POPS 
AREAWIDE EVEN DROPPING ACROSS MOST OF THE FA THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT AS 
AIRMASS DRIES A BIT ON UPPER NW FLO AS UPR TROF SLIPS E TO THE 
PIEDMONT/COASTAL PLAIN. KEPT SOME SLGT AND LOW CHC POPS ALONG MTNS 
BORDERING NC THROUGH THIS PERIOD AS MOISTURE/INSTABILITY STILL 
REMAINS HIGH ENOUGH ALONG WITH OROGRAPHIC LIFTING TO KEEP MENTION OF 
A SHRA/TSRA IN FCST. LOW LVL ELY FLO DEVELOPS LATE IN THE WEEKEND 
AND STRENGTHENS INTO TUESDAY AND THEREFORE SLGT THROUGH CHC POPS 
WERE RE-APPLIED FA AREA-WIDE. GFS INDICATES PRESSURES INCREASE 
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE OH VLY THROUGH THE MID 
ATLANTIC BRINGING COOLER GREAT LAKES AIRMASS TO A HALT ALONG WITH 
ITS ATMOSPHERIC LIFTING ABILITIES. EVER SO SLIGHTLY TWEAKED MAX/MIN

FRONT APPEARS ON REGIONAL RADAR COMPOSITE. EVEN A FEW CELLS ARE 
STILL POPPING UP AHEAD OF THE FRONT IN NORTHERN MIDDLE TN. 
PREVIOUSLY TONIGHT WELL DEFINED, IN FACT BEAUTIFUL, OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES WERE ALL OVER THE FORECAST AREA. WORST SEVERE WEATHER OF

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...A COLD FRONT OVER WEST 
TENNESSEE...IS SLOWLY WORKING ITS WAY EAST.  AHEAD OF THE 
FRONT...THE AIR MASS REMAINS WARM...MOIST AND UNSTABLE.  IN ADVANCE 
OF THE FRONT...SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ARE FORMING AND WILL MOVE 
INTO THE MRX CWA LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  LI/S ARE BETWEEN 
-4 AND -6 AND CAPES GENERALLY ABOVE 2000J...AND THERE REMAINS THE 
POTENTIAL FOR ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS.  THE COLD FRONT SHOULD REACH 
INTO THE AREA OVERNIGHT WITH ASSOCIATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
CONTINUING ALONG AND JUST AHEAD OF THE FRONT.  THE FRONT SHOULD 
STALL OVER THE AREA...PROVIDING CONTINUED DYNAMICS FOR CONVECTION ON 
THURSDAY.  A MINOR COOLING TREND IS EXPECTED WITH THE FRONT...WITH 
THURSDAY/S TEMPERATURES A DEGREE TO TWO COOLER THAN TODAY/S.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
DEVELOPING FROM ERN CANADA SOUTHWARD...IS SHOWN TO EXTEND INTO THE 
TN VALLEY BY 12Z FRIDAY...THEN SOUTHERN END OF THIS TROUGH LINGERS 
WELL INTO THE WEEKEND.  THIS FACTOR PLUS SOME UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW 
FAR SOUTH THE WEAK COLD FRONT PUSHES...LEADS TO THE NEED TO CARRY AT 
LEAST CHANCE POPS INTO MONDAY.  DECIDED TO CARRY LOWER END OF LIKELY 
POPS FOR EXTREME ERN MOST MTNS DAYTIME FRIDAY DUE TO EXPECTED 
CONVERGENCE...AND TO ALSO BETTER MESH WITH NEIGHBORING GRIDS FROM 
GSP/RNK.  

BY TUESDAY...THERE WOULD APPEAR TO BE JUST A WEAK SHEAR AXIS LEFT OF

WEAK FRONT NOTED ON HPC PROGS COULD BE A WEAK FOCUS FOR CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT BY THAT TIME...BUT THIS IS TOO FAR OUT TO TIME WITH ANY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL SLOWLY SHIFT EAST OF THE MRX CWA TONIGHT.  HOWEVER...STRONG 
SUBSIDENCE REMAINS IN PLACE THIS EVENING...SUPPRESSING CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT.  A COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO REACH INTO THE EAST 
TENNESSEE AREA WEDNESDAY LATE AFTERNOON.  ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
APPROACHING FRONT...INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND LOWERING 
HEIGHTS...WILL RESULT IN SLIGHTLY LOWER AFTERNOON HIGH TEMPERATURES. 
ADDITIONALLY...THE AIR MASS WILL BECOME MODERATELY UNSTABLE WITH 
LI/S OF -4 TO -5 AND CAPES NEAR 2000.  WITH THE ADDED LIFT FROM THE 
ADVANCING FRONT...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED 
TO FORM...AND SOME OF THESE STORMS MAY BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...THE FRONT WILL 
STALL OUT OVER THE AREA BRINGING AN INCREASED CHANCE OF 
PRECIPITATION INTO THE WEEKEND.  TEMPERATURES WILL MODERATE SOMEWHAT 
AS COMPARED TO THE LAST FEW DAYS.  BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND AND 
INTO THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK...MORE SEASONAL CONDITIONS WILL 
RETURN WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN IN THE AFTERNOON.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS REVEALS A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHEAST REGION...WITH DEWPOINTS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THIS TIME YESTERDAY. AN UPPER- 
LEVEL HIGH REMAINS CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
THIS MORNING...BUT IT SHOULD GRADUALLY BEGIN TO WEAKEN TODAY AS AN 
UPPER TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY AND PUSHES A 
COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE REGION. MOS TEMP GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO INSIST 
THAT TEMPS WILL RISE INTO THE 95 TO 100 DEGREE RANGE ACROSS MOST OF 
THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...BUT WILL GENERALLY FORECAST HIGHS TO RISE 
ONLY A DEGREE ABOVE YESTERDAYS READINGS. ALTHOUGH THE SOIL MOISTURE 
HAS BEEN SLOWLY DRYING WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES EXPECTED...THINK THAT 
THE WEAKENING UPPER HIGH AND POSSIBLE HIGH CLOUD DEBRIS FROM ANY
ISOLATED CONVECTION SHOULD KEEP TEMPS FROM WARMING TOO MUCH ABOVE 
THOSE OBSERVED YESTERDAY. WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS 
EXPECTED TO DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AND SUBSIDENCE BEGINNING TO RELAX 
A BIT...THINK THAT ISOLATED CONVECTION COULD DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

ON WEDNESDAY...THE COLD FRONT SHOULD BE LOCATED GENERALLY ALONG THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY...AND MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS. A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS IS EXPECTED TO 
DEVELOP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF THIS FRONT...AND THINK 
THAT A FEW SEVERE TSTORMS WITH DAMAGING WINDS WILL BE POSSIBLE. 
LATEST GFS MODEL RUN INDICATES THAT THIS COLD FRONT WILL STALL-OUT 
ALONG THE MOUNTAINS...WHICH IS MORE REALISTIC THAN YESTERDAYS 
SOLUTION WHICH SHOWED THE FRONT STALLING-OUT OVER THE CAROLINAS. 
THUS...IT APPEARS THAT A CHANCE OF CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE 
MOUNTAINS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...STRONG HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE
POSITIONED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TONIGHT WILL SLOWLY
SHIFT TO EASTWARD ON TUESDAY. CONTINUED HIGH HEIGHTS AND ABUNDANT
DAYTIME HEATING WILL PRODUCE ANOTHER HOT AND HUMID DAY FOR TUESDAY. AIR

CONTINUING...CONVECTION WILL BE LIMITED. FOR NOW...WILL EXPECT
CONVECTION TO BE LIMITED TO A SLIGHT CHANCE OVER HIGHER TERRAIN.


.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY WILL SEE AN INCREASING CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS
WITH THE FRONT APPROACHING AND COOLER TEMPERATURES ALOFT ADDING TO THE
INSTABILITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE. A COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA
WEDNESDAY AND SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE AREA BY LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
TEMPERATURES COOLING A LITTLE WEDNESDAY WITH INCREASING CLOUD COVER AND
COOLER AGAIN ON THURSDAY AND BEYOND AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE. POPS THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
REVEALS A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION...WITH A WARM AND HUMID AIRMASS REMAINING OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA. A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL HIGH CENTERED OVER THE LOWER 
MS RIVER VALLEY THIS MORNING...WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY MOVE EAST 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY AND TUESDAY. MOS TEMP GUIDANCE 
CONTINUES TO INSIST THAT TEMPS WILL RISE INTO THE 95 TO 100 DEGREE 
RANGE TODAY AND TUESDAY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THE FAIRLY HIGH 
SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT AND HIGH CLOUD DEBRIS FROM CONVECTION OVER THE 
GREAT LAKES AND MID ATLANTIC REGIONS HAVE LIKELY BEEN THE CULPRITS 
FOR THE COOLER TEMPS OBSERVED OVER THIS WEEKEND. WITH THE UPPER- 
LEVEL HIGH EXPECTED TO BECOME CENTERED OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON...THINK THAT TEMPS SHOULD RISE A FEW DEGREES HIGHER THAN 
YESTERDAY. HOWEVER...WILL STILL PLAN TO UNDERCUT ALL GUIDANCE BY 
THREE TO FOUR DEGREES. ALTHOUGH CLOUDS SHOULD INCREASE A LITTLE BIT 
ON TUESDAY...THINK THAT HIGHS WILL BE FAIRLY SIMILAR TO TODAYS 
EXPECTED HIGHS...SINCE THE SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT WILL BE SLOWLY 
DRYING OUT. 

AS FOR POSSIBLE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY...MODELS REVEAL A VERY UNSTABLE 
AIRMASS DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON...BUT STRONG SUBSIDENCE ALOFT WITH 
THE UPPER HIGH SHOULD SUPPRESS ANY CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. ON TUESDAY...SUBSIDENCE BEGINS TO RELAX A BIT...SO THINK 
THAT ISOLATED CONVECTION COULD DEVELOP...MAINLY ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS.


.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...ON WEDNESDAY CAPPING INVERSION
WILL CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AND WOULD EXPECT UNSTABLE AIR MASS TO RESPOND
WITH GOOD COVERAGE OF STORMS EARLY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. DONT KNOW IF MODE WILL
BE A LINE OF STORMS SINCE...FRONT MAY NOT BE IN CWA YET...AS MUCH AS
SIMPLY CONVECTION STARTING IN LOCALLY FAVORED AREAS...ESPECIALLY ON THE
PLATEAU THEN MOVING ENEWD IN FLOW. WEDNESDAY EVENING THINK THE FRONT
WILL GET INVOLVED AND VERY WELL COULD GET A LINE OF STORMS ACROSS THE
AREA. FOR PEAK HEATING ON WEDNESDAY...EXPECTING CAPE VALUES AOA 2500
J/KG IF WE CAN GET UP TO FORECAST HIGH TEMPS.

THINK FRONT WILL MAKE IT MOST OF THE WAY ACROSS CWA WEDNESDAY
NIGHT...BUT MAY HANG IN MOUNTAINS THURSDAY...FINALLY THURSDAY NIGHT
LOOKS SAFE TO SAY FRONT WILL BE SOUTH/EAST OF CWA. WITH UPPER TROF
SETTLING INTO AREA...UNSETTLED WX WITH SOME CONVECTION CAN BE EXPECTED
INTO THE WEEKEND.

ANOTHER MCS MAY DEVELOP WITH SHORTWAVE MOVING THROUGH PA THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...TEMPS ACROSS SWRN VA AND 
NE TN ARE FINALLY STARTING TO HEAT UP...HAVING BEEN INHIBITED BY 
PATCHY MID TO HIGH CLOUDS FOR MUCH OF THE DAY.  HEAT INDICES OTHER 
THAN AT CHA...HAVE YET TO GO ABOVE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S.  SHOULD 
BE ANOTHER DAY THAT WE OUT PERFORM MOS WHICH HAS BEEN TOO HOT EACH 
DAY.  HOWEVER...BELIEVE THAT OUR FORECASTED HIGHS WILL END UP CLOSE 
FOR TODAY...WITH A LITTLE WARMING TOMORROW AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER HEAT 
INDICES.  LOW LEVEL FLOW BECOMES WEAK SW BY TUESDAY AND TIME HEIGHT 
SECTIONS SHOW AN INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE.  HOWEVER...RIDGING 
HOLDS STRONG AND THE WARM AIR ALOFT SHOULD STILL SERVE TO CAP ANY 
SIGNIFICANT CONVECTION FROM DEVELOPING.  THUS...DECIDED TO LIMIT 
POPS (20% OR SO) TO JUST THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS TUESDAY AFTERNOON.
POPS WERE REMOVED FROM ALL VALLEY LOCATIONS FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON.

OTHERWISE...FOR TONIGHT...CLOUDS HAVE THINNED BUT KEPT JUST A FEW 
MORE CLOUDS IN THE FAR NE AREAS...IN CASE MORE CONVECTION DEVELOPS 
OVER CENTRAL APPALACHIANS AND DRIFT OUR WAY.  TOSSED IN PATCHY 
VALLEY FOG IN AREAS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME LATE NIGHT FOG OVER 
THE PAST COUPLE OF MORNINGS.  KEPT MINS VERY NEAR PERSISTENCE VALUES.

ONLY MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO REMAINING HIGHS AND LOWS EACH PERIOD...
GENERALLY STAYING ABOUT 1 TO 3 DEGREES BELOW THE HOTTER MAX TEMPS.  
THE SEGMENTED SPS WAS ALREADY UPDATED...AND ALL GRID/WEB PRODUCTS 
HAVE BEEN SENT FOR THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...RIDGING DROPS 
SOUTHEAST TO THE GULF/ATLANTIC COASTAL REGION BY WEDNESDAY ALLOWING 
A SLOW RETURN OF DEEP MOISTURE AHEAD OF FRONTAL BOUNDARY WHICH IS 
BELIEVED TO MAKE PROGRESS INTO THE FA ON THURSDAY. WILL USE HIGHEST 
POPS 30-40 PERCENT WED/THU WITH FRONTAL MOVEMENT INTO THE REGION AND 
THEN TAPER BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE ESPECIALLY NORTHERN SECTIONS 
INCLUDING THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SW VA/NE TN FRI-SUN AS 
DRIER AIR FILTERS INTO THIS AREA AND MAINTAIN SLIGHT TO CHANCE TYPE 
POPS DURING THIS PERIOD FOR THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FA AS THE 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIPS INTO THIS REGION AND WEAKENS BY SUNDAY. 
STAYED A FEW DEGREES BELOW MEX MOS MAX TEMP GUIDANCE AS IT APPEARS 
THAT THERMO NUCLEAR WARMING IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTING FOR THE PAST 
SEVERAL DAYS IS OUT TO LUNCH AND BELIEVE THIS TREND WILL MAINTAIN 
ITSELF.

FOG AGAIN THIS MORNING...ONCE AGAIN IN MOST OF THE SEQUATCHIE VALLEY
...ALONG THE CLINCH RIVER IN SCOTT AND RUSSELL COUNTIES OF SW VA... 
AND AROUND THE TRI CITIES AIRPORT.  PATCHY MID TO HIGH CLOUDS...FROM 
THE MCS ACTIVITY TO OUR NORTH...ARE PASSING ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN 
THIS MORNING.  LOW TEMPS THIS MORNING WERE AS LOW AS LOW TO MID 60S 
ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN WHERE SOME SLIGHT DRYING OF DEWPOINTS 
OCCURRED...AND GENERALLY IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S ACROSS MUCH 
OF THE REMAINING AREAS.  14Z TEMPS SEEM TO BE RUNNING A DEGREE OR 
TWO BEHIND YESTEDAY...BUT EXPECT THIS TREND TO BE QUICKLY OVERCOME 
AS 12Z OHX/RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW VERY WARM AIR IN THE LOW LEVELS.  THE 
CAPPING INVERSION LOOKS EXTREMELY STRONG FROM OHX SOUNDING...SO IN 
SPITE OF A SLIGHT INCREASE IN PRECIPITABLE WATER...NO CONVECTIVE 
PRECIPITATION (PCPN) IS ANTICIPATED.

WILL PLOT OUT HIGH TEMPS FROM YESTERDAY...AND CHECK AGAINST 
FORECASTED HIGHS FOR TODAY...TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ALLOWING FOR A
COUPLE OF DEGREES WARMER ACROSS THE BOARD.  AN INTERESTING NOTE IS 
THAT WE WERE CORRECT IN THINKING THAT ALL MOS GUIDANCE WAS LIKELY 
TOO WARM FOR THIS WEEKEND MAX TEMPS.  THE AVERAGE ERROR FROM 
NGM/ETA/MAV MOS FOR YESTERDAY AT 3 MAIN SITES WAS JUST OVER 4 
DEGREES TOO WARM.

WILL CHECK GRIDS AND SEE IF JUST A MINOR ADJUSTMENT OR TWO ARE NEEDED
FOR CURRENT TEMPS/DEWPOINTS/ETC.

REVEALS A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC

DEWPOINTS HAVE LOWERED OVERNIGHT ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST 
VA...BUT THINK THAT THEY WILL SLOWLY RISE AGAIN TONIGHT INTO MONDAY 
WITH SOUTHWEST WINDS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP. A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL HIGH 
OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY MOVE EAST 
TOWARD THE TN RIVER VALLEY TODAY. THIS UPPER HIGH SHOULD BECOME

A COUPLE OF DEGREES WARMER THAN TODAYS EXPECTED HIGHS. STRONG 
SUBSIDENCE ALOFT COMBINED WITH A DECENT CAPPING INVERSION SHOULD 
HELP TO SUPPRESS ANY POSSIBLE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY THROUGH MONDAY 
NIGHT. MODELS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP A FEW MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS

THEM SOUTHEAST INTO THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. THINK THAT WITH THE 
UPPER HIGH IN THE REGION...IT SHOULD DEFLECT ANY MCS ACTIVITY AWAY 
FROM THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT.

FROM APPROACHING UPPER TROUGH START TO COOL COLUMN.  STILL PLAN ON 
TUESDAY AS VERY WARM WITH WEDNESDAY BEING A TRANSITION DAY TO A 
DEFINITELY COOLER DAY ON THURSDAY.  DECENT CHANCE OF SEVERE STORMS 
WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS CAP ERODES FROM NORTHWEST OVER 
STEAMY BOUNDARY LAYER AIR.  HARD TO KNOW AT THIS POINT HOW FAR SOUTH

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MAIN CONCERN CONTINUES TO BE 
THE BUILDING UPPER RIDGE AND ASSOCIATED SUBSIDENCE/WARMING.  ACTUAL 
TEMPS HAVE ALREADY WARMED FROM 1 TO 3 DEGREES ABOVE MAX TEMPS ON 
FRIDAY...ALTHO HEAT INDICES SO FAR ARE JUST INTO THE 90 TO 95 DEGREE 
RANGE OVER OUR FORECAST AREA.  DEWPOINT TEMPS HAVE LOWERED SLIGHTLY 
HELPING TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF OF THE HEAT INDICES...MAINLY OVER 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND SWRN VA.  DID NOTICE THAT MOS DEWPOINTS 
GENERALLY WERE TOO LOW INITIALLY ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA 
...ESPECIALLY GFS/MAV.   

SOME MODERATE CUMULUS CLOUDS NOTED BUT RAINFREE ON AREA RADARS THIS 
AFTERNOON.  PLAN TO RUN WITH A DRY FORECAST RIGHT INTO MONDAY AT 
THIS POINT.  DONT SEE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT OF ANY MCS ACTIVITY 
REACHING THIS FAR SOUTH ON SUNDAY NIGHT...AND THE ATMOSPHERE LOOKS 
DRY AND TOO WARM ALOFT FOR ANY CONVECTION DURING THE AFTERNOONS AND 
EVENINGS.  

OTHERWISE...ADDED SOME PATCHY VALLEY FOG FOR MAINLY THE SEQUATCHIE 
VALLEY AND NRN VALLEY AREAS LATE TONIGHT...SIMILAR TO WHAT OCCURRED 
THIS MORNING.  MIN TEMPS WERE ADJUSTED CLOSE TO PERSISTENCE...WITH 
MAX TEMPS ALLOWED TO WARM 1 TO 3 DEGREES EACH DAY.

ISSUED ALREADY.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
1010 AM EDT SAT JUL 23 2005

.DISCUSSION...MORNING UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW THAT THE UPPER RIDGE IS 
STILL GENERALLY JUST TO OUR WEST...KEEPING THE FORECAST AREA UNDER 
WEAK NW FLOW ALOFT.  THE 12Z OHX SOUNDING IS STARTING TO SHOW THE 
EFFECTS OF THE RIDGING...AS LAYER FROM 850 TO 700 MBS HAS WARMED 
CONSIDERABLY FROM YESTERDAY.  MEANWHILE...FURTHER EAST THE 12Z RNK 
SOUNDING SHOWS LESS WARMING ALOFT AND A WEAKER CAP.  ANOTHER MAJOR 
CHANGE NOTED FROM 12Z SOUNDINGS IS THE BIG REDUCTION IN PRECIPITABLE 
WATER VALUES...WITH OHX DOWN FROM 1.70 INCHES TO 1.17 INCHES...AND 
RNK DOWN FROM 1.81 INCHES TO 0.98 INCHES.  THIS MOISTURE DROP AND 
STRONGER CAPPING INVERSION SHOULD SUPPRESS ANY CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH THE DRY FORECAST.

NOTICED THAT MOS HAS BEEN RUNNING A FEW DEGREES TOO WARM ON HIGHS 
EACH DAY...BUT THIS TREND COULD END TODAY GIVEN THE DRYING THAT HAS 
OCCURRED.  HOWEVER...THE MOIST SOIL MUST STILL BE FACTORED IN...AND
SHOULD KEEP HIGHS DOWN A BIT.

DOES NOT APPEAR THAT A MORNING UPDATE IS NEEDED...BUT WILL LOOK OVER 
THE GRIDS FOR ANY POSSIBLE MINOR TWEAKS.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
326 AM EDT SAT JUL 23 2005

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS REVEALS A 
HUMID AIRMASS REMAINING OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH YESTERDAYS 
WEAK COLD FRONT EVIDENTLY WASHED-OUT AS IT REMAINS HARD TO FIND 
ACROSS THE REGION. MODELS INDICATE THAT A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE 
OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL SLOWLY MOVE EAST 
TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. THIS WILL CAUSE TEMPS TO RISE TO 
THEIR WARMEST LEVELS SO FAR THIS YEAR. STRONG SUBSIDENCE ALOFT 
COMBINED WITH A CAPPING INVERSION SHOULD HELP TO SUPPRESS ANY 
POSSIBLE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT THE COOLER GFS MOS NUMBERS BY 
A DEGREE TODAY...SINCE THE FAIRLY HIGH SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA SHOULD HELP TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF WARMING. THESE 
HIGH TEMPS COMBINED WITH HIGH DEWPOINTS SHOULD CREATE AFTERNOON HEAT 
INDICES IN THE 95 TO 100 DEGREE RANGE ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER HIGH CONTINUES THROUGH 
MONDAY THEN STARTS TO FADE OFF TO THE SOUTHEAST.  FOR SUNDAY...BIG 
QUESTION IS THE POSSIBILITY OF MCS REMNANTS FROM GRT LKS HEADING 
SOUTHWARD AFFECTING AREA.  GFS SHOWS THIS...BUT NO OTHER MODELS.  
WILL IGNORE GFS/MAV POPS AND COOLER TEMPS FOR SUNDAY AT THIS TIME 
AND KEEP US UNDER COVER OF RIDGE.  BY MONDAY...HI CENTER SPENDS THE 
DAY AT GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS NP...SO ANY MCS ACTIVITY WOULD BE 
DIRECTED WELL AROUND CWA, ETC.  ALSO ON MONDAY SURFACE FLOW LOOKS 
LIKE IT MAY START ALLOWING EVEN HIGHER DEW POINTS TO GET BACK INTO 
THE AREA AGAIN.  HEAT INDEX CRANKS UP TO ABOUT 107 DEGREES AT KCHA 
ON MONDAY.  MINIMUM TEMPS STILL TOO COOL TO CONSIDER HEAT 
ADVISORY...WILL KEEP SPS GOING.  

FOR TUESDAY...UPPER HIGH STARTS TO SLIDE OFF...BUT EASTERN PART OF CWA
WILL LIKELY STILL BE UNDER STRONG INFLUENCE OF IT. BUMPED UP HIGH TEMPS
IN EASTERN TIER OR TWO A LITTLE CLOSER TO MONDAY TEMPS.

257 PM EDT FRI JUL 22 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...CURRENT RADAR SHOWS VERY 
LITTLE COVERAGE AT THE MOMENT.  WILL PROBABLY CARRY 20 POPS FOR 
EARLY THIS EVENING...BUT MAY ADJUST BASED ON LATEST RADAR AT THE 
LAST MINUTE.  HEIGHTS RISE AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN THROUGH 
SATURDAY. LOOKS LIKE SUBSIDENCE AND DEEP LAYER DRYING SHOULD KEEP 
TOMORROW DRY.  WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS...BUT WILL CUT A 
COUPLE OF DEGREES OFF CHA HIGH TEMP FOR TOMORROW.  


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MEDIUM TO LONG RANGE 
MODELS CONSISTENT IN BUILDING UPPER RIDGE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS WEEKEND INTO TUESDAY.  AFTER CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF DRYING 
AND SUBSIDENCE WARMING...IT SEEMS THAT CONVECTION WILL BE INHIBITED
BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.  A STRAY SHOWER OR STORM MIGHT TRY TO 
DEVELOP IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN...BUT SHOULD BE SHORT LIVED AND VERY 
ISOLATED SATURDAY EVENING AND ALSO SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 
THUS...WE DECIDED TO REMOVE THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EVEN FOR THE 
MTNS/HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS FOR THOSE PERIODS.

RIDGE WEAKENS AS UPPER TROUGH DEVELOPS ACROSS THE MID TO UPPER MISS 
VALLEY REGION BY TUESDAY NIGHT.  ASSOCIATED FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS 
PROGGED TO SETTLE JUST INTO NRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THEN POSSIBLY MOVE AS FAR SOUTH AS SRN TN BORDER 
BY 12Z FRIDAY.  OF COURSE MUCH UNCERTAINTY IN TIMING A FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY IN THE SUMMER...ESPECIALLY SO FAR OUT.  HOWEVER...FOR NOW 
POPS/WX WERE ADJUSTED TO FIT THIS SCENARIO...AND DEWPOINT TEMPS WERE 
ALLOWED TO DECREASE SLIGHTLY FROM WEDS NIGHT INTO FRIDAY.  ALSO... 
RAISED POPS ON TUE AND WED TO BETTER MESH WITH NEIGHBORS AND HPC 
FORECAST.

OTHERWISE...WARMEST TEMPS OF THE SEASON ON TRACK FOR SAT THRU 
TUE...AND WILL UPDATE THE SPS ON THIS SUBJECT.  MIN TEMPS AND 
DEWPOINT TEMPS ARE A BIT TRICKY...ESPECIALLY IF THE MIXING OF DRY 
AIR FROM ALOFT LEADS TO LOWER DEWPOINTS THAN ANTICIPATED.  THIS 
WOULD LEND SOME SUPPORT TO MOS MIN TEMPS AS LOW AS UPPER 50S TO 
LOWER 60S IN NRN AREAS.

352 AM EDT FRI JUL 22 2005

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MID WEST...WITH A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE COMPLEX 
(MCS) OVER NORTHERN KY. THIS MCS SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE SOUTHEAST 
AND INTO THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...BUT THINK IT SHOULD 
CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AS IT MOVES INTO A MORE STABLE AIRMASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. THE PERSISTENT TSTORM COMPLEX OVER THE NORTHERN 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU SHOULD ALSO HELP TO STABILIZE THE LOCAL AIRMASS 
AND WEAKEN THE LEADING EDGE OF THIS MCS. WILL PLAN TO RAISE POPS 
INTO THE LIKELY CATEGORY FOR THIS MORNING...AND KEEP A CHANCE FOR 
ADDITIONAL CONVECTION FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING AS THE 
COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA. HOWEVER...WITH THIS MORNINGS 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY...THINK THE LOCAL AIRMASS WILL BE SLOW TO 
DESTABILIZE AGAIN WITH ONLY SCATTERED ACTIVITY EXPECTED IN THE 
AFTERNOON. ALSO...WILL NOT RAISE MAX TEMPS FOR THIS AFTERNOON ABOVE 
YESTERDAYS VALUES...SINCE TEMPS SHOULD BE SLOW TO RISE THIS MORNING 
WITH CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY IN THE AREA.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...STILL ON TRACK TO HAVE 
UPPER HIGH TO MIGRATE RIGHT ON TOP OF US BY MONDAY.  STILL LEANING 
TOWARD COOL SIDE OF GUIDANCE ON HIGH TEMPS SUN-TUE SINCE SOILS HAVE BEEN
FAIRLY MOIST LATELY. HIGHS ON THURSDAY IN PLAINS WERE GENERALLY
OVERFORECAST BY MAV IN NON-DROUGHT AREAS. FORECASTING HEAT INDEX VALUES
FLIRTING WITH 105 DEGREES IN SOUTHERN SECTIONS...BUT AT LEAST TEMPS WILL
COOL SOMEWHAT AT NIGHT...NOT REALLY THREATENING HEAT ADVISORY CRITERIA.
HOWEVER...WILL CONTINUE WITH SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST
HEAT WAVE OF THIS SUMMER.

THINK MODELS ARE OVERPLAYING SOME OF THE DRYING IN THE LOWER LEVELS THIS
WEEKEND AS WELL. WOULD EXPECT A FEW DEGREES SHAVED OFF DEW POINTS...BUT
THINK THAT THE SUNDAY AM LOW OF 60 AT KTRI BY THE MAV IS TOO COOL/DRY.
ORIENTATION OF DRIEST DEW POINTS ON MODELS AS THEY MOVE SOUTH MUST BACK-
DOOR INTO AREA...THINK THOSE DRIEST DEW POINTS MAY STAY ON OTHER SIDE OF
APPS. 

NO CHANGES BEYOND TUESDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
MCS REALLY GETTING ITS ACT TOGETHER ACROSS ILLINOIS AND INDIANA.
AFTER LOOKING AT THE LATEST MODEL RUNS...QUITE UNSTABLE AIRMASS WITH PLENTY
OF MOISTURE WILL AWAIT THUNDERSTORM COMPLEX EARLY FRIDAY MORNING. LIFTED
INDICES OF -4 TO -6 WITH K INDICES OF NEAR 40. CAPES ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLATEAU
WILL BE OVER 2000 J/KG...SO SEE NO REASON WHY COMPLEX WILL NOT MOVE INTO
THE FORECAST AREA. I EXPECT STORMS TO MOVE INTO THE REGION BY 09-10Z.

BOWING OF STORMS WITH POTENTIAL OF DAMAGING STRAIGHT LINE WINDS AND TORRENTIAL
RAINS WILL BE MAIN CONCERN. WILL UP POPS FOR NORTHERN SECTIONS TO 50-60 PERCENT
WITH 20-30 POPS SOUTH. HAVE ALSO INCREASED POPS FOR FRIDAY TO 60-70
PERCENT RANGE. WILL HAVE UPDATE OUT SOON. THANKS JKL AND BNA FOR COORDINATION.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRI)...RADAR SHOWS ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
CONVECTION OVER THE AREA...THINK THIS WILL DIMINISH THIS EVENING AS 
WE LOSE HEATING...BUT GIVEN MOIST AIRMASS AND THE FACT THAT THERE 
WERE ECHOES ON RADAR WHEN I CAME IN THIS MORNING...WILL KEEP 20 POPS 
THROUGH OVERNIGHT PERIOD.  TOMORROW...TAIL END OF UPPER TROUGH 
ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLEX OVER GREAT LAKES REGION TODAY MAY AFFECT OUR 
AREA...ESPECIALLY THE NORTH.  NAM MOST BULLISH WITH THIS FEATURE.  
WILL NOT GO AS FAR AS THE NAM...BUT WILL GO WITH 40 TO 50 POPS 
NORTH...AND 30 TO 40 SOUTH.  WILL GENERALLY GO CLOSE TO MAV TEMPS 
TONIGHT...BUT WILL UNDERCUT A DEGREE OR TWO NORTH AND CENTRAL 
TOMORROW WITH POSSIBILITY OF MORE CLOUDS.   

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...FORECAST AREA REMAINS 
IN WEAK NW FLOW ALOFT INITIALLY UNTIL THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDS EAST 
FROM THE PLAINS STATES.  THUS...COVERAGE OF CONVECTIVE PCPN IS 
UNCERTAIN FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.  MODELS HINT AT PERHAPS AN MCS AFFECTING 
THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY FRIDAY...WITH POPS DIMINISHING FROM 
THE NW FRIDAY EVENING.  KEPT POP/WX GRIDS DRAWN FOR THIS SCENARIO...
BUT THERE MIGHT JUST BE A GENERAL DECREASE IN SHOWERS/STORMS WITH 
LOSS OF HEATING.  

UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN OVER THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...WHICH 
WILL SERVE TO LIMIT CONVECTION.  TEMPS ALSO ON THE RISE BUT PROBABLY 
NO HIGHER THAN MID TO UPPER 90S FOR MAX TEMPS.  UPDATED THE HWO 
PRODUCT TO INCLUDE A MENTION OF HOT TEMPS AND HEAT INDICES...AND 
WILL LIKELY ISSUE AN SPS WITH SAME INFORMATION WITH THE AFTERNOON
PACKAGE.

BY MID NEXT WEEK...DGEX/GFS/ECMWF AND ENSEMBLES INDICATE THE RIDGE 
BREAKS DOWN.  UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPS ACROSS UPPER MIDWEST AND

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...REGIME OF CONVECTION 
FIRING ON PLATEAU AND MOVING IN MID LEVEL FLOW SEEMS TO BE 
CONTINUING THIS AFTERNOON.  WEAK SHEAR AXIS THAT SEEMED TO 
SUPPLEMENT THIS DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PAST TWO DAYS SEEMS TO HAVE 
FADED TODAY.  THINKING THERE WILL BE VERY LITTLE OVERNIGHT 
PRECIP...SO HAVE ONLY MINIMAL POPS AFTER SUNSET...THEN REFIRING IN 
HIGHER TERRAIN ON THURSDAY.  ALSO ON THURSDAY...WEAK UPPER LEVEL 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH SHOULD BE SAGGING INTO THE NORTHERN PARTS OF THE 
AREA.  WILL GO WITH HIGHER POPS OVER NORTHWEST SECTIONS.  UPPER FLOW 
SHOULD START OUT WEAK...BUT PICK UP A LITTLE AS TROUGH MOVES IN. 

ADJUSTED DEW POINT FIELDS TO BRING MORE IN LINE WITH OBSERVED 
VALUES.  CURRENT LOW TEMP TONIGHT LOOKS GOOD...TWEAKED HIGH TEMP FOR 
TOMORROW JUST 1-2 DEGREES AT MOST.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FOR THURSDAY NIGHT 
INTO FRIDAY NIGHT...THE NW FLOW ALOFT COULD EASILY SEND MCS ACTIVITY 
OUR WAY.  HOWEVER...SHORT RANGE MODELS DONT HINT AT ANY MCS 
REACHING OUR FORECAST AREA...SO THIS JUST REMAINS A POSSIBILITY AT 
THIS TIME.  THUS...GIVEN GOOD MOISTURE SUPPLY AND MODERATE OR BETTER 
INSTABILITY...TRIED TO STAY CLOSE TO MOS BLEND FOR AT LEAST DIURNAL 
CONVECTION.  POPS/WX/SKY WERE ALL ADJUSTED TO BETTER MESH WITH 
NEIGHBORS GRIDS/FORECAST.  KEPT MAX TEMPS JUST BELOW THE WARMEST MOS 
LIKE PREVIOUS GRIDS...WITH PERSISTENCE GOOD FOR MINS.  

SATURDAY INTO MONDAY...THIS SHOULD BE THE DRIEST PERIOD OF THE 
FORECAST AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS EASTWARD FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND 
SWRN STATES...SHIFTING THE WESTERLIES AND ANY MCS TRACK FURTHER 
NORTH OF THE REGION.  LINGERING MOISTURE (SOIL AND RESIDUAL) COULD 
INHIBIT HOW HIGH MAX TEMPS GET...SO KEPT MAX TEMPS JUST BELOW HPC 
AND GFS MOS FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.  FINAL EDITS THESE PERIODS WERE 
MADE TO ADD A SLIGHT CHANCE OF TSRA FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON...ACROSS
THE FORECAST AREA.  

TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...ENSEMBLE MEANS FROM GFS AND ECMWF SUPPORT 
LESS UPPER LEVEL TROUGHING AND FRONTAL PUSH SOUTH THAN OPERATIONAL 
GFS MODEL INDICATES.  THUS...STAYED BELOW GFS MOS AND HPC GUIDANCE 
POPS FOR THESE DAYS.  ALSO RAISED GFS DEWPOINTS SLIGHTLY WITH LESS

FAIRLY QUIET THIS MORNING AS OPPOSED TO PREVIOUS MORNINGS WITH 
RADARS ALMOST BLANK.  AIR MASS STILL UNSTABLE...THINK THAT DIURNAL 
CONVECTION WILL START UP AGAIN...CUMULUS INCREASING RAPIDLY ON THE 
PLATEAU AGAIN THIS MORNING.  MID LEVEL FLOW WEAKER TODAY...SO 
THINKING THAT STORMS THAT DEVELOP ON PLATEAU MAY NOT MAKE IT AS FAR 
ACROSS THE VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON.  YESTERDAY...SOME STORMS MADE IT 
ALL THE WAY ACROSS.  NAM BACKING OFF ON STABLE AIR PUSHING INTO KTRI 
AREA FOR THIS AFTERNOON...DIDNT THINK THAT MADE SINCE ON THE 06Z 
RUN AS STABLE AIR IS FAR TO THE NORTH AND NOT MAKING ANY PUSH SWD 
RIGHT NOW.

ALL IN ALL...MADE A FEW CHANGES TO POPS AND QPF FOR FIRST 
PERIOD...OTHERWISE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES.

.DISCUSSION...LITTLE CHANGE TO CURRENT FORECAST. A RAY OF HOPE FOR 
DECREASED POPS AS DPS HAVE FINALLY DROPPED BELOW 70 ACROSS NE PART 
OF CWA. NO SIGNIFICANT TRIGGER OF NOTE. HOWEVER...PCPN CHCS REMAIN 
HIGH WITH PWS STILL AROUND 150% OF NORMAL. TEMPS A COUPLE DEGREES 
ABOVE NORMAL WILL CONTINUE SO AIRMASS ONCE AGAIN DESTABILIZES 
SUFFICIENTLY FOR GREATER THAN TYPICAL DIURNAL PCPN COVERAGE TDY. 
SLIGHTLY LOWER PCPN CHC ON THU. NW FLOW MORE PRONOUNCED THAN IN 
PREVIOUS RUNS LATE THU/FRI. THIS HOLDS OFF LARGE SCALE WESTERN 
RIDGE. MCS POTENTIAL HAS INCREASED FOR LATE THU INTO FRI ACROSS N 
AREAS. LATER FORECASTS WILL LIKELY NEED ADJUSTMENTS FOR THIS FEATURE 
DEPENDING ON ITS EVOLUTION. RIDGING AND LAYER DRYING BUILDS IN LATER 
ON FRI. HEIGHT RISES FOR THE WEEKEND HAVE BACKED OFF A NOTCH. 
SURFACE MOISTURE WILL REMAIN HIGH SO NO TRIPLE FIGURE TEMPS 
EXPECTED.

FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS. LOCAL RADARS REVEAL THAT CONVECTION 
IS RAPIDLY COMING TO AN END ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING AS 
THE LOCAL AIRMASS STABILIZES. HOWEVER...WILL PLAN TO LEAVE A SLIGHT 
CHANCE IN THE FORECAST OVERNIGHT FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL 
CONVECTION. WILL ALSO PLAN TO ADD A MENTION OF PATCHY DENSE FOG IN 
ALL ZONES...SINCE THIS WAS THE CASE LAST NIGHT AND EXPECT THINGS TO

327 PM EDT TUE JUL 19 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...WEAKLY CAPPED UNSTABLE 
AIR MASS TO CONTINUE OVER REGION IN SHORT TERM.  CONVECTION STILL 
MORE COMMON IN WESTERN PARTS OF CWA.  THINK THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE 
AS SURFACE LEE TROF CONTINUES EAST OF APPS THAT SHOULD LESSEN 
COVERAGE OVER WESTERN SIDE OF APPS.  WESTERLY MID LEVEL FLOW IS 
HELPING KEEP WESTERN SIDE OF CWA MORE ACTIVE AS STORMS THAT FORM ON 
PLATEAU MOVE INTO WESTERN PARTS OF VALLEY DURING PEAK HEATING.

ONLY CHANGES IN TEMPS WERE TO BUMP UP LOW TEMPS TONIGHT 1-3 DEGREES 
OVER CENTRAL AND NORTH WHERE TEMPS HAVE NOT COOLED AS MUCH AS MODELS 
HAVE HINTED AT FOR THE PAST FEW NIGHTS.

.LONG TERM...(WED NIGHT THROUGH TUE)...MAIN FEATURE OF CONCERN FOR 
THE LONG TERM PERIOD IS MASSIVE UPPER RIDGE THAT MODELS AND 
ENSEMBLES GENERALLY AGREE WILL BE BUILDING INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS OVER THE WEEKEND. RIDGE WILL BE CENTERED OVER THE 
TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
THIS WILL TEND TO SUPPRESS CONVECTION IN MOST LOCATIONS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN. 
THUS HAVE CONTINUED TO CONFINE ANY POPS TO MAINLY THE MOUNTAIN ZONES.

THE OTHER MAJOR EFFECT THIS STRONG UPPER RIDGE WILL HAVE IS WELL 
ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS. GFS GUIDANCE PROJECTS 100 FOR CHA ON SATURDAY 
WITH MID 90S FOR OTHER FORECAST POINTS IN OUR FORECAST AREA. WILL 
TRIM THESE TEMPS SOMEWHAT DUE TO MOIST SOIL CONDITIONS RESULTING 
FROM RECENT WIDESPREAD CONVECTION. NEVERTHELESS...VERY WARM 
CONDITIONS CAN BE ANTICIPATED AS THIS UPPER RIDGE TREKS THROUGH THE 
REGION.

.DISCUSSION...RADAR ALREADY SHOWING ISOLATED SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM
ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA.  RUC MODEL SHOWS A 
WEAK WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE REGION WHICH IS HELPING TO FOCUS THE
ISOLATED CONVECTION.  THIS WAVE SEEMS TO MOVE OUT OF THE AREA WITH 
ANOTHER MOVING INTO THE AREA LATER TODAY.

BNA SOUNDING SHOWS AIRMASS REMAINING VERY MOIST WITH PWS NEAR 2 INCHES
AND UNSTABLE WITH CAPES POTENTIALLY AROUND 3500 J/KG...SO PLENTY OF
ENERGY AVAILABLE THIS AFTERNOON FOR ADDITIONAL STORM DEVELOPMENT.
MAIN CONCERN WILL BE TORRENTIAL RAINS AND ISOLATED DAMAGING WET 
DOWNBURSTS.

SATELITTE AND AREA OBSERVATIONS SHOWING FOG IS LIFTING ACROSS THE

AIRMASS REMAINS VERY MOIST WITH PWS ABOVE 2.00 IN. WONT TAKE MUCH

OMEGA VALUES SET UP TODAY OVR N PART OF CWA TDY. A WEAK 850-700MB 
TROUGH MOVES E ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTN AND TNGT. THIS TIMING SUPPORTS
HIGH LIKELY POPS. A DELINEATING TROUGH SETS UP WED AND EARLY THU NR 
W TN TWEEN WEAKENING SE RIDGE AND JUMBO HOT WESTERN RIDGE. THIS 
ALLOWS FOR CONTINUED ABV CLIMO MAINLY AFTN/EVE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY. 
WESTERN RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD EAST. LAST PART OF WORK WEEK 
TRANSITIONS TO NEAR CLIMO WITH SMALL CHANCE FOR MCS IN NW FLOW ON 
FRI. HEIGHTS INCREASE INTO WEEKEND WITH FIRST SIGN OF DRYING IN

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...PRETTY GOOD COVERAGE OF 
PRECIP OVER NORTHERN AND WESTERN SECTIONS OF CWA THIS AFTERNOON.  
LOOKS LIKE WEAK SHEAR AXIS WAS OVER THIS AREA AS WELL AS PLATEAU OUT 
WEST THAT GOT STUFF STARTED.  MUCH OF THIS PRECIP SHOULD DIMINISH 
AFTER SUNSET.  SHEAR AXIS SHOULD SAG OUT OF THE AREA OVERNIGHT AS 
UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES.  FOR TUESDAY...GENERALLY LOCATING HIGHER 
POPS IN A GRADIENT HIGHER NW TO LOWER SE FOR TUESDAY AS UPPER TROUGH 
SAGS INTO AREA.  

HAVE MADE ONLY MINOR CHANGES TO OTHER PARAMETERS IN GRIDS THROUGH 
TUESDAY.


.LONG TERM...(TUE NIGHT THROUGH MON)...NOT MUCH CHANGE TO TYPICAL 
SUMMER-TYPE PATTERN ANTICIPATED THROUGH THE LONG TERM. MODELS AND 
ENSEMBLES GENERALLY AGREE THAT UPPER RIDGE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING OVER 
THE SOUTHWESTERN CONUS WILL SLOWLY BUILD EASTWARD AND WILL MERGE 
WITH WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE. FLOW ALOFT BECOMES MORE NORTHWESTERLY 
AS SOUTHWEST UPPER RIDGE DRIFTS EASTWARD TOWARD THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS AND STRENGTHENS TO BECOME THE DOMINANT FEATURE. THE 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT IS PROJECTED TO PROVIDE A MODICUM OF DRYING 
IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS AND THUS SOMEWHAT LESS DIURNAL 
CONVECTION COVERAGE IS ANTICIPATED. THEREFORE GENERALLY CONFINED ANY 
POPS TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN FOR THE UPCOMING WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT 
WEEK. OTHERWISE KEPT AS POPS PREVIOUSLY DEPICTED IN GRIDS. TEMPS ARE 
PROJECTED TO AVERAGE ABOVE CLIMO THROUGH MOST OF THE LONG TERM 
PERIOD.

NO MAJOR UPPER LEVEL OR LOWER LEVEL PLAYERS IN AREA TODAY TO FOCUS 
ANY ORGANIZED DEEP CONVECTION...BUT WITH WEAK CAP STILL SHOULD BE 
SOME SCATTERED ACTIVITY DEVELOPING SOON.  HIGHER TERRAIN SHOULD BE 
BEST MECHANISM FOR DEEP CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON...AM RAISING POPS 
5-10% IN HIGHER TERRAIN WITH LOWER LEVELS THE SAME AND MAYBE A 
LITTLE LESS POPS.  MID LEVEL FLOW HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE...SO 
FAIRLY PREDICTABLE MOVEMENTS OF STORMS.  CELLS DEVELOPING OVER

JUST WEST OF SMOKIES MAY STAY RELATIVELY DRY THIS AFTERNOON.  NO 
CHANGES TO TEMPS OR WINDS FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

.SHORT TERM...WEAK ISOLATED CONVECTION CONTINUES ALONG A BOUNDARY 
MAINLY TO OUR NORTH AND WEST THIS MORNING.  OTHERWISE...AN UPPER 
RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION OVER 
THE NEXT 24 HOURS...BRINGING FLOW ALOFT MORE WESTERLY.  AS A 
RESULT...SLOW DRYING IN THE UPPER LAYERS.  HOWEVER...AIR MASS IN 
PLACE REMAINS MARGINALLY UNSTABLE WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE.  A SLIGHT 
INCREASE IN DAYTIME WARMING WILL AID DIURNAL SCATTERED CONVECTION... 
PROVIDING NORMAL DIURNAL SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORM THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

.LONG TERM...A WEAKENING FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPROACHING THE AREA ON 
TUESDAY WILL HANG UP TO OUR NORTH AND SLOWLY SAG SOUTHWARD AS IT 
WASHES OUT OVER THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY.  LITTLE CHANGE IN THE AIR 
MASS EXPECTED THROUGH THIS PERIOD AND THEREFORE...EXPECT CONTINUED 
SCATTERED MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION.  UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMES MORE 
NORTHWESTERLY ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS A CENTRAL U.S. RIDGES 
STRENGTHENS.  A SECOND WEAKENING BOUNDARY IS PROGGED INTO THE REGION 
ON FRIDAY.  ALL THIS WILL ALLOW FOR A SLOW DRYING OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE...THOUGH CONFIDENCE REMAINS LOW OVER THE EXTENT OF 
DRYING...ESPECIALLY ON THE LOWER LAYERS.  WILL KEEP SOME POPS GOING 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE REMAINDER OF THE EXTENDED...THOUGH SHIFTING POPS 
TO BECOME MORE DIURNAL IN NATURE AND SLOWLY DECREASING THE PERCENT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...SUBTLE CHANGES IN STORE OVER THE SHORT
TERM AS MODELS AND ENSEMBLES DEPICT WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE CONTINUING TO
BUILD WESTWARD INTO THE CENTRAL GULF STATES. THIS WILL NOT ONLY RESULT
IN MARGINAL HEIGHT RISES OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...BUT ALSO
PROVIDE MORE OF A WESTERLY COMPONENT TO THE UPPER AIR FLOW. THIS IN TURN
WILL RESULT IN SOMEWHAT DRIER AIR IN THE UPPER LEVELS. THUS ANTICIPATE
SLIGHTLY LESS COVERAGE OF CONVECTION...ALTHOUGH SCATTERED DIURNAL
CONVECTION STILL A STRONG POSSIBILITY IN THE SECOND PERIOD.
THEREFORE...CONTINUED WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS/FORECAST OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
OVERNIGHT INCREASING TO LOW CHANCE POPS DURING PEAK HEATING IN THE
SECOND PERIOD. TEMPS SHOULD CONTINUE TO WARM AS A RESULT OF THE HEIGHT
RISES AND LESS CLOUD COVER. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE VALUES.

.LONG TERM...(MON NIGHT THROUGH SUN)...NOT MUCH CHANGE FOR MUCH OF

SHOULD STALL TO OUR NORTH BEFORE DISSIPATING.  WILL GENERALLY HAVE 
CHANCE POPS THROUGH FRIDAY.  GFS TRIES TO DRY THINGS OUT A BIT BY

RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC CONTINUES TO BRING DEEP TROPICAL

VALLEY TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER THE UPPER RIDGE REMAINS 
STRONG OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES SO DO NOT WANT TO RAISE POPS HIGHER 
THAN CHANCE TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. THE COLD FRONT WASHES OUT LATE 
WEDNESDAY. AT THE END OF THE WEEK GFS MODEL TRIES TO SHIFT WESTERN 
RIDGE FARTHER EAST WITH BUILDING HEIGHTS OVER THE CENTRAL STATES AND 
MS VALLEY. ANOTHER FRONT MOVING AROUND RIDGE COULD FINALLY GIVE THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS SOME DRIER AIR BY NEXT WEEKEND IF IT CAN MOVE 
SOUTH OF THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. DROPPED POPS TO 
JUST TERRAIN AREAS ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS SATURDAY BUT NOT REAL 
CONFIDENT THAT THE DRY AIR WILL MAKE IT CONSIDERING THE STRENGTH OF 
THE RIDGE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY AGREE 
THAT VERY MOIST ATMOSPHERE WILL PERSIST OVER MOST OF THE 
SOUTHEASTERN CONUS THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. HOWEVER...VERY LITTLE IN 
THE WAY OF SIGNIFICANT FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE TO TRIGGER ORGANIZED 
PRECIP AS REMNANTS OF DENNIS BECOME MORE AND MORE INDISTINGUISHABLE. 
LACK OF TRIGGERING MECHANISM MAKES LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS 
PROJECTED IN GUIDANCE A LITTLE SUSPECT. THUS...WILL UNDERCUT 
GUIDANCE POPS SOMEWHAT...ESPECIALLY IN THE NOCTURNAL HOURS. 
ANTICIPATE MAINLY SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION AGAIN IN THE SECOND 
PERIOD WITH BEST CHANCE ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN. FOR 
TEMPS...GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE VALUES AS THEY AGREE QUITE 
WELL WITH OTHER GUIDANCE OVERALL.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS KEEP 
ATMOSPHERE MOIST AND MODERATELY UNSTABLE AS BERMUDA HIGH RIDGE 
BUILDS IN FROM THE SOUTH AND EAST. LIKE THE SHORT TERM AM SKEPTICAL 
ABOUT THE NAM MODELS HIGH POPS SATURDAY NIGHT AND BOTH NAM AND GFS 
MODELS SUNDAY. FOLLOWED CLOSER TO GFS SATURDAY NIGHT AND KEPT POPS 
10 TO 20 PERCENT LOWER...IN THE CHANCE RANGE SUNDAY. TERRAIN AREAS
SHOULD SEE THE BEST CHANCE SUNDAY AND BEYOND AND BE THE AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING VARIETY OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING FROM 
UNEVEN HEATING. TEMPERATURES SHOULD CONTINUE TO WARM FROM SATURDAY 
AND BE NEAR NORMAL FROM SUNDAY THROUGH THE WEEK. A COLD FRONT TRIES 
TO DROP SOUTH THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AT 
MID TO LATE WEEK WHICH COULD ENHANCE RAIN CHANCES. BECAUSE ITS STILL 
ABOUT 5 DAYS OFF LEFT POPS THE SAME. DID LOWER HIGHS A DEGREE OR

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...USED A BROADBRUSHED APPROACH FOR 
POPS TODAY PLACING FA IN CATEGORICAL RANGE FOR SHRA AND SOME THUNDER 
(USED CHC TSRA TERM ACROSS NRN SECTIONS OF FA INCLUDING NRN PLATEAU 
AND SW VA/NE TN WHERE INSTABILITY SUFFICIENT FOR CONVECTION 
QUESTIONABLE) AS DENNIS STILL SPINNING WITH A SLIGHT EWD SHIFT FROM 
YESTERDAYS POSITION. DEEPEST MOISTURE APPEARS TO HAVE SHIFTED E OF 
THE APPALACHIANS TODAY BUT PWS STILL QUITE HIGH WITH AT LEAST A 
COUPLE OF MORE SPOKES OF VORTICITY TO ROTATE ACROSS THE FA TODAY. 
THREE WAVES ARE EVIDENT IN SAT IMAGERY THIS MORNING WITH THE FIRST 
PRODUCING SHRA AND SOME TSRA ACROSS ERN TN/SW VA WITH ANOTHER 
FARTHER BACK ACROSS WRN/MID TN AND YET ANOTHER DROPPING S ACROSS WRN 
KY SO EXPECT CATEGORICAL POP NOT BAD FOR TODAY. A LITTLE 
DISHEARTENED AT THE ABILITY OF MOS (OR MY ABILITY) TO GET A LITTLE 
CLOSER TO REALITY ON WED MAX TEMPS. DECIDED TO UNDERCUT A BIT AT 
TRI/TYS TODAY AND KEEP THESE AREAS IN THE UPR 70S WITH ABUNDANT 
MOISTURE BEING WORKED ON BY OLD TROPICAL CIRCULATION. THE PROBLEM IS 
WITH MID SUMMER INSOLATION AND A BREAK IN THE OVC HERE AND THERE MOS 
MAX TEMPS WOULD BE RIGHT IN THE BALLPARK. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...WITH THE GFS LOSING THE 
REMNANT CIRCULATION OF DENNIS BY THE START OF THE PERIOD...THE MAIN 
SYNOPTIC DRIVING FEATURE WILL BE SURFACE AND MID LEVEL RIDGING OF 
THE BERMUDA HIGH. SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AROUND THE HIGH WILL CONTINUE 
TO PROVIDE A SURGE OF TROPICAL MOISTURE AND ALLOW FOR CONTINUED 
UNSETTLED WEATHER IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS. EVEN WITH THE MAIN UVV OF 
DENNIS OUT OF THE PICTURE...ITS MOISTURE STILL REMAINS AND WILL 
COMBINE WITH NEW TROPICAL MOISTURE ADVECTION FROM THE SOUTH. THIS 
PATTERN DOES NOT BREAK DOWN UNTIL LATE MONDAY WHEN THE GFS MOVES A 
MODERATELY STRONG SHORT WAVE INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY 
AND INTO THE GREAT LAKES. THIS SW WILL ONLY SERVE TO WEAKEN THE 
RIDGE  A TAD THROUGH THE WEEKEND. GFS TRIES TO PUT A COLD FRONT 
ABOUT 100 MI NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY MORNING AND 
PRESSURE PATTERN IN GFS INDICATES IT SHOULD STALL THERE BEFORE

WITH 14/00Z RNK AND OHX SOUNDINGS MEASURING 1.80 TO 2.03 INCHES OF 
PRECIPITABLE WATER.  14/00Z SOUNDINGS AND MSAS SHOW THAT SOME 
INSTABILITY LINGERS GENERALLY ALONG AND SOUTH OF A LINE FROM CSV TO

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER LOW LEFT OVER FROM DENNIS
CONTINUES TO REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE OHIO VALLEY TODAY AND PROVIDED THE
FORECAST AREA WITH EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER. SHOWERS KEPT TEMPERATURES MUCH
COOLER TODAY THAN YESTERDAY. THE ONLY AREA THAT HAD SOME HEATING WAS
EXTREME NE TN AND SW VA. THIS WAS THE ONLY AREA WHERE THUNDERSTORMS
DEVELOPED AND BROUGHT SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL TO SULLIVAN AND
JOHNSON COUNTIES. EXPECT COVERAGE TO SLOWLY DECREASE ALL NIGHT BUT WITH
SHORTWAVE ENERGY ROTATING AROUND UPPER LOW THERE WILL BE A GOOD CHANCE
OF SHOWERS DURING THE NIGHT WITH AT LEAST LIGHT RAINFALL AMOUNTS. SHOWER
ACTIVITY SHOULD PICK UP AGAIN THURSDAY AS AIRMASS DESTABILIZES WITH THE
HEAT OF THE DAY. THINK THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE LESS RAINFALL BUT WILL
FOLLOW NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE WITH HIGH POPS. THERE MIGHT BE MORE
THUNDERSTORMS BUT THAT WILL DEPEND ON HEATING. WENT A DEGREE OR TWO
BELOW GUIDANCE THURSDAY AND ADDED PATCHY FOG WITH THE RAINFALL THAT
OCCURRED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. STILL COULD BE SOME FLOODING
CONCERNS DUE TO SATURATED GROUND THROUGH THURSDAY. THE BEST AREA FOR
HEAVIER RAINS LOOK TO BE ACROSS THE NORTHEAST CLOSER TO LOW.  THIS CYCLE
WILL CONTINUE INTO SATURDAY.



.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...WITH THE GFS LOSING
THE REMNANT CIRCULATION OF DENNIS BY THE START OF THE PERIOD...THE MAIN
SYNOPTIC DRIVING FEATURE WILL BE SURFACE AND MID LEVEL RIDGING PROVIDED
BY THE BERMUDA HIGH SOUTHEAST OF CAPE HATTERAS. WITH POSITIONING OF THE
RIDGE OFF TO OUR SOUTHEAST...SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AROUND THE HIGH WILL
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A SURGE OF TROPICAL MOISTURE AND ALLOW FOR CONTINUED
UNSETTLED WEATHER IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS. EVEN WITH DENNIS OUT OF THE
PICTURE...HIS MOISTURE STILL REMAINS AND WILL COMBINE WITH TROPICAL
MOISTURE FROM THE SOUTH. THIS PATTERN DOES NOT BREAK DOWN UNTIL LATE
MONDAY WHEN THE GFS...ALONG WITH THE OTHER GLOBAL MODELS...MOVES A
POTENT SHORT WAVE TROF INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY AND INTO
THE GREAT LAKES. WHILE THE TROF IS NOT PREDICTED TO PASS THROUGH OUR
REGION HERE...IT WILL SERVE TO WEAKEN THE GRIP THE RIDGE WILL HAVE ON
OUR WEATHER THROUGH THE WEEKEND. GFS TRIES TO PUT A COLD FRONT ABOUT 100
MI NORTH OF MY CWA ON WEDNESDAY MORNING AND PRESSURE PATTERN IN GFS
INDICATES IT SHOULD STALL THERE BEFORE WASHING OUT AS UPPER LEVEL
SUPPORT IS PROGGED TO SHIFT TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF THE SURFACE FRONT.

SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...EXPECT CONVECTION FROM SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON TO BE ONGOING DURING THE FIRST OF THE PERIOD WITH BEST 
INSTABILITY LOCATED OVER THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA. SHORTLY 
AFTER SUNSET...CONVECTION SHOULD DIMINISH AND COME TO AN END BY 
DAYBREAK SUNDAY. SUNDAY SHOULD BE MUCH LIKE SATURDAY WITH AFTERNOON 
DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. WILL FOLLOW MEX GUIDANCE 
CLOSELY HERE AND GO WITH WARMER TEMPS IN THE AFTERNOON AS CLOUD 
COVER WILL BE HIGH PARTLY CLOUDY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY. MIN TEMPS WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE WARM IN THE TROPICAL STYLE AIRMASS.

MONDAY...WITH MOISTURE LEVELS DECREASING ONLY SLIGHTLY WILL GO AHEAD 
AND LOWER THE POPS TO 40 PERCENT MOUNTAINS 30 PERCENT ELSEWHERE AS 
ONLY TRIGGER MECHANISM IS THE TERRAIN FOR ALL THE INSTABILITY LIKELY 
TO BE GENERATED. MAX TEMPS RETURN TO THE LOW 90S SOUTH AND UPPER 80S 
NORTH. MINS CONTINUE TO BE ON THE WARM SIDE.

TUESDAY...INSTABILITY CONTINUES IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS WITH ONLY 
TRIGGER THE TERRAIN AGAIN. FRONT APPEARS TO BE FAR ENOUGH TO THE 
NORTH TO PRECLUDE ANY GOOD QUALITY LIFT. WILL BLANKET THE AREA WITH 
30 PERCENT POPS AS DIFFICULT THIS FAR OUT TO ADEQUATELY PREDICT 
PRECISE LOCATION OF DEVELOPMENT. 

WEDNESDAY...WITH FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO MY NORTH COULD SEE SOME LIFT 
FROM THE FRONT TO HELP KICK OFF SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN 
THE AFTERNOON. WITH THIS FRONT NEARBY WILL GO AHEAD AND RAISE POPS 
TO 40 PERCENT MOST LOCATIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS POSSIBILITY. TEMPS 
CONTINUE TO BE SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL WITH LOW TO MID 90S SOUTH TO 
NEAR 90 NORTH.

.DISCUSSION...CIRCULATION REMNANTS OF DENNIS IS SLOWLY SPINNING IN PLACE
OVER INDIANA BUT BANDS ROTATING AROUND IT HAVE MOVED ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. LEADING EDGE OF THE ACTIVITY HAS PRODUCED
THE HEAVIEST INITIAL RAINFALL AND HAS STABILIZED THE ATMOSPHERE OVER
WESTERN SECTIONS. TEMPERATURES ARE NOT RISING VERY FAST DUE TO CLOUDS
AND RAINFALL. EXPECT THE ACTIVITY TO SLOWLY SPREAD ACROSS THE REMAINDER
OF THE FORECAST AREA BY EARLY AFTERNOON WITH SOME THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE
ON THE LEADING EDGE. CLOUD COVER WILL HOLD TEMPERATURES DOWN OVERALL BUT
ANY BREAKS WILL ALLOW FAIRLY RAPID HEATING IN A FEW PLACES. RAINFALL
AMOUNTS ALSO A CONCERN WITH SOME AREAS SATURATED WITH LOW FLASH FLOOD
GUIDANCE. IF TRAINING DEVELOPS OR ORGANIZED CONVECTION LOCALIZED
FLOODING IS A POSSIBLITY. UPDATE TO CHANGE WORDING TO CHANCE OF THUNDER
AND WILL KEEP HIGH POPS ALL DAY.

330 AM EDT WED JUL 13 2005

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...TD DENNIS THE MAIN FEATURE OF 
INTEREST AS USUAL. CIRCULATION REMAINS OVR THE LWR OH VLY THRU SHORT 
TERM WITH HIGH POPS ACROSS MRX FA AS PW QUITE HIGH WITH SOME 
INSTABILITY AND THE ADDED COMPONENT OF A COUPLE OF VORT LOBES 
ROTATING ACROSS THE TN VLY/SRN APPALACHIANS. 1ST LOBE GENERATING THE 
NICE AREA OF SHOWERS ACROSS MID TN WITH SOME CONVECTIVE ELEMENTS 
SHOWING UP ACROSS THE TN VLY OF AL PRESSING ENE TWD SE TN. BELIEVE 
THERE WILL BE SOME DOWNSLOPING ACROSS NE TN/SW VA BUT STILL THINK 
THERE SHOULD BE A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE FOR RAIN HERE ESPECIALLY LATER 
IN THE DAY SO USED CATEGORICAL POP HERE ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE 
FA. BEST CHC FOR RAIN SHOULD BE ON THE PLATEAU CLOSEST TO THE BEST 
MOISTURE AXIS IN PLACE ACROSS MID TN THRU CENTRAL/ERN KY. STAYED 
CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS WHICH WILL BE A LITTLE SUPPRESSED TODAY WITH 
MASS OF BKN-OVC CLOUD COVER EDGING E ACROSS TN/KY.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...INHERITED VERY FINE FORECAST 
PACKAGE, HENCE MADE ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO EARLY PART OF PERIOD. 
WITH TD DENNIS FALLING APART BUT STILL IN THE AREA MUST ACCOUNT FOR 
SLIGHT INSTABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. MAIN FEATURE WITH DENNIS IS 
REMAINS OF COPIOUS MOISTURE. ADJUSTED THURSDAY WORDING (REFLECTING 
MINOR INSTABILITY) TO READ SHOWERS LIKELY WITH A CHANCE FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS. SUNSHINE WILL BE LIMITED AND THAT WOULD BE THE MAIN 
DRIVING FORCE. TEMPS LOOK OK WITH CLOUD COVER KEEPING DAILY HIGHS 
DOWN. LEFT REST OF LONG TERM FORECAST UNCHANGED.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
326 PM EDT TUE JUL 12 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...MAIN CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT 
THIS AFTERNOON HAS STAYED ALONG AND EAST OF THE BEST INSTABILITY AXIS
...WHICH GENERALLY RUNS E-W ACROSS CENTRAL AL THEN TURNS SW-NE 
ACROSS NW GA INTO WRN NC.  THIS WAS THE AREA WELL DEFINED BY MOST 
SHORT RANGE MODELS AND MODIFIED 12Z ACTUAL SOUNDINGS...TO HAVE THE 
HIGHEST CAPES AND THETA-E VALUES.  SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR INFILTRATED 
MOST OF MIDDLE TN AND JUST INTO WRN PARTS OF OUR FORECAST AREA...AND 
THESE AREAS CONTINUE TO BE ALMOST RAINFREE.  SINCE THE MAIN AXIS OF 
DEVELOPMENT (WITH MOVEMENT NE) IS TO MY SOUTH AND EAST...I HAVE 
UNDERCUT MOS POPS CONSIDERABLY FOR REST OF THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE 
EVENING HOURS (POPS LESS THAN 50 PERCENT WITH CHANCE WORDING).  

HOWEVER...DO FEEL THAT SHORT RANGE MODELS ARE CORRECT IN A HAVING A 
SHORTWAVE ROTATE EWD FROM THE REMNANTS OF DENNIS OVER ILLINOIS LATE 
TONIGHT.  THUS...POPS WILL BE ALLOWED TO INCREASE CONSIDERABLY AFTER 
MIDNIGHT FROM THE WEST.  LET POPS MAX OUT BEFORE 18Z IN THE WEST 
TOMORROW...THEN MAX POPS IN ERN ZONES FOR TOMORROW AFTERNOON.  DONT 
THINK THE CONVECTIVE PCPN WILL LAST ALL DAY...SO TRENDED POPS BACK 
TO LIKELY CATEGORY BY LATE AFTERNOON.

OTHERWISE...MAV MOS AT LEAST SLIGHTLY REFLECTED THE DRIER AIR 
INITIALLY IN PARTS OF OUR FORECAST AREA...SO DEW POINT TEMPS WERE 
POPULATED FROM MAV MOS.  NEAR OR JUST BELOW PERSISTENCE FOR MIN 
TEMPS TONIGHT...THEN I FAVORED THE COOLER MAV MOS MAX TEMPS DUE TO 
RAIN AND CLOUDS TOMORROW.

.LONG TERM...WENDESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...

WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...THE REMNANT CIRCULATION OF TROPICAL 
DEPRESSION DENNIS CONTINUES TO LINGER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
THROUGH THE MID RANGE. MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT ABOUT 
THE CONTINUAL EVOLUTION OF THE REMNANT CIRCULATION. GFS HAS 
PERFORMED WELL TO THIS POINT AND SEE NO REASON TO NOT USE THIS 
MODEL. WILL THEREFORE BE RELYING HEAVILY ON IT FOR THE FORECAST. NAM 
ALSO HAS A GOOD HANDLE ON THE SITUATION BUT THE GUIDANCE POPS ARE 
JUST A BIT TO HIGH FOR MY TASTE CONSIDERING THAT MOST OF THE 
PRECIPITATION WILL TAKE ON A DIURNAL FORM. 

WEDNESDAY NIGHT...LARGE AREA OF OMEGA LIFT EXITING MY FORECAST AREA 
AT THE START OF THE PERIOD AND LEAVING BEHIND ONLY SMALL POCKETS OF 
UPWARD MOTION. WILL THEREFORE HAVE HIGHEST POPS OVER THE MOUNTAINS 
AT START OF THE PERIOD AND LOWER POPS TO THE SOUTHWEST. WILL 
INCREASE POPS TOWARD MORNING ACROSS SE TN AS THE GFS INDICATES 
ANOTHER PIECE OF ENERGY WILL BE MOVING INTO THE AREA. MODEL GUIDANCE 
FROM THE GFS HAS POPS IN THE LOW 70S AND WILL GO CLOSE TO THIS 
VALUE. NAM GUIDANCE IS NEAR 90 AND FEEL THIS MAY BE TO HIGH. FOR 
TEMPERATURES...CONTINUAL SOUTHERLY FLOW HAS BROUGHT IN A VERY MOIST 
TROPICAL AIRMASS. WILL BE GOING ABOVE GUIDANCE FOR TEMPS SLIGHTLY 
HERE DUE TO AIRMASS AND CLOUD COVER HELPING TO KEEP TEMPERATURES UP.

THURSDAY...GFS INDICATES LARGE AREA OF PRECIP DEVELOPING AREAWIDE 
DURING THE DAYLIGHT HOURS. WITH A DEEP LAYER OF AVAILABLE MOISTURE 
AND GOOD LIFT IN THE COLUMN SEE NO REASON WHY LIKELY POPS WILL NOT 
WORK. MAV GUIDANCE IS GOING AS HIGH AS 86 PERCENT AT TYS AND WHILE 
THIS IS NOT TOTALLY UNREALISTIC...LOW AND MID LEVEL FLOW IS BECOMING 
MORE SOUTHEASTERLY BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND THIS WILL ADD QUITE A 
DEGREE OF DOWNSLOPE FLOW TO AREAS IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN 
VALLEYS. WILL THEREFORE GO WITH 70 POPS SOUTH AND 60 CENTRAL AND 
NORTH TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. EXPERIENCE WITH THIS SYSTEM HAS 
SHOWN...ESPECIALLY YESTERDAY...THAT DOWNSLOPE FLOW REALLY DRIES OUT 
MOST AREAS IN NORTHEAST TN...SO DEPARTING FROM GUIDANCE POPS SEEMS 
REASONABLE. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR THE LOWER MAV GUIDANCE BECAUSE 
DESPITE WHETHER IT RAINS OR NOT...CLOUD COVER SHOULD BE PRESENT 
HELPING TO LOWER MAX TEMPS AND THE COOLER MAV LOOKS GOOD.

THURSDAY NIGHT...PRECIPITATION BEGINS TO DWINDLE INTO THE OVERNIGHT 
HOURS AND WILL REDUCE POPS BACK TO 50 PERCENT AS ENOUGH MOISTURE 
REMAINS THAT ONLY A LITTLE LIFT IS NECESSARY TO KICK OFF SOME 
SHOWERS. AGAIN...WARMER THAN GUIDANCE ON TEMPERATURES DUE TO THE 
MOIST AIRMASS UNDER CLOUDY SKIES.

FRIDAY...LESS MOISTURE AND MORE DOWNSLOPE FLOW WILL TRANSLATE INTO 
50 POPS SOUTH AND 40 POPS NORTH AS INDICATED BY THE 12Z GFS. TEMPS 
WILL CONTINUE TO TREND SLIGHTLY BELOW MAV GUIDANCE FOR MAX TEMPS.

FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...LOW TO MID LEVEL MOISTURE WITH WEAK 
TO MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR CONTINUES OVER THE REGION THROUGH THE 
PERIOD.  ADDITIONALLY...THOUGH THERE IS SOME DISCREPANCY IN 
TIMING...MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A COUPLE OF WAVES ROTATING THROUGH 
THE AREA.  AS A RESULT...WILL CONTINUE WITH GENERALLY SCATTERED 
SHOWERS.THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD.

.DISCUSSION...REMNANTS OF DENNIS CENTERED OVER SRN TIP OF ILLINOIS 
THIS MORNING...WITH MRX FORECAST AREA UNDER A DRY SLOT AND ENJOYING 
SOME OF THE WARMEST TEMPS ACROSS TN PARTS.  APPEARS THAT THE BEST 
INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING WILL OCCUR JUST TO OUR SOUTH 
AND FROM THE SRN APPALACHIANS EASTWARD.  THIS WAS REFLECTED IN 
MODIFYING OHX AND RNK 12Z SOUNDINGS...WITH MUCH MORE INSTABILITY 
INDICATED WHEN WARMING RNK SOUNDING INTO THE MID 80S (POSITIVE CAPE 
GREATER THAN 2000 J/KG AND LIFTED INDEX OF -7 DEGS).  MODIFIED OHX 
SOUNDING GENERATED POSITIVE CAPE LESS THAN 1000 J/KG AND LIFTED 
INDEX OF AROUND -2 DEGREES C.  FREEZING AND WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS 
ARE VERY HIGH...WITH THE SEVERE THREAT LOOING TO BE ISOLATED 
DOWNBURSTS.

RADARS SHOW ALMOST NO ECHOES ACROSS EAST TN/SW VA/SW NC CURRENTLY...
ALTHO CONVECTION DEVELOPING TO OUR SOUTH IS TRACKING NE TOWARD SE TN 
AND SW NC.  I DOUBT IF ALL AREAS WILL SEE 50 PERCENT COVERAGE...AND 
MAY TRY TO RELFECT A BIT OF A POP GRADIENT IN THE UPDATE THIS 
MORNING.  OTHERWISE...FEEL THAT TERRAIN WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN 
WHERE STORMS DEVELOP ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA...WITH EXPECTED 
MOVEMENT TO BE NORTHEAST AWAY FROM THE MTN ZONES.  DOUBTFUL IF MAX 
TEMPS OR SKY COVER PART OF FORECAST WILL NEED MUCH ADJUSTMENT.

WILL UPDATE GRIDS...WEB PRODUCTS AND ZFPMRX BY OR BEFORE 11 AM EDT.

325 AM EDT TUE JUL 12 2005

.SHORT TERM...WATER VAPOR LOOP SHOWS A DRY SLOT OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA
THIS MORNING AS A SHORT-WAVE MOVES EAST OF THE REGION. A FAIRLY WARM MORNING
ACROSS THE AREA WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE GREAT TENNESSEE VALLEY GENERALLY IN
THE MID 70S. REMAINS OF DENNIS WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE SLOWLY NORTH THEN EAST
ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY TODAY AND WEDNESDAY. SEVERAL SHORT-WAVES WILL ROTATE
AROUND THE UPPER LOW...BUT TIMING OF WAVES DIFFICULT.

IN ANY EVENT...FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW AIRMASS WILL BE QUITE UNSTABLE...
ESPECIALLY OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING WITH CAPES NEAR 2500 J/KG AND LIFTED INDICES OF -5 TO -7.
CONVECTIVE TEMPERATURE IN THE LOWER AND MID 80S. MAIN LIFT WILL BE LOCAL
TERRAIN...BUT PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY FOR SCATTERED MAINLY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING CONVECTION.

SOME ISOLATED SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE GIVEN EXPECTED INSTABILITY WITH
MAIN CONCERN BEING DAMAGING DOWNBURSTS WINDS AND TORRENTIAL RAINS. WILL ISSUE
A SPS CONCERNING POTENTIAL OF ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS.

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY...REMAINS OF DENNIS WILL MEANDER ACROSS
THE OHIO VALLEY THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK BEFORE DISSIPATING. NAM AND GFS
SHOWS PLENTY OF DEEP TROPICAL MOISTURE OVER THE REGION WITH MODERATELY UNSTABLE
AIRMASS GENERALLY EACH DAY. BOTH MODELS ALSO HINT OF A SEVERAL WAVES ROTATING
ACROSS THE REGION WEDNESDAY...SO HAVE KEPT POPS IN THE 60-70 PERCENT RANGE.
ALSO...WILL KEEP SCATTERED MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION GOING THROUGH THE REST
OF THE FORECAST AS PWS REMAIN HIGH.  DAYTIME HEATING WILL WORK WITH LOCAL
TERRAIN AND LIFT OVER OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES TO PRODUCE SCATTERED STORMS EACH
DAY...GENERALLY AFTERNOON AND EVENING VARIETY.

.DISCUSSION...NO CHANGES. CENTER OF CIRCULATION OF DENNIS REMNANTS
CONTINUE TO DRIFT NORTHWARD THROUGH THE LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEY.
HOWEVER...BROAD CIRCULATION AROUND THIS SYSTEM ENCOMPASSES NEARLY THE
ENTIRE EASTERN HALF OF THE CONUS. CONVECTIVE BANDS ALSO CONTINUE TO
ROTATE AROUND THE EASTERN HEMISPHERE OF THE CIRCULATION. RADAR SHOWS
SEVERAL OF THESE BANDS IN THE VICINITY OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS.
MUCH OF THIS ACTIVITY HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED IN EAST TENNESSEE TODAY BY
STRONG DOWNSLOPE FLOW. STILL REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW LONG THIS TREND
WILL CONTINUE AS FLOW SLOWLY WEAKENS AND SHIFTS TO A MORE
SOUTHWESTERLY COMPONENT. AM RELUCTANT TO LOWER POPS BECAUSE OF THIS

312 PM EDT MON JUL 11 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...REMAINS OF HURRICANE DENNIS 
WILL BE THE FORECAST FOCUS FOR THE NEAR TERM.  CIRCULATION WILL 
CONTINUE TO WEAKEN OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS...HOWEVER DEEP MOISTURE 
FIELD IN PLACE AND DAYTIME HEATING FEEL THAT THUNDERSTORMS STILL A 
SIGNIFICANT THREAT ON TUESDAY.  GOOD BREAKS THIS AFTERNOON...AND 
FEEL THERE WILL BE EVEN MORE TUESDAY WITH A LITTLE LESS MOISTURE 
INFLUX...SO WENT WITH WARMER GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...DENNIS...OR WHAT 
REMAINS OF DENNIS...CONTINUES TO BE THE MAIN FOCUS FOR OUR WEATHER 
OVER THE EXTENDED TERM. AS STEERING CURRENTS REMAIN WEAK...DENNIS IS 
PROGGED TO MOVE LITTLE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. MODELS IN GENERAL 
GOOD AGREEMENT THAT DENNIS WILL MOVE TO THE EAST EVER SO SLOWLY 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND INTO WEDNESDAY. IT IS THIS MOVEMENT BACK TO THE 
EAST THAT WILL CAUSE AN INCREASE IN THE CHANCE OF -SHRA AND -TSRA 
FOR OUR REGION ON WEDNESDAY. WILL ONLY SLOWLY INCREASE POPS 
OVERNIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS ARE TIGHTLY CLUSTERED 
ON TEMPERATURES THROUGH MOST OF THE PERIOD SO WILL ONLY DEVIATE 
SLIGHTLY WHERE APPROPRIATE.

WEDNESDAY...WITH DENNIS MOVING BACK TO THE EAST DURING THE 
DAY...CONDITIONS LOOK GOOD FOR NUMEROUS SHOWERS TO DEVELOP. 
X-SECTIONS ON THE GFS FROM NEAR HSV TO RNK SHOW A VERY DEEP LAYER OF 
MOISTURE EXTENDING FROM NEAR THE SURFACE WELL UP TO 400MB. 
ACCOMPANYING THIS LAYER IN THE MODEL FIELDS IS AN INCREASE IN 
VORTICITY AT 500MB COUPLED WITH RATHER STRONG OMEGA LIFT AROUND 18Z 
WEDNESDAY. WITH MAV GUIDANCE POPS IN THE 70 PERCENT RANGE SEE NO 
REASON TO DIFFER FROM MOS HERE. DESPITE THE FACT IT IS DAY 3 OF THE 
FORECAST AND ONLY NEGATIVE ISSUE MAY BE TERRAIN INFLUENCES...FEEL IT 
IS PRUDENT TO GO WITH HIGH LIKELY POPS NORTH AND LOW LIKELY SOUTH AS 
MOISTURE AND LIFT LOOKS FARLEY DECENT. WILL ACCORDINGLY GO WITH 
CLOUDY SKIES AND LOWER THAN MAV GUIDANCE TEMPS HERE IN THE DAY AND 
WARMER THAN GUIDANCE TEMPS AT NIGHT DUE TO WARM AND MUGGY TROPICAL 
AIRMASS.

SPC HAS MY AREA IN A SEE TEXT HEADLINE FOR SOME ISOLATED SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS. AT THIS POINT...THINK ANY SEVERE STORMS WOULD BE 
ISOLATED DUE TO PERSISTENT CLOUD COVER EXPECTED WEDNESDAY. AND THUS 
AGREE WITH SPC TAKE ON THE SITUATION.

THURSDAY...DENNIS IS LIKE A PARTY GUEST THAT JUST WONT LEAVE. GFS 
STILL HAS THE REMNANT CIRCULATION OVER NORTH CENTRAL KENTUCKY 
MOVING SLOWLY TO THE EAST. MOISTURE STILL AVAILABLE THOUGH NOT AS 
DEEP AS WEDNESDAY. WILL GO WITH 50 POPS HERE MOST LOCATIONS AS 
EXPECT MID LEVEL FLOW TO BE OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST AND THIS WILL CAUSE 
UPSLOPE IN A FEW LOCATIONS TO ENHANCE PRECIPITATION. BEST CHANCES 
AFTERNOON AND DIMINISHING AFTER SUNSET. TEMPS WILL BE CLOSER TO 
GUIDANCE VALUES HERE AS A FEW BREAKS IN THE CLOUD DECK STILL SEEMS 
POSSIBLE.

FRIDAY...WITH GFS LOSING THE REMNANT CIRCULATION...WEATHER PATTERN 
STARTS TO TURN INTO A TYPICAL SUMMERTIME REGIME...BUT WITH ADDED 
TROPICAL MOISTURE THAT NORMALLY IS NOT PRESENT. STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY 
FLOW COMBINED WITH A COUPLE OF VORT MAXES MOVING IN DURING THE 
DAYLIGHT HOURS LOOK TO CAUSE AN INCREASE IN THE PRECIPITATION. AGAIN 
WILL BE GOING WITH 50 PERCENT. TEMPS AGAIN FOLLOW CLOSELY WITH MEX 
GUIDANCE.

SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...WITH MOISTURE AMOUNTS STARTING TO DWINDLE WILL 
SEE MAINLY AFTERNOON CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY ENHANCED BY TERRAIN 
FEATURES AND HAVE STARTED TO DECREASE POPS ACCORDINGLY. WILL SEE 
TEMPERATURES AGAIN START TO WARM UP BUT DUE TO PERSISTENT SOUTHERLY 
FLOW...HEAT INDICES LOOK TO BE QUITE HIGH THANKS TO DEWPOINTS IN 
THE LOW 70S IN MANY PLACES.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...OUTER BANDS OF MAINLY SHOWERS 
ROTATING AROUND DENNIS ARE LIFTING NORTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEASTERN U.S.  AS DENNIS APPROACHES THE GULF COAST THEN MOVES 
INLAND OVER AL AND MS TONIGHT...THESE BANDS WILL SLOWLY ROTATE INTO 
EAST TENNESSEE.  WILL RANGE POPS FROM AROUND 60 PERCENT SOUTHERN 
ZONES TO 20 IN THE NORTH.  WITH EXPECTED TRACK OF DENNIS OVER 
NORTHERN MS AND INTO WEST TN ON MONDAY...MAIN PRECIP BANDS WILL STAY 
TO OUR SOUTH AND WEST.  DOWNSLOPING WILL ALSO AID IN LIMITING 
PRECIP.  HOWEVER...SOME BANDS OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED 
TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA.  BEST POTENTIAL OF RAINFALL REMAINS OVER 
SOUTHERN ZONES.  DEEP MOISTURE...STRONG ROTATIONAL SHEAR AND A 
WEAKLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL AID THUNDERSTORMS IN THE SOUTHERN 
ZONES.  WITH THIS...THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT POTENTIAL FOR LIMITED 
STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS.  WINDS WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA 
AS WELL AS THE REMNANTS OF DENNIS APPROACHES THE REGION.  STRONGEST 
WINDS...AS USUAL...WILL BE FOUND OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  HOWEVER... 
DUE TO THE EXPECTED TRACK OF DENNIS BEING SUFFICIENTLY TO OUR 
WEST...BELIEVE WINDS WILL REMAIN BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA.  WITH A 
THICKENING CLOUD COVER AND EXPECTED RAINFALL...MONDAY AFTERNOON 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN SUNDAY/S.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...LATEST MODEL RUNS INDICATE 
THAT DENNIS WILL CONTINUE MOVING NORTHWEST INTO WEST TN BY MONDAY 
MORNING...WITH THE BULK OF ITS ASSOCIATED WINDS AND MOISTURE 
REMAINING WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA. EXTENDED MODELS NOW INDICATE 
THAT THE REMNANTS OF DENNIS WILL STALL-OUT OVER THE WESTERN OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY...AND REMAIN WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGHOUT THE

OHIO RIVER VALLEY THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. HOWEVER...WITH INCREASED 
MOISTURE LEVELS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...SCATTERED CONVECTION 
SHOULD DEVELOP ALMOST EVERY DAY THIS WEEK...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...AFTERNOON CONVECTION DEVELOPING 
SOUTH OF THE MRX CWA.  AIR MASS OVER THE AREA IS FAIRLY STABLE AND 
DRY.  WILL KEEP LOW POPS OVER FAR SOUTHERN ZONES BUT EXPECT MAIN 
EVENING CONVECTION TO STAY SOUTH OF THE TENNESSEE BORDER.  HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
TONIGHT WITH PATCHY FOG POSSIBLE ONCE AGAIN TOWARD MORNING.  ON 
SUNDAY...MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE AS DENNIS MAKES LANDFALL.  
MAY SEE LIMITED INFLUENCE FROM DENNISS APPROACH ON SUNDAY AND WILL 
SLOWLY INCREASE CLOUDS AND POPS FROM SOUTH TO NORTH DURING THE 
AFTERNOON.  HOWEVER...MAIN PRECIP BANDS FROM DENNIS SHOULD BE 
CONFINED TO OUR SOUTH THROUGH THE DAY AND WILL KEEP POPS NEAR 40 
PERCENT SOUTH...AND LESS THE 20 PERCENT NORTH.  GUIDANCE 
TEMPERATURES LOOK GOOD AND WILL NOT STRAY FAR. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS INDICATE THAT 
DENNIS WILL CONTINUE MOVING NORTHWEST INTO WEST TN BY MONDAY 
MORNING...WITH THE BULK OF ITS ASSOCIATED MOISTURE REMAINING WEST OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...SOME OF THIS MOISTURE WILL HELP TO 
TRIGGER SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...ESPECIALLY 
ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS WHERE UPSLOPE FLOW WILL AID IN CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT. LATEST EXTENDED MODEL RUNS INDICATE THAT THE REMNANTS 
OF DENNIS WILL STALL-OUT OVER THE WESTERN OHIO RIVER VALLEY BY 
TUESDAY NIGHT...AS IT BEGINS TO INTERACT WITH A COLD FRONT OVER THE 
UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. THE GFS MODEL INDICATES THAT THIS 
COLD FRONT WILL THEN SLOWLY PUSH THE REMNANTS OF DENNIS SOUTHWARD 
INTO THE TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEY BY WEDNESDAY...WHERE IT COULD BECOME 
QUASI-STATIONARY AND LINGER THROUGH FRIDAY. THIS WOULD RESULT IN A 
VERY WET SCENARIO WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF HEAVY RAINS ACROSS THE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
300 PM EDT FRI JUL 8 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...ISOLATED CONVECTION 
DEVELOPING TO OUR SOUTHWEST THIS EVENING.  THE MAIN FOCUS OF THIS 
SHOULD GENERALLY STAY SOUTH OF THE TENNESSEE BORDER WITH ONLY 
LIMITED CELLS REACHING INTO THE MRX CWA.  AS SUCH...WILL PUT LOW 
POPS OVER FAR SOUTHERN ZONES.  OTHERWISE...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
CONTINUES TO BUILD INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TONIGHT.  
CONTINUED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND LIGHT WIND SHOULD ALLOW AREAS OF 
FOG TO FORM BY MORNING.  THE AIR MASS REMAINS RELATIVELY STABLE 
THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON...SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITING CHANCE OF 
CONVECTION.  WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES NEAR GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...

MODEL DISCUSSION...ALL EYES FOCUSED ON MAJOR HURRICANE DENNIS AND 
ITS EVENTUAL MOVEMENT TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA. LATEST GUIDANCE FROM 
GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE A LANDFALL BETWEEN BILOXI MS AND PANAMA CITY 
FL SOMETIME SUNDAY MORNING. THE MODELS THEN DIVERGE SLIGHTLY BUT ARE 
IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT OF TAKING THE STORM OVER MIDDLE OR WESTERN 
TENNESSEE...FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM MY FORECAST AREA TO CAUSE MAJOR 
PROBLEMS...BUT JUST CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE AFFECTED BY SOME OUTER 
BANDING. MORNING INITIALIZATION ON GFS AND ECMWF LOOK PRETTY GOOD AT 
500MB WITH ONLY THE UKMET OVER PLAYING THE WEAK TROF OVER LOUISIANA. 
CURRENT THINKING IS THAT TROF OVER LOUISIANA WILL HELP INDUCE A 
TRACK MORE TO THE EAST INITIALLY THEN ALL MODELS BUILD BACK IN A 
RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN US THAT SHOULD STEER DENNIS BACK TOWARD THE 
WEST. HOW FAR WEST IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME. NEVERTHELESS...FEEL 
CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT OUR REGION WILL SEE SOME PRECIPITATION. GFS 
ALREADY INDICATING THAT A GOOD PORTION OF OUR FORECAST AREA WILL SEE 
DOWNSLOPING FLOW INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WILL LESSEN 
PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS. 00Z RUN OF FSUS MM5 MESOSCALE MODEL 
INDICATES THAT TOTAL AMOUNTS MAY ONLY APPROACH ONE QUARTER TO ONE 
HALF INCH IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BY TUESDAY WITH TOTALS ONE INCH OR 
MORE ACROSS SE TN. AT THIS POINT...TO EARLY TO COMMIT TO ANY 
PRECIPITATION TOTALS.

SUNDAY...WITH DENNIS PROGGED TO BE MOVING ASHORE ACROSS THE GULF 
COAST...QUESTION IS HOW MUCH CLOUD COVER WILL STREAM OVERHEAD DURING 
THE DAY. THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE RARE INSTANCES WHERE CHATTANOOGA IS 
ACTUALLY COOLER FOR MAX TEMPS THAN TRI CITIES. WILL CONSTRUCT GRIDS 
THIS WAY WITH NEAR 90 NORTH AND UPPER 80S SOUTH AS CLOUD COVER WILL 
ARRIVE OVER SOUTHERN SECTIONS FIRST. WILL ALSO PLACE LIKELY POPS IN 
SW NC AND EVENTUALLY SE TN AS OUTER BANDS OF DENNIS SHOULD AFFECT 
THE REGION. 

SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...AS DENNIS MOVES ACROSS ALABAMA TOWARD 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE..WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE POPS AS GFS INDICATES 
VORT LOBE MOVING THROUGH MY CWA BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z AND WILL RAISE 
POPS TO 70 PERCENT CHA TO 40 PERCENT TRI. MAIN CONCERN HERE IS THAT 
DOWNSLOPING WILL LIMIT PRECIPITATION FROM TYS UP TO VJI AND HAVE 
BACKED OFF POPS THERE. MY CURRENT POP DISTRIBUTION IS BELOW MEX 
GUIDANCE BECAUSE DUE TO SOME REMAINING UNCERTAINTY FROM 
DENNIS...FEEL IT IS NOT PRACTICAL TO GO TO CATEGORICAL POPS SOUTHERN 
SECTIONS JUST YET. HAVE FOLLOWED HPC QPF GUIDANCE CLOSELY WITH ONLY 
MINOR TWEAKS TO BRING OUT TERRAIN INFLUENCES. WILL HAVE LOWER THAN 
GUIDANCE TEMPS HERE AS CLOUD COVER WILL BE ESPECIALLY THICK ACROSS 
SE TN.

TUESDAY...WITH DENNIS NOW FORECASTED TO MOVE INTO WESTERN KENTUCKY 
WILL START TO TAPER POPS DOWN BELOW THE LIKELY CATEGORY DURING THE 
DAY AS MOST OF THE MOISTURE THEN STARTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE 
REGION. HOWEVER...GFS INDICATES THAT DENNIS MAY STALL ACROSS THE 
OHIO VALLEY AND THEN TRACK BACK ACROSS MY FORECAST AREA INTO 
WEDNESDAY. WILL TREND TOWARD MEX TEMPS HERE AS CLOUD COVER STARTS TO 
THIN OUT.

WEDNESDAY...IF DENNIS STALLS AND THEN MOVES BACK ACROSS MY FORECAST 
AREA ON WEDNESDAY...WOULD SEE ANOTHER SHOT AT RAIN ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA. WITH THIS BEING THIS FAR OUT IN THE EXTENDED...WILL 
NOT GO COMPLETELY WITH THE GFS FORECAST AND ONLY ADVERTISE 30 POPS 
AT THIS POINT. THIS IS ACTUALLY ONLY 10 PERCENT BELOW MEX GUIDANCE. 
FOR TEMPS...WILL FOLLOW MEX GUIDANCE CLOSELY.

THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...THE REMAINS OF DENNIS PREDICTED BY THE GFS TO 
BE MOVING OUT ONLY LEAVING BEHIND SOME RESIDUAL MOISTURE WHICH COULD 
TOUCH OFF SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. FELT THAT 30 TO 
40 POPS WERE BEST SOLUTION HERE. 

IT IS CURRENTLY JUST A LITTLE TO EARLY TO PREDICT WITH ANY CERTAINTY 
A RAINFALL FORECAST FOR EXACT AMOUNTS FOR OUR REGION...BUT HEAVIER 
AMOUNTS SHOULD BE SEEN ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST 
NORTH CAROLINA MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY WITH LESSER AMOUNTS FROM 
KNOXVILLE ON NORTHEAST TOWARD THE TRI CITIES IN ASSOCIATION WITH 
DENNIS.

FRIDAY...THE DRYING TREND CONTINUES WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE

.LONG TERM...(TOMORROW NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)

MODEL DISCUSSION...STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY IN THE MODEL FORECAST FOR 
THE LONG TERM PERIOD. 06Z GFS STARTED TO MOVE BACK TO THE EAST WITH 
ITS TRACK OF DENNIS ALONG WITH ALL OF THE OTHER DYNAMICAL MODELS. 
NHC IN TCDAT4 PRODUCT MENTIONED THAT A GULFSTREAM IV JET MISSION 
LAST NIGHT DISCOVERED THE SUB TROPICAL RIDGING OVER THE ATLANTIC TO 
BE SOMEWHAT WEAKER THAN PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS HAD INDICATED. 
THEREFORE...TODAYS MODEL CYCLES HAVE RESPONDED WITH SHIFTING THE 
TRACK FURTHER TO THE EAST. THE 12Z GFS RESPONDED BY CALLING FOR A 
LANDFALL ACROSS THE BIG BEND REGION OF FLORIDA ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON 
AND MOVING THE SYSTEM JUST TO THE WEST OF CHATTANOOGA BY DAYBREAK 
MONDAY. OTHER GLOBAL MODELS...THE ECMWF AND UKMET HAVE NOT SHIFTED 
THE STORM AS FAR TO THE EAST AT THIS TIME. WHICH SUCH UNCERTAINTY 
FEEL IT IS PRUDENT NOT TO TOTALLY FOLLOW THE GFS SOLUTION AND GO 
WITH LIKELY POPS FOR THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY...BUT 
WILL NEVERTHELESS RATCHET UP POPS SOME.

FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...WITH CINDYS REMAINS WELL TO THE NORTH 
OF THE FORECAST AREA AT THE START OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD...THE 
REGION WILL RECEIVE A BRIEF RESPITE FROM THE RAINY WEATHER ON 
SATURDAY BEFORE FOCUS SHIFTS BACK TO THE SOUTH AND THE APPROACH OF 
HURRICANE DENNIS. AS TYPICAL WITH LARGE TROPICAL 
SYSTEMS...SUBSIDENCE OUT IN FRONT OF THE STORM WILL PROVIDE SOME 
NICE WEATHER FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND 
WARM CONDITIONS. IN FACT...TEMPS MAY BE 20 DEGREES WARMER IN SOME 
PLACES THAN WHAT OCCURRED ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON. WILL ONLY PLACE A 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP SOUTHERN SECTIONS AND INTO THE MOUNTAINS TO 
ACCOUNT FOR AFTERNOON CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY...THOUGH SHOULD BE 
EXTREMELY ISOLATED UNTIL SUNDAY MORNING. 

SUNDAY...AS THE OUTER FRINGES OF DENNIS START TO MOVE TOWARD THE 
REGION...WILL INCREASE POPS SOUTH TO NORTH DURING THE DAY. WILL GO 
FOR 40 TO 50 PERCENT FOR CHATTANOOGA BY SUNDAY EVENING AND 20S AND 
30S ACROSS CENTRAL AND NORTHERN SECTIONS. WILL GO SLIGHTLY BELOW MAV 
GUIDANCE HERE TO ACCOUNT FOR CLOUD COVER. 

MONDAY...IF THE 12Z GFS VERIFIES WE COULD BE LOOKING AT ANOTHER 
TROPICAL SYSTEM TRAVERSING OUR REGION. WITH UNCERTAINTY STILL IN THE 
FORECAST AS EXPLAINED ABOVE...WILL ONLY GO UP TO 50 PERCENT CHANCE 
OF RAIN FOR MONDAY SOUTH AND 40 ELSEWHERE. WILL KNOCK MAX TEMPS DOWN 
A FEW DEGREES BELOW GUIDANCE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CLOUDY SKIES. 
AGAIN...IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT MUCH UNCERTAINTY EXISTS IN THE 
PATH OF DENNIS. THE EVENTUAL PATH OF THE STORM WILL DICTATE WHAT 
WEATHER WE EXPERIENCE EARLY IN THE WORK WEEK.

TUESDAY...DENNIS WILL MOVE INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY DURING THE 
MORNING HOURS. 06Z GFS INDICATED A LARGE MID LEVEL RIDGE SETTING UP  
OVER THE REGION AND CAUSING DENNIS TO STALL. 12Z GFS NOT SO BULLISH 
ON THIS FEATURE THOUGH IT DOES BRING THE REMAINS OF DENNIS BACK 
THROUGH MY FORECAST AREA TUESDAY AFTERNOON WITH ANOTHER SHOT AT 
RAINFALL THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. WILL ONLY GO WITH 30 POPS HERE AS 
MODELS ARE HIGHLY DIVERGENT BY THIS TIME IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...REMNANTS OF TS CINDY MAKING MORE 
RAPID PROGRESSION THAN PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED. GFS APPEARS TO HAVE 
BEST HANDLE ON CURRENT CINDY PRECIP TRENDS AND IS THUS THE PREFERRED 
SOLUTION. LATEST GFS RUN HAS MOVED TRACK SLIGHTLY WESTWARD AND NOW 
DEPICTS BULLSEYE OF HEAVIEST PRECIP JUST WEST OF THE APPALACHIANS 
AND DIRECTLY OVER OUR FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE FIRST PERIOD. RAPID 
PROGRESSION SHOULD LIMIT QPF SOMEWHAT THOUGH. DOWNSLOPE FLOW 
COMPONENT ALSO A LIMITING FACTOR. NEVERTHELESS...EXPANDING FFA TO 
INCLUDE ENTIRE CWA SEEMS PRUDENT GIVEN THE RATHER WET CONDITIONS 
THAT HAVE PREVAILED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS IN MANY AREAS. 
NEEDLESS TO SAY...CATEGORICAL POPS IN ORDER...ESPECIALLY FROM THE 
CENTRAL VALLEY NORTHEAST. ALSO GENERALLY FAVORED COOLER GFS GUIDANCE 
TEMPS.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN CHANGES MADE EARLY 
WERE TO TAPER OFF RAINS A LITTLE QUICKER ON FRIDAY MORNING DUE TO 
FASTER EXPECTED TRACK OF CINDY REMNANTS.  ALSO...SOME CHANGES MADE 
TO MANY AREAS FOR LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY TO REMOVE THE SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS (ALL BUT ERN MTNS AND EXTREME SE TN AREAS).  I PREFERRED 
THE GFS MODELS DEPICTION OF A BRIEF BREAK IN THE RAINY WEATHER 
BEHIND THE EXIT OF CINDY...AND ALSO HURRICANE DENNIS DOES NOT COME 
INTO OUR WEATHER PICTURE TOO SOON.  MODELS DO SHOW A LOT OF VARIANCE 
AS THEY BEGIN TO PICK UP DENNIS OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO THIS WEEKEND.
HOWEVER...EXPECT MORE DRY AREAS THAN IN A LONG TIME FOR SAT AND SUN. 
KEPT IN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THOSE DAYS WHERE WE NEEDED TO MESH WITH 
FFC AND GSP GRIDS.  THE OFFICIAL NHC TRACK OF DENNIS AND OPERATIONAL 
GFS HINTED AT DENNIS AFFECTING OUR WEATHER BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...AND
POPS WERE RAISED JUST SLIGHTLY FOR WEDS WITH PRELIMINARY GRIDS FOR 
THURSDAY (NEW DAY 7) INTRODUCED AS A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS.

OTHERWISE...ZFP...WEB PRODUCTS AND FLASH FLOOD WATCH ALREADY ISSUED.

312 PM EDT WED JUL 6 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TOMORROW NIGHT) ALL EYES FOCUSED ON 
THE MOVEMENT OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION CINDY AS IT MOVES NORTHEAST 
TOWARD OUR REGION. CURRENT SATELLITE IMAGE HAS THE CENTER OF 
CIRCULATION ABOUT 50 MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST OF MONTGOMERY ALABAMA. 
KBMX RADAR SHOWS A LARGE PRECIPITATION SHIELD MOVING NORTHEAST 
TOWARD MY FORECAST AREA. HAVE ALREADY ISSUED THE FLOOD WATCH AND 
WILL LET CURRENT CONFIGURATION CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING HOURS. 

OUT AHEAD OF CINDY...WHERE A LITTLE HEATING OCCURRED THIS MORNING 
COUPLED WITH RISING MOTION ATTRIBUTED TO A LEFTOVER 
BOUNDARY...NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED. SOME 
OF THIS ACTIVITY IS VERY HEAVY NECESSITATING A FEW FLASH FLOOD 
WARNINGS. THIS ACTIVITY IS CONTINUING TO MOVE OFF TO THE NORTHEAST 
INTO HAMBLEN AND GREENE COUNTIES AT THIS TIME. RAINFALL RATES ARE 
AROUND ONE INCH OR MORE PER HOUR. 

TONIGHT...SOMEWHAT OF A NO BRAINER. WILL GO WITH HIGHER POPS SOUTH 
AS MAIN RAIN SHIELD APPROACHES. GFS HAS 100 POPS IN CHATTANOOGA AND 
FIND IT HARD TO ARGUE WITH THIS FORECAST. WILL TAPER POPS DOWN TO 
NEAR 50 PERCENT NORTH AS MAIN ACTIVITY WILL NOT ARRIVE THERE UNTIL 
DAYBREAK.

TOMORROW...TRACK OF CINDY WILL BE ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE 
APPALACHIANS AND THIS WILL HELP DECREASE RAINFALL AMOUNTS ACROSS 
PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA DUE TO DOWNSLOPING. HOWEVER...WILL 
STILL LIKELY SEE SOME PRECIPITATION AREAWIDE. THEREFORE...WILL HAVE 
HIGHEST POPS (100 PERCENT) ON THE MOUNTAIN TOPS TAPERING DOWN TO 60 
PERCENT IN THE FAR NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE CWA. THIS FOLLOWS CLOSELY 
WITH MAV GUIDANCE. 

TOMORROW NIGHT...AS THE SYSTEM EXITS TO THE NORTH...WILL KEEP LIKELY 
POPS NORTHEAST UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT WHEN IT WILL TAPER DOWN TO 
CHANCE POPS. 

FLOODING CONCERNS WILL BE GREATEST IN THE MOUNTAINOUS AREAS WHERE 
RAINFALL IS PREDICTED TO BE HEAVIEST. RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF 2 TO 4 
INCHES SHOULD BE COMMON ACROSS THE RIDGETOPS ON THE TN-NC BORDER AND 
IN CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES. LESSER AMOUNTS DOWN INTO THE VALLEY 
WITH AMOUNTS NEARING 1 INCH IN THE TRI CITIES AND KNOXVILLE METRO 
AREAS. LESSER AMOUNTS BACK TOWARD THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU OF HALF 
INCH WILL BE POSSIBLE. CHATTANOOGA METRO SHOULD BE BETWEEN ONE AND 
ONE HALF INCH FROM THIS SYSTEM.

WIND THREATS...WILL ADD GUSTY WORDING TO THE ZONES IN THE 
MOUNTAINS AS COULD SEE SOME GUSTS UP TO 25 TO 30 MPH. BUT AT THIS 
TIME CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH NOR WOULD IT MEET LOCAL CRITERIA 
FOR WIND ADVISORY.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY) AFTER THE REMAINS OF T.S. 
CINDY EXIT THE REGION...WE WILL HAVE A FEW DAYS RESPITE FROM THE 
RAINS BEFORE SUMMERTIME AFTERNOON CONVECTION RETURNS.  THE BIG 
UNKNOWN IN THE FORECAST IS THE TRACK OF T.S. (MOST LIKELY SOON 
HURRICANE) DENNIS.  THERE IS A WIDE SPREAD OF LANDFALL POSSIBILITIES 
FROM WESTERN LOUISIANA TO TAMPA SO ITS IMPACT ON THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS IS STILL WAY UP IN THE AIR.  IF IT WERE TO IMPACT THE 
REGION IT WOULD BE IN THE EARLY TO MID PART OF NEXT WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...NEWLY DOWNGRADED TROPICAL DEPRESSION CINDY LOCATED 40 
MILES NORTH OF MOBILE ALABAMA. SUSTAINED WINDS OF ONLY 35 MPH 
PERSISTING VERY NEAR THE CENTER. THIS WILL BE THE MAIN FOCUS FOR OUR 
WEATHER OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. THE MAIN THREATS FROM CINDY 
WILL BE VERY HEAVY RAIN. SOME BREEZY CONDITIONS COULD DEVELOP OVER 
THE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN ON THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. 

CURRENT GUIDANCE FROM NHC MOVES THE CENTER OF WHAT WILL REMAIN OF 
CINDY OVER EXTREME SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA IN 24 HOURS THEN 
CONTINUING THE NORTHEAST MOVEMENT ACROSS WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON THURSDAY AND MOVING THE REMAINS OUT OF OUR 
REGION AND INTO CENTRAL VIRGINIA ON FRIDAY MORNING. ALONG THIS 
PATH...THE HEAVIEST RAIN WILL LIKELY FALL ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
OF THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND OVER SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. 
HPC AND RFC QPF AMOUNTS OF AROUND 1 TO 3 INCHES WILL BE LIKELY 
ACROSS THESE AREAS WITH ISOLATED HIGHER AMOUNTS APPROACHING 4 
INCHES. WE HAVE JUST ISSUED A FLOOD WATCH FOR ALL OF THE EAST 
TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES IN SOUTHWEST 
NORTH CAROLINA. ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS WATCH ARE 
HAMBLEN...GREENE...COCKE...AND JEFFERSON COUNTIES DUE TO POSSIBLE 
RIVER FLOODING OF THE NOLICHUCKY...PIGEON AND FRENCH BROAD RIVERS 
FROM HEAVY RAINS FALLING IN THEIR HEADWATERS IN THE MOUNTAINS. 
LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE WATCH WILL LIKELY SEE UP TO ONE INCH OF 
RAIN...WITH ISOLATED AMOUNTS APPROACHING ONE AND A HALF INCHES. 

FOR THE UPDATE...WILL BE UPDATING THE ZONES TO INCLUDE THE FLOOD 
WATCH. ADDITIONALLY...BASED ON RADAR TRENDS...OUTER BANDING FROM 
CINDY MOVING NORTHEASTWARD OUT OF ALABAMA TOWARD MY TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA COUNTIES AND WILL GO AHEAD AND RAISE POPS 
TO LIKELY THERE. WILL CUT BACK MAX TEMPS A COUPLE OF DEGREES DUE TO 
CLOUDY SKIES OVER A PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA. WILL BE WATCHING 
LATEST MODEL RUNS AND GUIDANCE ON A POSSIBLE LAKE WIND OR WIND 
ADVISORY FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN...BUT WILL HOLD OFF FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RATHER TYPICAL SUMMER WEATHER 
ANTICIPATED THROUGH MOST OF THE SHORT TERM AS REMNANTS OF TS CINDY 
APPROACH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD. 
HAVE GENERALLY UNDERCUT GUIDANCE POPS FOR TODAY AS THEY SEEM 
OVERDONE BASED ON PROJECTED OPERATIONAL MODEL PARAMETERS. MODEL TIME 
HEIGHTS DEPICT UNIMPRESSIVE MOISTURE PROFILE WITH GENERAL SUBSIDENCE 
PROJECTED IN THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE. FORECAST SOUNDINGS 
DEPICT WEAK MID-LEVEL CAP THROUGH MUCH OF THE FIRST PERIOD. THUS 
ANTICIPATING ONLY SCATTERED...MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION AT THIS TIME 
IN SPITE OF ILL-DEFINED SURFACE BOUNDARY LURKING NEARBY. RESIDUAL 
MOISTURE FROM CINDY ENCROACHES SOUTHERN TIER OF FORECAST AREA BY 
LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD PER GFS. HAVE INCREASED POPS IN THOSE 
AREAS LATE. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY STUCK WITH PRECEDING 
GRIDS/FORECAST.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MAIN WEATHER EVENT IS 
THE EXPECTED REMNANTS OF T.S. CINDY ON THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT.
PER DISCUSSIONS...GFS MODEL BEST OF THE BUNCH AND CLOSEST TO NHC 
TRACK...SO MANY OF THE GRIDS (SUCH AS WINDS AND QPF) WERE ADJUSTED 
IN LINE WITH 06/00Z GFS MODEL.  KEPT THE HIGHEST POPS AND HEAVIEST 
QPF ACROSS SWRN NC AND EXTREME ERN TN ZONES...INCREASING POPS TO 
LIKELY TO JUST INTO CATEGORICAL FOR THOSE AREAS BY THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON.  GENERALLY ALL SHORT RANGE MODELS MOVE REMNANTS OF CINDY 
QUICKER EAST OF THE REGION BY EARLY FRIDAY MORNING...THUS POPS WERE 
TRIMMED BACK FROM THE WEST A BIT FASTER THAN PREVIOUS GRIDS.  MAX 
TEMPS WERE ALSO LOWERED SOME ON THURSDAY DUE TO THE APPROACH OF 
CONVECTIVE PCPN AND CLOUDS.

SEEMS STILL EARLY TO ISSUE ANY SORT OF FLOOD WATCH FOR THURSDAY...
BUT WILL UPDATE OUR SPS FOLLOWING THE EARLY MORNING UPDATE ON CINDY.

OTHERWISE...JUST VERY MINOR CHANGES INTO FRIDAY...AND THE ADDITION 
OF SOME PRELIMINARY GRIDS FOR NEW DAY 7 (WEDNESDAY).  TROPICAL STORM 
DENNIS IS JUST TOO FAR AWAY AT THIS TIME...TO JUSTIFY MUCH DETAIL IN 
THE GRIDS FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...BIG WEATHER STORY IN THE 
SHORT TERM WILL BE THE ONGOING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVING 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA AT THE START OF THE PERIOD. ONE 
THUNDERSTORM OVER SCOTT COUNTY PROMPTED A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM 
WARNING...BUT HAS SINCE WEAKENED BELOW SEVERE LIMITS. SOME OF THESE 
STORMS HAVE ALSO CONTAINED VERY HEAVY RAINFALL RATES NEAR ONE AND 
ONE HALF INCH PER HOUR. WITH MOST OF THE ACTIVITY MOVING TOWARD THE 
EASTERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA AT THIS TIME...WILL START THE 
FORECAST PERIOD WITH 50 PERCENT POPS EVERYWHERE EXCEPT THE MOUNTAIN 
COUNTIES WHERE WILL CONTINUE LIKELY POPS NEAR 60 PERCENT. 

OVERNIGHT...EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DIMINISH THROUGH THE 
NIGHT AND JUST ONLY LIGHT SCATTERED SHOWERS SHOULD PERSIST 
OVERNIGHT. WITH RAIN SEEN AROUND THE TRI CITIES AIRPORT...WILL GO 
AHEAD AND ADD PATCHY FOG IN THE NE SECTIONS OF THE CWA...BUT WILL 
NOT INCLUDE ELSEWHERE AT THIS TIME. FOR TEMPERATURES WILL GO AHEAD 
AND TREND TOWARD THE WARMER GUIDANCE AS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND CLOUD 
COVER WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.

TOMORROW...FOG SHOULD LIFT OUT NE SECTIONS YIELDING TO PARTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA EARLY AS ALL ATTENTION SHIFTS TO THE 
SOUTH TOWARD TROPICAL STORM CINDY. AFFECTS SHOULDNT BE FELT ACROSS 
MY CWA UNTIL THURSDAY AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...WITH TROPICAL MOISTURE 
STREAMING NORTHWARD WILL RUN 40 POPS SOUTH AND 20 NORTH AS AFTERNOON 
HEATING MAY HELP TO KICK OFF SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. WILL GO 
SLIGHTLY BELOW GUIDANCE FOR MAX TEMPS TOMORROW AS WELL.


.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...FRONT LINGERS ACROSS 
AREA INTO WEDNESDAY EVENING.  WILL KEEP LOW CHANCE POPS IN THE SOUTH 
FOR WEDNESDAY EVENING...THEN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THE ENTIRE AREA FOR 
THE REST THE NIGHT.  REMNANTS FOR TROPICAL STORM CINDY PUSHING IN 
FROM SOUTH.  GFS IS A LOT QUICKER WITH PRECIP MOVING IN...BRINGING 
IT IN ON WEDNESDAY.  WENT WITH THE ETA WHICH IS CLOSER TO HPC/TPC 
TRACK ON HELD OFF BEST CHANCES UNTIL THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND THURSDAY 
NIGHT...WENT WITH 50 POPS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND DECREASING POPS 
WESTWARD.  HIGHEST QPF WILL BE IN THE MOUNTAINS EAST OF THE EXPECTED 
TRACK.  DRIER WEATHER PUSHES IN FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...SHOULD BE 
ONLY DIURNAL ACTIVITY BOTH DAYS.  WENT WITH A DRY SUNDAY WITH HIGH 
PRESSURE ACROSS THE AREA.  NEXT TROPICAL SYSTEM MOVING UP FROM THE

BETTER CHANCE SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL AFTER TUESDAY.

.DISCUSSION...GENERALLY PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES ACROSS THE CWA 
THIS MORNING. A MODERATE TO OCCASIONALLY HEAVY AREA OF SHOWERS MOVED 
FROM KNOXVILLE NORTHEASTWARD TOWARD TRI CITIES THIS MORNING AND HAS 
SINCE LEFT THE FORECAST AREA. ALL FOCUS NOW TURNS BACK TO THE WEST 
WHERE 12Z SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWED AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT 
STRETCHING FROM DETROIT MI SOUTHWEST TO NEAR DYERSBURG TN. AHEAD OF 
THIS FRONT A BROKEN LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAS DEVELOPED 
ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND NORTHERN ALABAMA. THIS LINE IS MOVING TO 
THE EAST AROUND 20 MPH. 

WITH ONLY THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA SEEING SIGNIFICANT 
BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS...FEEL BEST ORGANIZED CONVECTION WILL TAKE 
PLACE THERE AND HAVE RAISED POPS TO 70 PERCENT. HAVE DECIDED TO KEEP 
POPS AT 70 PERCENT ELSEWHERE AS APPROACHING SHOWERS ARE NOT 
WEAKENING TO MUCH. WILL NOT TAKE TO MUCH HEATING IN THIS MOIST 
AIRMASS TO TOUCH OFF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. MORNING SOUNDING 
FROM OHX CAME IN WITH 1500 J/KG OF CAPE AND AN LI OF -5. MSAS 
ANALYSIS HAS AN AREA OF -3 TO -4 LIS ACROSS MY SOUTHERN VALLEY AT 
THIS TIME. ONLY ISOLATED PULSE TYPE SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ARE 
EXPECTED TODAY...IF ANY AT ALL...AND MAINLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
THIRD OF THE CWA. CURRENT HWO HIGHLIGHTS THIS POSSIBILITY WELL.

FOR THE UPDATE THIS MORNING WILL REMOVE MORNING WORDING FROM ZONES. 
WILL ALSO LOWER MAX TEMPS A CATEGORY AS CLOUD COVER AND APPROACHING 
SHOWERS WILL HAMPER THE WARM UP. WILL HAVE THE ZONES OUT SHORTLY.

HAVE A GREAT DAY

325 AM EDT TUE JUL 5 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES GENERALLY 
AGREE THAT WEAK UPPER TROUGH/SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE 
FORECAST AREA DURING THE FIRST PERIOD. THIS FEATURE WILL GENERATE 
SCATTERED AND POSSIBLY EVEN ORGANIZED CONVECTION...ESPECIALLY DURING 
MAXIMUM SURFACE HEATING TIME FRAME. THUS HAVE INCREASED POPS TO 
LIKELY CATEGORY FOR MOST LOCATIONS. ANTICIPATE ANY ORGANIZED 
CONVECTION TO MOVE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS BY THE SECOND 
PERIOD...BUT CANT RULE OUT LINGERING SCATTERED ACTIVITY AND 
CONTINUED CHANCE POPS. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE BLEND OF 
GUIDANCE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...TWO MAIN FEATURES WILL BE 
THE COLD FRONT JUST COMING INTO THE REGION TODAY...AND THEN THE 
TROPICAL SYSTEM (DEPRESSION #3) WHICH IS PROGGED TO ENTER THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AROUND THURSDAY.  REMNANTS OF THIS TROPICAL 
SYSTEM MAY INTERACT WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND AFFECT OUR REGION
...BUT THE PROBLEM IS TIMING AND THE TRACK OF THE DEPRESSION AT THIS 
POINT.  

FOR THE COLD FRONT...MODELS HAD TRIED TO PUSH A COLD FRONT THROUGH 
THIS PAST WEEKEND...AND SUGGESTED DRYING WHICH NEVER QUITE HAPPENED.
THIS COULD INDEED HAPPEN AGAIN WITH THE FRONT COMING INTO THE REGION 
TODAY.  HOWEVER...I DID ADJUST POPS DOWN SLIGHTLY FOR NRN AREAS FOR 
WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY...TO BETTER MESH WITH NEIGHBORS GRIDS AND 
LATEST MOS POPS.  KEPT CHANCE POPS GOING FOR SRN MOST AREAS...SINCE 
FRONT MAY STALL AND ALSO THE TROPICAL SYSTEM WILL AFFECT SRN AREAS 
INITIALLY.  WILL LET LATER SHIFTS CONSIDER MAKING ANY MORE 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FOR LATE FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND...ONCE THE 
TRACK AND TIMING OF THE DEPRESSION BECOMES MORE CERTAIN.

OTHERWISE...ADDED SOME PRELIMINARY GRIDS FOR THE NEW DAY SEVEN 
(TUESDAY) AND MADE VERY MINOR MAX/MIN TEMP ADJUSTMENTS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUE)...CONVECTION OVER THE AREA SHOULD 
DIMINISH OVERNIGHT AS WE LOSE SOLAR HEATING.  WILL CARRY CHANCE 
POPS...MAINLY EVENING.   TOMORROW...A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL BE 
APPROACHING FROM THE NORTHWEST...BUT IT WILL BE SLOW MOVING AND WILL 
STILL BE NORTHWEST OF THE AREA BY EVENING.  ALTHOUGH ORGANIZED 
FORCING IS EXPECTED TO BE LACKING...WITH CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE AND 
INSTABILITY ONCE AGAIN TOMORROW...40 TO 50 POPS LOOK REASONABLE. MAV 
TEMPS LOOK OK...SO ONLY MINOR TWEAKS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...FRONT LINGERS ACROSS 
AREA INTO WEDNESDAY.  WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS IN FOR WEDNESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  MOISTURE DECREASING ON THURSDAY...BUT WITH THE 
FRONT STILL NEAR...WILL CONTINUE LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY AND 
THURSDAY NIGHT.   FRONT SOUTH OF AREA BY FRIDAY.  MOISTURE LIMITED 
BUT WITH SOME INSTABILITY TO TRIGGER SOME DIURNAL ACTIVITY...WILL 
KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY.  TROPICAL SYSTEM MOVING UP FROM 
THE SOUTH BY THIS WEEKEND.  WENT WITH HPC/TCP TRACKS INSTEAD OF

347 AM EDT MON JUL 4 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE WEAK UPPER TROUGH FROM 24 
HOURS AGO IS GONE...WITH SHORTWAVE RIDGE NOW MOVING INTO PLACE.  THE 
WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS NOW ALMOST NON-EXISTANT.  DEWPOINT TEMPS 
ARE SLIGHTLY LOWER ACROSS SWRN VA AND NE TN WHERE LOW TO MID 60S 
WERE NOTED...AND GENERALLY UPPER 60S TO AROUND 70 DEGREES ELSEWHERE.

THIS ALL WOULD APPEAR TO NOT LEAVE ANY WELL DEFINED FOCUS FOR 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT LATER TODAY...OTHER THAN HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS 
SUCH AS SUGGESTED BY NAM/ETA AND NGM MODELS.  GFS MODEL LOOKS TO 
BROADBRUSH THE CONVECTIVE PCPN TOO MUCH.  CURRENT RADAR PICS SHOW 
LINGERING CONVECTION MAINLY CONFINED TO WRN NC.  PREVIOUS FORECAST 
AND GRIDS PAINTED LIKELY POPS THIS AFTERNOON FOR MTN ZONES...AND  
GENERALLY 30 PERCENT ELSEWHERE...WHICH LOOKS VERY REASONABLE TO ME.
POPS DIMINISHING TONIGHT TO 20 TO 30 PERCENT RANGE LOOKS FINE AS 
WELL.  SUPPOSE THAT AN ISOLATED STORM OR TWO MIGHT REACH MARGINAL 
SEVERE LEVELS...BUT OVERALL LOOKS TO BE ONE OF THE LESS STORMY 
FOURTHS OF JULY.

MADE VERY MINOR MAX TEMP ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON YESTERDAYS HIGHS... 
AND ALSO ADJUSTED MINS MORE IN LINE WITH PERSISTENCE OVER PAST FEW 
NIGHTS.  

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...ANOTHER COLD FRONT MOVES 
SOUTHEAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TUESDAY WITH A LARGE AREA OF PRE 
FRONTAL CONVECTION AHEAD OF IT. MODELS DISAGREE ON THE AFFECT FOR 
THE EASTERN TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE GFS KEEPS THE 
BULK OF THE CONVECTION TO THE SOUTH IN MS/AL/GA DURING THE DAY 
TUESDAY AND THEN DEVELOPS AN MCS OVER THE AR/TN BORDER AREA TUESDAY 
NIGHT AND SHIFTS THE LEFTOVERS INTO MIDDLE AND EAST TENNESSEE BY 
LATE WEDNESDAY. THE GFS DOES NOT BRING THE COLD FRONT THROUGH UNTIL 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE NAM BRINGS A LARGE AREA OF RAIN AHEAD OF THE 
FRONT ACROSS TN TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT AND HAS THE FRONT THROUGH 
WITH DRIER AIR OVER THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY WITH CONVECTION 
MOSTLY SOUTH. PREFER THE SLOWER GFS BUT WITHOUT THE HEAVIER QPF 
AMOUNTS WEDNESDAY. FROM THURSDAY ON THE GFS DRIES FORECAST AREA 
OUT WITH NOT MUCH CHANCE OF RAIN THROUGH SATURDAY. THE DGEX IS MORE 
REALISTIC WITH RAIN EACH DAY OF THE EXTENDED. TD NUMBER 3 MAY HAVE 
AN AFFECT ON THE FORECAST AREA AT THE END OF THE WEEK AS THE 
HURRICANE CENTER EXPECTS IT TO MOVE NE INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY 
FRIDAY. THIS SYSTEM WOULD INCREASE RAIN CHANCES AND AMOUNTS IF IT 
FOLLOWS THE CURRENT FORECAST TRACK.

.DISCUSSION...SKIES ARE PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY TONIGHT WITH SOME 
PATCHY FOG AFTER MUCH OF THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA 
RECEIVED SOME RAINFALL FROM SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS. A WEAK COLD 
FRONT LIES JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY BUT THE AIRMASS 
TO THE NORTH OVER TN IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENT. SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR LIES 
TO THE NORTH OF A LINE FROM LONESOME PINE VIRGINIA TO NASHVILLE TO 
JACKSON LINE. A WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROUGH LIES OVER THE MS VALLEY. 
BOTH THE NAM AND GFS BRING A VORTICITY LOBE TOWARD MIDDLE TN AND THE 
PLATEAU TODAY CREATING CONVECTION DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY 
EVENING. THE RUC AND THE GFS BRING A VORTICITY MAXIMUM ACROSS THE 
MOUNTAINS FROM SW TO NE. THIS OCCURS AS THE TROUGH MOVES EAST. 
SOUNDINGS SHOW THE AIRMASS TODAY WILL BECOME MODERATELY UNSTABLE 
WITH ALL THE MOISTURE LEFT OVER FROM THE LAST FEW DAYS CONVECTION 
BUT WINDS ALOFT WILL BE WEAK. A FEW STRONG THUNDERSTORMS MAY DEVELOP 
BUT THREAT FOR ORGANIZED SEVERE STORMS IS LIMITED. HEAVY RAINFALL 
WILL BE MORE OF A THREAT WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 1.5 
TO ALMOST TWO INCHES.

MONDAY RIDGING STRENGTHENS FROM THE SOUTH BUT AT THE SAME TIME 
SHORTWAVES MOVE FROM SW TO NE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
LOWERED RAIN CHANCES SLIGHTLY MONDAY AND RAISED HIGH TEMPERATURES. 
THEN TUESDAY ANOTHER COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND TRIES 
TO MOVE SOUTH INTO TN. RIDGE AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST WILL KEEP FRONT NEAR OR OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE 
REST OF THE WEEK. TYPICAL AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE ENHANCED SOMEWHAT WITH THE FRONT. THE PATTERN

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AREA RADARS RATHER VOID OF 
CONVECTIVE PCPN AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER...SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
DEWPOINTS REMAIN MOSTLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S THIS MORNING...AND 
THE COLD FRONT APPEARS TO BE STILL GENERALLY JUST TO OUR NW.  
DAYTIME HEATING SHOULD SEND TEMPS INTO THE 80S TO LOWER 90S...AND 
CREATE SOME INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING.  02/00Z 
MOS POPS ARE GENERALLY IN THE CHANCE RANGE ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA...SO DECIDED TO INCREASE POPS IN THE MTN ZONES AND EXTREME SRN 
COUNTIES INTO CHANCE CATEGORY.  ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ELSEWHERE. 

FOR TONIGHT...ASSUMING THAT COLD FRONT SHOULD EVENTUALLY PUSH SOUTH 
AND EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT FELT IT WAS WISE TO KEEP LOW 
POPS FOR MTNS AND SE TN INTO THE EVENING HOURS.  THIS ALSO MESHED 
BETTER WITH FFC AND GSP GRIDS.

OTHERWISE...JUST MINOR TEMP ADJUSTMENTS MADE BASED ON HIGHS 
YESTERDAY AND LATEST MOS MAX AND MIN TEMPS.  AREAS OF FOG MAY BE 
LOCALLY DENSE THIS MORNING...BUT SO FAR NOTHING WIDESPREAD.  WILL 
COVER THE FOG IN SHORT TERM FORECAST IF OBS SITES FALL MORE BY 
DAYBREAK.  SEE SOME POTENTIAL FOR AT LEAST PATCHY OR AREAS OF FOG 
AGAIN TONIGHT...BUT WILL WAIT AND SEE BEFORE ADDING AT THIS POINT. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...EVEN WITH COLD FRONT THROUGH 
THE FORECAST AREA THE AIRMASS CHANGE WILL BE MINIMAL AND WEAK 
IMPULSES MOVING FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS THE TN VALLEY SHOULD STILL 
DEVELOP WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR MOST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...THE 
NORTHERN TENNESSEE VALLEY AND THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. THE 
BERMUDA HIGH BUILDS NORTH MONDAY BUT WILL KEEP AFTERNOON AND EARLY 
EVENING SHOWERS IN THE FORECAST FOR PERSISTENCE. ANOTHER COLD FRONT 
APPROACHING THE OHIO VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT MOVES INTO THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY TUESDAY AND SLOWLY SAGS INTO THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY. THIS KEEPS A CHANCE OF CONVECTION OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...FOG BURNING OFF AND SKIES MOSTLY SUNNY THIS MID 
MORNING. GOOD HEATING EARLY WILL ALLOW FOR MOD-STRONG INSTABILITY 
THIS AFTERNOON WITH GOOD LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATE. UPPER TROUGH MOVING E 
TO THE NORTH OF TN WILL AID IN LIFT. BEST CONVERGENCE EARLY ALONG 
NORTHERN PLATEAU THEN PROGRESSES SE THROUGH THE MRX CWA FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF DAYLIGHT HOURS. HAIL THREAT LOOKS LOW BUT CHANCE FOR 
DAMAGING WINDS IS ON TRACK.  CURRENT FCST OF MORE CLOUD COVER AND 
SLIGHTLY LOWER MAX TEMPS FOR TDY REMAINS THE SAME. RAISED POPS TO 
LIKELY AREA-WIDE. STORM MOTIONS TO THE SE NEAR 15 MPH MAY LESSEN
MINOR FLOODING THREAT BUT HOURLY RATES AROUND THREE QUARTERS TO ONE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MCS ACTIVITY IS HOLDING TOGETHER 
QUITE WELL THIS MORNING OVER THE OHIO VALLEY INTO ERN KY.  BASED ON 
THIS AND THE FACT THAT THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO OUR NORTH WILL BE 
DROPPING SE THIS AFTERNOON...DECIDED TO INCREASE POPS TO LIKELY 
CATEGORY FOR LATER TODAY ACROSS NRN TWO-THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA.
THIS MESHES WELL WITH NEIGHBORING GRIDS AND ALSO WITH 01/00Z MOS.

MODERATE TO STRONG INSTABILITY FOR TODAY WITH OUR AREA INCLUDED IN A 
SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE STORMS.  RIGHT REAR QUAD OF THE UPPER LEVEL 
JET TO PASS ACROSS OHIO VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON DOES PROVIDE SOME 
UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE ACROSS AT LEAST SW VA AND NRN PARTS OF EAST 
TN.  OTHERWISE...THE AMOUNT OF SHEAR AND STORM RELATIVE HELICITY 
LOOKS QUITE WEAK ACROSS OUR REGION...SO EXPECT MAIN THREAT TO BE 
DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS.  WOULD NOT RULE OUT A FEW REPORTS OF 
HAIL...BUT THE FREEZING AND WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS LOOK A BIT TOO 
HIGH.  DID NOT MENTION SEVERE STORMS IN ZFP OR GRIDS...

FOR TONIGHT...I LIKED THE PREVIOUS GRIDS TIMING OF THE GRADUAL END 
OF ANY CONVECTION THIS EVENING...LEADING INTO A DRY WEEKEND BEHIND 
THE PASSING COLD FRONT.  

OTHERWISE...VERY MINOR TEMP/DEWPT AND MAX/MIN TEMP ADJUSTMENTS FROM 
PREVIOUS GRIDS.  DID INCLUDE SOME PATCHY AREAS OF FOG FOR EARLY THIS 
MORNING...MAINLY IN AREAS WHERE MEASURABLE PCPN OCCURRED OVER THE 
PAST 24 HOURS.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL PUSH 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY MORNING AS HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY MOVES SOME DRIER AIR INTO 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. KEPT SKIES MOSTLY SUNNY TO PARTLY CLOUDY 
WITH NO RAIN. COLD FRONT BECOMES STATIONARY TO THE SOUTH SUNDAY AND  
AS RIDGING BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHEAST AGAIN MOISTURE MOVES AROUND THE 
RIDGE AND INTO THE TN VALLEY. THE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD BE OVER THE MOUNTAINS FIRST ON SUNDAY WITH 
TYPICAL LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE 
MOUNTAINS AND THEN CONTINUES AREAWIDE THE 4TH OF JULY AND THROUGHOUT 
THE WEEK. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN HOT IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 
90S.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEAK SHORTWAVE AND 
INSTABILITY TRIGGERING ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE AREA...MAINLY 
ALONG THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  SCATTERED CONVECTION SHOULD CONTINUE 
INTO THE EVENING HOURS...THEN DIMINISH WITH THE LOSS OF SURFACE 
HEATING.  WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS WITH 
COLD FRONT ENTERING REGION.  FRONT SHOULD PASS THROUGH FRIDAY.  
PRETTY GOOD INSTABILITY AND UPPER DIVERGENCE ALONG WITH FRONT...WILL 
KEEP HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY.  WITH THE FRONT PASSING THROUGH... 
STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...STRONGER REENFORCING 
COOLER AIR ENTERING CWA FROM NORTHWEST WILL BE RUNNING INTO UNSTABLE 
AIR MASS FRIDAY EVENING...BUT WILL BE STARTING TO STABLIZE AFTER 
SUNSET.  ANOTHER PROBLEM WILL BE THE AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY LEFT IN 
AREA FROM AFTERNOON CONVECTION AND POSSIBLE WAVE OF PRECIP FROM 
EARLIER IN THE DAY.  WILL DIMINISH POPS OVERNIGHT...WITH BEST 
CHANCES IN THE NORTHEAST AND MOUNTAINS. 

SATURDAY THROUGH ABOUT NOON MONDAY...COOLER/STABLE AIR MASS SAGS 
INTO REGION...WILL ONLY HAVE SLGT POPS IN APP MOUNTAINS SUNDAY 
AFTN.  

BY MONDAY AFTERNOON...WILL START UP SUMMER SHOWER/TSTM REGIME 
AGAIN.  LOOKS LIKE UPPER LEVEL RIDGING EARLY IN THE WEEK WILL GIVE 
WAY TO TROUGH LATE IN THE WEEK.  WILL SLOWLY RAISE POPS DURING WEEK 
IN ANTICIPATION OF UPPER TROUGH.  

GENERALLY GOING ON COOL SIDE OF GUIDANCE...THINK OVER THE WEEKEND 
COOLER AIR MASS WILL FILL IN BETTER THAN MODELS SHOWING...THINK THEY 
ARE HAVING TROUBLE RESOLVING TERRAIN EFFECTS ON AIR MASS...THINK 
WHOLE WEST SIDE OF APPS WILL GET FULL COOL AIR MASS OVER 
WEEKEND...MODELS HINT THAT AIR MASS WONT MODIFY THAT MUCH...BUT 
THINK IT WILL.  ALSO...MODEL HIGH TEMPS LOOK A LITTLE TOO WARM FOR

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...BY THIS AFTERNOON...STRONG DIURNAL 
HEATING AND DEW POINTS IN THE UPPER 60S AND LOW 70S WILL HELP  
DESTABILIZE THE AIR MASS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION.  LIS 
OF AROUND -3 ARE EXPECTED WITH CAPE NEAR 1500J.  A WEAK DISTURBANCE 
MOVING THROUGH THE UPPER LEVEL WILL ADD LIFT.  HOWEVER...STRONGEST 
LIFT IS NOT WELL PHASED WITH BEST INSTABILITY.  AS A RESULT... 
SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT WILL REMAIN SCATTERED IN 
NATURE.  OTHERWISE...IT WILL BE ANOTHER WARM DAY AND WILL KEEP 
TEMPERATURE NEAR GUIDANCE. 

LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...NOT MANY CHANGES TO FORECAST. 
WEAK TROF LIFTS OUT, FLATTENED RIDGE TRIES TO MAKE A COMEBACK. 
HENCE, WEAKENED FRONT MAKES ATTEMPT AT CROSSING AREA LATE 
FRIDAY/EARLY SATURDAY. ONLY EFFECT WILL BE TO KEEP TEMPS AROUND 
NORMAL AS OPPOSED TO REALLY, REALLY HOT, AND SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR, BUT 
STILL MUGGY. TYPICAL SUMMERTIME LOOK RETURNS STARTING INDEPENDENCE 
DAY WITH LOW POPS, GENERALLY SUNNY BUT HAZY, AND HOT. FOR THE LEAST

BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE NAM AND GFS MODELS ON THURSDAY.  WENT

WITH CONVECTION BUT GFS MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE WEAK.  FOR TEMPERATURE
GUIDANCE WENT A LITTLE CLOSER BUT SLIGHTLY BELOW GFS NUMBERS.



.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...GENERALLY DRY WEATHER IN 
STORE FOR THIS WEEKEND AS UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE COLD 
FRONT PUSH EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS 
INTO THE AREA. A RETURN TO TYPICAL SUMMER-TYPE WEATHER IS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A BERMUDA HIGH DOMINATING THE FORECAST AREA WITH A 
VERY HUMID AND TROPICAL AIRMASS ACROSS THE REGION. SO FAR... 
CONVECTION TODAY HAS NOT BEEN AS EXTENSIVE AS YESTERDAY WHICH IS 
LIKELY DUE TO THE STABILIZING EFFECT OF THE EARLIER CONVECTION THIS 
MORNING. THINK THAT ADDITIONAL CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH THE UNSTABLE AND VERY MOIST AIRMASS IN 
PLACE. IN FACT...THINK CONVECTION COULD DEVELOP AT ANY TIME FOR THE 
NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...ALTHOUGH THE BEST COVERAGE WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. MODELS INDICATE THAT A COLD 
FRONT WILL SLOWLY APPROACH THE AREA BY THURSDAY NIGHT...ALTHOUGH 
THINK THAT THE MODELS MAY BE TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH ITS SOUTHWARD 
PROGRESSION SINCE THE UPPER DYNAMICS ARE NOT PROGGED TO BE TOO 
STRONG. WILL PLAN TO TREND THE FORECAST TOWARDS PERSISTENCE...SINCE 
THE LOCAL AIRMASS WILL REMAIN VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED UNTIL THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE ON FRIDAY. 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
ABOUT BRINGING COLD FRONT SLOWLY THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY TO 
JUST SOUTH OF TN SATURDAY BEFORE IT WASHES OUT. INSTABILITY 
INCREASES AND WITH THE FRONT IN THE VICINITY SOME STRONG STORMS ARE 
POSSIBLE FRIDAY. SPC HAS PART OF THE FORECAST AREA IN A SLIGHT RISK

THE OHIO VALLEY SINKS SOUTH. LOWS SHOULD DROP A FEW DEGREES INTO THE 
UPPER 50S NORTH AND LOWER TO MID 60S SOUTH FOR A COUPLE OF NIGHTS. 
AS MOISTURE LIFTS NORTH SUNDAY WILL INTRODUCE SLIGHT CHANCE RAIN 
AGAIN. BERMUDA HIGH STRENGTHENS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK OFF THE 
EAST COAST WHICH BRINGS MORE HUMID AIR AND CONTINUED CHANCE OF

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SITUATION: UPPER RIDGE 
DOMINATES SE US, BUT OLD UPPER LOW WHICH CUT OFF NOW BISECTS THE 
RIDGE AND REALLY VERY LITTLE CIRCULATION LEFT TO IT. IT APPARENTLY 
IS STILL ACTING AS A FOCUS MECHANISM FOR CONVECTION, HOWEVER. 
ANTI-CYCLONIC ROTATION AROUND SOUTHERN EDGE OF RIDGE APPARENT OVER 
MAINLY FLORIDA AND THIS IS ADVECTING HUGE AMOUNTS OF TROPICAL 
MOISTURE NORTHWARD. THIS HELP TO KEEP POPS UP THROUGH TONIGHT. HAVE 
INCREASED POPS TODAY IN TN/NC MOUNTAINS AND HIGHER TERRAIN OF 
EXTREME SW VA TO ACCOUNT. INSTABILITY IS MODERATE (0 TO -2) SO THERE 
MIGHT BE SOME BORDERLINE SEVERE THUNDRSTORMS AGAIN TODAY. AS LONG AS 
THE WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE (AS DEFINED BY THE LOW) HANGS AROUND, 
THIS WILL BE THE STORY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE FOURTH OF JULY)...CUT OFF LOW 
BEGINS TO FILL AND LIFT OUT IN RESPONSE TO UPPER MIDWEST TROFFING 
AROUND THURSDAY MORNING. RIDGE ASSERTS ITSELF AGAIN, BUT NOT AS 
DRAMATICALLY INITIALLY AS BEFORE. HOWEVER, BY INDEPENDENCE DAY, ITS 
BACK WITH A VENGEANCE. IF THE GFS COMES TO PASS, A 593 DM UPPER 
RIDGE BUILDS AGAIN, UNDERLAIN BY A STRONG SURFACE BERMUDA HIGH, FOR 
HOT, MUGGY, AND HAZY WEATHER.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
A WEAK TROUGH (OR OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY) GENERALLY ALONG THE TN/KY 
BORDER...WITH CURRENT CONVECTION OVER THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU CONCENTRATING AROUND THIS BOUNDARY. WITH A MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AND VERY MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE...EXPECT ADDITIONAL 
CONVECTION TO DEVELOP ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BEFORE THE 
SUN SETS THIS EVENING. THINK THAT A FEW ISOLATED PULSE SEVERE STORMS 
WILL DEVELOP THROUGH THE EARLY EVENING HOURS IN THIS MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIRMASS...WITH LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL ALSO POSSIBLE. WILL 
PLAN TO TREND THE FORECAST TOWARD PERSISTENCE...SINCE TOMORROW 
SHOULD BE VERY SIMILAR TO TODAY. THINK THAT AREAS OF FOG WILL LIKELY 
DEVELOP LATER TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE RAINFALL OCCURRED 
THIS AFTERNOON. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...FORECAST AREA IS 
CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN RIDGING TO THE WEST AND BERMUDA RIDGE 
TO THE EAST OVER THE SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC. WEAK TROUGH WILL STILL BE 
OVER THE OHIO AND TN VALLEYS WITH TROPICAL AIR COMING UP FROM THE 
SOUTH. GFS MODEL SHIFTS THE PRECIPITATION A LITTLE FARTHER EAST 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AS RIDGING FROM THE WEST MOVES TOWARDS THE TN 
VALLEY. THE NAM STRENGTHENS THE RIDGE BUT KEEPS THE TROUGH CENTERED 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH THURSDAY. 
WITH MODELS TENDING TO GO TOO HIGH IN THE SUMMER PREFER THE LOWER 
GFS. FOLLOWED A DIURNAL TREND WITH HIGHER POPS AFTERNOON AND EARLY 
EVENING WITH SLIGHT CHANCE THE REST OF THE DAY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD 
FOLLOW THE SAME TREND WITH HIGHS MID TO UPPER 80S AND LOWS UPPER 60S 
TO LOWER 70S. 

A STORM SYSTEM ACROSS THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST TODAY IS EXPECTED TO 
MOVE EAST ALONG THE CANADIAN BORDER AND THEN DIVE SOUTHEAST AROUND 
RIDGING OVER THE SOUTHWEST. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE TOWARDS THE

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WARM AND VERY HUMID AIRMASS OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S. AN 
UNMODIFIED MORNING SOUNDING FROM NASHVILLE ALREADY REVEALS A 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS WITH LIFTED INDICES AROUND -8 AND CAPES 
AROUND 2100 J/KG. THE LOCAL AIRMASS IS ALSO VERY MOIST WITH 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 1.9 INCHES AND K INDICES AROUND 40. 
THUS...EXPECT THE POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED SEVERE PULSE STORMS THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL AS WELL. HAVE ALREADY UPDATED THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK 
TO REFLECT THESE EXPECTATIONS. 

REST OF THE FORECAST LOOKS TO BE ON TARGET...WITH TEMPS...POPS AND 
WINDS IN GOOD SHAPE. THUS...NO UPDATES PLANNED FOR THIS MORNING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK SFC PRES GRADIENT ACROSS 
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. PATCHES OF LEFTOVER CONVECTION SLIDING 
UPSLOPE IN WRN NC MTNS TO DOWNSLOPE FROM THERE INTO TN VALLEY, 
WEAKENING AS IT COMES THIS WAY. SOME HINTS OF SLIGHTLY HIGHER CAPE 
IN CENTRAL VALLEY, BUT ITS JUST A LITTLE WARMER DOWN HERE, IS ALL. 
THIS WILL ALLOW SOME OF THE LEFTOVERS TO ENTER THE VALLEY LOCATIONS 
AND SO HAVE INCREASED POPS OVER SOUTHERN PARTS OF NORTHEAST TN 
ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND PARTS OF NORTHERN SOUTHEAST TN/SW NC 
TODAY. STILL MAINTAINED CHANCE CAT, THOUGH. REMNANTS OF 
SUBTROPICAL/TROPICAL/QUASITROPICAL LOW MOVING AROUND RIDGE HAVE 
CREATED A LITTLE OF A DIFFICULT ISOBAR PATTERN AND SO NO REAL 
DRIVING DYNAMICAL LOW LEVEL FORCE TO PUSH AIR PARCELS UPWARD. 
HEAVIER RAINS FALLING IN NC MOUNTAIN/SC UPLANDS WILL NOT LIKELY MAKE 
THIS FAR IN ORGANIZED FASHION. SOME MINOR LOCAL FLOODING, ESPECIALLY 
IN FLOOD PRONE SPOTS OR HEAVILY URBANIZED AREAS MIGHT OCCUR. FOR 
TEMPS, HAVE ADJUSTED HIS/LOWS TO JUST BELOW THE BLEND GUIDANCE TO 
ACCOUNT FOR SOME CLOUDS TODAY AND BELIEVE THE GUIDANCE FOR TONIGHT 
WAS TOO HIGH.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...ATLANTIC AND GULF OF MEXICO 
WILL BE READILY TAPPED FOR MOISTURE AS RIDGING BUILDS ONCE AGAIN 
OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WITH HEIGHT GRADIENT BETWEEN THIS HIGH AND 
A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE IN POSITION ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO 
VALLEYS EARLY IN THE PERIOD WHICH MIGRATES E ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS 
ON THURSDAY. USED CHC POPS WITH HIGHEST VARIETY IN THE MTNS AND ON 
THE PLATEAU TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY AS ATMOSPHERE PROGGED TO BE 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE WITH HIGH PWS AND LIFT VCNTY OF MID SOUTH 
TROUGH. GFS STILL BRINGS FRONTAL BOUNDARY SOUTH AND TRIES TO PRESS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...AFTER SCATTERED LIGHT 
SHOWERS MOVED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT AND EARLY THIS 
MORNING CLOUD COVER THINNED ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA 
WHICH IS TYPICAL WITH A SOUTHEAST TO EASTERLY FLOW. DOWNSLOPING OFF 
THE MOUNTAINS HELPED CLEAR OUT THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. DOPPLER RADAR SHOWS ONE PATCH OF SHOWERS NEAR CHATTANOOGA AND 
SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS IN THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS OTHERWISE THE RADAR 
SCREEN IS CLEAR. WILL START OUT WITH CHANCE POPS FOR THE LATE 
AFTERNOON. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE STILL LIES OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH 
THE UPPER LEVEL NEAR MOB. THE GFS BRINGS TO MUCH QPF OVER THE 
MOUNTAINS AS IT ROTATES AROUND THE UPPER LOW WITH THE NAM MORE 
REALISTIC. WILL TAPER POPS BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE BY EARLY EVENING 
TONIGHT WITH THE BEST CHANCE LATE AFTERNOON DURING PEAK HEATING 
TODAY. MONDAY THE CENTER OF THE UPPER LOW MOVES NORTH INTO WEST TN 
SO INSTABILITY WILL BE GREATER AND MORE LOW LEVEL SHEAR. SPC IN THE 
DAY 2 OUTLOOK MENTIONED POSSIBLE MULTICELL STORMS WITH HIGH WINDS 
AND HAIL. WILL NOT MENTION SEVERE BUT INCLUDE THUNDER FOR ALL DAY 
MONDAY. TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN SLOWER WITH THE HIGHER MOISTURE 
CONTENT IN THE AIR AND MORE CLOUD COVER. EXPECT LOWS TONIGHT TO DROP 
TO THE UPPER 60S TO NEAR 70 AND HIGHS TO REACH THE MID 80S. HAZY 
SKIES WILL ALSO CONTINUE ESPECIALLY IN THE MORNING.             

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE 
IN AGREEMENT IN KEEPING TROPICAL MOISTURE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH AT LEAST MID-WEEK.  A 
WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE WILL REMAIN OVER THE REGION...BUT 
OVERALL...LITTLE IN THE WAY OF UPPER SUPPORT FOR CONVECTION. MAIN 
LIFT WILL BE TERRAIN AND LIFT OVER SURFACE BOUNDARIES...GENERALLY 
TYPICAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR.

I EXPECT GENERALLY DIURNAL AFTERNOON/EVENING CONVECTION. SOME OF 
THESE STORMS WILL PRODUCE HEAVY RAINS...FREQUENT LIGHTNING...AND 
ISOLATED SEVERE EACH DAY.  AN UPPER TROUGH MOVING EAST ACROSS 
SOUTHERN CANADA AND NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY WILL HELP TO 
PULL A COLD FRONT TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS LATE IN THE WEEK. LATEST GFS SHOWS THIS FRONT MOVING 
SOUTH OF THE FORECAST FOR FRIDAY THEN LIFTING BACK NORTH AS A WARM 
FRONT SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. CONFIDENCE OF SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT OF FRONT 
LOW...SO WILL MAINTAIN CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LOW CENTERED SOUTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA WILL BE THE PROBLEM FOR TODAY.  INCREASED MOISTURE AND 
SHOWERS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE AREA OVERNIGHT WILL SPREAD NORTH 
AND WEST THROUGHOUT TODAY AND TONIGHT.  SOME BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 
THE NAM AND GFS MODELS LEAD TO BIG SPREAD IN GUIDANCE NUMBERS.  NAM 
TAKES THE BULK OF THE MOISTURE AND PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE 
REGION...WHILE THE GFS LIMITS THE MOISTURE OVER OUR 
REGION...THEREFORE LOWER POPS.  GENERALLY SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THE TWO NUMBERS WITH SLIGHT LEANING TOWARDS THE HIGHER NAM 
VALUES.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...LOWER PRESSURE SFC AND ALOFT 
WILL CONTINUE TO ESTABLISH ITSELF ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. 
DRIFTING W INTO THE MS AND OH VLY BEFORE BEING PICKED UP BY THE 
WESTERLIES IN A SHEARING AND WEAKENING FASHION BY MIDWEEK. MOISTURE 
SOURCE INITIALLY WILL BE THE ATLANTIC AND THEN WILL SHIFT TO THE 
GULF OF MEXICO TUE/WED AND THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF VAPOR FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF SHRA AND SOME TSRA MON THROUGH WED AS FA BECOMES 
POSITIONED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CIRCULATION IN BEST LIFT AND 
MOISTURE CONVERGENCE. USED HIGHER CHC POPS WITH EMPHASIS IN THE 
MAJOR TERRAIN AREAS THROUGH THIS PERIOD. MAINTAINED SLIGHTLY LOWER

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MOISTURE HAS INCREASED 
GRADUALLY OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS AS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW OFF THE 
SOUTHEAST COAST HAS MOVED SLOWLY NORTH. THE SURFACE LOW WAS 280 
MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE CAROLINAS ABOUT 100 MILES FARTHER NORTH THAN 
FRIDAY. SCATTERED SHOWERS HAVE MOVED NORTH INTO THE CENTRAL 
CAROLINAS AND CENTRAL GEORGIA BY MID AFTERNOON. CURRENT RADAR 
SIMILAR TO FRIDAY WITH ONLY A FEW WEAK SHOWERS SO FAR ON THE 
SOUTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. TEMPERATURES ARE A DEGREE OR SO COOLER 
THAN YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME...MOSTLY IN THE MID 80S. DEWPOINTS HAVE 
RISEN A FEW DEGREES AS WELL. 

GFS IS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH BRINGING MOISTURE NORTHWEST OVER THE 
MOUNTAINS SUNDAY WITH LIKELY POPS IN THE SOUTH. THE NAM/ETA IS A 
LITTLE MORE REASONABLE AND WILL FOLLOW CLOSER...FROM CHANCE SOUTH TO 
SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH. TEMPERATURES SUNDAY WILL BE A FEW DEGREES 
COOLER TOO DUE TO MORE CLOUD COVER...ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH 
ALTHOUGH THE THICKEST CLOUDS SHOULD STAY EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. 
HAZE AND FOG WILL ALSO AFFECT VISIBILITIES DUE TO LIGHT WINDS BUT 
NOT ENOUGH TO CAUSE SEVERE RESTRICTIONS.    

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...NOT MANY CHANGES TO 
STATUS QUO. FORECAST ISSUE THIS PERIOD IS CIRCULATION CENTER 
OFFSHORE CAROLINA WHICH IS HEADED SLOWLY THIS WAY. BELIEVE RIDGE 
WILL FLATTEN FROM THE BOTTOM AS THIS THING APPROACHES, BUT WILL 
REMAIN STRONG ENOUGH TO WARD OFF MOST OF ITS ENERGY TO THE WEST. 
THUS  HAVE INCREASED POPS IN EXTREME SOUTHEAST TN/EXTRM SW NC SUNDAY 
NIGHT INTO MONDAY, BUT REMAINED IN CHANCE CAT. KEPT POPS LARGELY 
UNCHANGED MID-LATE NEXT WEEK AND JUST ADJUSTED POPS IN BETWEEN THESE 
TWO PERIODS TO MAKE A MORE GRADUAL DECREASE TO STATUS QUO. WITH 
HIGHER RH, EXPECT TEMPS TO DROP TO MORE SEASONAL LEVELS, WHICH ARE 
STILL HOT, BUT NOT IN THE 90S, GENERALLY.

DISTURBANCE OFF THE SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC COAST THIS MORNING WITH THE 
FIRST WAVE OF HIGH AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS ALREADY OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. THE AIRMASS IS STILL FAIRLY STABLE THIS MORNING BUT INCREASING 
MOISTURE WILL INCREASE INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON AND MODELS TRY TO 
BRING A FEW SHOWERS OVER SOUTHERN SECTIONS AS A VORTICITY LOBE 
CROSSES THE MOUNTAINS FROM SC AND GA. THE ETA SHOWS THE BEST LIFT TO 
BE OVER MIDDLE TN AND THE GFS SOUTHERN MIDDLE TN AND SE TN AND SW 
NC. THE DEEPER MOISTURE ARRIVES TONIGHT WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
BETTER THEN. TEMPERATURES AND DEW POINTS ARE ABOUT THE SAME AS 
FRIDAYS FOR THIS TIME OF MORNING. CURRENT FORECAST GIVES HIGHS IN 
THE UPPER 80S TO NEAR 90 WHICH SEEMS REASONABLE. CURRENTLY THERE IS 
NO POPS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. WOULD LIKE TO ADD ISOLATED

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...A LITTLE MORE CLOUD COVER HAS 
FORMED TODAY OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU TODAY THAN THURSDAY. THIS
AREA IS MORE UNSTABLE AND DEWPOINTS WERE A LITTLE HIGHER OVER 
NORTHERN AL AND MIDDLE TN. DOPPLER RADAR IS INDICATING SHOWERS 
ACROSS NORTHERN AL AND A FEW OVER SOUTHERN MIDDLE TN. A FEW 
LIGHTNING STRIKES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACTIVITY OVER NORTHERN AL. 
THE ACTIVITY IS MOVING SLOWLY WEST. HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE AND 
ALOFT CONTINUES OVER THE SOUTHEAST AND MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES. AN 
UPPER LOW OVER SOUTHEAST FLORIDA IS SPREADING CLOUDINESS NORTH AND 
NORTHWEST INTO GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA WITH THUNDERSTORMS ALONG 
THE COASTAL AREAS. 

DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS EXPECT A FEW SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A 
THUNDERSTORM TO DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON BUT NOT ENOUGH TO INCLUDE IN THE FORECAST BEFORE THEY 
DISSIPATE BEFORE SUNSET. THE EASTERLY FLOW WILL BRING A LITTLE MORE 
MOISTURE OVER THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT AND SATURDAY BUT DOWNSLOPING 
OFF THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS SHOULD KEEP ANYTHING MORE THAN A FEW 
SHOWERS FROM FORMING. MODELS KEEP THE DEEPER MOISTURE SOUTH OF THE 
BORDER AND THEN MOVE IT WEST INTO AL. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND A 
THUNDERSTORM MAY DEVELOP ACROSS SW NC AND SE TN SATURDAY AFTERNOON 
BUT NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH COVERAGE FOR ISOLATED 
WORDING. LOWS TONIGHT SHOULD BE A DEGREE OR SO WARMER ACROSS 
NORTHERN SECTIONS WITH HIGHS SATURDAY EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT THE SAME 
AS TODAY UPPER 80S TO NEAR 90.        

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SAME-O, SAME-O AS 
PREVIOUS FORECASTS WITH A NOTABLE EXCEPTION. RIDGE CONTINUES TO 
DOMINATE THE AREA WITH HOT TEMPS AND MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS. LOW OFF 
THE FLORIDA COAST WANTS TO MEANDER THIS GENERAL DIRECTION BUT MODELS 
DIFFER ON JUST WHERE AND THAT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE. NATIONAL 
GUIDANCE SEEMS TO FAVOR THE GFS AND SURROUNDING OFFICES HAVE 
ACCOUNTED FOR THIS IN THEIR FORECASTS. HAVE NO PROBLEM RAISING POPS 
A HAIR ON THE WEEKEND FOR THIS POSSIBILITY. STILL DONT WANT TO GO 
TOO HIGH AND IMPLY THAT THIS MEASLY LOW WILL OBLITERATE THE STRONG 
RIDGE. THERE HAVE ONLY GONE LOW CHANCE IN MOUNTAINS AND A LITTLE 
INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY, WITH SLIGHT CHANCE ELSEWHERE. AFTER LOW 
MAKES ITS (POSSIBLE) ENTRANCE, IT MOVES ON AND ALLOWS RIDGE TO 
RE-BUILD, BUT A SERIES OF SHORT WAVES EJECTING FROM SOUTHWEST LOW 
WILL TEND TO FLATTEN THE RIDGE, ALLOWING FOR RETURN OF SOME MOISTURE 
LATER IN THE PERIOD. IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE THE DOG DAYS OF SUMMER 
ALREADY. MORE HOT AND HUMID WITH TYPICALLY SUMMER-LIKE LOW POPS.

TODAY.  SO CUMULUS BUILDUPS OVER THE MOUNTAINS TODAY SHOULD DRIFT TO 
THE WEST TODAY...RESULTING IN MORE CLOUD OVER FOR LOWER ELEVATIONS 
TODAY.  

HAVE INSERTED SLGT CHC -SHRA INTO HIGHEST TERRAIN OF THE SMOKIES FOR 
TODAY.  WEAK DOWNSLOPING EASTERLY/SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW FROM MOUNTAINS 
SHOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR -SHRA TO BE SUSTAINED...RIGHT NOW VERY 
LOW POPS IN VALLEY GRIDS.  ALL CUMULUS COVER SHOULD DISSIPATE AGAIN 
NEAR SUNSET.

DOWNSLOPING WIND SHOULD ALSO HELP TO RAISE HI TEMPS BY ABT 2 DEG F 
TODAY OVER VALUES YESTERDAY. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...AS HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR 
THE PAST SEVERAL SUMMERS ACROSS THE SRN APPALACHIANS WE CANT SEEM 
TO HOLD ONTO A GOOD OLD FASHIONED UPPER LEVEL RIDGE FOR VERY LONG 
WITHOUT A WEAKNESS OR EASTERLY WAVE DEVELOPING AND ENDING OUR RUN OF 
ABOVE NORMAL WARMTH AND SUPPRESSED CONVECTIVION. IT APPEARS THAT THE 
MODELS (NAM/GFS) WANT TO BRING AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CURRENTLY 
VCNTY OF THE BAHAMAS INTO THE SERN U.S. NAM WAS DISCARDED BECAUSE OF 
ITS FARTHER WEST TRACK OF THE LOW INTO THE DEEP SOUTH WHILE THE GFS 
MOVEMENT OF THE LOW INTO THE CAROLINAS LATER SAT NIGHT INTO SUN 
WAS PREFERRED. SYSTEM TRACKS NWD TO THE EAST OF THE FA SO MTNS ALONG 
THE NC BORDER WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE THE BEST CHANCE FOR CONVECTION 
WITH DOWNSLOPING ELY FLO INHIBITING PRECIP TO AN EXTENT IN THE GREAT 
VALLEY IN THIS SCENARIO. INTRODUCED SLGT CHC POPS ACROSS THE S AND 
MTNS SAT NIGHT AND THEN USED SLGT CHC SHRA/TSRA FOR SUN THRU THU AS 
LOW LVL MOISTURE INCREASES AROUND BACK SIDE OF SFC-85H HI PRES WHICH 
RE-ESTABLISHES ITSELF OVR THE WRN ATLANTIC. STAYED A LITTLE BELOW 
GUIDANCE MAX/MIN TEMPS EARLY IN THE PERIOD AND THEN HELD CLOSE TO 
MAX TEMPS LATE IN THE LONG TERM BUT ADJUSTED MINS DOWN SLIGHTLY 
BECAUSE THEY APPEARED TO BE UNREALISTICALLY MILD FOR THE MRX

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...CURRENT SATELLITE PICTURES 
SHOWS A LACK OF CLOUD COVER OVER MUCH OF THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST 
STATES. SOME SCATTERED CUMULUS OVER THE MOUNTAINS WITH JUST A FEW 
OVER THE VALLEY IS SEEN. ONLY A FEW SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED ALONG THE 
SOUTHERN BORDER AND THESE HAVE BEEN VERY BRIEF. CENTRAL US UPPER 
LEVEL RIDGE HAS EXPANDED EAST TODAY AND DRIER AIR HAS MOVED SOUTH 
FROM A WEAK FRONT THAT MOVED THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. 
GFS/NAM INDICATING THE RIDGE WILL STAY IN PLACE TONIGHT AND FRIDAY 
WITH LITTLE MOISTURE AVAILABLE. LIGHT WINDS WILL CONTINUE. LOW 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE A LOWER ONE MORE NIGHT BEFORE MOISTURE 
INCREASES AND HIGHS FRIDAY ABOUT THE SAME AS TODAY IN THE UPPER 80S 
TO LOWER 90S. WITH DRIER AIR IN PLACE THINK THERE WILL BE A LITTLE 
LESS FOG TONIGHT AND FRIDAY MORNING SO HAVE KEPT IT OUT OF THE 
FORECAST.         

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MORE OF THE SAME. 
RIDGE BUILDS OVER EASTERN US FROM SURFACE OF THE EARTH TO THE MOON. 
GENERALLY DRY FORECAST EACH DAY, BUT WITH INTENSE SOLAR RADIATION 
MUST KEEP A LOW (20%) POP IN EACH PERIOD. LATE IN THE TIME FRAME, 
SAY, NEXT WEDNESDAY-THURSDAY, BERMUDA HIGH BUILDS ENOUGH TO PROVIDE 
SIGNIFICANT DEWPOINTS, AGAIN, AND A SERIES OF SHORT WAVES TEND TO 
FLATTEN THE RIDGE, SO HAVE UPPED POPS A LITTLE THEN. BASICALLY, A

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT STILL LINGERING 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH ONLY A FEW 
CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. DRY CONDITIONS AND ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS ARE 
EXPECTED THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE OVER THE PLAINS STATES BUILDS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 
LATEST GFS AND NAM MODELS DEVELOP A TROPICAL SYSTEM AROUND SOUTHERN 
FLORIDA ON FRIDAY...BUT REVEAL BIG DISCREPANCIES WITH THE TRACK OF 
THIS SYSTEM FOR THE WEEKEND. THE NAM MODEL SUGGESTS THAT MOISTURE 
FROM THIS SYSTEM WILL AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY...BUT THE 
GFS MODEL REVEALS A MORE EASTERLY TRACK ALONG THE CAROLINA COAST 
WHICH WOULD KEEP THE FORECAST AREA DRY ON SUNDAY. WITH ALL OF THIS 
UNCERTAINTY...WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE THE PREVIOUS FORECAST OF ONLY A 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR CONVECTION ON SUNDAY. 

ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT SHOULD STALL OUT OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
BY SUNDAY...AND HAVE A LIMITED AFFECT ON THE FORECAST AREA. A 
BERMUDA HIGH IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC BY EARLY
NEXT WEEK...WHICH SHOULD DOMINATE THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE WEEK.
THIS SCENARIO SHOULD RESULT IN A TYPICAL SUMMERTIME PATTERN OF 
ISOLATED DIURNAL CONVECTION EACH DAY. TEMPS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF 
NEXT WEEK LOOK TO REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL WITH NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE 
EXPECTED.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
315 PM EDT FRI JUN 17 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...GENERALLY A FAIR WX 
PERIOD DESPITE THE FACT THAT MODELS INDICATE AN UPR TROF DROPS S 
ACROSS THE FA TONIGHT INTO SATURDAY AND EVEN DEVELOPS A CLOSED LOW 
OVR THE SRN APPALACHIANS SAT NIGHT. EXPECT MOST PRECIP IN THE FORM 
OF -SHRA/SHRA TO DEVELOP ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MTNS IN THE 
CAROLINAS AND MAINTAINED SLGT CHC POPS FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW 
VA AND NRN/CNTRL MTN GROUPS OF TN FOR SAT AFTERNOON. UPR LOW DROPS 
SE INTO SC ON SUN. MODELS BROADBRUSH QPF WELL W INTO THE FA ON SUN 
BUT DONT BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE TOO MUCH SHRA/TSRA DEVELOPMENT 
EXCEPT IN TERRAIN ALONG NC BORDER WITH LOW LVL EASTERLY FLO. WILL 
MAINTAIN SLGT CHC POPS IN NRN MTN GROUP SUN AFTERNOON INTO SUN NIGHT 
FOR POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT. STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMP BLEND FOR 
THE SHORT TERM WHICH CONTINUES BELOW NORMAL TEMPS IN NLY FLO REGIME.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...GLOBAL MODELS CONTINUE TO 
REMAIN IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE EARLY PORTION OF THE LONG TERM 
FORECAST PERIOD. SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 00Z AND 12Z GFS EXIST 
IN THE STRENGTH AND AMOUNT OF PRECIP ON MONDAY. THE 12Z GFS IS 
INDICATING THAT THE MCS NOW MOVING INTO THE LOWER SOUTHEAST WILL 
CONTINUE TO MOVE ALONG THE GULF COAST AND GENERATE A LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM ALONG THE ATLANTIC COASTLINE IN GEORGIA. THIS COMBINED WITH 
THE CLOSED UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE CAROLINAS ON MONDAY INTENSIFIES 
THE PRECIPITATION FIELD IN THE GFS QUITE A BIT FROM THE 00Z RUN. 
FEEL THAT THIS IS OVERDONE IN THE 12Z GFS. NEVERTHELESS...WE WILL 
STILL HAVE DOWNSLOPING FLOW INTO OUR REGION ON MONDAY AND THUS WE 
WILL HAVE LESS PRECIP CHANGES THAN ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN. 
WILL GO AHEAD AND PLACE A TIGHT PRECIP GRADIENT IN THE GRIDS ON 
MONDAY WITH 40 POPS IN NE TN MOUNTAINS...30 POPS IN THE SMOKYS AND 
20 POPS IN THE ADJACENT VALLEY LOCATIONS BUT WILL KEEP THE TYS AND 
CHA AREAS DRY AS EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT DOWNSLOPING FLOW INTO THE 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY JUST ABOUT KILLS OFF ALL PRECIP. WILL 
KEEP TEMPS A FEW DEGREES BELOW MOS NORTH AND IN THE MOUNTAINS DUE TO 
EXPECTED CLOUD COVER BUT WILL STAY JUST SLIGHTLY BELOW MOS IN 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS.

FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...AS A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVER 
THE AREA FROM THE WEST...EXPECT MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES 
OVER THE REGION WITH A SLOW WARM UP OF TEMPERATURES BUT NOT AS QUICK 
AS THE MEX GUIDANCE INDICATES. A FRONTAL SYSTEM THAT WAS INDICATED 
YESTERDAY IN THE GFS...LOOKS TO NOW MISS OUR FORECAST AREA TO THE 
NORTH. THIS HAS BEEN NOTICED IN THE 00Z AND 12Z FORECAST CYCLES AND 
SO I REMOVED POPS ON WEDNESDAY. 

THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WILL BE TRANSITIONAL DAYS AS THE RIDGE AXIS 
SHIFTS EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA AND A SOUTHERLY FLOW RETURNS 
BRINGING MORE MOISTURE. 12Z GFS SHOWS A SURGE OF SOUTHERLY MOISTURE 
FROM THE GULF ON FRIDAY THAT NECESSITATES INCREASING POPS OVER THE 
SOUTHERN SECTIONS AND THEN INTO THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA 
BY AFTERNOON. OVERNIGHT FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY I HAVE DECIDED TO RAISE 
POPS TO 40 PERCENT SOUTH...30 CENTRAL...AND 20 SOUTH AS THE MOISTURE 
AND QPF IN THE MODELS LOOKS FAIRLY DEEP. LATER SHIFTS MAY NEED TO 
RAISE THESE POPS AS LATER RUNS CONFIRM WHAT WAS SEEN IN THE MODELS 
TODAY.

HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY 
BUILDING INTO THE TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEY. A STRONG LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM OVER NEW ENGLAND WILL HELP TO KEEP A COOL AND DRY NORTHWEST 
FLOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. AS A RESULT...EXPECT MOSTLY CLEAR 
SKIES WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPS THROUGH TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (SAT THROUGH THU)...GENERALLY DRY WEATHER WITH SOMEWHAT 
BELOW CLIMO TEMPS IN THE OFFING THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK AS HIGHLY 
AMPLIFIED TROUGH PERSISTS OVER THE EASTERN CONUS. GFS HINTS AT 
SCATTERED LIGHT PRECIP DEVELOPING OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA SAT NIGHT AND SUNDAY. HOWEVER...NAM AND SHORT-RANGE 
ENSEMBLES KEEP THIS PRECIP MAINLY EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS. THE 
CANADIAN GEM DOES NOT SUPPORT THE IDEA OF ANY PRECIP AT ALL. THUS 
HAVE MAINTAINED CONTINUITY AND CONTINUED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN FOR SATURDAY PM. GFS SUGGESTS SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION WILL REMAIN IN NORTHWESTERLY FLOW THROUGH MOST OF THE 
UPCOMING WEEK. HOWEVER...TEMPS ARE EXPECTED TO MODERATE TO NEAR 
CLIMO BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.

302 PM EDT THU JUN 16 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CONTINUED WEAK 
NORTHERLY FLOW WILL BRING COOLER AIR TO THE REGION.  HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER WITH A WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVING BACK INTO 
THE AREA FRIDAY AFTERNOON.  WITH THE SHORTWAVE...CLOUDINESS WILL 
INCREASE...PARTICULARLY OVER THE NORTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST 
AREA.  THIS SHORT WAVE WILL FURTHER INPACT THE AREA ON SATURDAY 
BRINGING A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS IN THE NORTH AND FAVORED 
UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE APPALACHIANS.

DID NOT STRAY FAR FROM GUIDANCE VALUES AS NO CLEAR TREND.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...SAME FORECAST ISSUE AS 
YESTERDAY WITH WHETHER OR NOT TO BELIEVE THE CUTOFF UPPER LEVEL LOW. 
MODELS TODAY DID HAVE A LITTLE BETTER AGREEMENT AT 06Z AND 12Z WITH 
THE UKMET...GFS...NAM AND ECMWF BOTH INDICATING A DEEP TROF ACROSS 
THE MID ATLANTIC AND SOUTHEAST EXTENDING FROM CENTRAL GEORGIA 
NORTHEASTWARD INTO VIRGINIA. THE GFS AND THE NAM TRY TO CLOSE OFF AN 
UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE DELMARVA PENINSULA BY MONDAY MORNING. THE 
MODELS HAVE BACKED OFF OF RETROGRADING THE UPPER LOW ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEAST INTO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. HOWEVER...THEY STILL 
KEEP THE LOW NEARLY STATIONARY OR WITH A SLIGHT SOUTHWARD DRIFT 
UNTIL MUCH LATER IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE RIDGE FINALLY STARTS TO 
SHIFT TO THE EAST AND KICK IT OUT BY THURSDAY. MODELS ARE IN FARELY 
GOOD AGREEMENT RUN TO RUN WITH THE LOCATIONS OF THE MOISTURE FIELDS. 
THE 00Z GFS WAS MUCH DRIER THAN THE 06 AND 12Z VERSION. AS SUCH THE 
MEX POPS WERE RATHER LOW. AFTER LOOKING AT THE 06 AND 12Z GFS 
RUN...FEEL IT IS PROBABLY BETTER TO FOLLOW RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY 
AND TWEAK POPS SLIGHTLY IN THE EXTENDED SECTIONS TO MATCH UP WITH 
THE 06 AND 12Z GFS. 

SUNDAY...MADE SOME CHANGES TO THE GRIDS FROM YESTERDAY SO THAT THE 
AREA WILL BE PRECIP FREE UNTIL SUNDAY NIGHT WHEN THE FIRST VORT MAX 
MOVES OVER THE NORTHEASTERN CWA. HAVE ONLY PLACED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
IN FOR THE NE TN MOUNTAIN GROUPS BECAUSE MOISTURE WILL BE EXTREMELY 
LIMITED ON OUR SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS. MODEL X-SECTIONS EXTENDING 
FROM CHA TO RNK SHOW THAT THE BULK OF THE MOISTURE SUNDAY NIGHT WILL 
BE CONFINED BELOW 700 MB. ANY SHOWERS THAT DEVELOP WILL LIKELY BE 
SHORT LIVED...AND OF COURSE DO NOT EXPECT ANY THUNDER WITH THIS 
SYSTEM AS ATMOSPHERE WILL BE STABLE. TEMPERATURES FOR SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON WILL BE BELOW CLIMO ALL AREAS...BUT NOTICEABLLY COOLER 
ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA WHERE TEMPS WILL BE IN THE UPPER 60S TO MID 
70S. SUNDAY NIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL ALSO BE FARELY COOL AND HAVE 
GONE AT SLIGHTLY ABOVE GUIDANCE NORTH DUE TO CLOUD COVER AND BELOW 
GUIDANCE SOUTH DUE TO EXPECTED MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES.

MONDAY...TIGHT GRADIENT OF MOISTURE CONTINUES AS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW 
(POSSIBLY A CUT OFF LOW) MEANDERS ACROSS EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA. 
HAVE ONLY PLACED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE 
FORECAST AREA AS MOISTURE LEVELS ARE HIGHEST RIGHT ALONG THE 
MOUNTAIN ZONES. TEMPERATURES WILL START TO WARM JUST SLIGHTLY BUT 
CLOUD COVER NE MAY HAMPER THIS WARM UP...SO HAVE STAYED SLIGHTLY 
BELOW GUIDANCE THERE. 

TUESDAY...HAVE DECIDED TO CHANGE TUESDAY TO A DRY DAY BASED ON THE 
UPPER LOW MOVING AWAY AND WHAT LITTLE MOISTURE THERE WAS...EXITING 
THE REGION. SHOULD SEE A MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY DAY AS SKY 
COVER DEPARTS THE REGION AS THE UPPER LOW PULLS AWAY. WITH THE UPPER 
LOW MOVING OFF...HEIGHTS RISE AND TEMPERATURES BEGIN TO WARM BACK TO 
NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES. WENT JUST SLIGHTLY BELOW GUIDANCE HERE.

WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...EXTENDED MODELS RUNS INDICATE A SHORT WAVE 
TROF WITH A POSSIBLE COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE REGION. BEST 
MOISTURE AND LIFT IS AROUND 12Z ON WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...IN THE 
EXTENDED PERIODS THE GFS CAN BE OFF ON A FROPA BY 24 HOURS. 
ADDITIONALLY...THIS FRONT DOES NOT HAVE MUCH ENERGY WITH IT AND MAY 
STALL OUT ACROSS OR JUST SOUTH OF MY FORECAST AREA. WILL RUN WITH 
CHANCE OF -TSRA ALL DAY ACROSS THE CWA ON WEDNESDAY BUT WILL KEEP 
THURSDAY DRY AT THIS POINT DUE TO ALL THE UNCERTAINTY. TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
UPPER TROUGH DIGGING INTO THE NORTHEAST SECTION OF THE NATION AND
SURFACE RIDGE BUILDING INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL BE THE MAIN
PLAYERS TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT.  AIRMASS WILL BE QUITE DRY WITH
PWS GENERALLY BETWEEN 0.75 AND 1 INCH.  ALSO...FORECAST SOUNDINGS
SHOW A FAIRLY DECENT MID-LEVEL SUBSIDENCE INVERSION WHICH WILL HELP
SUPPRESS CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT.

NAM DOES SHOW A MCS MOVING SOUTHEAST FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE
LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY LATE FRIDAY AND FRIDAY WHICH MAY GIVE
ADDITIONAL CLOUDS TO SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. HOWEVER...THE GFS DOES NOT
SHOW THIS FEATURE BUT DOES PULL MORE CLOUDS SOUTH FROM UPPER LOW INTO
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. WILL CALL FOR PARTLY 
CLOUDY SKY FOR FRIDAY AREA-WIDE.

DRIER DEWPOINTS WILL ALLOW FOR GREATER DIURNAL RANGE IN TEMPERATURES
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WITH WARM AFTERNOONS AND MILD MORNINGS.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)

...MODEL DISCUSSION...
THE 00Z GFS AND OTHER GLOBAL MODELS (ECMWF AND UKMET) WERE ALL IN 
DECENT AGREEMENT THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...OR AS FAR OUT AS THE 
MODELS WOULD GO. THE 00Z GFS WAS SHOWING THE UPPER LEVEL TROF 
PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE NORTHERN THIRD OF MY FORECAST AREA ON 
SATURDAY BECOMING CLOSED OFF AND CUT OFF FROM THE MAIN FLOW AND 
ACTUALLY RETROGRADING SOUTHWESTWARD INTO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. I WAS REALLY LEANING TOWARD DISCOUNTING 
THIS GFS SOLUTION...BUT THE OTHER GLOBAL MODELS ALL FOLLOWED SUIT. 
MOREOVER...HPC FAVORS THE GFS SOLUTION AND THEREFORE I AM GIVING THE 
GFS ADDED WEIGHT. THE 06Z GFS CONTINUED WITH ITS PREDECESSOR OF A 
CUTOFF LOW MOVING INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY. HOWEVER...THE 12Z GFS 
JUST IN HAS DECIDED TO KEEP THE CUT OFF LOW FROM RETROGRADING AND 
KEEPS IT NEARLY STATIONARY THROUGH MONDAY OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST. 
THIS ONLY WILL CHANGE THE FORECAST SLIGHTLY BUT THIS JUST SHOWS THE 
DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECAST. IF THE UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVES 
OVER OUR REGION...A MOSTLY CLOUDY AND COOLER PERIOD WILL BE 
EXPERIENCED WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR -TSRA AND -SHRA. IF IT STAYS TO 
THE NORTH...SLIGHTLY WARMER AND FAIRER WEATHER WILL BE IN STORE FOR 
OUR FORECAST AREA. 

GFS MODEL ENSEMBLE MEMBERS DO SHOW A SLIGHT INCREASE IN PRECIP 
CHANCES STARTING AT THE FIRST OF THE WEEK. NO LARGE RANGES ARE 
NOTICED IN THE ENSEMBLE PLOTS AND THIS HELPS TO ADD CONFIDENCE TO A 
SITUATION WHERE THE MODELS SEEM TO BE SLIGHTLY FLIP FLOPPING RUN TO 
RUN. NEVERTHELESS...HERES THE FORECAST.

SATURDAY...THE PERIOD STARTS OFF WITH THE UPPER LOW THAT IS OVER THE 
GREAT LAKES TODAY MOVING INTO THE NORTHEAST AND DRAGGING A MID LEVEL 
TROF ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. AN AREA OF HIGHER MOISTURE IS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE AND PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA ON SATURDAY. HOWEVER...WITH BARELY ANY MOISTURE RETURN FROM THE 
GULF...IT APPEARS AS LITTLE IF ANY PRECIPITATION CAN BE GENERATED. 
HAVE DECIDED TO PLACE IN ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE FAVORED 
UPSLOPE AREAS FROM THE SMOKIES NORTHWARD INTO NE TN MOUNTAINS AND SW 
VA. HAVE LEFT THE VALLEYS DRY FOR SATURDAY. OMEGA X-SECTIONS REVEAL 
VERY LIMITED LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE FEATURE AND 
THEREFORE...TOPOGRAPHY WILL BE THE ONLY AVAILABLE SOURCE OF LIFT. 
WILL SHUT OFF PRECIPITATION AT 00Z SUNDAY AS THE TROF AXIS SHIFTS 
EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

WITH UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE PATH OF THE UPPER LEVEL LOW...HAVE 
INCREASED SKY COVER ON SUNDAY OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AS IT 
APPEARS THERE WILL BE SOME POOLING OF LOW AND MID LEVEL MOISTURE 
AGAINST THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS. I HAVE MADE SOME TIGHT 
GRADIENTS IN SKY COVER TO ACCOUNT FOR MORE CLOUDINESS NEAR THE RIDGE 
LINE. WITH THIS MOISTURE PRESENT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO HAVE SOME 
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP IN THE AFTERNOON AND HAVE PLACED 30 POPS IN 
THE MOUNTAINS WITH 20 POPS CENTRAL AND SOUTH. 

MUCH OF THE SAME TYPE OF FORECAST CONTINUES MONDAY INTO TUESDAY AS 
ENOUGH UNCERTAINTY EXISTS IN THE PATH OF THE UPPER LEVEL LOW TO 
INCLUDE A CHANCE OF -TSRA EVERYWHERE. I FEEL THERE IS A BETTER 
CHANCE ACROSS SOUTHERN SECTIONS AND HAVE THEREFORE PLACED 30 POPS 
THERE FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS WHILE THERE ARE 20S ELSEWHERE. 

TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY FEATURE THE RETURN OF A LITTLE MORE MOIST 
ATMOSPHERE AND WILL THEREFORE CONTINUE THE SAME PRECIPITATION 
BREAKUP AS ON MONDAY WITH 30 POPS SOUTH AND 20 POPS NORTH.

TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE PERIOD WILL BE SLIGHTLY BELOW CLIMATOLOGY 
UNTIL WEDNESDAY. SOME OF THE COLDEST TEMPERATURES EXPERIENCED IN A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS WILL BE FELT ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN WHERE MINS 
SATURDAY MORNING WILL DIP INTO THE LOW 50S WITH ONLY HIGHS RETURNING 
TO THE MID TO UPPER 70S. I HAVE FORECASTED A SLIGHT WARMING TREND 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED STARTING ON SUNDAY WITH MAX AND MIN TEMPS 
GENERALLY BOTH INCREASING A DEGREE OR TWO EACH DAY. THIS IS CLOSE IN 
LINE WITH THE MEX GUIDANCE AS GOOD AGREEMENT EXISTS BETWEEN ENSEMBLE 
MEMBERS.

THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED FORMING INTO BROKEN LINE SEGMENTS. IN 
OUR FORECAST AREA...LITTLE IN THE WAY OF DEVELOPMENT THUS FAR...BUT 
DEWPOINTS REMAIN IN THE UPPER 60S AND LOW 70S WITH A SURGE OF 
MOISTURE INDICATED OVER NORTHERN ALABAMA. LIFTED INDICES ON MSAS ARE 
CURRENTLY -7C ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND LIS ARE DECREASING 
ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF MY CWA. LAPS INDICATES SBCAPES APPROACHING 
2500 J/KG ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF EAST TENNESSEE. NEEDLESS TO 
SAY THE ATMOSPHERE IS REALLY DESTABILIZING TODAY.

FOR THE IMMEDIATE SHORT TERM...ALL FOCUS WILL BE ON THE DEVELOPING 
CONVECTION OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE. WE HAVE ALREADY ISSUED A SPS 
STATEMENT CONCERNING THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE WEATHER. AS DISCUSSED 
IN THIS MORNINGS AFD...THE MAIN THREATS WILL BE STRONG DAMAGING 
DOWNBURST WINDS DUE TO ALL THE DRY AIR ALOFT. THIS THREAT WILL BE 
INCREASE IF ANY OF THESE DEVELOPING THUNDERSTORMS CAN MERGE INTO 
BROKEN LINE SEGMENTS OR EVEN BOWING SEGMENTS. HAIL DOES NOT APPEAR 
TO BE AS BIG OF A THREAT...HOWEVER SOME OF THE STRONGEST 
THUNDERSTORMS COULD PRODUCE HAIL UP TO THE SIZE OF HALF 
DOLLARS...BUT THIS WILL BE HIGHLY ISOLATED. 

MODEL QPF IS EXTREMELY DRY IN THE NAM. ONLY THE GFS WAS ABLE TO PICK 
UP ON THE CONVECTION IN MIDDLE TENNESSEE. DESPITE THIS FACT...THE 
GFS POPS OVERNIGHT ARE JUST TO LOW TO GO WITH IN THIS FORECAST. 
(I.E. 10 PERCENT AT TYS) WILL THEREFORE BE GOING WITH PREVIOUS 
FORECAST OF AROUND 40 PERCENT...BUT MAY RAISE THIS PRIOR TO ZFP 
ISSUANCE. CURRENT THINKING IS THAT PRECIPITATION WILL ARRIVE IN THE 
EARLY EVENING HOURS AND CONTINUE THROUGH UNTIL AROUND MIDNIGHT 
BEFORE DIMINISHING. SOME CONCERN THERE WILL BE SOME LINGERING POPS 
TOWARD MORNING IN THE NORTH AND MOUNTAIN ZONES AND HAVE COVERED THIS 
POSSIBILITY WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AFTER 06Z. WILL INCLUDE THROUGH 
02Z THE MENTION OF DAMAGING WINDS IN THE ZONES. 

850 RH PLOT SHOWS THAT AFTER ABOUT 09Z MOST OF THE AREA WILL DRY OUT 
CONSIDERABLY AS THE FRONTAL SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH. AN UPPER LEVEL 
LOW...NOW OVER CENTRAL MINNESOTA WILL BEGIN TO MOVE ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL GREAT LAKES AND INTO THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY. THIS UPPER LEVEL 
LOW WILL SEND SEVERAL SPOKES OF ENERGY ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH THE 
SHORT TERM PERIOD. HOWEVER...MOISTURE WILL BE EXTREMELY 
LIMITED...PLUS THE IMPULSES WILL BE COMING DURING THE OVERNIGHT 
HOURS...SO THERE WILL BE NO AIDE FROM DIURNAL HEATING. HAVE ONLY 
INCLUDED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS WED AND THURS NIGHT FOR THE FAVORED 
UPSLOPE AREAS NORTH OF THE SMOKIES. 

FOR TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE PERIOD...A GRADUAL DECREASE EACH DAY IS 
INDICATED IN THE MAV GUIDANCE AND AS SUCH FELT IT BEST TO FOLLOW THE 
MAV GUIDANCE CLOSELY DUE TO PRIOR PERFORMANCE. 

WILL HOLD OFF ON ZFP UNTIL AROUND 330 TO 345 PM TODAY TO CAPTURE 
LAST MINUTE CHANGES. ALL OTHER PRODUCTS EXPECTED OUT AROUND THAT 
TIME TOO. 

THANKS TO GSP FOR THE COORDINATION ON THE SEVERE WEATHER SITUATION.

.LONG TERM...(FRI THROUGH TUE)...06Z GFS CONTINUES TO SHOW SPURIOUS 
UPPER LOW FORMING OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND SUBSEQUENTLY 
RETROGRADING TO THE MID-MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY REGION. THIS 
SCENARIO IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE 06Z DGEX OR MOST OF THE GFS 
ENSEMBLES MEMBERS. THUS WILL TEND TO DISREGARD THE 06Z GFS AT THIS 
TIME AND FAVOR DGEX SOLUTION. THIS WOULD LEAD TO A GENERALLY DRY 
FORECAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND WITH ONLY ISOLATED DIURNAL CONVECTION 
INTO THE EARLY PART OF THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK. TEMPS SHOULD SLOWLY 
MODERATE FROM BELOW CLIMATOLOGY OVER THE WEEKEND TO NEAR CLIMATOLOGY 
BY LATE IN THE PERIOD AS HEIGHTS RISE INEXORABLY.

.DISCUSSION...FOG WAS DENSE THIS MORNING AT TRI AND OQT. 
ALSO...VISBY SATELLITE SHOWED FOG IN THE USUAL LOCATIONS IN THE 
SEQUATCHIE VALLEY AND ALONG I-75 SOUTH OF LOUDON COUNTY. WITH THIS 
FOG NOW STARTING TO LIFT JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE IN THE CWA...HEATING 
IS BEGINNING VERY QUICKLY. AT 10 AM...CHA WAS ALREADY 80/71 WITH TYS 
AT 78/72. 12Z SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWED A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
BEGINNING TO MOVE JUST TO THE EAST OF OUR AREA AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT 
EXTENDING FROM SE MINN TO CENTRAL ARK. THIS FRONT WILL MOVE EAST 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY HELPING TO PROVIDE SOME LIFT FOR DEVELOPMENT OF 
THUNDERSTORMS. INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE ISODROSOTHERM ANALYSIS 
FROM THIS MORNING REVEALS A MOIST TONGUE OF HIGHER DEWPOINTS ACROSS 
WEST TN AND WEST KY. THIS MOIST SURGE IS A COUPLE HUNDRED MILES 
AHEAD OF THE FRONT. WE SHOULD SEE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS LATER 
THIS AFTERNOON AS THE MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW BECOMES STRONGER AS THE 
PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS OVER OUR CWA. 

BIG STORY FOR TODAY WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE WEATHER. SPC 
HAS HIGHLIGHTED MY ENTIRE FORECAST AREA IN A SLIGHT RISK. ANALYSIS 
OF UPPER AIR CHARTS SHOWS UPPER RIDGING STARTING TO MOVE EAST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA AS WELL. CONCERN TODAY IS OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SEVERE WEATHER. BIGGEST THREAT IS DAMAGING WINDS...MAINLY FROM 
DOWNBURSTS. THIS IS DUE TO THE DRY AIR ALOFT AND RELATIVELY DRY AIR 
AT THE SURFACE. THETA-E DIFFERENCE OF 32K IS PRESENT BETWEEN THE 
SURFACE AND 500 MB WHICH ALSO IS A STRONG INDICATOR OF POTENTIAL FOR 
DOWNBURST WINDS. WILL THEREFORE BE ADDING STRONG GUSTY WIND WORDING 
TO ZONES AND WILL HOLD OFF ON DAMAGING WORDING UNTIL LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON IF A WATCH IS ISSUED OR THE THREAT BECOMES MORE 
WIDESPREAD. 

AS FAR AS HAIL POTENTIAL...WET BULB ZEROS ARE LOWER THE FURTHER WEST 
YOU GO ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. CONSIDERING A 500MB TEMP OF -6C...A 
DECENT UPDRAFT WOULD BE NEEDED TO PRODUCE VERY LARGE HAIL. STILL 
THINKING THAT NICKEL TO QUARTER SIZE HAIL WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE 
STRONGEST STORMS. VIL OF THE DAY CALCULATIONS ARE AROUND 55 KG/M2. 

STORMS SHOULD DEVELOP FIRST ACROSS THE PLATEAU LOCATIONS AND HAVE A 
MOVEMENT TO THE NORTHEAST AROUND 20 TO 30 MPH. DUE TO THIS FAST 
MOVEMENT...WIDESPREAD FLOODING WILL NOT BE A THREAT. I ONLY EXPECT 
TYPICAL URBANIZED SMALL SCALE FLOODING LIKE YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A 
HEAVY THUNDERSTORM.

WILL UPDATE ZONES ADDITIONALLY TO REMOVE MORNING FOG WORDING AND 
TWEAK TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY OVER THE MOUNTAIN ZONES AS IT DOESNT 
APPEAR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS HAVE MUCH SHOT AT THE UPPER 80S TODAY. 
STILL GOING TO BE VERY WARM TODAY ACROSS THE VALLEY LOCATIONS. TRI 
WILL HAVE A SHOT AT TYING THE RECORD HIGH OF 92 DEGREES.  

ZONES OUT SOON...HAVE A GREAT DAY

IN THE SHORT TERM AND COMING CLOSER TOGETHER IN THE LONG TERM.
WARM/HOT DAY EXPECTED WITH WAA AND LIMITED CLOUDS EARLY.
FCST MAXS TEMPS CLOSEST TO NAM. RECORD OF 92 IN 1943 FOR TRI WILL
BE APPROACHED. OTHER RECORDS ARE IN THE MID/UPR 90S. HEAT INDICES
WILL GET AS HIGH AS THE UPPER 90S SOUTHERN AREAS. MOS POP #S AND
QPF VERY LOW TODAY. SPC HAS PUT TN VLY IN SLGT RISK TDY. AIRMASS
DESTABILIZES VERY WELL THIS AFTERNOON. MOISTURE CONVERGENCE IN 
ADVANCE OF THE AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE. CAPES
AND LIS GET INTO THE MODERATE RANGE. POSSIBLE MCS DEVELOPMENT TO 
THE WEST AND OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES MOVING IN THIS AFTN ALLOW FOR MORE 
THAN POPCORN TYPE COVERAGE SO WENT ABOVE GUIDANCE FOR TDY AND THIS 
EVENING. NORTHERN PLATEAU LOOKS TO BE AREA WITH BEST CHANCE AND MAIN 
THREAT SHOULD BE DOWNBURSTS. JET SEGMENT AT BOTTOM OF NORTHERN SHORT 
WAVE PUNCHES THROUGH AROUND MIDNIGHT BRINGING MID LEVEL DRYING AND 
SOME COOLING AT THE LOWER LEVELS. MOST CONVECTION ENDING AROUND THAT 
TIME. LOWERED TONIGHT MINS SOME TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS COOLING. AN 
1000-850 MB TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH DURING THE DAY ON WED WHICH DRIES 
OUT THE LOWER LEVELS. DESPITE NW FLOW THIS DRYING SHOULD ALLOW AFTN 
TEMPS TO JUMP UP WITH EXTENDED MINUTES OF SUNSHINE. SOME MOISTURE 
ADVECTS INTO N PART OF CWA ON THU ALLOWING FOR ISOLD ...MAINLY 
OROGRAPHIC SHWR POTENTIAL THU AFTN/EVE. E U.S. TROUGH DEEPENS AND

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
300 PM EDT MON JUN 13 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...STRATO-CUMULUS DECK 
NOW BEGINNING TO BREAK UP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ALLOWING 
TEMPERATURES TO WARM INTO THE UPPER 80S SOUTH TO UPPER 70S NORTH. 
EXPECT A FEW MORE DEGREES OF WARMING...SO TEMPERATURES COULD 
APPROACH THE 90 DEGREE MARK IN CHATTANOOGA. THIS IS JUST A PREVIEW 
OF WHAT IS TO COME TOMORROW.

BUT FIRST...TONIGHT WILL BE ANOTHER HUMID NIGHT ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. TEMPS ONLY COOL DOWN SLIGHTLY NORTH THANKS TO DRIER AIR 
FILTERING IN. WITH THE ATMOSPHERE SO WARM AND JUICY...DONT EXPECT 
WIDESPREAD FOG FORMATION AS USUALLY A WARM ATMOSPHERE HERE WILL NOT 
HAVE WIDESPREAD FOG NO MATTER HOW MUCH MOISTURE YOU PUT INTO IT. 
HAVE ADDED PATCHY FOG TO THE ZONES AS THE USUAL SPOTS...LIKE 
TRI...WILL PROBABLY GET SOME FOG AS IT RAINED THERE THIS MORNING. 
HAVE FOLLOWED CLOSELY TO THE MET GUIDANCE AS MAV APPEARS TO BE JUST 
A LITTLE TOO COOL. 

TUESDAY...AFTER THE FOG LIFTS...EXPECT PLENTY OF RADIATIONAL HEATING 
TO COMMENCE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO GO AS 
HIGH AS THE MET NUMBERS...BUT NEVERTHELESS MOST OF MY VERIFICATION 
POINTS WILL BE IN THE 90S FOR HIGHS. THE REASON FOR THIS WARM UP IS 
STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF A STORM SYSTEM PROGGED TO 
APPROACH THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY. WITH THIS STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY 
FLOW...PLENTY OF MOISTURE WILL BE IN THE AREA AS WELL AS DEWPOINTS 
ARE EXPECTED TO RISE INTO THE LOW 70S IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF OUR 
FORECAST AREA. WITH SUCH A WARM AND HUMID AIRMASS...THE ATMOSPHERE 
WILL QUICKLY DESTABILIZE IN THE AFTERNOON. MODIFIED MODEL SOUNDINGS 
SHOW MUCAPE VALUES NEAR 3200 J/KG WITH LIS IN THE -6 TO -8 RANGE. 
WHILE BETTER JET DYNAMICS ARE ACROSS NORTHERN KENTUCKY...THE GFS HAS 
A 25 TO 30 KT JET AT 850MB ACROSS OUR FORECAST REGION IN THE 
AFTERNOON. NEEDLESS TO SAY...SPC HAS MY ENTIRE FORECAST AREA IN A 
SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE WEATHER TOMORROW. MAIN THREATS SHOULD BE 
DAMAGING DOWNBURST AND STRAIGHT LINE WINDS AND HAIL ABOUT QUARTER 
SIZE OR LESS. WILL BE UPDATING THE HWO TO MENTION THIS POSSIBILITY. 
THE NAM IS RATHER DRY WITH ITS QPF TOMORROW...BUT SO IS THE GFS...SO 
I HAVE GONE ABOVE THE MOS POPS AND PLACED 40 IN THE PLATEAU AND 
MOUNTAIN GROUPS AND 30S IN THE VALLEY LOCATIONS. 

TUESDAY NIGHT...EXPECT AT THE START OF THE EVENING PERIOD STRONG 
THUNDERSTORMS TO BE CONTINUING AND THEN GRADUALLY WEAKENING AFTER 
SUNSET AS INSTABILITY DIMINISHES. THE NAM IS BRINGING IN AN AREA OF 
CONVECTION CENTRAL AND NORTH OVERNIGHT AND HAVE KEPT POPS UP TO 
ACCOUNT FOR THIS POSSIBILITY AS AN UPPER LEVEL LOW CENTERED OVER THE 
UPPER GREAT LAKES WILL BE SENDING DOWN A SERIES OF VORT MAXES OVER 
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS TO CREATE CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION. 

WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...WITH THE FRONT PASSING WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON 
WILL HAVE 30 POPS WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE FRONT AS MOISTURE AT THIS 
POINT WILL BE LIMITED. THERE WILL BE A DECENT TEMPERATURE CONTRAST 
BEHIND THIS FRONT COME WEDNESDAY NIGHT THANKS TO HEIGHTS FALLING AT 
LEAST 30 TO 60 DM DUE TO THE UPPER LEVEL LOW DESCENDING INTO THE 
UPPER OHIO VALLEY. WILL SEE MINS THURSDAY MORNING DROP INTO THE 
LOWER 60S NORTHEAST AND MID 60S SOUTH. THURSDAY AFTERNOON SHOULD BE 
DRY...DESPITE MODELS GENERATING SOME QPF OVER THE AREA. MODELS 
TRYING TO CREATE SOME UPSLOPE...BUT DO NOT THINK THIS IS A FAVORABLE 
SOLUTION...ESPECIALLY WITH LIMITED MOISTURE.

THURSDAY NIGHT...PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES WILL PREVAIL AS A WEAK AREA OF 
HIGH PRESSURE MOVES OVER THE REGION PROVIDING FOR A COOL 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW. TEMPERATURES DROP INTO THE UPPER 50S UP NORTH 
AND MID 60S SOUTH TO GIVE THE REGION ANOTHER TASTE OF LATE SPRING.

.LONG TERM...(FRI THROUGH MON)...SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 06Z 
GFS AND 06Z DGEX CAST CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY THROUGH MUCH OF THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD. BOTH GFS AND DGEX PORTRAY A RATHER DEEP (FOR THIS 
TIME OF THE YEAR) UPPER CUT-OFF LOW OVER THE EASTERN CONUS. 
PLACEMENT OF THIS UPPER LOW IS CONSIDERABLY DIFFERENT HOWEVER WITH 
THE DIFFERENCES POTENTIALLY HAVING A PROFOUND EFFECT ON OUR SENSIBLE 
WEATHER. GFS SUGGESTS THE UPPER LOW WILL HOVER OVER THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY REGION THROUGH THE PERIOD WHILE THE DGEX SHOWS IT BEING 
ANCHORED OVER THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES. POOR RUN-TO-RUN 
CONSISTENCY OF THE GFS LEADS TO SOME SKEPTICISM OF ITS SOLUTION. 
THUS INCLINED TO FAVOR 06Z DGEX SOLUTION. PREVIOUS GRIDS/FORECAST 
COINCIDES QUITE WELL WITH DGEX SOLUTION SO WILL MAKE ONLY COSMETIC 
CHANGES. CONTINUED TREND OF GENERALLY DRY WEATHER INTO DAY 7 
(MONDAY). FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY USED BLEND OF GFS AND ENSEMBLE 
GUIDANCE THROUGH MOST OF THE PERIOD.

1010 AM EDT MON JUN 13 2005

.DISCUSSION...EARLY MORNING VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL A 
STRATUS DECK MOVING ACROSS THE EASTERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND INTO 
THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THIS CLOUD DECK HAS HAD SOME LIGHT RAIN AND 
DRIZZLE WITH IT AS WELL AS LOW CEILINGS. VERY WARM TEMPERATURES THIS 
MORNING CHARACTERISTIC OF MORNINGS IN FLORIDA WITH MINS IN THE LOW 
70S AND DEWPOINTS ONLY A COUPLE OF DEGREES COOLER. THIS IS EVIDENT 
OF THE TROPICAL AIRMASS LEFT BEHIND IN THE WAKE OF ARLENE. 

12Z UPPER AIR ANALYSIS AT 700MB AND 500MB REVEALS A LARGE SWATH OF 
DRY AIR AT THOSE LEVELS MOVING INTO MY CWA FROM THE WEST. THIS IS IN 
RESPONSE TO A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROF MOVING THROUGH THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS WITH DRY AIR FILLING IN BEHIND. POINT SOUNDINGS OVER 
THE SMOKYS SHOW THAT WHILE THE SOUNDING IS MOIST UP TO 700MB RAPID 
DRYING COMMENCES ABOVE THIS LAYER. AT THE SURFACE...ETA12 HAS A 
THETA-E RIDGE OVER MY MOUNTAIN COUNTIES AT PEAK HEATING TIME. THIS 
SEEMS REASONABLE GIVEN THE VERY WARM AND MOIST AIRMASS AT THE 
SURFACE. HOWEVER...WITH THE DRY AIR ALOFT I AM NOT CONFIDENT IN MUCH 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON. BEST LOCATION FOR 
THUNDERSTORM INITIATION WILL BE OVER THE APPALACHIANS. DEVELOPMENT 
IS POSSIBLE OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU MAINLY EARLY IN THE DAY 
BEFORE TO MUCH DRY AIR FILTERS IN. STORM MOVEMENT SHOULD BE OFF TO 
THE NORTHEAST AROUND 20KTS. 

WITH SUCH DRY AIR ALOFT...IF A FEW THUNDERSTORMS REALLY GET GOING IN 
THIS ENVIRONMENT...THERE IS A THREAT FOR DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS. 
THIS THREAT WILL BE ISOLATED TO ONLY THE STRONGEST OF THUNDERSTORMS. 
HAIL DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A THREAT GIVEN THE HIGH FREEZING LEVEL 
NEAR 16000 FT. ALSO...GIVEN THE TROPICAL AIRMASS STILL IN PLACE AT 
THE SURFACE...SOME STORMS COULD HAVE HEAVY RAIN AT TIMES. 

FOR THE UPDATE THIS MORNING...WILL KEEP CURRENT POP AMOUNTS THE SAME 
AND WILL ONLY TWEAK THE HOURLY TEMP GRIDS TO GET BETTER IN LINE WITH 
CURRENT TRENDS. HAVENT MADE ANY CHANGES TO MAX TEMPS TODAY AS WE 
ARE ONLY 10 TO 15 DEGREES AWAY FROM PREDICTED MAX TEMPS. WILL REMOVE 
MORNING FOG WORDING AND USE BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY PHRASING FOR 
SKY COVER.

UPDATE OUT SOON...HAVE A GREAT DAY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT 
EASTERN EXTENT OF PRECIP SHIELD FROM ARLENE AS MODELS DISAGREE QUITE 
A BIT. ETA PROJECTS ONLY SPOTTY PRECIP THROUGH THE ENTIRE EVENT 
WHILE GFS IS MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THE PRECIP...ESPECIALLY OVER 
THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. THE CANADIAN GEM MODEL TENDS 
TO FAVOR THE GFS WHILE THE SHORT-RANGE ENSEMBLES SEEM TO OFFER A 
COMPROMISE OF THE OPERATIONAL MODELS. INCLINATION IS TO SLIGHTLY 
FAVOR THE GFS BASED ON CURRENT TRENDS. TENDED TO UNDERCUT GFS 
GUIDANCE POPS IN THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES HOWEVER. BASED ON STILL 
UNCERTAIN PATH OF ARLENE THROUGH TENNESSEE...WILL CONTINUE SPS. 
APPEARS RAIN HEAVY ENOUGH TO CAUSE WIDESPREAD FLOODING IS UNLIKELY 
AT THIS TIME HOWEVER. FOR TEMPS...DID NOT STRAY FAR FROM GFS 
GUIDANCE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(SUN NIGHT THROUGH SAT)...CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE LINGERS 
OVER THE AREA SUN NIGHT INTO MONDAY...BUT MODELS DO INDICATE SOME 
DEEP LAYER DRYING BY TUESDAY...ALTHOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
CONTINUES.  NAM HAS SHIFTED MUCH MORE IN LINE WITH THE GFS...SO THEY 
ARE NOW IN DECENT AGREEMENT.  APPEARS WE WILL HAVE SCATTERED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS AROUND MONDAY AND TUESDAY...MAINLY DRIVEN BY 
DAYTIME HEATING.  00Z GFS WAS FOLLOWED FURTHER OUT...WHICH WAS THE 
PREFERRED SOLUTION BY HPC. A COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO SWING THROUGH 
THE REGION LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY WED...SO WILL CONTINUE CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.  CUT OFF UPPER LOW FORECAST TO BE 
POSITIONED TO OUR NORTHEAST THU THROUGH SAT.  CONSIDERABLE

.DISCUSSION...TONG OF MOISTURE WELL AHEAD OF APPROACHING TROPICAL
SYSTEM CONTINUES TO STREAM INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION.
HOWEVER...RECENT RADAR RETURNS SHOW PRECIP DECREASING IN COVERAGE AND
INTENSITY ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA AS SOME LOW-LEVEL DRYING

REDEVELOPMENT OF AFTERNOON CONVECTION POSSIBLE...BUT COVERAGE
SHOULD BE SCATTERED IN NATURE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SOUTHERN

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DEEP MOIST SOUTHERLY FLOW 
CONTINUES ACROSS THE REGION IN ADVANCE OF TS ARLENE. LOW TO MID 
LEVEL RIDGING FM THE EAST REMAINS IN PLACE EARLY TODAY THEN BEGINS 
TO RETREAT LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT. GUIDANCE QPF DOES NOT HAVE A 
GOOD HANDLE ON WIDESPREAD -RA MOVING NW ACROSS THE AREA THIS 
MORNING. DO NOT LIKE THE LIGHT QFP AMOUNTS DEPICTED THROUGH THE 
SHORT TERM WITH PWS BEING ABOVE 2.0. TRIED NOT TO STRAY TOO FAR 
FROM POP/QPF GUIDANCE BUT FEEL THEY MAY BE UNDERDONE. BEST 
ISENTROPIC LIFT MOVES N OF AREA TODAY. HEATING WILL BE LIMITED BY 
CLOUD COVER. DESPITE LACK OF HEATING...TSTM PARAMETERS IN FCST 
SOUNDINGS ARE IN THE MDT RANGE SO KEPT MENTION FOR TSTM ACTIVITY. 
WENT WITH RELATIVELY LOW POPS NE AREAS WHERE SOME MID LEVEL DRYING 
AND DOWNSLOPING IS INDICATED. STAYED ON THE WARM SIDE OF TEMP 
GUIDANCE AS TROPICAL AIRMASS IS EVIDENT. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...CONFIDENCE REMAINS LOW IN 
MODEL SOLUTION FOR TIMING AND TRACK OF TS ARLENE.  UPPER HIGH 
CENTERED OFF THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST IS EXPECTED TO EXPAND WESTWARD 
WHICH SHOULD SERVE TO KEEP THE TRACK OF ARLENE TO OUR WEST AND MAY 
SLOW IT DOWN A BIT.  THEREFORE....WILL STAY IN LINE WITH HPC 
FORECAST OF MOVEMENT OF THE TS WHICH BRINGS THE SYSTEM INTO 
WESTERN-MIDDLE TN ON SUNDAY AS THIS LOOKS REASONABLE.  AS A 
RESULT...WILL CONTINUE THE LIKELY POPS OVER OUR CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
ZONES AND SLIGHTLY LOWER POPS IN OUR NORTHERN ZONES WITH PASSAGE OF

.DISCUSSION...SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS VERY WARM TROPICAL STYLE 
AIRMASS IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION THIS EVENING. LAST VISIBLE 
SATELLITE IMAGES CONFIRMED THAT CIRRUS OUTFLOW FROM TROPICAL STORM 
ARLENE IS BEGINNING TO OVERSPREAD THE AREA AS ALMOST ALL METAR SITES 
ARE REPORTING A CEILING BETWEEN 12000FT AND 20000FT. PER TIME 
HEIGHTS ON ETA AND GFS EXPECT THIS CLOUD DECK TO REMAIN OVERNIGHT. 
UPPER AIR SOUNDING FROM OHX HAS PW OF 2.12 INCHES. TROPICAL AIRMASS 
IS SURELY IN PLACE NOW. AREA RADARS SHOWING CONVECTION BEGINNING TO 
DIMINISH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...KGSP RADAR SHOWING A 
WEAKENING LINE OF SHOWER ACTIVITY MOVING TOWARD MY TN AND NC 
MOUNTAIN COUNTIES. 

TROPICAL STORM ARLENE IS NOW NEARLY A HURRICANE WITH SUSTAINED WINDS 
NEAR 70 MPH. PICTURE BECOMING A LITTLE MORE CLEAR ON HOW THIS SYSTEM 
WILL AFFECT OUR WEATHER OVER THE WEEKEND. UPPER AIR ANALYSIS AT 500 
MB SHOWS THE ATLANTIC RIDGE STARTING TO BUILD IN EVEN STRONGER. 
THIS...AS NHC HAS ADVERTISED...WILL TURN ARLENE ON A MORE 
NORTH-NORTHWESTWARD TRACK TOWARD WESTERN MIDDLE TENNESSEE. A SLIGHT 
DEVIATION TO THE EAST OF THIS FORECAST TRACK WILL BRING A GREATER 
CHANCE OF HEAVIER RAINFALL INTO MY CWA COME SATURDAY AFTERNOON. HAVE 
BROUGHT UP POPS BEYOND THE FIRST PERIOD SLIGHTLY TO COME IN BETTER 
AGREEMENT WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES. ONLY ALLOWED LIKELY POPS ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE CWA. FOLLOWED PREVIOUS FORECAST IN THE 
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN SECTIONS AS THEY WILL BE FURTHEST AWAY FROM THE 
EVENTUAL TRACK. WILL BE SENDING OUT AN SPS SHORTLY TO HIGHLIGHT 
RISKS FROM THIS SYSTEM. IT SHOULD BE NOTED MOST OF THE CONVECTION IS 
ON THE EAST SIDE OF THIS SYSTEM SO ONE SHOULD NOT FOCUS ON THE 
STORMS CENTER. 

FOR THE UPDATE TONIGHT...WILL KEEP POPS AT 50 PERCENT CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN MOUNTAIN GROUPS AND 30 TO 40 ELSEWHERE THROUGH 06Z...AND 
THEN WILL DROP DOWN TO 30 PERCENT SOUTH AND 20 PERCENT NORTH. TEMPS 
BASICALLY ON TRACK BUT HAVE MODIFIED HOURLY TEMP GRIDS TO INDICATE 
ONLY A MINOR DROP IN TEMPS SINCE MOST LOCATIONS CURRENTLY WITHIN 5 
DEGREES OF DEWPOINTS. WILL ADD IN SOME PATCHY FOG AS A VERY MUGGY 
AIRMASS IS IN PLACE NEAR THE SURFACE.

ZONES...GRIDDED PRODUCTS AND SPS OUT SOON.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SAT)...MINOR CHANGES IN THE OFFING BY THE 
SECOND PERIOD AS EFFECTS FROM TROPICAL STORM ARLENE BEGIN TO BE FELT 
IN THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. ETA FORECAST SOUNDINGS DEPICT ELEVATED 
SUBSIDENCE INVERSION DEVELOPING AS NORTHERN PERIPHERY OF ARLENE 
APPROACHES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT DIURNAL CONVECTION WILL BE SUPPRESSED 
SOMEWHAT COMPARED WITH THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS. THUS HAVE LOWERED POPS 
SLIGHTLY IN THE SECOND PERIOD. 12Z GFS DEPICTS CONVECTIVE BAND FROM 
ARLENE ENTERING THE SOUTHERN TIER OF OUR FORECAST AREA BY LATE 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON...WHICH CASTS SOME UNCERTAINTY IN POPS TRENDS 
HOWEVER. DID NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO TEMPS AS THEY MATCH 
GUIDANCE QUITE WELL AS IS.

.LONG TERM...(SAT NIGHT THROUGH FRI)...FIRST ISSUE FOR THIS PERIOD 
IS WHAT EFFECT REMNANTS OF ARLENE WILL HAVE ON THE AREA.  OFFICIAL 
TPC FORECAST TRACK SIMILAR TO BUT FASTER THAN GFS...KEEPING CENTER 
WELL WEST OF OUR AREA.  HOWEVER...GFS DEPICTS SWATH OF TROPICAL 
MOISTURE MOVING NORTH ACROSS THE AREA SAT NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  STILL 
CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY FOR THIS TIME FRAME...SO FOR NOW WILL 
TREND WETTER...BUT STILL WILL NOT GO AS HIGH AS MAV POPS.  
CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE LINGERS INTO MONDAY...SO WILL CONTINUE CHANCE 
POPS.  RUN TO RUN CONTINUITY OF MODEL SOLUTIONS...AND MODEL 
AGREEMENT...CONTINUES TO BE LACKING FURTHER OUT.  LATER PERIODS WERE 
GENERALLY BASED ON 06Z GFS...WHICH WAS THE PREFERRED SOLUTION BY

.DISCUSSION...SAME STORY AS YESTERDAY WITH AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS 
DUMPING DECENT AMOUNTS OF RAINFALL ACROSS THE REGION. 
THANKFULLY...NOT ALWAYS IN THE SAME PLACES AS YESTERDAY. SURFACE AND 
UPPER RIDGING IS STILL IN PLACE PROVIDING FOR A MOIST SOUTHERLY FLOW 
INTO THE REGION. IR SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW SOME OF THE CLOUDS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE CIRCULATION OF TROPICAL STORM ARLENE MOVING INTO 
NORTHERN FLORIDA AND SOUTHERN GEORGIA. CURRENT NHC ADVISORY HAS THIS 
SYSTEM STILL SOUTH OF CUBA. NHC FORECAST BRINGS THE SYSTEM INTO 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE IN 72 HOURS. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS SYSTEM 
AS THE ADDED TROPICAL MOISTURE WILL NO DOUBT IMPACT OUR WEATHER. 

IN THE IMMEDIATE SHORT TERM...WITH THE SETTING OF THE SUN THIS 
EVENING ALMOST ALL OF THE CONVECTION IN MY CWA HAS DISSIPATED. IR 
SATELLITE HAS CLOUD TOPS WARMING ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY NORTHWARD 
INDICATING AN END TO CONVECTION. SATELLITE AND GSP RADAR SHOW 
WEAKENING OUTFLOW BOUNDARY EXTENDING FROM ANDERSON SC TO CHARLOTTE 
NC MOVING NORTHWEST TOWARD THE MOUNTAIN COUNTIES OF NORTH CAROLINA. 
TWO NIGHTS AGO A SIMILAR FEATURE MOVED INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND 
ENHANCED AN ALREADY ACTIVE AREA OF SHOWERS. A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH 
ALL THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE PRESENT THAT THIS BOUNDARY MAY HELP TO 
INITIATE SOME -SHRA OR EVEN -TSRA ACTIVITY OVER THE MOUNTAINS. THIS 
IS THE ONLY FEATURE THAT WILL ALLOW FOR ANY PRECIPITATION OVERNIGHT 
AND THUS THE CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION IS LOW. WILL THEREFORE KEEP 30 
PERCENT CHANCE POPS IN THE MOUNTAIN ZONES AND DECREASE TO 20 PERCENT 
AFTER 06Z. WILL GO AHEAD AT ZONE UPDATE ISSUANCE AND PLACE 30 POPS 
IN THE ZONES FOR THE MOUNTAINS AND LET THE DIGITAL PRODUCTS SHOW THE 
DECREASE TOWARD MORNING. WILL HAVE 20 POPS IN FOR NE TN...SW VA AND 
THE NORTHERN PLATEAU COUNTIES.

WILL ADD SOME PATCHY FOG TO THE ZONES AS TEMPERATURES ALREADY CLOSE 
TO DEWPOINTS. MODELS NOT TO BULLISH ON DENSE FOG LIKE LAST 
NIGHT...BUT LAST NIGHT CHA WENT TO ZERO VISIBILITY DUE TO FOG. TYS 
WAS FOG FREE WHILE TRI ONLY MADE IT TO 2SM. MOISTURE TRANSPORT 
VECTORS SHOW A SURGE OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INTO THE CHA AREA 
OVERNIGHT AND THIS MAY HELP TO PROVIDE SOME FOG FORMATION AGAIN 
GIVEN MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND CALM WINDS. HOWEVER...I AM NOT GOING TO 
MENTION DENSE FOG AS FEEL COVERAGE WILL BE SPOTTY AT BEST. 

TEMPERATURES ALREADY CLOSE TO ADVERTISED MINS AND WILL ONLY TWEAK 
SLIGHTLY TO MATCH THE CURRENT TRENDS. HAVE REWORKED THE HOURLY TEMP 
GRIDS TO FIT CURRENT OBSERVATIONS AND ACCOUNT FOR A VERY SLOW 
TEMPERATURE DROP OVERNIGHT. 

ZONES AND GRIDDED PRODUCTS OUT SHORTLY AFTER 10PM THIS EVENING.

.DISCUSSION...THE ATMOSPHERE HAS HAD JUST ABOUT ALL THE ACTION IT 
CAN TAKE THIS EVENING AS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE ALL BUT 
DISSIPATED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH ONLY A COUPLE OF LIGHT 
SHOWERS REMAINING IN THE VICINITY OF TRI AND TYS. THIS IS MUCH 
DIFFERENT THAN LAST NIGHT AS SHOWERS REMAINED WELL INTO THE EVENING 
HOURS. 00Z MESOANALYSIS SHOWED OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM DECAYING MCS 
OVER SOUTHERN ILLINOIS CONTINUING TO MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD. WITH MOST 
ASOS SITES SEEING PRECIPITATION TODAY...TEMPERATURES HAVE REALLY 
DROPPED OFF PER ANALYSIS. ENTIRE CWA IS HOLDING ON TO THE LOWER TO 
MID 70S AS OF 00Z. WILL LIKELY SEE A SLOW TEMPERATURE DROP 
OVERNIGHT. 

FOR THE UPDATE...WILL LOWER POPS DOWN TO SLIGHT CHANCE EVERYWHERE 
EXCEPT MOUNTAIN ZONES. KGSP RADAR SHOWS -TSRA MOVING JUST WEST OF 
DUE NORTH ACROSS NW NORTH CAROLINA. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD MISS MY TN 
AND VA COUNTIES JUST TO THE EAST...BUT ANY INTERACTION WITH LEFTOVER 
BOUNDARIES FROM CONVECTION TODAY COULD KICK OFF A STRAY SHOWER OVER 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND THIS CHANCE IS GREATER THAN IN THE VALLEY 
LOCATIONS. CONSIDERING RAINFALL AT MOST LOCATIONS TODAY WILL ADD 
PATCHY FOG TO THE ZONES. NOT OVERLY CONCERNED THAT THIS FOG WILL GO 
DENSE TONIGHT AS ASOS SITES ONLY DROPPED INTO THE 2SM RANGE ON 
VISBYS...BUT THE USUAL LOCATIONS MAY BRIEFLY SEE DENSE FOG PRIOR TO 
SUNRISE. THIS WILL BE LIKELY BE SPOTTING AND WILL THEREFORE NOT 
MENTION DENSE FOG IN ZONES.

MINIMUM TEMPERATURES LOOK FINE AND MADE NO CHANGES. DID ADJUST 
HOURLY TEMPERATURES TO FAVOR A GRADUAL DECREASE OVERNIGHT AS 
TEMPERATURES ALREADY WITHIN 5 TO 8 DEGREES OF FORECASTED MINS.

ZONES AND GRIDDED PRODUCTS OUT SHORTLY.

310 PM EDT WED JUN 8 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE OCCURRING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON 
WITH THE MOST CONCENTRATED ACTIVITY OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU.
MSAS DATA SHOWS LIS IN THIS AREA OF -4 TO -5 WITH -1 TO -3 OVER THE 
REMAINDER OF THE AREA. CONSIDERABLE CLOUD COVER MOST OF THE DAY 
SHOWS THAT THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS CONTINUE 
IN A MOIST SOUTHERLY FLOW AS UPPER RIDGE STAYS PUT ALONG THE EAST 
COAST AND SOUTHEAST STATES. THE GFS AND ETA SHOWS A WEAKNESS IN THE
RIDGE OVER THE LOWER MS VALLEY AND WEAK VORTICITY MAXIMUMS MOVING 
FROM SOUTH TO NORTH WITH THE FLOW. BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING DURING THE 
TIME OF MAXIMUM HEATING. ALSO HEAVY RAIN WITH LOCALIZED FLOODING IS 
POSSIBLE BEFORE SUNSET WITH THE STRONGER THUNDERSTORMS DUE TO LIGHT 
WINDS FROM THE SURFACE UP TO HIGH LEVELS. SOME THUNDERSTORMS MAY 
PRODUCE AN INCH OR TWO IN AN HOURS TIME. THAT WILL BE THE MAIN 
THREAT THROUGH THURSDAY ALTHOUGH HIGH WIND GUSTS COULD OCCUR WITH A 
FEW COLLAPSING CELLS THROUGH EARLY EVENING.         

.LONG TERM...(THU NIGHT THROUGH WED)...FAIRLY STAGNANT PATTERN FOR 
MUCH OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD.  MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT FOR THE BIG 
PICTURE...BUT AS USUAL SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE DETAILS.  THINK NAM 
SOLUTION LOOKS GOOD FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE PERIOD...WITH QUITE A 
BIT OF MOISTURE LINGERING BUT NOT MUCH FORCING EVIDENT INTO THE 
WEEKEND.  SHOULD SEE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...WITH THE BULK OF 
THE ACTIVITY IN THE AFTERNOON WITH THE DIURNAL HEATING.  MODELS 
STILL TRYING TO SHOW A POSSIBLE TROPICAL SYSTEM MAKING LANDFALL ON 
THE GULF COAST SOMETIME POSSIBLY AS SOON AS THIS WEEKEND...BUT THE 
OFFICIAL TRACK STAYS PRETTY FAR TO THE WEST AFTER LANDFALL.  06Z 
GFS...AND HPC GUIDANCE WHICH WAS BASED ON IT...SHOW A COLD FRONT 
PUSHING THROUGH BY EARLY WED.  WILL KEEP CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY THROUGH TUE...THEN SLIGHT CHANCE WED.

.DISCUSSION...A WARM MOIST TROPICAL AIRMASS CONTINUES OVER THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. SKIES ARE PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY THIS MORNING. A 
FEW LIGHT SHOWERS ARE OCCURRING OVER THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS. 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE ALREADY DEVELOPING ACROSS THE WESTERN TENNESSEE 
VALLEY IN WESTERN TN AND KY FROM OUTFLOWS FROM EARLIER THUNDERSTORMS 
AND MOVING EAST. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 70S WITH DEWPOINTS IN 
UPPER 60S. THE LIFTED INDEX VALUES ARE ALREADY AROUND -2 IN THE 
WESTERN SECTIONS. THINK THAT SHOWERS MAY DEVELOP BY EARLY AFTERNOON 
IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN TODAY A LITTLE EARLIER THAN YESTERDAY. ETA 
MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE LIS AROUND -4 TO -5 WITH CAPES FROM 1500 
TO 2000 J/KG A LITTLE HIGHER THAN YESTERDAY. A WEAK SHORT WAVE IS 
EXPECTED TO MOVE SLOWLY NORTH AND EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS FURTHER ENHANCING PRECIPITATION IN THE MOUNTAINS. ALSO 
HEAVY RAINFALL OCCURRED ACROSS SOME AREAS OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE 
LAST NIGHT AND THE OVERNIGHT CONVECTION LEFT MANY OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES. SO WITH THIS IN MIND LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL IS A 
POSSIBILITY LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING ESPECIALLY OVER THE 
MOUNTAINS. ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS MAY OCCUR WITH HIGH WINDS THE MAIN 
THREAT. CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS GOOD. ONLY CHANGE WILL BE TO MENTION 
HEAVY RAIN IN THE ZONES.

.SHORT TERM...AREA RADARS SHOW SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
MUCH OF THE CENTRAL AND NORTH SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH MORE 
NUMEROUS STORMS EAST AND SOUTH OF THE APPALACHIANS. WATER VAPOR LOOP SHOWS
A WEAK SHORT-WAVE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS HELPING TO FOCUS THE
VERY MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS. MAIN THREAT THIS MORNING WILL BE HEAVY
DOWNPOURS AND LIGHTNING.

NAM AND GFS SHOWS TROPICAL AIRMASS REMAINING ACROSS THE REGION TODAY WITH
A FAIRLY UNSTABLE AIRMASS WITH CAPES NEAR 2500 TO 3000 J/KG. ALSO...K-
INDICES IN THE 30S. STORM MOTION A LITTLE FASTER TODAY WITH A GENERALLY
SOUTH TO NORTH MOVEMENT AROUND 10 KNOTS OR SO. WEAK UPPER WAVE WILL REMAIN
NEAR THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THIS WAVE COMBINED
WITH TERRAIN AND LEFT OVER OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WILL PRODUCE SCATTERED CONVECTION
LATER TODAY. DUE TO PWS OF 1.75 INCH...HEAVY RAIN WITH THE STRONGER STORMS
IS A SURE BET. IF THUNDERSTORMS TRAIN ALONG AN OLD OUTFLOW...THEN ISOLATED
FLASH FLOODING IS A CONCERN.

ALSO...SIMILAR TO TUESDAY ACTIVITY...ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLE AS WELL
WITH MAIN CONCERN BEING DAMAGING DOWNBURSTS WINDS AND HAIL UP TO NICKEL SIZE.

.LONG TERM...OVERALL PATTERN REMAINS STAGNANT WITH UPPER RIDGE OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES WITH TROPICAL MOISTURE CONTINUING TO FEED INTO
THE FORECAST AREA. GFS ALSO HINTS OF A TROPICAL SYSTEM MOVING INTO THE 
CENTRAL GULF COAST STATES EARLY THIS WEEKEND THEN MOVING NORTH. MAIN LIFT
THROUGH THE EXTENDED FORECAST WILL REMAIN MAINLY TERRAIN AND OLD OUTFLOW
BOUNDARIES. BY TUESDAY...GFS HINTS OF A WEAK FRONT MOVING INTO THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY.

WILL CONTINUE WITH MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION THROUGH THE EXTENDED FORECAST.

.DISCUSSION...BUSY EVENING FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS ANYWAY WITH 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVING MAINLY OUT OF THE NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND INTO THE NORTHEAST TENNESSEE VALLEY. SOME OF 
THE LAST VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATED TWO OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES 
MOVING INTO MY CWA. THE MAIN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY OF CONCERN WAS OVER 
NORTHWESTERN NORTH CAROLINA AND MOVING TOWARD THE TN/NC BORDER. THIS 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY WILL LIKELY SERVE AS A FOCUSING POINT FOR CONTINUED 
SHOWERS INTO THE LATE EVENING AND EARLY MORNING HOURS. WITH THE SUN 
ALREADY SET...INSTABILITY IS QUICKLY STARTING TO DIMINISH ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA AS REFLECTIVITY SIGNATURES ON KMRX RADAR ARE STEADILY 
DROPPING BELOW 50DBZ. HOWEVER...AS OCCURRED LAST NIGHT...AN AREA OF 
SHOWER ACTIVITY WILL LIKELY REMAIN OVER NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
EXTREME SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA FOR THE NEXT FEW HOURS AS IT IS AIDED BY 
THE APPROACHING OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM THE SOUTHEAST.

THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA WAS PRETTY MUCH DEVOID OF 
CONVECTION EXCEPT FOR SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA AND THE SOUTHERN 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. A DECAYING MCV WAS MOVING THROUGH THE REGION AS 
EVIDENT BY COUNTERCLOCKWISE CIRCULATION OF STORMS ON RADAR IMAGERY. 
AS INSTABILITY HAS DIMINISHED GREATLY...ALMOST ALL PRECIPITATION HAS 
CEASED. KHTX RADAR ONLY HAS A FEW WEAK RETURNS OVER POLK COUNTY IN 
TENNESSEE. 

FOR THE UPDATE THIS EVENING...WILL REARRANGE POPS IN THE SHORT TERM 
TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CURRENT RADAR TRENDS IN THE NORTHEAST CWA AND  
ELSEWHERE. WILL CONTINUE TO DECREASE HOURLY POPS OVERNIGHT AS 
REMAINING INSTABILITY AND LIFT DIMINISHES. WILL ADD IN SOME PATCHY 
FOG FOR NE TN AND SW VA WITH ALL THE ADDED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FROM 
THE STORMS. HAVE MADE NO CHANGES TO THE TEMPERATURE GRIDS AS MINS 
ARE ON TRACK. 

ONE SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT THE RAINFALL THIS EVENING...SINCE 853 PM 
EDT...THE TRI CITIES REGIONAL AIRPORT HAS RECEIVED 1.70 INCHES OF 
RAIN. THIS WILL BREAK THE DAILY MAXIMUM RAINFALL RECORD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...DEEP CONVECTION 
STRUGGLING TO GET GOING THIS AFTERNOON...ALTHOUGH IT IS BEGINNING TO 
INCREASE.  THINKING THAT WE ARE KIND OF BETWEEN WEAK SYSTEMS NOW.  
WILL HAVE SOME POPS TONIGHT...BUT THINK BETTER CHANCES ARE TOMORROW 
WHEN RICHER LOW LEVEL AIR RETURNS.  LOW-LEVEL PRESSURE GRADIENT 
STARTS TO TIGHTEN NW-SE TOMORROW AS WELL...SO THINKING BETTER 
CHANCES WEST VERSUS EAST WITH BETTER SSW SURFACE FLOW AND BETTER 
THETA-E VALUES...ALTHOUGH MODELS LIKE THE EAST AS WELL.  TOUGH TO 
KNOW IF CURRENT WEAK MCV THIS AFTERNOON OVER NE AL WILL BE A PLAYER 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY...NOT BANKING ON IT FOR NOW...THINKING THAT 
CURRENT CONVECTION WILL REORGANIZE THIS FEATURE OVERNIGHT.  
ALSO...WILL NEED TO WATCH CONVECTION TO NORTHEAST...MORE UNSTABLE UP 
THERE...NOTING 88/70 AT KMTV VERSUS 79/66 AT KTRI.  THIS CONVECTION 
IS BACK-BUILDING TOWARD CWA.

MADE VERY FEW CHANGES TO TEMPERATURE GRIDS.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...THERE WILL BE 
LITTLE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED TIME 
PERIOD.  AN UPPER LEVEL HIGH POSITIONED TO OUR EAST KEEPS THE 
SOUTHERN ALLAPHIAN REGION IN SOUTHERLY FLOW ALOFT.  THIS FLOW WILL 
CONTINUE TO FEED MOISTURE INTO THE AREA.  WITH DIURNAL HEATING... 
THE AIR MASS WILL DESTABILIZE EACH AFTERNOON.  THIS WILL BE 
SUFFICIENT FOR THERMAL INDUCE CONVECTION EACH DAY OF THE EXTEND.  
ADDITIONALLY...THE ARE WEAK WAVES IN THE UPPER FLOW WHICH MAY 
ENHANCE CONVECTION.  HOWEVER...DETAILS SUCH AS TIMING AND POSITION 
OF THE WAVES IS DIFFICULT.  THEREFORE...WILL GENERALLY JUST CONTINUE 
WITH ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE PERIOD.  WILL 
KEEP TEMPERATURES CLOSE TO MODEL GUIDANCE AS THESE NUMBERS LOOK 
REASONABLE.

LOTS OF DEEP CONVECTION OVER THE SOUTHEAST U.S. YESTERDAY AND LAST 
NIGHT.  RFC PRECIP ANALYSIS SHOWS ABOUT 70 PERCENT COVERAGE OVER 
MS...AL...TN.  ATMOSPHERE PRETTY WORKED OVER AND MORE STABLE TODAY.  
MID CLOUDS VERY SLUGGISH TO START ERODING AND TEMPS AND DEW POINTS 
LOWER VERSUS YESTERDAY.  STILL A WEAK CAP OVER AREA.  WILL TRIM BACK 
POPS A BIT FOR THIS AFTERNOON.  THINK THE BEST PLACES FOR INITIAL 
CONVECTION WILL BE ESSENTIALLY IN THE AREAS THAT SAW THE LEAST RAIN 
YESTERDAY.  14Z SURFACE THETA-E SHOWS AN AXIS FROM SE CORNER OF 
TN...UP TN VLY TO KTYS...SKIPPING WET GROUNDS NEAR KMRX...THEN PICKS 
UP AGAIN IN NE CORNER.  ALSO WEAK MCV IN N AL WILL NEED TO BE 
CONSIDERED.  WEAK STEERING FLOW TO NORTHEAST.

THINK BEST AFTN PRECIP CHANCES WILL BE FROM SOUTHERN AREAS DUE TO 
MCV AND EASTERN AREAS DUE TO BETTER HEATING.  ALTHOUGH NORTHERN 
PLATEAU SEEMS MORE STABLE...ITS ELEVATED TERRAIN MAY HELP GET THINGS 
GOING ANYWAY.  EVEN THOUGH PW/S REMAIN HIGH WILL KEEP QPF/S FAIRLY 
LOW FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

.SHORT TERM...A LOT OF CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS REMAIN ACROSS THE FORECAST
AREA EARLY THIS MORNING WITH PATCHY FOG.  BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER 
ANTICIPATED LATER THIS MORNING...HOWEVER...WATER VAPOR SHOWS PLUME OF
TROPICAL MOISTURE MOVING ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...
SO OVERALL A MOSTLY CLOUDY DAY.

ENOUGH BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS TO ALLOW FOR A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS WITH
CAPES APPROACHING 2000 J/KG. ALSO...SOUNDING DATA SHOWS A FAIRLY LOW CONVECTIVE
TEMPERATURE...SO CONVECTION SHOWED DEVELOP FAIRLY EARLY TODAY. MAIN LIFT WILL
BE LIFT OVER BOUNDARIES AND TERRAIN. K-INDICES IN THE MID 30S SUGGEST A
FAIRLY DECENT COVERAGE OF STORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. CONVECTION MAY
ALSO BE AIDED BY WEAK WAVES IN THE UPPER FLOW.

MAIN CONCERN FROM THESE THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL DUE
TO THE ABUNDANT MOISTURE AND SLOW MOVEMENT OF STORMS.  HAVE INCLUDED LOCALLY
HEAVY RAINS IN THE FORECAST. AIRMASS NOT AS UNSTABLE TODAY AS YESTERDAY...
SO SEVERE THREAT NOT AS POTENT. HOWEVER...ISOLATED SEVERE STILL POSSIBLE 
PRODUCING DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS.

.LONG TERM...GFS AND NAM SHOWS SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES REMAINING UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF WEAK UPPER RIDGING WITH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS IN THE PLUME OF TROPICAL MOISTURE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE HIGH.
DIURNAL CONVECTION SEEMS A GOOD BIT EACH DAY WITH MAIN LIFT REMAINING THE
HIGHER TERRAIN AND LIFT OVER BOUNDARIES. MAY BE SOME WEAK UPPER WAVES AS
WELL...BUT TIMING AND INFLUENCE OF THESE INDIVIDUAL WAVES VERY DIFFICULT
TO PIN DOWN.  WILL MAINTAIN SCATTERED MAINLY AFTERNOON AND EVENING CONVECTION

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS 
POSITIONED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THIS EVENING. AIR 
MASS HAS BEEN SLOWLY DESTABILIZING...BUT BELIEVE CLOUD COVER HAS 
LIMITED EXPECTED INSTABILITY SLIGHTLY. WEAK CONVECTION HAS BEGUN 
OVER GA THIS AFTERNOON AND EXPECT SOME THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY THIS 
EVENING INTO THE MRX AREA. BUT WITH LIMITED MID AND UPPER LEVEL 
MOISTURE...LESS THAN EXPECTED INSTABILITY AND LACK OF A DECENT 
TRIGGERING MECHANISM...BELIEVE SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT WILL 
BE ISOLATED IN NATURE WITH BEST CHANCES ALONG HIGHER TERRAIN. WITH 
LOSS OF THERMAL HEATING OVERNIGHT...AIR MASS WILL STABILIZE ENDING 
CONVECTIVE THREAT. PATCHY FOG DEVELOPMENT ONCE AGAIN EXPECTED BY 
MORNING...ESPECIALLY ALONG RIVERS AND OTHER LOW LYING AREAS. ON 
SUNDAY...THE ATMOSPHERE WILL ONCE AGAIN DESTABILIZE...TO A GREATER 
EXTENT THAN THIS AFTERNOON. MOISTURE STILL LIMITED BUT DOES DEEPEN A 
BIT...BUT THERE REMAINS LITTLE TO ACT AS A TRIGGER. THEREFORE...WILL 
CONTINUE POPS OF AROUND 30 PERCENT FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS. WILL 
KEEP FORECASTED TEMPS NEAR GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...TROPICAL MOISTURE 
INCREASES OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY...AS A BERMUDA HIGH 
PATTERN DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTHEAST. A TYPICAL SUMMERTIME PATTERN 
WILL CONTINUE THROUGH NEXT WEEK WITH SCATTERED CONVECTION EXPECTED 
EACH DAY...MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. ZONAL 
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW WILL KEEP A WEAK COLD FRONT NORTH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA THROUGH NEXT WEEK. A FEW TSTORM COMPLEXES MAY DEVELOP ALONG THIS 
FRONT AND TRACK TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA...BUT ITS TOO EARLY TO 
HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE IN THIS POSSIBILITY. THUS...WILL KEEP POPS IN 
THE LOW CHANCE CATEGORY THROUGH NEXT WEEK...WITH TEMPS REMAINING 
NEAR SEASONAL NORMALS WITHOUT MUCH CHANGE EXPECTED FROM DAY-TO-DAY.

OTHERWISE...MAIN SYNOPTIC FEATURE IS A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE THAT HAS 
SHIFTED EAST INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION.  WITH THE

SEEING ANY TRIGGERS MOVING IN TO AID INITIATION OF CONVECTION AND 
MOISTURE IS LIMITED (LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS IN PLACE...BUT IT IS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...UPPER TROUGH EXITING THE REGION 
THIS EVENING AS WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN. SCATTERED SHOWERS... 
WITH MAYBE A STRAY RUMBLE OF THUNDER...WILL SLOWLY DISSIPATE TONIGHT 
AS THE TROUGH AXIS MOVES AWAY. WITH SUBSIDENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
HIGH...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FROM RECENT RAINS...DECREASING CLOUDS AND 
LIGHT WINDS...EXPECT SOME FOG FORMATION OVERNIGHT. LOCALLY DENSE FOG 
IS POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY ALONG LOW LYING AREAS. ON SATURDAY...HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BE THE DOMINATE FEATURE. INCREASE HEIGHTS WILL ALLOW 
TEMPERATURES TO REBOUND TO NEAR NORMAL LEVELS. ADDITIONALLY...A 
DECREASE IN CLOUD COVER AND DIURNAL HEATING WILL HELP SLIGHTLY 
DESTABILIZE THE AIR MASS ONCE AGAIN. WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IN 
PLACE...A WEAK IMPULSE IN THE UPPER FLOW WILL ALLOW FOR THE 
POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN 
THE AFTERNOON. WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES IN LINE WITH MODEL GUIDANCE... 
AS MODELS IN FAIR AGREEMENT AND NUMBERS LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...INSTABILITY INCREASES 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY...AS MOISTURE FROM THE 
CARIBBEAN MOVES NORTH INTO THE REGION. EXTENDED MODELS CONTINUE TO 
INDICATE A BERMUDA HIGH PATTERN DEVELOPING OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
THROUGH NEXT WEEK...BRINGING A MORE TYPICAL SUMMERTIME PATTERN. AS A 
RESULT...EXPECT ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION THROUGHOUT NEXT 
WEEK...MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. A WEAK COLD 
FRONT WILL SLOWLY BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
NEXT WEEK...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW REMAINS ZONAL ACROSS THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE NATION. A FEW TSTORM COMPLEXES MAY DEVELOP AHEAD OF THIS 
FRONT AND TRACK TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA...BUT ITS TOO EARLY TO

.DISCUSSION...IR SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW CYCLONIC CIRCULATION OVER 
WESTERN MIDDLE TENNESSEE SLOWLY BEGINNING TO LIFT NORTHEASTWARD. ON 
THE EASTERN SIDE OF THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM...AN AREA OF SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED. ANALYSIS OF 500 MB HEIGHTS SHOW 
TROF AXIS JUST WEST OF A NASHVILLE TO BIRMINGHAM LINE. AS THIS AXIS 
SLOWLY MOVES NORTHEAST OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS...UPWARD MOTION FOR 
PRECIPITATION WILL SLOWLY DIMINISH SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST. HAVE SEEN 
SOME GOOD SIZE THUNDERSTORMS ON AREA RADARS THIS EVENING. NO REPORTS 
OF SEVERE WEATHER...BUT SOME GOOD RAINERS AND A FEW WITH HIGH 
LIGHTNING COUNTS. CURRENT RADAR SCAN FROM KMRX SHOWS INTENSITY OF 
RETURNS DIMINISHING. HOWEVER...I EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO SEE SHOWER 
ACTIVITY CONTINUE INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS...ESPECIALLY ACROSS 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE AREA. 

FOR THE UPDATE THIS EVENING...NOT MANY CHANGES NEEDED. WILL GO AHEAD 
AND TRIM POPS BACK ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA. THIS IS WHERE THE MOST 
STABLE AIR IS AT THIS TIME. MSAS HAS LIS +4 AND UP. 
MOREOVER...EASTERLY AND SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW WILL HELP TO PROVIDE SOME 
DOWNSLOPING OVERNIGHT AND HELP PREVENT LITTLE IN THE WAY OF 
PRECIPITATION. WILL CONTINUE PREVIOUS TREND OF INCREASING POPS 
OVERNIGHT NORTHEAST...BUT WILL NOT COME UP QUITE AS FAST. ACROSS 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS WILL ADJUST POPS TO REFLECT CURRENT 
RADAR TRENDS. 

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...FORECASTED MINS APPEAR TO BE ON TRACK...BUT 
WILL TWEAK DOWN JUST A COUPLE OF DEGREES ACROSS SW VA WHERE 
TEMPERATURES ARE ALREADY INTO THE LOWER 60S. 

WILL MONITOR RADAR TRENDS FOR THE NEXT HALF HOUR AND THEN START 
SENDING OUT UPDATED PRODUCTS BY 10 PM.

HAVE A GREAT NIGHT

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT WITH 
MAIN SYNOPTIC FEATURES AFFECTING THE AREA...NAMELY TIMING AND 
POSITION OF AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS THAT IS PROGGED TO SWING 
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TONIGHT. SCATTERED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS FORMING OVER GA/AL THIS AFTERNOON WILL CONTINUE TO 
TRACK TO THE NORTH INTO EAST TENNESSEE THROUGHOUT THE EVENING HOURS 
WITH THE AIR MASS SLOWLY STABILIZING TONIGHT. HOWEVER...THE 
ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN MARGINALLY UNSTABLE OVERNIGHT...AND THIS 
COMBINED WITH DEEPENING MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS FROM THE TROUGH AXIS 
WILL CONTINUE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND EVEN SOME ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS. THIS PRECIP WILL SPILL OVER INTO FRIDAY AS WEAK 
INSTABILITY CONTINUES AND THE TROUGH EXITS THE REGION. MODEL 
GUIDANCE LOOKS REASONABLE FOR TEMPERATURES AND WILL STICK CLOSE TO 
THESE.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY 
FRONT SHOULD BECOME SITUATED OVER CENTRAL EAST TN ON FRIDAY NIGHT... 
AS ITS ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW PRESSURE AREA DIMINISHES OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. INSTABILITY BEGINS TO INCREASE OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
ON SATURDAY...WITH SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING IN THE VICINITY 
OF THIS FRONT. EXTENDED MODELS INDICATE THAT A BERMUDA HIGH PATTERN 
WILL DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHEAST BY SUNDAY...BRINGING A MORE TYPICAL 
SUMMERTIME PATTERN THROUGH NEXT WEEK. AS A RESULT...EXPECT SCATTERED 
CONVECTION THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...MAINLY DURING THE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. 

A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE MIDWEST ON MONDAY... 
BECOMING QUASI-STATIONARY OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AS THE UPPER- 
LEVEL FLOW REMAINS ZONAL. GFS MODEL INSISTS THAT THIS FRONT WILL 
CONTINUE TO SLOWLY SINK SOUTH INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY... 
BUT WITH THE UPPER FLOW REMAINING ZONAL...THINK THAT THIS FRONT WILL 
LIKELY STALL-OUT SOMEWHERE AROUND THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE 
MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. TEMPS WILL WARM BACK TO MORE SEASONAL LEVELS BY 
SATURDAY WITHOUT MUCH OF A CHANGE THROUGH NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES ARE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT UPPER TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY APPROACH 
THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE FIRST TWO PERIODS. THIS WILL RESULT IN 
RATHER UNSETTLED WEATHER. AGREEMENT AMONG MODELS IS NOT REFLECTED IN 
THE MODEL GUIDANCE POPS HOWEVER AS THEY RANGE FROM CHANCE TO 
CATEGORICAL. DUE TO UNCERTAINTY...STAYED WITH CURRENT POP 
GRIDS/FORECAST FOR THE MOST PART. LOWERED POPS TO LIKELY IN ALL 
AREAS EARLY IN THE FIRST PERIOD AS CURRENT BAND OF PRECIP SHOULD 
LIFT OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA BY SUNRISE. ONLY SCATTERED PRECIP HAS 
DEVELOPED BEHIND THIS MAIN BAND. ALSO CONTINUED TO MENTION THUNDER 
FOR AFTERNOON/EVENING PERIODS AS UPPER TROUGH MOVING INTO THE AREA 
CAUSES ATMOSPHERE TO BECOME SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY 
STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH/LOW 
CONTINUES TO LIFT SLOWLY NE FRIDAY...WEAKENING AND FINALLY MOVING 
JUST NE OF THE REGION BY FRIDAY EVENING.  THE SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
AREA ALSO WEAKENS CONSIDERABLY WITH AN ASSOCIATED FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
LYING ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN...DURING PEAK HEATING.  THUS...RAISED 
POPS A BIT NEAR THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND ALSO ADDED A MENTION OF 
THUNDERSTORMS DUE TO SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE SURFACE BASED LIFTED INDICES 
AND AN INCREASE IN POSITIVE CAPE VALUES INTO THE 800 TO 1500 J/KG 
RANGE.  MY POP VALUES ARE JUST BELOW THE HIGHER MOS VALUES...BUT 
WERE A BETTER FIT WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES GRIDS.  
  
CONVECTION SHOULD WEAKEN AND GRADUALLY DISSIPATE FRIDAY EVENING. THEN
THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDS TO A MORE SUMMERTIME PATTERN FOR THE WEEKEND 
AND INTO NEXT WEEK.  INSTABILITY LOOKS TO REALLY INCREASE ON SAT AND 
SUN...REACHING EASILY 2000 J/KG OR HIGHER DUE TO CONSIDERABLE 
RESIDUAL MOISTURE AND MUCH WARMER MAX TEMPS.  THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR 
MCS ACTIVITY TO AFFECT AT LEAST WRN AND NWRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA LATE SATURDAY AND LATE SUNDAY...AS VERY FAVORABLE CONDITIONS 
EXIST FOR THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND MID 
MISS VALLEY...WITH MOVEMENT EASTWARD.  HOWEVER...THIS IS STILL 
SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN AT THIS POINT...WITH BEST BET TO BE A MORE 
TYPICAL CONVECTIVE PATTERN FAVORING THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS SUCH AS 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES.  THUS...ONLY VERY MINOR POP AND 
WEATHER ADJUSTMENTS MADE FOR THE WEEKEND.  NO CHANGES MADE FROM 
MONDAY OUT...EXCEPT TO ADD SOME PRELIMINARY NEW DAY 7 (THURSDAY) 
GRIDS.

OTHERWISE...FAVORED THE COOLER MAV MOS MAX TEMPS ON FRIDAY...A BLEND 
FOR MINS FRIDAY NIGHT...AND A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE BLEND OF MOS FOR 
HIGHS ON SATURDAY.

THIS EVENING. 01Z OBSERVATIONS SHOW TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 50S 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA TO MID 60S SOUTH.  
MESO-ANALYSIS FROM 23Z REVEALED A TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEAST. 1005MB SURFACE LOW CENTERED NEAR TUPELO MS WITH PRESSURES 
10MB HIGHER OVER MY NORTHERN COUNTIES. THIS IS LEADING TO A STEADY 
NORTHEAST WIND. ABINGDON VA HAS BEEN SEEING 13KTS SUSTAINED WITH 
GUSTS UP TO 20KTS. REPORTS ON THE NC SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN FROM GSP 
WEATHER INDICATE WIND GUSTS NEAR 40 KTS. IT WONT BE UNCOMMON IN OUR 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO HAVE GUSTS APPROACH THIS MAGNITUDE. HAVE MADE 
TWEAKS TO WIND GRIDS USING NAM-12 TO ACCOUNT FOR THE GUSTINESS. WILL 
ALSO ADD GUSTY WORDING TO MOUNTAIN ZONES...ESPECIALLY OVER NE TN 
GROUPS. 

PRECIPITATION BEGINNING TO FILL IN AGAIN FROM SOUTHWEST TO 
NORTHEAST. LIGHT TO EVEN MODERATE RAIN FALLING AT TIMES REDUCING 
VISIBILITIES AT CHA TO NEAR 2SM. 

BOTH NAM AND GFS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ABOUT MOVEMENT OF PRECIPITATION. 
GFS AND NAM INDICATE STRONG OMEGA LIFT ON EAST SIDE OF APPALACHIANS 
OVERNIGHT...BUT DOWNSLOPING WILL HELP PREVENT HEAVY PRECIPITATION. 
NEVERTHELESS...WITH CURRENT RADAR TRENDS BEING WHAT THEY ARE...TOUGH 
TO GO AGAINST 100 POPS EVERYWHERE. WILL CONTINUE 100 POPS OVERNIGHT. 
AS FOR TEMPERATURES...WILL LOWER MINS A FEW DEGREES CENTRAL AND 
NORTH AS TEMPERATURES CONTINUING TO DROP. HIGHER ELEVATIONS WILL 
LIKELY MAKE IT INTO THE UPPER 40S BY DAYBREAK. HAVE ADJUSTED HOURLY 
TEMPS TO BETTER MATCH TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...USED CATEGORICAL POPS FOR 
TONIGHT AS LOW PRESSURE SFC AND ALOFT CONTINUES TO CHANNEL MOISTURE 
N ACROSS THE TN VLY/SRN APPALACHIANS. FIRST WAVE PRESSING N ACROSS 
SW VA WHILE NEXT VORT AXIS MOVING STEADILY N ACROSS CENTRAL THRU 
SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF AL/GA AND SHOULD PRODUCE A FAIRLY LENGTHY 
PERIOD OF -RA WHEN IT ARRIVES IN THE FA TONIGHT. THIS WAVE PROGGED 
BY MODELS TO BUILD N THRU SW VA AROUND 12Z THU BUT WITH PLENTY OF 
MOISTURE STILL AVAILABLE FOR LIFTING IN THE VICINITY OF THE STAGNANT 
UPPER LOW LIKELY POPS SEEM TO BE BEST FCST SOLUTION FOR THU. STAYED 
RATHER CLOSE TO TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE BLEND DURING SHORT TERM FCST.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LOW OVER THE 
DEEP SOUTH WILL GRADUALLY MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS 
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE IS PROGGED TO GRADUALLY DIMINISH AS IT APPROACHES THE 
FORECAST AREA...WITH A WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT BECOMING SITUATED 
OVER NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. NAM AND GFS MODELS REVEAL SOME 
DISCREPANCIES WITH THE AMOUNT OF RAINFALL EXPECTED THURSDAY NIGHT 
AND FRIDAY...AND WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE PERIOD 
SINCE UPPER DYNAMICS SHOULD BE WEAK. INSTABILITY WILL ALSO REMAIN 
WEAK THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...SO EXPECT MAINLY JUST LIGHT SCATTERED 
SHOWERS. 

INSTABILITY BEGINS TO INCREASE THIS WEEKEND AS A BERMUDA HIGH SETS 
UP OVER THE SOUTHEAST BRINGING A MORE TYPICAL SUMMERTIME PATTERN. 
THUS...EXPECT ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION THIS WEEKEND THROUGH 
THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
HOURS. A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA ON 
TUESDAY...BUT SHOULD BECOME STATIONARY OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AS 
THE UPPER FLOW REMAINS ZONAL. AS FOR TEMPS...A WARMING TREND BACK TO 
MORE SEASONAL LEVELS WILL DEVELOP BY THIS WEEKEND...WITHOUT MUCH 
CHANGE EXPECTED THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AREA RADARS SHOW PRECIP SHIELD 
WHICH HAS PERSISTED OVER THE SOUTHEAST CONUS THE PAST FEW DAYS HAS 
FINALLY INVADED OUR SOUTHERN TIER AS UPPER TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS 
SLOWLY PROGRESSES EASTWARD. ANTICIPATE THAT THIS AREA OF PRECIP WILL 
CONTINUE TO SLOWLY SPREAD NORTHWARD THROUGH THE FIRST PERIOD. 
HOWEVER...DOWNSLOPE FLOW WILL TEND TO INHIBIT THIS PROGRESSION 
THROUGH THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEYS. NEVERTHELESS...STILL HAVE 
OPTED TO GO WITH CATEGORICAL POPS AS MID-LEVEL LIFT APPEARS STRONG 
ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THE DOWNSLOPE INHIBITION OF PRECIP. ALSO WENT 
CATEGORICAL POPS FOR THE SECOND PERIOD AS AXIS OF UPPER TROUGH 
APPROACHES THE AREA. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FAVORED A BLEND ALTHOUGH 
TEMPS WILL BE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON RATE OF PROGRESSION OF PRECIP 
NORTHWARD THROUGH THE FIRST PERIOD.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER 
LOWER MISS VALLEY REGION TODAY MOVES EVER SO SLOWLY ENE...AND 
CREATES A LENGTHY PERIOD OF MOSTLY SHOWERS FOR THE TN VALLEY AND SRN 
APPALACHIANS.  LOCATION OF THE TROUGH ON THURSDAY JUSTIFIED RAISING 
POPS TO LIKELY...AND ALSO NUDGED UP TO GOOD CHANCE POPS RIGHT 
THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY.  HOWEVER...THE FORCING DOES NOT 
LOOK STRONG AND INSTABILITY IS QUITE LIMITED...SO THE THREAT OF ANY 
THUNDERSTORMS IS VERY MINIMAL UNTIL THE WEEKEND.  FEEL THAT COVERAGE 
OF SHOWERS WILL DROP CONSIDERABLY BY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...AS 
RIDGING ALOFT SHOULD PROVIDE WARMING AND AT LEAST A WEAK CAP.  THIS 
MAKES BOTH THE GFS AND DGEX LOOK A BIT SUSPECT TO ME IN SHOWING SUCH 
WIDESPREAD PCPN EVEN ON THE WEEKEND.  MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW MODERATE 
CAPE WITH SOME LINGERING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND MAX TEMPS TOPPING 
OUT NEAR CLIMO FOR A CHANGE...SO FELT BEST BET WAS TO STICK WITH OUR 
20-30 PERCENT POPS FOR NOW FOR SAT AND SUN.

OTHERWISE...JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO MAX/MIN TEMPS...AND ALSO SOME 
PRELIMINARY GRIDS MADE FOR THE NEW DAY 7 (WEDNESDAY).

AREA RADARS SHOW A BROAD SWATH OF PRECIPITATION MOVING NORTHWARD 
EVER SO SLOWLY. WHEN WALKED IN THE DOOR THIS AFTERNOON LINE OF 
PRECIP JUST APPROACHING ROME GEORGIA. AT THIS HOUR...PRECIP JUST A 
FEW MILES NORTH OF ROME. LAPS ANALYSIS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
SHOWED ONLY MARGINAL INSTABILITY ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE WHERE 
SOME LIGHT SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED. 1000-700MB MEAN FLOW INDICATES 
SHOWERS THAT DEVELOP WILL MOVE TO THE NORTHWEST AT 15 TO 20 KTS. 

FOR THE UPDATE THIS EVENING...HAVE TWEAKED THE POP GRIDS SLIGHTLY TO 
ACCOUNT FOR CURRENT TRENDS. HAVE ADDED SOME POPS TO THE MOUNTAIN 
GROUPS OF TN TO ACCOUNT FOR UPSLOPE GENERATED SHOWERS ON THE NC SIDE 
OF THE MOUNTAINS. BUT THESE SHOWERS SHOULD NOT LAST DOWN INTO THE

MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE IN SURGING MOISTURE NORTH ACROSS THE AREA. 
THINK NAM IS OVERDONE...AND GIVEN RECENT HISTORY OF MODELS OVERDOING 
PRECIP...WILL GO CLOSER TO THE MAV POPS.  ALSO...SHOULD SEE DECENT

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A GENERALLY DRY DAY IN STORE AS 
UPPER LEVEL CONVERGENCE SUPPRESS ANY PRECIP THROUGH THE FIRST 
PERIOD. A WEAK SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM APPROACHES FROM THE SOUTHWEST 
BY THE SECOND PERIOD. SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES BECOME APPARENT WITH 
THE ONSET OF PRECIP WITH THE SHORT-RANGE ENSEMBLES THE FASTEST AND 
THE 00Z NAM THE SLOWEST. GFS REPRESENTS A GOOD COMPROMISE AND IS 
SUPPORTED BY THE CANADIAN GEM...THUS IS THE PREFERRED SOLUTION AT 
THIS TIME. POPS SLOWLY INCREASE TO LIKELY CATEGORY IN THE SOUTHERN 
TIER BY LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD. HOWEVER...ANTICIPATE FAR NORTHERN 
TIER TO REMAIN DRY THROUGH THE FIRST TWO PERIODS AS PRECIP ONLY 
SLOWLY OVERSPREAD THE AREA. FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE VALUES ARE 
GENERALLY CLOSE AND APPEAR REASONABLE. TENDED TO SLIGHTLY FAVOR GFS 
GUIDANCE WHERE DIFFERENCES EXIST BASED ON THAT BEING THE PREFERRED 
SOLUTION.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...THE WEAK UPPER TROUGH IN 
THE SRN STREAM WILL BE A SLOW MOVER AND AFFECT THE EARLY PERIODS OF 
THE LONG TERM...LIKELY WELL INTO FRIDAY.  THIS SYSTEM LOOKS TO KEEP 
OUR AREA UNDER ABUNDANT CLOUDINESS WITH VERY COOL AND PLEASANT HIGH 
TEMPS EACH DAY.  THE AIRMASS LOOKS TO BE SO STABLE THAT I SERIOUSLY 
DOUBT IF THUNDERSTORMS CAN POSSIBLY DEVELOP UNTIL THE WEEKEND...WHEN
WARMER TEMPS AND AT LEAST PARTIAL SUNSHINE ACTUALLY CREATE SOME 
INSTABILITY IN THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING PERIODS.  

CHANGES MADE IN THE GRIDS WERE TO SLOW DOWN THE ARRIVAL OF LIKELY 
POPS FOR SWRN VA AND NE TN UNTIL WEDNESDAY NIGHT...DOWNPLAYED 
THUNDERSTORM PROSPECTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ACTUALLY 
DROPPING...AND RAISED POPS OVERALL FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY 
NIGHT.  BRIEF UPPER LEVEL RIDGING BY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...BUT STILL 
BOTH GFS AND DGEX BRING MORE SHOWERS AND STORMS...WHICH SEEMED A BIT 
SUSPECT TO ME (SO NO WEATHER OR POP ADJUSTMENTS MADE FOR THE WEEKEND 
PERIODS JUST YET).  FOR TEMPS...NOTICED THAT OUR MAX TEMPS WERE 
CONSIDERABLY WARMER THAN NEIGHBORS FOR THURSDAY MAXES...SO LOWERED 
HIGHS THURSDAY SIGNIFICANTLY CONSIDERING THE CLOUDINESS AND EXPECTED 
PCPN.  A FEW PRELIMINARY GRIDS ALSO MADE FOR THE NEW DAY 7 (TUESDAY).

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...TOUGH FORECAST IN THE SHORT 
TERM AS WE HAVE A FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO OUR SOUTH OVER THE GULF 
STATES...AN UPPER TROUGH OVER EAST TEXAS AND A SHORT WAVE SINKING 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY.  LOW CLOUDS (AND EARLIER SOME 
LIGHT RAIN) HAVE PUSHED UP INTO THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE AREA...AND 
HOW FAR NORTH THESE CLOUDS WILL MAKE IT IS PROBLEMATIC.  LOOKS LIKE 
SHORT WAVE TO OUR NORTH SHOULD KEEP THE BULK OF ITS ENERGY TO OUR 
NORTH AND EAST...SO EXPECT LITTLE MORE THAN SOME CLOUDS IN THE NORTH 
FROM THIS FEATURE TONIGHT.  SHORT WAVE ENERGY EJECTING FROM TX 
TROUGH MAY BE A PLAYER TOMORROW...BUT THINK GFS DETAILS LOOK SUSPECT 
IN BRINGING SURGE OF MOISTURE AND LIFT NORTH SO QUICKLY...SO PLAN TO 
GO CLOSER TO THE SLOWER NAM.  UPSHOT IS WILL GO WITH QUITE A BIT OF 
CLOUDINESS SOUTH...AND HIGHER POPS...BUT NO HIGHER THAN CHANCE.  
WILL GO WITH LESS CLOUDS NORTH...AND DRY TONIGHT...THEN SLIGHT 
CHANCE TOMORROW AFTERNOON AS THERE MAY BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR A 
SHOWER/TSTM.   

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...WARM FRONT/SURFACE LOW 
PUSHING UP FROM SOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY.  ETA A LITTLE 
SLOWER THAN GFS ON BRINGING DEEPER MOISTURE INTO CWA...WENT WITH A 
BLEND ON TIMING AND KEPT THE LIKELY POPS IN THE SOUTH AND CHANCE 
POPS IN THE NORTH FOR TUESDAY NIGHT.  BOTH MODELS SHOWING DEEP  
MOISTURE ACROSS REGION AS SURFACE LOW AND WARM FRONT TRACKS INTO 
REGION ON WEDNESDAY...SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH COVERAGE FOR LIKELY POPS  
ON WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  NOT MUCH INSTABILITY EXPECTED ON 
WEDNESDAY...THINK IT SHOULD BE MAINLY SHOWERS AND JUST ISOLATED 
THUNDER ON WEDNESDAY.  MOISTURE LINGERING INTO THURSDAY AS UPPER 
TROUGH PASSES...KEPT 50 POPS FOR THURSDAY.  SHORTWAVE ROTATES 
THROUGH ON FRIDAY...MOISTURE LIMITED SO KEPT ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A TOUGH FORECAST TO PIN DOWN 
THIS MORNING AS ONLY LIGHT RAIN HAS PUSHED AS FAR NORTH AS EXTREME 
SE TN AND SW NC SO FAR.  MAIN WEATHER FEATURES LOOK TO BE THE UPPER 
TROUGH OVER TX AND FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES.  
ANALYSIS OF UPPER AIR PLOTS REVEALS ISENTROPIC LIFT AS THE MOST 
LIKELY FORM OF LIFT THIS MORNING...BUT THIS LIFT DOES NOT HOLD FOR 
MUCH BEYOND THE MORNING HOURS CAUSING SOME UNCERTAINTY FOR LATER 
TODAY.  OF COURSE...NEW CONVECTIVE PCPN WILL DEVELOP TO OUR SOUTH 
LATER TODAY...AND I DID INCLUDE A MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS FOR OUR 
FORECAST AREA.  OTHERWISE...THINKING WAS LIGHT RAIN AS PCPN TYPE 
THIS MORNING AND KEPT THE VERY LOW POPS NORTH TO LIKELY FOR SE TN 
AND SW NC.  SOME INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...ALTHO 
LOOKS TO BE ANOTHER COOL DAY (NOTING THAT HIGHS SUNDAY ENDED UP EVEN 
COOLER THAN THE COOLEST MAV MOS).  CHANGED PCPN TYPE TO SHOWERS AND 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

SHORT RANGE MODELS SEEM IN AGREEMENT ON THE MAIN NORTHWARD PUSH OF 
SHOWERS AND FEW THUNDERSTORMS NOT UNTIL TUESDAY AND/OR TUESDAY NIGHT.
POP GRIDS TONIGHT GENERALLY REFLECT A DECREASING TREND FROM NEAR AND 
AFTER 06Z TUESDAY UNTIL AN INCREASING TREND FOR LATER TUESDAY.  

FOR TEMPS...LESSON LEARNED FROM YESTERDAY LED ME TO GO WITH OR TO 
UNDERCUT THE COOLER MAV MOS HIGHS.  THE MOS BLEND FOR MINS TONIGHT 
LOOKED FINE.  POPS WERE DRAWN VERY CLOSE TO MOS BLEND...FROM LIKELY 
SOUTH TO 20 PERCENT OR LESS NORTH TODAY...THEN A BIT BELOW THE MOS 
BLEND FOR TONIGHT TO MESH WITH NEIGHBORS GRIDS AND ALLOW FOR SOME 
UNCERTAINTY.  


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...BIG CHANGES...OR NOT? 
TOUGHEST DECISION IN A LONG TIME. MODELS FIRST FLIP FLOP, BUT AT 
LEAST TOGETHER. THEN THEY DIFFER BY 180 DEGREES. NOW WHAT? BEST 
DECISION IN MY MIND IS TO GO WITH CONTINUITY TO SOME DEGREE WITH 
SOME TWEAKS. TUESDAY NIGHT HAVE MAINTAINED POPS BUT TAKEN THUNDER 
OUT OF NORTHEASTERN PORTIONS OF AREA. WEDNESDAY SHOWS QUITE AMPLE 
RAINFALL OVER AREA, SO UPPED POPS TO BE IN LINE WITH SURROUNDING 
OFFICES, AS WE WERE WAY LOW. THIS SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED OUT GOOD. 
HOWEVER, ON WEDNESDAY INSTABILITY VERY LOW WITH LIS AROUND +6 OR 
HIGHER AND CAPES ARE JUST SILLY, SO TOOK THUNDER OUT ALTOGETHER ON 
WED. ALSO ADJUSTED MAX/MIN TEMPS TO ACCOUNT FOR MORE CLOUDS...LOWER 
DURING DAY, SLIGHTLY HIGHER AT NIGHT.

930 PM EDT SUN MAY 29 2005

.DISCUSSION...01Z SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS MESO-HIGH MOVING OFF TO THE 
EAST OF MY FORECAST AREA. WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF A PRESSURE 
GRADIENT...VALLEY WINDS HAVE GONE CALM MOST LOCATIONS. ONLY TYS AND 
OQT HAVE A 3 KNOT WIND. CLOUD COVER REMAINS IN PLACE OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA AS EVIDENT BY IR IMAGERY. SEVERAL COMPLEXES OF SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH...BUT ONCE THEY 
MOVE NORTH OF BIRMINGHAM AL THEY START TO FALL APART IN THE MORE 
STABLE AIRMASS. KHTX RADAR SHOWS ONLY A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN FORECAST AREA AT THIS TIME WITH A WEAKENING LINE OF -SHRA 
MOVING INTO NORTHWESTERN GEORGIA. 

.UPDATE...NAM AND GFS CONTINUE TO BE IN SOME DISAGREEMENT ABOUT 
FUTURE EVOLUTION OF THE FORECAST OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. GFS HAS A 
BETTER HANDLE OF WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW...SO WILL GIVE A LITTLE 
MORE WEIGHT TO THE GFS. BOTH THE GFS AND NAM INDICATE AN AREA OF 
WEAK MOIST ISENTROPIC LIFT ON THE 300K SURFACE BETWEEN 06 AND 12Z 
ACROSS MY SOUTHERN CWA. CONSIDERING THIS AND LIGHT SHOWERS ALREADY 
IN PLACE TO THE WEST...WILL GO AHEAD AND RAISE POPS TO CATEGORICAL 
BY 09Z ACROSS MY SOUTHERN COUNTIES. WILL KEEP THE POP LAYOUT THE 
SAME ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. IT IS GOING TO BE 
VERY HARD TO SEE ANY PRECIPITATION ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SW VA 
OVERNIGHT WITH THE DRY AND STABLE AIRMASS...BUT A SLIGHT CHANCE  
EXISTS OF SEEING A STRAY SHOWER MOVE THAT WAY BY DAYBREAK...SO WILL 
LEAVE POPS IN. 

HAVE ALSO LOWERED MINS A COUPLE OF DEGREES AT CHA DUE TO 
TEMPERATURES ALREADY INTO THE LOW 60S THERE. CURRENT OBS FROM 
SURROUNDING AWS SITES IN THE CHATTANOOGA VICINITY ARE NEAR 60 AS OF 
9PM EDT...SO THINKING UPPER 50S SHOULD BE BEST AS LITTLE ADDITIONAL 
COOLING SHOULD TAKE PLACE. HAVE ALSO MODIFIED THE HOURLY TEMP GRIDS 
TO REFLECT EXPECTED TEMP FALLS OVERNIGHT. 

WILL MAKE CHANGES TO ZFP AND REMOVE ANY EVENING AND OVERNIGHT

.SHORT TERM...MODELS COMING INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH REGARDS TO 
SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE. THIS FEATURE WILL BE OVR TX MON AND MOVE 
SLOWLY ENE AND INTO THE TN RVR VLY BY TUE NGT. LGT PCPN CHC 
INCREASES TONIGHT WITH CONTINUED WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT. RELATIVELY
DRY INITIAL CONDITIONS IN LLVL RIDGE BEGINNING TO ERODE. ELEVATED 
WARMING MOVES N THROUGH MRX CWA THROUGH MON BUT GOOD SFC DP BOUNDARY 
STAYS SOUTH OF SE TN BORDER. SFC WAVE ASSOCIATED WITH UPR SHORT WAVE 
APPROACHES THE AREA ALONG THIS SFC FRONTAL BOUNDARY THROUGH TUES 
NGT. SIMILAR TO TDY EXPECT MAJORITY OF CONVECTION TO STAY S OF MRX 
ON MON WITH THE BULK OF RAINFALL ALONG AND SOUTH OF KNOXVILLE. NE TN 
SHOULD BE THE WARM SPOT ACROSS THE AREA. THIS TREND CONTINUES INTO 
TUE WITH A GOOD CHC FOR CONVECTIVE COMPLEX WORKING INTO THE AREA ON 
TUE NGT AS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SWINGS IN. MODEL TEMPS CLOSE THROUGH 
PERIOD AND WITH DECREASED DIURNAL RANGE DUE TO CLOUD COVER.

.LONG TERM....(WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS PUSHING SURFACE 
LOW AND WARM FRONT INTO THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY...WITH AMPLE 
MOISTURE AVAILABLE...KEPT CHANCE POPS GOING FOR WEDNESDAY.  SURFACE 
LOW TRACKS SLOWLY EAST OVER OUR AREA THROUGH MIDWEEK.  KEPT CHANCE 
POPS GOING FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.  A SHORTWAVE ROTATES THROUGH 
ON FRIDAY...MOISTURE LIMITED SO KEPT ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR 
FRIDAY. ANOTHER FRONT PUSHING INTO REGION FOR THE WEEKEND...SHOULD 
HAVE ADEQUATE MOISTURE FOR SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
ON SATURDAY.  MOISTURE A LITTLE MORE LIMITED ON SUNDAY...SO ONLY 
WENT WITH 20 POPS FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...500 MB TROUGH AXIS EXTENDS FROM 
THE OHIO VALLEY SOUTH INTO THE MID MISS VALLEY REGION THIS MORNING.  
SURFACE TO 850 MB ANALYSIS DOES NOT SHOW AS SIGNIFICANT OF A COLD 
FRONT AS YESTERDAY...ALTHO WELL NOTED NW TO SE DIFFERENCE IN DEW 
POINT TEMPERATURES ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA (MID TO UPR 40S NW TO 
UPR 50S SE).  SEEMS THAT THE BEST UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT IS OVER THE 
OHIO VALLEY (AND MAY BRUSH SW VA AND NE TN)...WHILE THE BEST 
INSTABILITY IS GENERALLY FROM THE GULF COAST STATES INTO SE TN AND 
SW NC TODAY.  MOISTURE AND CLOUDS ON THE INCREASE AT THIS 
TIME...ALTHO LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS A BIT LACKING.

STAYED QUITE CLOSE TO PREVIOUS POPS IN THE ZFP AND GRIDS...BUT DID 
ADJUST POPS UP SOME THIS MORNING TO BETTER MESH WITH RADAR TRENDS.
CHOSE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS FOR SE TN...AND 
MAINLY A CHANCE OF SHOWERS ELSEWHERE EARLY TODAY.  DONT SEE HOW CHA 
COULD GET ANYWHERE NEAR 87 DEGREES FOR MAX TEMP...FAVORING THE MUCH 
COOLER MAV MOS FOR HIGHS TODAY GIVEN THE INCREASE IN CLOUDS AND 
HIGHER RAIN CHANCES.

FOR TONIGHT...DONT SEE MUCH THREAT OF CONVECTIVE PCPN BEYOND THE 
EVENING HOURS...WITH JUST A MINOR TWEAK OR TWO FROM PREVIOUS 
SKY/POP/WX GRIDS.   


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MAIN PROBLEM IS WHAT TO DO 
ABOUT LATE SUNDAY NIGHT...MEMORIAL DAY...INTO EARLY TUESDAY. SOME 
FLIP-FLOPPING OF MODELS ON THE HOLIDAY. COMPLICATED PATTERN, YET 
MAINLY ZONAL UPPER FLOW DURING PERIOD. FRONTAL ZONE APPROACHING AREA 
MONDAY WITH WEAK TO MODERATE INSTABILITY AND ADEQUATE MOISTURE. K 
INDICES ARE SO-SO LATE MONDAY. ALL ELEMENTS SEEM JUST ENOUGH OUT OF 
SYNC TO KEEP US SEVERE TSTM FREE. HAVE INCREASED POPS DRAMATICALLY 
IN THE MOUNTAINS DURING BBQ TIME ON MONDAY, AND KEPT THEM HIGHER 
INTO MONDAY NIGHT-EARLY TUESDAY. SAME IS TRUE FOR THE WHOLE AREA, 
THOUGH NOT AS DRAMATICALLY. HAVE ALSO INCREASED MIN TEMPS SLIGHTLY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT) VISIBLE SATELLITE 
IMAGERY SHOWS CUMULUS DEVELOPING ACROSS THE CWA. MOST DEVELOPMENT 
SEEN OVER SW VA AT THIS TIME. RADAR IMAGERY FROM KJKL SHOWS A FEW 
SHOWERS DEVELOPING IN SOUTHEASTERN KENTUCKY. KMRX RADAR AT THIS TIME 
SHOWING ONLY A COUPLE OF WEAK RETURNS TO THE NORTH OF MY CWA. MSAS 
ANALYSIS HAS THETA-E RIDGE STILL IN PLACE OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF 
THE FORECAST AREA AND MAY SEE A BRIEF SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM DEVELOP 
LATER IN THE AFTERNOON. WILL LEAVE IN A MENTION OF A SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORM IN THE EVENING HOURS OF THE FORECAST.

MODELS IN BETTER AGREEMENT TODAY THAN YESTERDAY WITH BOTH NAM AND 
GFS SHOWING A SHORTWAVE MOVING INTO THE REGION EARLY SATURDAY 
MORNING AND THROUGH THE AFTERNOON HOURS. GFS MAINTAINS MCS-LIKE 
FEATURE FROM YESTERDAY JUST SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTH OF ITS PREDICTED 
POSITION 24 HOURS AGO. HOWEVER...THE GFS HAS BACKED OFF OF THE 
INTENSITY OF THIS SYSTEM. THE NAM IS NOW FALLING MORE IN LINE WITH 
THE GFS IN BRINGING A LINE OF CONVECTION INTO MY FORECAST AREA ON 
SATURDAY. THE NAM IS RUNNING ABOUT 6 HOURS SLOWER THAN THE GFS IN 
THE FIRST TWO PERIODS. HOWEVER...CONFIDENCE HAS INCREASED THIS 
FORECAST CYCLE AND WILL THEREFORE BE ABLE TO GO WITH SOME HIGHER 
POPS.

TONIGHT...WILL HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF -TSRA IN THE FORECAST UNTIL 
00Z TONIGHT TO ALLOW FOR ANY AFTERNOON CONVECTION THAT MAY DEVELOP. 
COVERAGE IS EXPECTED TO BE ISOLATED AT BEST. AREAS IN SW VA AND 
MOUNTAINS OF NE TN APPEAR TO HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF SEEING ONE OF 
THESE SHOWERS OR THUNDERSTORMS. GUIDANCE WAS AGAIN WARM AT TRI AND 
CHA BUT A LITTLE COOL AT TYS AND OQT LAST NIGHT. CONSIDERING 
MOISTURE MOVING IN DURING THE NIGHT FROM THE SOUTHWEST...WILL FOLLOW 
THE WARMER MAV NUMBERS A LITTLE CLOSER TONIGHT AND GENERALLY COME IN 
ONE DEGREE COOLER THAN THE MAV. CLOUDS SHOULD START TO BUILD IN 
AFTER 03Z THIS EVENING SW TO NE. WILL START SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
ACROSS WESTERN SECTIONS AT 00Z AND INCREASE TO CHANCE BY 06Z ALMOST 
ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. TIMING DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE GFS AND NAM 
PREVENT GOING HIGHER THAN 40 PERCENT ANYWHERE OVERNIGHT...AND FEEL 
GREATEST CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION WILL BE AFTER 06Z.

SATURDAY...GFS INDICATES ONGOING CONVECTION IN THE FORECAST AREA BY 
DAYBREAK WHILE NAM IS JUST BRINGING IN PRECIPITATION TO OUR WESTERN 
COUNTIES. HAVE SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE ON THE TWO MODELS IN TIMING OF 
THIS SYSTEM WITH THE GREATEST CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION FALLING 
BETWEEN 12Z AND 18Z. CONFIDENCE HIGH ENOUGH AT THIS POINT TO GO WITH 
50 POPS CENTRAL AND SOUTH AND LIKELY POPS NORTH. IT SHOULD BE NOTED 
THAT MET GUIDANCE IS A GOOD 20 PERCENT HIGHER THAN MAV GUIDANCE. I 
FELT IT BEST TO STAY CLOSER TO THE MAV GUIDANCE AS IT HAS BEEN A 
LITTLE MORE CONSISTENT OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS WITH THIS 
FEATURE. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A LITTLE SUPPRESSED DUE TO ALL THE 
CLOUD COVER AND TSRA ACTIVITY. STAYED CLOSE TO THE WARMER MAV 
NUMBERS AGAIN IN THIS SITUATION. SPC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE AREA JUST 
TO MY EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS IN A SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE WEATHER  
AND KEPT MY FORECAST AREA IN A GENERAL THUNDERSTORM SECTION. AGREE 
WITH THIS DECISION AS BEST INSTABILITY WILL BE EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS 
WHERE MORE HEATING CAN TAKE PLACE. STILL...THERE COULD BE AN 
ISOLATED STRONG THUNDERSTORM MOVE THROUGH TOMORROW AFTERNOON WITH 
THE MAIN THREATS BEING HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS. 

SATURDAY NIGHT...PRECIPITATION ENDS QUICKLY WEST TO EAST AS 
SHORTWAVE KICKS OUT WITH A WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE MOVING IN. 
BOTH NAM AND GFS AGREE PRECIP SHOULD END SHORTLY AFTER 00Z. WILL 
HAVE AREA PARTLY CLOUDY AND PRECIP FREE IN THE FORECAST BY 06Z. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT 
AND TOOK A BLEND OF THE MET AND MAV GUIDANCE AS THE MAV HAS BEEN TO 
WARM DURING RADIATIONAL COOLING NIGHTS.

SUNDAY...HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL FOR THE DAY...BUT EXPECT A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF -TSRA OVER THE PLATEAU...NE TN AND SW VA AS THE NAM AND 
GFS PROG AN AREA OF MOISTURE TO MOVE OVERHEAD. WITH PLENTY OF 
HEATING EXPECTED...CANT RULE OUT A STRAY SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM...BUT EXPECT MOST OF THE AREA TO REMAIN DRY ON SUNDAY. 
TEMPERATURES WARM BACK TO NEAR NORMAL WITH HIGHS IN THE MID 80S 
SOUTH TO UPPER 70S NORTH. THIS IS A BLEND OF THE GUIDANCE.

SUNDAY NIGHT...WE WILL NOW BEGIN TO ENTER A VERY UNSETTLED PERIOD 
WITH THE GFS SENDING SEVERAL PIECES OF ENERGY TOWARD THE FORECAST 
AREA. GFS AND NAM BOTH HAVE A STORM SYSTEM ON OUR DOORSTEP BY 
DAYBREAK MONDAY AND HAVE RAISED POPS OVERNIGHT TO 40 SOUTH AND 30 
NORTH TO ACCOUNT FOR THE APPROACH OF THIS SYSTEM. WITH WARM 
SOUTHERLY FLOW...HAVE STUCK CLOSE TO THE WARMER MAV NUMBERS FOR 
TEMPERATURES SUNDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS BRINGING A SURFACE LOW 
INTO REGION ON MONDAY.  WENT WITH THE SLOWER DGEX AND HELD OFF BEST 
POPS UNTIL MONDAY AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT.  WITH AMPLE MOISTURE 
ADVECTING IN...WENT WITH HIGH CHANCE POPS.  HELD OFF ON LIKELY POPS 
SINCE MODELS STILL SHOWING SOME TIMING ISSUES.  DRIER WEATHER 
PUSHING IN TUESDAY...BUT WITH SOME RESIDUAL MOISTURE LINGERING...  
KEPT CHANCE POPS INTO TUESDAY.  PRECIP SHOULD BE ENDING TUESDAY 
NIGHT AND DRY WEATHER CONTINUING INTO WEDNESDAY.  MODELS INDICATING 
A SHORTWAVE APPROACHING WEDNESDAY NIGHT ALONG WITH THE RETURN OF 
MOISTURE...KEPT LOW CHANCE POPS FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY 
NIGHT AS TROUGH PASSES.  DRIER WEATHER RETURNS FRIDAY...BUT KEPT LOW 
POPS INTO FRIDAY WITH MODELS INDICATING ANOTHER SHORTWAVE MOVING 
THROUGH.

1001 AM EDT FRI MAY 27 2005

.DISCUSSION...FRONTAL BOUNDARY HARD TO FIND THIS MORNING. LEE 
TROFING PRESENT FROM CENTRAL VIRGINIA SOUTHWEST INTO CENTRAL 
GEORGIA. A WEAK DEWPOINT GRADIENT EXISTS ACROSS THE CENTRAL OHIO 
VALLEY ON 12Z SURFACE ANALYSIS. SATELLITE IMAGES SHOWS A LINE OF 
CLOUDS MOVING THROUGH MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND EASTERN KENTUCKY. THIS IS 
MOST LIKELY THE LOCATION OF THE FRONT AS MSAS HAS LARGEST GRADIENT 
OF THETA-E IN THIS LOCATION. 

AS PREVIOUS FORECASTER NOTED...NOT TO EXCITED ABOUT PRECIPITATION 
CHANCES TODAY...ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BOTH NAM AND GFS 
INDICATE A THETA-E RIDGE AT 850MB PERSISTING OVER THE MOUNTAIN 
COUNTIES IN TN AND NC THROUGH 21Z TODAY. THETA-E ADVECTION BECOMES 
STRONGLY NEGATIVE WEST TO EAST BETWEEN 15Z AND 21Z THUS HELPING TO 
LIMIT CONVECTION. 

POPS ARE ALREADY IN THE FORECAST AND WITH A GOOD WARMUP IN 
STORE...PREFER TO KEEP CURRENT POPS. BEST FORCING IN THE TN 
AND NC MOUNTAINS WHERE GREATEST INSTABILITY WILL EXIST THE LONGEST. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS HAVE VERY HIGH LCL HEIGHTS (800 MB AND ABOVE) DUE TO 
RELATIVELY DRY BOUNDARY LAYER. THIS WILL HELP PRECLUDE STORM 
DEVELOPMENT IN THE VALLEY LOCATIONS. ANY THUNDERSTORMS THAT DO 
DEVELOP ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA COULD POSSIBLY PUT DOWN SOME SMALL 
HAIL DUE TO COLD TEMPERATURES ALOFT...BUT THIS WOULD REQUIRE A GOOD 
SIZE THUNDERSTORM.  

FOR THE UPDATE...WILL REMOVE MORNING AND AFTERNOON WORDING AND TWEAK 
TEMPERATURES JUST A COUPLE OF DEGREES UPWARD WHERE A FEW SITES ARE 
COMING IN A LITTLE WARMER THAN CURRENT DIURNAL TRACE. GRIDDED AND 
ZFP PRODUCTS OUT SHORTLY.

HAVE A GREAT DAY

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
330 AM EDT FRI MAY 27 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HARD TO GET VERY EXCITED ABOUT 
RAIN CHANCES TODAY...WITH JUST ISOLATED COVERAGE LOOKING GOOD.  THE 
WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY DOES SHOW UP ON SURFACE AND 850 MB 
ANALYSIS...AND MAY VERY WELL LIE JUST ABOUT WHERE SOME VERY WEAK AND 
SPOTTY SHOWERS WERE NOTED FROM ERN KY SOUTH INTO MIDDLE TN.  OTHER 
THAN THIS BOUNDARY...TERRAIN SHOULD BE ANOTHER WEAK FOCUS DURING 
PEAK HEATING.  I GENERALLY LIKED AND ONLY SLIGHTLY MODIFED THE 
PREVIOUS 15-20% POPS IN THE GRIDS FOR TODAY...CHANGING TO SHOWERS 
FOR TYPE THIS MORNING WITH LITTLE INSTABILITY.  MOISTURE IS VERY 
LIMITED AND SOUNDINGS SHOWED A WEAK CAP AROUND 600 MB LEVEL...MORE 
REASONS NOT TO CARRY POPS MUCH ABOVE 20% POPS FOR TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...THE RIDGING ALOFT HAS WEAKENED CONSISDERABLY AND OPENS 
THE DOOR FOR SOME POSSIBLE LATE NIGHT MCS ACTIVITY...TO BRUSH AT 
LEAST THE WRN AND NRN ZONES.  THIS SEEMS STILL A BIT UNCERTAIN FOR 
NOW...SO DONT SEE THE NEED FOR MORE THAN CHANCE POPS.  

OTHERWISE...ALLOWED FOR TEMPS TO WARM A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE THU MAXES
FOR HIGHS TODAY...THEN THE MOS BLEND WAS QUITE CLOSE AND ACCEPTABLE 
FOR MINS TONIGHT.  


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...NO CHANGES TO LONGER TERM 
FORECAST. REALLY THE ONLY CHANGE WAS TO THE POPS FOR MEMORIAL DAY. 
WITH ELONGATING, SLOWING FRONT IN VICINITY, BROAD AREA OF MID-LEVEL 
LIFT, AND ADEQUATE MOISTURE (ESPECIALLY TOWARD LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY 
EVENING), FELT THAT INCREASING POPS SLIGHTLY (WITHIN CHANCE CAT) 
WAS CALLED FOR.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK AND DIFFUSE COLD FRONT 
STRETCHING FROM NEAR DETROIT SOUTHWEST TO NEAR MEMPHIS. SATELLITE 
IMAGES REVEAL ONLY A FEW HIGH CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FRONT... 
AND AREA RADARS ARE DEVOID OF ANY PRECIP ALONG IT. THIS COLD FRONT 
IS PROGGED TO APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA AROUND SUNRISE...BUT WITH 
LIMITED MOISTURE AND THE MAIN UPPER DYNAMICS REMAINING NORTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA...THINK THAT IT WILL REMAIN DRY EVERYWHERE OVERNIGHT. 
THUS...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THIS EVENING TO REMOVE THE MENTION OF

250 PM EDT THU MAY 26 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS AND SATELLITE IMAGE SHOWS MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY 
CONDITIONS PREVAILING ACROSS THE CWA TODAY. TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED 
INTO THE MID 70S SOUTH TO LOW 70S NORTH. DEWPOINTS ARE BEGINNING TO 
APPROACH THE 50 DEGREE MARK. TO THE NORTHWEST...A WEAK FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY IS EVIDENT STRETCHING FROM CENTRAL MICHIGAN SOUTHWESTWARD 
TOWARD THE OZARKS OF MISSOURI. AIRMASS BEHIND THE FRONT IS NOT MUCH 
DIFFERENT THAT CURRENT AIRMASS WE HAVE IN PLACE...SO WHEN THIS WEAK 
FRONT PASSES LATER TOMORROW...DONT EXPECT MUCH OF A CHANGE IN THE 
OVERALL AIRMASS.

FOR THE FIRST 24 HOURS OF THE FORECAST MODELS REMAIN IN DECENT 
AGREEMENT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED FRONT THROUGH THE 
CWA BETWEEN 12 AND 18Z ON FRIDAY. BOTH NAM AND GFS SHOW A MOISTURE 
SURGE AROUND THAT TIME. MOISTURE TRANSPORT VECTORS SHOW GREATEST 
INFLUX OF MOISTURE IN THE 925-850MB LAYER TO BE BETWEEN 09 AND 15Z 
TOMORROW. IT IS AT THIS POINT THAT WILL INTRODUCE POPS INTO THE 
FORECAST. AS FRONT IS VERY WEAK WITH LITTLE OR NO LIFT ASSOCIATED 
WITH IT...WILL ONLY PAINT POPS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. OTHER 
CONCERN WILL BE THE MINIMUM TEMPERATURE FORECAST. MODELS INDICATE 
DEWPOINTS MAY RISE SLIGHTLY OVERNIGHT IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT. CLOUD 
COVER WILL ALSO BE ON THE INCREASE. CLIMATOLOGY SHOWS MINS OCCUR 
AROUND 10Z HERE...JUST AT OR AFTER LOW LEVEL CLOUD COVER SHOULD 
ARRIVE. BOTH MET AND MAV GUIDANCE HAS HAD A WARM BIAS OVER THE LAST 
COUPLE OF DAYS AND WILL THUS CONTINUE TO GO A COUPLE OF DEGREES 
BELOW GUIDANCE ON MIN TEMPS TONIGHT. HAVE ADJUSTED HOURLY TEMP GRIDS 
TO INDICATE A STEEPER RISE IN TEMPERATURES AFTER 10Z THAN USUAL.

FRIDAY...WILL HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS MOST LOCATIONS EXCEPT THE 
TN/NC MOUNTAINS WHERE CHANCE POPS WILL BE PLACED. WITH DECENT 
HEATING EXPECTED AND COLD TEMPERATURES ALOFT (FREEZING LEVEL FALLS 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY TO A MIN VALUE OF 9500 FEET OVER OUR VA COUNTIES) 
I CANNOT RULE OUT AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM. AS AIRMASS DOES NOT 
CHANGE MUCH BEHIND THE FRONT...WILL FOLLOW MAV GUIDANCE CLOSELY HERE 
AS IT HAS PERFORMED BETTER ON MAX TEMPS.

FRIDAY NIGHT...FORECAST CONFIDENCE STARTS TO LESSEN HERE. WIDELY 
DIVERGENT SOLUTIONS BETWEEN THE GFS AND NAM. FOR THE LAST SEVERAL 
RUNS THE GFS HAS INDICATED A MCS MOVING ALONG THE SOUTHERN TENNESSEE 
BORDER TOWARD THE EAST OVERNIGHT FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY. YESTERDAYS 
RUN HAD THE MCS MOVING INTO THE CHA AREA BY 06Z...TODAYS RUN IS 
SLIGHTLY SLOWER. NEVERTHELESS...CONSISTENCY IN THE GFS DOES AT LEAST 
COUNT FOR SOMETHING. THE NAM HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN INDICATING LOW 
CHANCE POPS WITH NO MCS OVERNIGHT. HAVE DECIDED...AFTER COORDINATING 
WITH OTHER OFFICES...TO PLACE A 30 POPS IN THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF 
THE CWA. THIS MAY NEED TO BE RAISED ON THE OVERNIGHT SHIFT AS 
CONFIDENCE INCREASES. GFS COULD BE HAVING SOME CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK 
ISSUES...BUT THAT WONT BE KNOWN UNTIL AFTER THE FORECAST VERIFIES. 
DYNAMICS NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE IN THE TENNESSEE VALLEY...SO GFS MAY BE 
OVERPLAYING ITS HAND. THAT BEING SAID...CANNOT DISCOUNT THE 
CONSISTENCY IN THE GFS. LIKE THE MAV TEMPS FOR MINS AND WILL FOLLOW 
THEM CLOSELY.

SATURDAY...NAM INDICATES WEAK IMPULSE MOVING THROUGH THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY ON SATURDAY WHILE THE GFS CONTINUES MOVEMENT OF THE 
AFOREMENTIONED MCS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. EITHER WAY...EXPECT 
THERE TO BE GOOD CHANCES OF CONVECTION AREA WIDE AND HAVE GONE WITH 
30 PERCENT FOR THE FORECAST AREA AS CANNOT AT THIS POINT PREDICT 
WITH CONFIDENCE WHERE CONVECTION WILL OCCUR. WILL TAKE A BLEND OF 
THE MAV AND MET MOS HERE FOR TEMPS AS THE MAV IS PREDICTING COOLER 
TEMPS BECAUSE OF MCS ACTIVITY. 

SATURDAY NIGHT...BETTER AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE MODELS AS A DRY SURGE 
OF AIR PUSHES IN BEHIND WEAK IMPULSE DRYING OUT THE REGION AND 
PROVIDING FOR NO -TSRA OR -SHRA ACTIVITY. WILL CONTINUE NO POPS FOR 
SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL AGAIN TAKE A BLEND OF THE MET AND MAV MOS. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS INDICATING A WEAK 
SHORTWAVE MOVING THROUGH SUNDAY...MOISTURE LIMITED SO KEPT SUNDAY 
DRY.  A MORE ORGANIZED SYSTEM PUSHING IN ON MONDAY AS SURFACE LOW 
NEARS...SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND LIFT FOR A LEAST 
SCATTERED PRECIP ON MONDAY.  GFS TRACKING SURFACE LOW ACROSS OUR 
AREA ON TUESDAY...WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING ON TUESDAY.  BEST 
INSTABILITY REMAINS SOUTH ON BOTH DAYS...BUT WILL KEEP THUNDER IN 
FOR BOTH DAYS.  UPPER LOW FOLLOWS WEDNESDAY...STILL SOME RESIDUAL 
MOISTURE AND LIFT...SO KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING FOR WEDNESDAY.  
MOISTURE LINGERS INTO THURSDAY...BUT WILL KEEP THURSDAY DRY FOR NOW.

.DISCUSSION...MORNING VISIBLE SAT IMAGES SHOWS ONLY SOME MID AND 
HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS STREAMING ACROSS THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA. 
ALL VALLEY FOG HAD LIFTED OUT BY 1330Z GIVING THE AREA MOSTLY SUNNY 
SKIES. UPPER AIR ANALYSES REVEAL MID AND UPPER LAYER RIDGING MOVING 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA. AS THE RIDGE CONTINUES TO MOVE TO THE 
EAST...OUR HEIGHTS WILL RISE AND WILL ALLOW FOR TEMPERATURES TO WARM 
BACK INTO THE LOW TO MID 70S NORTH...UPPER 70S CENTRAL AND NEAR 80 
SOUTH. MOISTURE CONVERGENCE PLOTS SHOW WEAK DIVERGENCE IN THE LOWER 
LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...SO NOT WORRIED ABOUT PRECIPITATION 
DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON. EXPECT DEVELOPMENT OF CUMULUS TO COMMENCE 
SHORTLY OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND THEN IN THE VALLEYS. 
HOWEVER...EXPECT TO REMAIN PARTLY CLOUDY ALL AREAS.

NO UPDATE PLANNED TO THE CURRENT FORECAST AS TEMPERATURE TRENDS 
APPEAR GENERALLY TO BE ON TRACK WITH LOTS OF SUNSHINE IN TODAYS

232 AM EDT THU MAY 26 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK RIDGING WILL CONTINUE TO 
BUILD IN TODAY.  AS A RESULT...LOW DEW POINTS WILL VERY SLOWING 
RISE...INCREASING HEIGHTS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO MODERATE TO 
NEAR NORMAL LEVELS...AND THE AIR MASS WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY 
STABLE.  TONIGHT...THE UPPER RIDGE WILL DAMPEN AS A WEAK FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY APPROACHES THE REGION.  THE INITIAL PUSH OF THE BOUNDARY 
WILL REACH INTO THE MRX TOWARD MORNING.  IT HAS VERY LITTLE MOISTURE 
OR LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND EXPECT MAIN THREAT WILL BE AN 
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER.  HOWEVER...WITH RESIDUAL LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
AND ADDED DYNAMICS FROM UPSLOPE FLOW...WILL KEEP SOME LOW POPS OVER 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF OUR NORTHEAST ZONES.

.LONG TERM...(FRI THROUGH WED)...MODEL TREND IS DRIER WITH WEAK 
FRONT EXITING AREA EARLY FRIDAY...AND WITH NO INFLUX OF GULF 
MOISTURE THINK 20 POPS FOR FRIDAY SHOULD SUFFICE. MODELS HAVING SOME 
DIFFICULTY WITH WEAK SHORT WAVE FEATURES THAT MAY AFFECT AREA FRIDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY.  TEND TO FAVOR THE NAM HERE...ALTHOUGH 
CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH.  WILL JUST CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE FRI NIGHT AND 
LOW CHANCE SAT.  WILL KEEP SUNDAY DRY...THEN GFS BRINGING 
SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM TO THE AREA FOR MONDAY INTO TUESDAY.  GIVEN POOR 
CONSISTENCY TRACK RECORD...NOT READY TO JUMP TOO HARD ON THIS...BUT 
WILL BUMP POPS UP SLIGHTLY FOR MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...AND LOWER 
MAX TEMPS A BIT. WILL GENERALLY LEAVE LATER PERIODS AS THEY ARE FOR 
NOW.

.SHORT TERM...FINALLY THE UPPER LEVEL LOW PARKED OVER THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS IS BEGINNING TO MOVE OFF TO THE 
NORTHEAST. HOWEVER...AS UPPER AIR ANALYSES REVEALED THIS 
MORNING...AREA WEATHER IS STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE LOW. 
VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS CLOUDS CONTINUING TO MOVE TOWARD OUR 
REGION FROM THE NORTH. TODAY THERE ARE MORE BREAKS OBSERVED IN 
CLOUD FIELD...ESPECIALLY OVER OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES. EXPECT CLOUDS 
TO DO MUCH THE SAME TONIGHT AS LAST NIGHT. SHORTLY AFTER SUNSET 
SHOULD START TO SEE MORE BREAKS NORTH AND EVEN CLOUDS DISSIPATE 
SOUTH. BY MORNING...CLOUDS SHOULD ONLY BE PRESENT NORTHERN SECTIONS 
AS THE LOW CONTINUES TO MOVE AWAY.

MODELS IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE FIRST 48 HOURS OF THE 
SHORT TERM. RIDGING BACK TO OUR WEST AS OBSERVED ON 12Z UPPER AIR 
ANALYSES IS BUILDING IN BETWEEN H7 AND H3. RIDGING NOT WELL 
PRONOUNCED AT H85. NEVERTHELESS...AS THE RIDGE MOVES FURTHER TO THE 
EAST OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AND INTO TOMORROW...HEIGHTS WILL RISE CAUSING 
TEMPERATURES TO REBOUND SLIGHTLY. MOREOVER...CLOUD DEVELOPMENT 
TOMORROW WILL BE LIMITED TO FAIR WEATHER CUMULUS. NO PRECIPITATION 
IS EXPECTED.

INTO THURSDAY NIGHT...CLOUDS WILL SLOWLY BEGIN TO INCREASE FROM THE 
WEST AS THE NEXT DISTURBANCE APPROACHES. WILL INTRODUCE A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF -TSRA EARLY FRIDAY MORNING AS A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
APPROACHES. BIG DISCREPANCY IN THE MODELS IS HOW MUCH MOISTURE WILL 
BE PRESENT. NAM SHOWS LESS MOISTURE BUT HIGHER POPS. GFS SHOWS MORE 
MOISTURE BUT LOWER POPS. HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE A BLEND OF THE TWO 
MODELS AND TREAT THIS EVENT LIKE DIURNALLY DRIVEN CONVECTION. WILL 
KEEP POPS LOW CHANCE IN THE MORNING HOURS OF FRIDAY ALL ZONES AND 
THEN INCREASE TO 50 POPS IN THE NE TN MOUNTAINS AND SW VA. GO WITH 
40 POPS IN THE NORTHERN VALLEY...SMOKYS AND PLATEAU AND WILL INSERT 
30 POPS ELSEWHERE. THIS WAS DONE DUE TO OMEGA LIFT CROSS SECTIONS 
INDICATING THE BEST LIFT WOULD BE PRIMARILY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
AND GENERALLY IN THE NORTH OF I-40. 

MODEL SOUNDINGS FROM THE NAM INDICATE THAT THUNDERSTORMS THAT 
DEVELOP ON FRIDAY COULD BE POTENTIALLY STRONG TO SEVERE WITH MAIN 
THREATS BEING STRONG WINDS AND HAIL. WILL NOT INSERT ANY MENTION YET 
IN ZONES AS EXPECT ANY STORMS TO BE SCATTERED IN NATURE AND TOUGH TO 
PINPOINT AT THIS TIME. WILL GO AHEAD AND UPDATE HAZARDOUS WEATHER 
OUTLOOK TO INCLUDE MENTION OF ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLE DURING 
THE AFTERNOON HOURS ON FRIDAY. 

INTO FRIDAY NIGHT WILL SEE CONVECTION SLOWLY DIMINISH AS HEATING IS 
LOST BUT WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE OF PRECIP IN THE FORECAST AS GFS 
IS INDICATING ANOTHER WAVE MOVING INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
OVERNIGHT AND INTO SATURDAY.

FOR TEMPERATURES...EXPECT ONE MORE NIGHT OF UNSEASONABLY COOL 
CONDITIONS TONIGHT BEFORE A SLIGHT MODERATING TREND. SINCE MAV 
GUIDANCE HAS BEEN ON THE WARM SIDE LATELY...HAVE UNDERCUT MAV 
GUIDANCE A DEGREE OR SO FOR TONIGHT AND TOMORROW...BUT FOLLOWED IT 
CLOSELY FOR MIN AND MAX TEMPS FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. 

.LONG TERM...(SAT THROUGH WED)...SCATTERED PRECIP LINGERS INTO 
SATURDAY BEFORE ENDING BY 00Z SUNDAY. UNCERTAINTY BECOMES QUITE HIGH 
BY 12Z MONDAY AS MODEL AND ENSEMBLE SOLUTIONS DIVERGE SIGNIFICANTLY. 
DID NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO PREVIOUS GRIDS/FORECAST OTHER THAN 
TO LOWER SOME OF THE MIN TEMPS. ALSO INTRODUCED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
FOR NEXT WEDNESDAY ALTHOUGH CONFIDENCE AGAIN IS NOT HIGH. FOR 
TEMPS...GFS MOS SEEMS REASONABLE EXCEPT FOR MAX TEMPS FOR NEXT 
WEDNESDAY WHERE HIGHER HEIGHTS ARE PROJECTED FOR THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION BY THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN THAN THE OPERATIONAL 
GFS. THUS WENT SLIGHTLY ABOVE GFS GUIDANCE VALUES FOR THAT DAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...RIGHT AROUND 17Z SHOWERS 
STARTED TO DEVELOP IN THE NORTHEASTERN CWA AND HAVE SINCE MOVED INTO 
NORTH CAROLINA. CURRENT RADAR TRENDS SHOW SOME SHOWERS STARTING TO 
DEVELOP NEAR THE KENTUCKY/VIRGINIA BORDER AND MOVING TO THE SOUTH. 
EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING HOURS WITH SOME LIGHT 
SHOWERS DEVELOPING AS THE VORT MAX MOVES OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

UPPER LEVEL LOW STILL ENTRENCHED ON THE EASTERN US KEEPING CLOUDY 
AND DOWNRIGHT COOL CONDITIONS FOR MAY IN THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
GOOD NEWS IS THAT THIS WONT LAST MUCH LONGER. 500 MB ANALYSIS SHOWS 
RIDGING OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS HEADING OUR WAY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE 
OF DAYS. SO EXPECT THIS PATTERN TO CHANGE BY THURSDAY.

NAM AND GFS BOTH IN AGREEMENT THROUGH THE SHORT TERM WITH ONE LAST 
VORT LOBE MOVING THROUGH TONIGHT GIVING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWER 
ACTIVITY...PRIMARILY OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. HAVE SET UP POPS TO 
HAVE HIGHEST VALUES IN THE MOUNTAINS. KEPT POPS OUT OF THE CENTRAL 
AND SOUTHERN VALLEY AS MOISTURE AND SUPPORT JUST NOT THERE FOR 
DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS. SOME CONCERN EXISTS FOR SEEING PATCHY FOG IN 
THE NORTHEASTERN CWA IN LOCATIONS THAT RECEIVE SOME RAINFALL THIS 
EVENING. HOWEVER...IN SUCH A COOL AIRMASS IT IS NOT VERY LIKELY TO 
SEE FOG LIKE WAS EXPERIENCED THIS MORNING (TRI DOWN TO 1/4 SM). WILL 
NOT INCLUDE FOG IN ZONES AT THIS TIME.

FOR TOMORROW...UPPER LOW BEGINS TO MOVE AWAY AS RIDGING APPROACHES 
FROM THE WEST. HAVE REMOVED POPS AFTER 12Z WEDNESDAY FOR ALL ZONES 
AND WILL CARRY PARTLY CLOUDY EVERYWHERE TOMORROW. 

TEMPERATURES TONIGHT WILL BE ALMOST 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL IN 
PLACES. DONT SEE MUCH REASON TO DEVIATE TO FAR FROM MOS THIS 
EVENING AS WILL MAINLY BE A RADIATIONAL COOLING EVENT FOR CENTRAL 
AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS. FOR NORTHERN SECTIONS...WILL TAKE A BLEND OF 
THE MET AND MAV GUIDANCE. TEMPERATURES DO NOT WARM MUCH TOMORROW 
UNDER PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES...AS TEMPERATURES STRUGGLE TO CLIMB OUT OF 
THE MID 70S SOUTH AND MID 60S NORTHEAST. 

.MEDIUM TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...LATEST MODEL 
RUNS REVEAL A SLOWER PROGRESSION WITH THE NEXT COLD FRONT ON 
THURSDAY...WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE NOT EXPECTED ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA UNTIL FRIDAY MORNING. WITH LIMITED MOISTURE EXPECTED WITH THIS 
FRONT...WILL CONTINUE A MENTION OF ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR 
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. MODELS INDICATE THAT ANOTHER BROAD UPPER 
LOW WILL DEVELOP OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION...AND WILL CONTINUE A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE 
VALUES ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE MEDIUM RANGE PERIOD AND 
LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...UNCERTAINTY IS FAIRLY HIGH 
FURTHER OUT...BUT A WEAK SHORT WAVE MAY AFFECT THE AREA SAT...THUS 
20 POPS. WILL GENERALLY LEAVE LATER PERIODS AS THEY ARE FOR NOW. 
HEADING THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...DGEX HAS LOW 
IN GREAT LAKES MUCH STRONGER THAN OTHER MODELS AND PUSHES FRONT AND 
CONVECTION FARTHER SOUTH FOR THE WEEKEND. IT DELAYS RETURN OF 
MOISTURE AND WARM FRONT TOO LONG. AM ALLOWING WARM FRONT PRECIP TO 
MOVE IN BY MONDAY AND INTO TUESDAY AS OTHER MODELS SUGGEST.

1024 AM EDT TUE MAY 24 2005

.DISCUSSION...MORNING SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS FRONT THAT MOVED 
THROUGH OUR REGION YESTERDAY MORNING NOW NEARLY STATIONARY FROM 
CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI EASTWARD TO NEAR SAVANNAH, GA. VERY HIGH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S SOUTH OF THE FRONT WHILE WE ARE REMAINING 
IN THE LOW TO MID 50S. SATELLITE IMAGE SHOWS A LAYER OF CLOUDS 
STARTING TO MOVE INTO THE CWA FROM THE NORTH. ALREADY SKIES ARE 
MOSTLY CLOUDY TO CLOUDY IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. A VERY LIGHT SHOWER 
IS ALSO OBSERVED ON KMRX RADAR MOVING THROUGH RUSSELL AND WASHINGTON 
COUNTIES IN VIRGINIA. FROM KNOXVILLE SOUTH (EXCLUDING THE SMOKYS) 
SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLEAR WITH TEMPERATURES ALREADY WARMING INTO THE 
LOW 70S. 

TAKING A LOOK AT THE NAM AND GFS SHOWS THE VORT PROGGED TO MOVE OVER 
THE REGION TODAY AT 18Z IS STILL ON TRACK FOR THAT TIME. 
PRECIPITATION LOOKS TO BE MOST LIKELY BETWEEN 18Z AND 21Z TODAY. FOR 
THAT REASON...WILL RAISE POPS SLIGHTLY...MAINLY OVER SW VA AND NE TN 
MOUNTAIN COUNTIES TO 40 PERCENT. NAM-40 SHOWS A VERY LOW FREEZING 
LEVEL OF 6500 FEET IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EXTREME NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE. WOULD NOT BE TOTALLY SURPRISED TO SEE A COUPLE OF ICE 
PELLETS IN THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS SHOULD SHOWERS DEVELOP.

ON THE UPDATE THIS MORNING WILL REMOVE ALL MORNING WORDING FROM THE 
ZONES. ALSO INCREASE POPS SLIGHTLY IN THE MOUNTAINS AND LOWER MIN 
TEMPS NORTHEAST ZONES A CATEGORY AS TEMPERATURES WILL RISE ONLY 
SLIGHTLY MORE (IF THAT) AS CLOUD COVER IS ALREADY FIRMLY ENTRENCHED.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODELS IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT 
WITH ROTATING THE TAIL END OF A SHORT WAVE ACROSS OUR NORTHERN ZONES 
THIS AFTERNOON.  COMPARING SATELLITE IMAGERY...MODEL TIMING APPEARS 
REASONABLE AS WELL.  LITTLE IN THE WAY OF LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH WAVE 
AND MOISTURE IS LIMITED.  THIS WILL MINIMIZE SHOWER POTENTIAL...AND 
CONFINED PRECIP MAINLY TO NORTHERN AREAS.  A FEW RESIDUAL SHOWERS 
MAY REMAIN OVER OUR FAR NORTHEAST THIS EVENING AS THE WAVE EXITS THE 
AREA.  NORTHERLY FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO PULL IN A COOLER...MORE 
STABLE AIR MASS THROUGH TONIGHT.  GUIDANCE NUMBER LOOK GOOD AND WILL 
KEEP TEMPS CLOSE TO THESE.

.LONG TERM...(WED THROUGH MON)...MODELS CONTINUE TO DEPICT UPPER LOW 
PULLING AWAY WED AND THU...WITH ANOTHER UPPER LOW DROPPING INTO THE 
GREAT LAKES AND NORTHEAST FRI AND SAT.  IT WILL BE ON THE COOL SIDE 
WED...AND IT SHOULD BE DRY AS LATEST VORT LOBE ROTATING AROUND THE 
UPPER LOW MOVES OUT OF THE AREA.  DRY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THU...THEN 
NEXT WEAK FRONT APPROACHES AND MOVES THROUGH THU NIGHT AND FRI. IT 
APPEARS THAT THIS FRONT WILL NOT HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF MOISTURE OR

308 PM EDT MON MAY 23 2005

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...VERY GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN BOTH 
THE NAM AND GFS WITH POSITIONING OF UPPER LEVEL LOW. TIMING OF 
PRECIPITATION IS ALSO VERY CONSISTENT IN THE MODELS. BOTH INDICATE 
TWO VORT MAXES ROTATING THROUGH THE CWA OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. THE 
FIRST ONE TONIGHT BETWEEN 03Z AND 09Z WILL BE THE WEAKER OF THE TWO 
AND DELIVER ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVER THE 
NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA. GFS HAS A LITTLE LESS MOISTURE 
THAN DOES THE NAM AND THUS POPS ARE SLIGHTLY LOWER. NEVERTHELESS... 
FEEL THAT SOME LOCATIONS IN THE NORTHERN THIRD...ESPECIALLY 
SOUTHWEST VA...WILL RECEIVE SOME SHOWERS WITH THE FIRST VORT.

BY 15Z TOMORROW SECOND (AND STRONGER) VORT APPROACHES FROM THE 
NORTH. BOTH MODELS SEEM TO WANT TO PLACE THE VORT MAX RIGHT OVER NE 
TN. FOR THIS ROUND OF PRECIP...HAVE RAISED POPS TO 40 IN SW VA AND 
NE TN MOUNTAINS...30 IN NE TN VALLEY...20 CENTRAL VALLEY AND NC 
MOUNTAINS AND WILL MENTION NO POPS IN SOUTHERN VALLEY WHERE MOISTURE 
AND LIFT WILL BE EXTREMELY LIMITED. CONSIDERED ADDING THUNDER TO THE 
ZONES TOMORROW GIVEN THE COOL AIR ALOFT WITH THE UPPER LEVEL LOW. 
HOWEVER...WITH LITTLE TO NO SURFACE INSTABILITY PRESENT...WILL KEEP 
JUST SHOWERS ONLY.

TEMPERATURES WILL BE BELOW NORMAL IN THE SHORT TERM. WILL GO THREE 
TO FOUR DEGREES BELOW GUIDANCE TONIGHT WITH HEIGHTS LOWERING AND A 
COOLER NW WIND BLOWING IN DESPITE THE POSSIBLE CLOUD COVER. 
MOREOVER...GUIDANCE HAD A WARMUP TODAY THAT DID NOT OCCUR... 
ESPECIALLY INTO SE TN. TEMPERATURES STRUGGLE TO REBOUND ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN CWA UNDER MOSTLY CLOUDY TO CLOUDY SKIES TOMORROW. LARGE 
TEMPERATURE CONTRAST BETWEEN SW VA AND SE TN TOMORROW DUE TO THE 
CLOUD COVER.

.MEDIUM TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...UPPER LOW OVER 
THE MID ATLANTIC STATES WILL MOVE EAST OUT OVER THE ATLANTIC ON 
TUESDAY NIGHT...WITH ANOTHER WEAK VORT LOBE ROTATING AROUND IT OVER 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING. GFS AND NAM 
MODELS INDICATE ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE WITH THIS VORT LOBE...SO WILL 
KEEP FORECAST DRY ON TUESDAY NIGHT FOR NOW. GFS MODEL ALSO REVEALS 
LIMITED MOISTURE WITH THE NEXT COLD FRONT ON THURSDAY...SO WILL ONLY 
MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NOW. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE VALUES 
ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE PERIOD AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...TROUGH ACROSS THE EASTERN 
STATES CONTINUES WITH A RIDGE OVER THE WEST. A PAIR OF CLOSED LOWS 
WILL STILL STRETCH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES STATES INTO THE NORTHEAST 
AND KEEP THE EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS IN A 
COOLER THAN NORMAL NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN. ANOTHER COLD FRONT IS 
EXPECTED TO BRING A REINFORCING SHOT OF COOLER AIR AND DEEPEN THE 
TROUGH IN THE EAST EARLY FRIDAY. THE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND A 
POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORM WILL ALSO BE ACROSS SW VA AND EXTREME NE TN 
FRIDAY. AS THE TROUGH DIGS SOUTH FRIDAY AND SATURDAY HIGH TEMPS WILL 
BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER ACROSS NORTHERN AND CENTRAL SECTIONS AND FOR 
THIS TIME OF YEAR SOME 5 TO 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. ALSO A STRONG 
SHORTWAVE ROTATING AROUND THE TROUGH SHOULD BRING ANOTHER SHOT OF 
SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS SATURDAY AFTERNOON OVER SW VA AND 
NE TN. LOWS SATURDAY WILL BE THE COOLEST OF THIS EXTENDED PERIOD IN 
THE UPPER 40S ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN.    

HIGH PRESSURE FROM SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA WILL DROP SOUTHEAST INTO THE 
TN VALLEY FOR THE WEEKEND. THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHWEST 
BREAKS DOWN THIS WEEKEND. A SYSTEM BEGINS DEVELOPING OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS AND THE TROUGH OVER THE EAST FINALLY SHIFTS OUT INTO

.DISCUSSION...VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS LOW LEVEL CLOUDINESS 
LIFTING OUT THIS MORNING AS HEATING BEGINS. OVER THE MID SOUTH...A 
DECAYING MCS IS SENDING MID AND UPPER LEVEL CLOUD COVER OVER MY 
SOUTHWESTERN ZONES. THIS FEATURE WILL NECESSITATE LOWERING MAX 
TEMPERATURES A CATEGORY AROUND CHATTANOOGA. 

POSITION OF UPPER LEVEL LOW IS A LITTLE FURTHER NORTH THAN 
PREVIOUSLY FORECASTED. PER ETA12 MODEL WILL SEE A FINE DIVIDING LINE 
OF CLOUD COVER AND MOISTURE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APALACHIANS. AT THIS 
POINT...FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT FOR MOST OF THE DAY SW VA AND NE TN 
WILL REMAIN PARTLY CLOUDY AND DRY AS MOST OF THE MOISTURE AND OMEGA 
LIFT REMAINS JUST TO OUR NORTH. THAT BEING SAID...HAVE LOWERED POPS 
TO SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SW VA...NE TN...AND THE SMOKIES. WITH COLD AIR 
ALOFT WILL CONTINUE MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS.

SOME CONCERN EXISTS WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF STRONG WINDS ACROSS THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. ETA12 HAS WINDS 20 TO 30 KTS THIS AFTERNOON. 
HOWEVER...CURRENT OBSERVATIONS SHOW WINDS COMING IN ABOUT 5 KTS 
BELOW MODEL FORECAST. WILL KEEP CURRENT WIND GRIDS IN PLACE...BUT 
WILL HOLD BACK ON A WIND ADVISORY. INSTEAD...I WILL ENHANCE THE 
WORDING IN THE ZFP TO INCLUDE SUSTAINED WINDS 15 TO 25 MPH WITH 
GUSTS 30 TO 40 MPH IN THE MOUNTAIN GROUPS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RADAR SHOWS SHOWERS AND A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS MOVING THROUGH NORTHERN AREAS AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING 
COLD FRONT.  MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD EXIT THE AREA BY THE 
BEGINNING OF THE TODAY PERIOD. MODELS HAVE SOME DIFFERENCES IN 
HANDLING UPPER LOW IN NORTHEAST AND SHORT WAVE ENERGY ROTATING 
AROUND IT.  WILL GENERALLY GO CLOSER TO THE NAM SOLUTION...IN 
AGREEMENT WITH HPC.  SHOULD BE BREEZY TODAY BEHIND THE FRONT...AND 
RATHER WARM IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY AS COLDER AIR LAGS AND 
DOWNSLOPE OFF THE PLATEAU HELPS BOOST TEMPS.  MAY SEE A FEW SHOWERS 
OR THUNDERSTORMS IN NORTHERN AREAS THIS AFTERNOON...BUT THINK 
INSTABILITY WILL BE LIMITED. WILL ONLY CARRY 20 TO 30 POPS NORTH AND 
SMOKIES.  TONIGHT AS VORT LOBE MOVES ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS...SHOULD 
SEE MORE CLOUDS NORTH AND PERHAPS A FEW SHOWERS...WILL CARRY 20 TO 
30 POPS AGAIN NORTH.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO ONLY 
A FEW MINOR TWEAKS.            

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...REX BLOCK OVR ERN CANADA WILL

NO WHERE TO GO AND THUS WILL SPIN LOBES OF VORTICITY ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL AND SRN APPALACHIANS KEEPING SLGT TO LOW CHC POPS GOING 
ACROSS SW VA/NE TN AND TERRAIN AREAS ALONG NC BORDER. MUCH OF THE 
REMAINDER OF THE FA WILL BE DRY HOWEVER. PATTERN FINALLY RELENTS 
ALLOWING FOR AN APPROXIMATE 24 HR PERIOD EXTENDING INTO THU MORNING 
FREE FROM THE THREAT OF RAIN FOR THE ENTIRE AREA. YET ANOTHER UPR 
TROF AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL MOVE SE ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES AND BUILD SLOWLY SE THRU MUCH OF THE ERN THIRD OF THE NATION 
INTO THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEEKEND INCREASING THE CHC FOR SHRA/TSRA 
THU AFTERNOON THRU FRI NITE. THE CHC FOR RAIN SHOULD END FOR MOST OF 
THE REGION SAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SW VA/NE TN WHERE ENERGY WILL 
CONTINUE TO ROTATE AROUND THE BACK SIDE OF DEPARTING UPR TROF. 
HEIGHTS SHOULD RISE SUFFICIENTLY FOR THE ENTIRE FA BY SUN TO KEEP 
PRECIP OUT OF THE FCST. STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS WHICH 
FEATURE A FAIRLY DECENT NE-SW TEMPERATURE GRADIENT AS MORE SEASONAL 
WARMTH OCCURS ON THE PERIPHERY OF THE PERSISTENT NERN U.S. UPR TROF 
KEEPING TEMPS ACROSS SE TN A LITTLE CLOSER TO CLIMATOLOGY ESPECIALLY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...LATEST SATELLITE PICTURES

OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WHICH IS BRINGING SHOWERS TO OH AND WV MOVING 
INTO VA. NEW THUNDERSTORM COMPLEX IS DEVELOPING NEAR THE POINT WHERE 
AR OK AND KS COME TOGETHER WHERE THE COLD FRONT IS STALLED. IN THE 
UPPER LEVELS A STRONG RIDGE CONTINUES OVER THE SOUTHWEST WITH TWO 
UPPER LEVEL LOWS OVER THE EASTERN US ONE OVER MASSACHUSETTS AND THE 
DEEPER LOW ALONG THE MN AND ONTARIO BORDER WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE MS VALLEY. THE MODELS MOVE THE MCS 
SOUTHEAST JUST SOUTH OF THE FRONT AND KEEP MOST OF THE ENERGY WITH 
THE FRONT ITSELF TO THE NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA AND MOVE THE BULK 
OF THE PRECIPITATION THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE MID ATLANTIC. 
I AM NOT VERY CONFIDENT OF ANY SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION FOR THE 
EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE BEST CHANCE 
FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE LATE THIS EVENING THROUGH 
ABOUT MID MORNING MONDAY. THE AIRMASS IS STILL STABLE THIS AFTERNOON 
BUT BECOMES UNSTABLE LATER TONIGHT WITH MID TO UPPER LEVEL WINDS 
INCREASING MONDAY. MOISTURE DECREASES RAPIDLY MONDAY ACROSS CENTRAL 
AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS AFTER 12Z BEHIND THE FRONT. PUT THE HIGHEST 
POPS SW VA MONDAY AS UPPER LOW OVER MN MOVES SE AND MERGES WITH 
PERSISTENT LOW ACROSS THE NE STATES. FLOW BECOMES MORE NORTHERLY 
AS UPPER LOW ENLARGES OVER THE EASTERN STATES MONDAY. TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD BE MILDER TONIGHT WITH EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER LATER AND COOLER
ACROSS THE NORTHEAST HALF MONDAY WITH LOWERING HEIGHTS AND A CHANCE
OF RAIN.      

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...CLOSED UPPER TROUGH ACROSS
THE MID-ATLANTIC AND EASTERN GREAT LAKE STATES WILL MOVE SLOWLY SOUTHEAST
ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS INTO VA/NC BY LATE TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY.  SCATTERED SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM ARE 
EXPECTED...MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON/EVENING TUESDAY AS COLD AIR ALOFT
HELPS DESTABILIZE THE AIR-MASS.

UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA FOR WEDNESDAY WITH SURFACE RIDGING
BUILDING INTO THE REGION PRODUCING DRY CONDITIONS. NEXT UPPER TROUGH WILL
SWINGS SOUTHEAST FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY/GREAT
LAKES AREA FOR LATE THIS WEEK.  ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP THROUGH
THURSDAY NIGHT AND EARLY FRIDAY...SO HAVE CONTINUED CHANCE OF SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS LATE THURSDAY THROUGH MAINLY FRIDAY MORNING. COLD FRONT
BECOMES STATIONARY ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES FOR NEXT WEEKEND...BUT
UPPER TROUGH MAY SWING SOUTH ENOUGH TO DESTABILIZE AIRMASS FOR 
SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE

AND LIFT TO JUSTIFY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SOUTH AND CHANCE CENTRAL AND 
NORTH FOR TONIGHT.  LOOKS LIKE INSTABILITY WILL BE LIMITED ENOUGH 
TODAY TO KEEP FORECAST DRY...WITH A PARTLY CLOUDY SKY. WILL GO A BIT 
ABOVE MAV TEMPS FOR TODAY MOST LOCATIONS...NEAR MAV TONIGHT.    

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPR TROF/CLOSE LOW WILL DROP 
SE INTO THE NERN U.S. EARLY IN THE PERIOD AND WILL MOVE VERY LITTLE 
THRU MID WEEK. THUS BELOW NORMAL TEMPS WILL BE THE RULE AS COOL AIR 
FLOWS SOUTH OUT OF CANADA. SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL BE 
PRESENT THROUGH TUE AS IMPULSES ROTATE AROUND THE LOW KEEPING 
SLGT/CHC TYPE POPS FOR -SHRA ACROSS MUCH OF THE FA. LOW FINALLY 
WOBBLES FAR ENOUGH AWAY TO THE NORTH AND EAST TO ALLOW A DRY DAY WED 
BEFORE ANOTHER S/WV AND COLD FRONT PUSH THRU THE MIDWEST INTO THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE IS 
STILL SHOWING QUITE A BIT OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ESPECIALLY ALONG THE 
KY/VA AND TN/KY BORDER. ALSO NEAR THE TN/GA BORDER. A WIDE RANGE OF 
AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES WERE OBSERVED DEPENDING ON HOW LONG THE LOW 
CLOUDS HUNG AROUND. CURRENT ANALYSIS HAS AN UPPER LEVEL LOW IN THE 
NORTHEAST. HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES AND OHIO 
VALLEY AND A SHORTWAVE OVER EASTERN IOWA AND WISCONSIN MOVING 
SOUTHEAST AROUND A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE 
SOUTHWESTERN STATES. BEHIND THE SHORTWAVE WAS A COLD FRONT THAT 
STRETCHED FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE CENTRAL ROCKIES. LOWER 
PRESSURE FORMING AN INVERTED TROUGH WAS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS THE SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST TOWARD 
THE FORECAST AREA. AS THE SUN SETS SKIES SHOULD BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR 
WITH CLOUDS INCREASING BY AFTERNOON SUNDAY. HOWEVER THERE IS LIKELY 
TO BE SOME CIRRUS SPREADING IN BY MORNING FROM ANY THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT FAR TO THE NORTHWEST. PREFER THE GFS SOLUTION 
WHICH BRINGS A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO EASTERN TN 
VALLEY MAINLY AFTER 23/00Z. ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF STORMS TO THE 
NORTHERN PLATEAU DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON. SPC PUTS A SLIGHT CHANCE 
OF SEVERE STORMS JUST TO THE BORDER FOR DAY TWO. ANY ACTIVITY DURING 
THE DAY SUNDAY SHOULD BE ISOLATED AND MORE ORGANIZED CONVECTION 
SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL EVENING.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...RIDGE NOW WEST OF US 
DROPS A SHORT WAVE OVER THE TOP (CURRENTLY DISINTEGRATING OVER IOWA) 
LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING. THE REMNANTS OF THIS WILL 
COMBINE WITH FROPA IN THE WEE HOURS OF MONDAY TO PROVIDE SHOWERS AND 
TSTMS INTO MONDAY. HAVE INCREASED POPS SLIGHTLY ON MONDAY AND MONDAY 
NIGHT TO ACCOUNT. SLIGHT RISK MONDAY NIGHT FOR SEVERE, AND FEEL THAT 
ANY SEVERE TSTMS WILL BE BORDERLINE AND WILL PULSE MAKING FOR A LONG 
EVENING.

MIDWEEK KEPT STATUS QUO WITH STABILIZING ATMOSPHERE. BY THURSDAY 
ANOTHER FROPA WITH COOLER TEMPS AND TSTMS. INCREASED POPS (BUT 
MAINTAINED CATEGORIES) SLIGHTLY LATE NEXT WEEK ON STRENGTH OF 
SYSTEMS DEPICTED IN MODELS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER TROUGH IS CURRENTLY 
LOCATED OVER EAST TENNESSEE WITH SHORTWAVE TRIGGERING AREA OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND THE CENTRAL 
VALLEY. SATELLITE SHOWS SOME MID LEVEL COOLING ALONG THE AXIS OF THE 
TROUGH ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS AREA IS MOVING 
SLOWLY SOUTHEAST PRODUCING HEAVY RAINFALL...WITH THE STRONGEST STORM 
POSSIBLY PRODUCING LARGE HAIL AND HIGH WINDS OVER MORGAN COUNTY. 
OTHER SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE OCCURRING ALONG A LINE OVER 
NORTHERN AL INTO CENTRAL GA. SURFACE CHART SHOWS LOW PRESSURE OVER 
EAST CENTRAL TN WITH A COLD FRONT ALONG THE TN/VA BORDER STRETCHING 
TO THE WEST TO NEAR JACKSON TN. SOME HEATING THIS AFTERNOON HAS 
CONTRIBUTED TO ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
TO DEVELOP. THE THREAT FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PERSIST 
INTO EARLY EVENING AS THE ACTIVITY MOVES SLOWLY SOUTH. HEAVY 
RAINFALL WILL BE A THREAT FOR FLOODING ESPECIALLY OVER THE PLATEAU 
AND CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE OVERNIGHT RAINS OF UP TO TWO INCHES 
SATURATED THE SOIL. BEHIND THE FRONT SKIES SHOULD SLOWLY CLEAR LATE 
TONIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY WITH PATCHY FOG FORMING IN AREAS THAT 
RECEIVED HEAVY RAINFALL. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN SATURDAY WITH 
CLEARING SKIES AND LOWER DEWPOINTS. SOME CU WILL STILL BE AROUND 
DURING THE AFTERNOON. FOLLOWED GFS GENERALLY FOR LOWS TONIGHT AND 
HIGHS SATURDAY.   

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...

SATURDAY NIGHT...CLEARING SKIES WILL PREVAIL SATURDAY NIGHT AS 
TEMPERATURES DROP TO COOLER VALUES THAN SEEN THE LAST FEW DAYS. 11 
DEGREE DIFFERENCE FORECASTED BETWEEN THE NORTHERN END OF OUR 
FORECAST AREA AND SOUTHERN END OF OUR FORECAST AREA PER MAV GUIDANCE 
WHICH WAS FOLLOWED CLOSELY.

SUNDAY...A TRANSITIONAL DAY AS A SURFACE HIGH MOVES EAST OF THE 
REGION CREATING A SOUTHERLY FLOW AHEAD OF THE QUICKLY MOVING FRONTAL 
SYSTEM OUT OF THE NORTHWEST. CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE IN THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS AS THE FRONT APPROACHES. EXPECT A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS OVER OUR NORTHWESTERN ZONES AFTER 18Z AS ENOUGH HEATING AND 
NEARBY MOISTURE COULD PRODUCE A FEW SHOWERS. HAVE PREFERRED THE GFS 
FORECAST FOR THIS FRONT AS IT HAS PERFORMED WELL WITH TODAYS STORM 
SYSTEM.

SUNDAY NIGHT...BULK OF PRECIPITATION WILL FALL IN THIS PERIOD. HAVE 
INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY ALL BUT SOUTHWESTERN CWA. THIS WAS DONE 
BECAUSE GFS GUIDANCE INDICATES LIKELY POPS WITH APPROACHING SYSTEM. 
A LITTLE CONCERNED TO GO SO HIGH WITH POPS SO FAST DUE TO GFS 
ENSEMBLES INDICATING A WIDE SPREAD OF SOLUTIONS. HOWEVER...GOOD RUN 
TO RUN CONSISTENCY OF THE GFS AND EXCELLENT AGREEMENT WITH THE NAM 
PROVIDE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO HOIST POPS SO HIGH.  

MONDAY AND TUESDAY...AS FRONT CLEARS THE AREA RAPIDLY IN THE MORNING 
HOURS...CLOUDS WILL CLEAR ONLY BRIEFLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN CWA AS AN 
UPPER LEVEL LOW SPIRALS IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND CLOUD COVER. 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL REMAIN IN THE FORECAST THROUGH THESE 
PERIODS AS UPSLOPE COMPONENT IS PRESENT ALONG WITH NECESSARY 
MOISTURE. POPS ONLY IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY...BUT HIGHEST IN THE 
UPPER ELEVATIONS. HAVE ADDED THUNDERSTORMS TO THE FORECAST DUE TO 
COLD AIR ALOFT AND THE POSSIBILITY OF THUNDERSTORMS...HOWEVER MOST 
PRECIPITATION WILL BE -SHRA.

WEDNESDAY...MID LEVEL RIDGING BEGINS TO MOVE EASTWARD AND KICK THE 
UPPER LEVEL LOW OUT OF THE PICTURE...BUT ENOUGH MOISTURE REMAINS TO 
KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ACROSS OUR NORTHERN CWA. AS TEMPERATURES 
WARM TO NEAR 80 SOUTH AND MID 70S NORTH.

THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...YESTERDAYS 00 AND 12Z GFS INDICATED A LARGE 
PIECE OF ENERGY AND MCS MOVING INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY ON THESE 
DAYS. DIDNT GO WITH THE GFS ON THIS SYSTEM YESTERDAY. DECIDED TO 
FOLLOW THE GFS CLOSER TODAY WHEN IT AGAIN INDICATED A RATHER LARGE 
AREA OF PRECIPITATION AND LIFT ACROSS MY CWA IN NEARLY THE SAME 
LOCATION AS YESTERDAY. HAVE RAISED POPS TO 40 PERCENT ON THURSDAY 
AND FRIDAY AT THIS POINT IN LINE WITH MEX GUIDANCE AND TO MATCH WELL 
WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES. 

TEMPERATURES THROUGH EACH PERIOD WERE SET WITH A BLEND OF THE MAV 
GUIDANCE AND WERE UNDERCUT SLIGHTLY ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY TO ACCOUNT 
FOR THE UPPER LEVEL LOW.

302 PM EDT THU MAY 19 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...COLD FRONT OVER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION OVERNIGHT TONIGHT BRINGING 
CATEGORICAL CHANCE FOR RAIN OVERNIGHT.  RAIN CHANCES CONTINUE WITH 
POST FRONTAL ACTIVITY ON FRIDAY BEFORE TAPERING OFF BY SUNSET 
FRIDAY.  TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN ON THE WARM SIDE TONIGHT...BUT 
WILL MODERATE ON FRIDAY WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE.  SKIES WILL BE 
MOST CLOUDY TO CLOUDY THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.

&&

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)

FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH MAIN 500 MB TROF AXIS TRAVERSING THE CWA AT THIS 
TIME...WILL BEGIN TO TAPER POPS DOWN IN THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. BOTH 
THE GFS AND NAM KEEP ENOUGH MOISTURE AND LIFT AROUND TO WARRANT 
KEEPING POPS IN PLACE. THE NAM IS SLIGHTLY SLOWER TODAY THAN 
YESTERDAY AT REMOVING PRECIP FROM THE FORECAST AREA. DUE TO BETTER 
CONTINUITY BETWEEN THE NAM AND GFS WILL START A RAPID CLEARING 
TOWARD DAYBREAK SATURDAY FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST. 

SATURDAY...WITH TROF AXIS NOW OVER THE ATLANTIC COAST...WILL SEE 
SKIES RAPIDLY CLEAR AS BRIEF MID LEVEL RIDGING TAKES PLACE. WILL SEE 
A VERY NICE DAY ACROSS THE CWA BY MIDDAY AS ANY REMAINING LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE IS SCOURED OUT AND SKIES BEGIN TO CLEAR. HAVE UNDERCUT MAV 
GUIDANCE A DEGREE OR TWO AT MANY LOCATIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE 
SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR. MAIN DIFFERENCE IN AIRMASS WILL BE THE MUCH 
LOWER DEWPOINTS EXPECTED. MET GUIDANCE ON DEWPOINTS IS PREFERRED 
HERE WITH DEWPOINTS UPPER 40S NORTHEAST TO MID 50S SOUTHWEST. 

SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND MUCH LOWER 
DEWPOINTS...EXPECT GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS. SOME 
LOCATIONS ABOVE 5000 FEET COULD POSSIBLY BREAK INTO THE UPPER 30S. 
HAVE UNDERCUT MAV MOS AGAIN JUST SLIGHTLY TO ACCOUNT FOR GOOD 
RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS. ONLY NEGATING FACTOR TO RADIATIONAL 
COOLING WILL BE SURFACE HIGH MOVING JUST EAST OF THE AREA INDUCING A 
WEAK SOUTHERLY FLOW UP THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THIS MAY PREVENT 
TEMPERATURES FROM FALLING QUICKLY FROM KNOXVILLE SOUTHWARD TO 
CHATTANOOGA. 

SUNDAY WILL BE A TRANSITIONAL DAY AS A FAST MOVING COLD FRONT MOVES 
INTO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. EXPECT THIS FRONT TO MOVE INTO MY 
WESTERN CWA BY 00Z MONDAY AND HAVE RAISED POPS TO 20 PERCENT 
AREAWIDE AT THIS POINT. INCREASE POPS TO 30 IN TOWARD DAYBREAK 
MONDAY. WITH MOISTURE AND CLOUD COVER IN PLACE...TEMPERATURES WILL 
BE WARMER THAN PREVIOUS NIGHT AND HAVE NOT STRAYED FROM GUIDANCE. 

MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...UPPER LEVEL LOW BECOMES NEARLY STATIONARY 
AND CUT OFF FROM THE MAIN FLOW OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. OVER 
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...PIECES OF ENERGY WILL ROTATE FROM THE 
NORTH AROUND THIS LOW AND INTO OUR CWA. THIS SCENARIO IS VERY 
SIMILAR TO MID WINTER WHEN CLIPPER TYPE SYSTEMS MOVE THROUGH VERY 
QUICKLY PROVIDING UPSLOPE PRECIPITATION. HAVE TREATED THIS EVENT THE 
SAME WAY IN THE EXTENDED. MEX GUIDANCE HAS MID CHANCE POPS AND HAVE 
FOLLOWED CLOSELY WITH HIGHER POPS IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN 
MOUNTAINS (30 PERCENT) WITH 20 PERCENT IN THE VALLEY SECTIONS. HAVE 
KEPT SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE DRY IN MOST OCCASIONS. ALSO EXPECT THERE TO 
BE A TIGHT TEMPERATURE GRADIENT DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. HAVE 
UNDERCUT MEX GUIDANCE A FEW DEGREES TO ACCOUNT FOR LOWER HEIGHTS 
ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS.  MONDAY NIGHT WILL BE THE COOLEST NIGHT 
WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 40S NORTHEAST AND UPPER 30S IN THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. ABOVE 5000 FEET IN THE SMOKYS...MINS COULD

ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. SCATTERED 
CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED OVER ILLINOIS AND MISSOURI AHEAD OF THE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM AND ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. LATEST MODEL RUNS 
SEEM TO BE IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE TRACK OF THIS LOW INTO THE 
MID ATLANTIC STATES BY FRIDAY. A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL LOW WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BY FRIDAY MORNING...BRINGING A BETTER 
COVERAGE OF CONVECTION TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY. MODELS ARENT REVEALING 
AS MUCH INSTABILITY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH THIS SYSTEM AS 
THEY DID IN YESTERDAYS RUNS. HOWEVER...THINK THAT SOME SEVERE 
TSTORMS WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE LATER TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY...SINCE 
UPPER DYNAMICS WILL BE STRONG WITH LAPSE RATES STEEPENING AS THE 
COLD AIR ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LOW MOVES OVER THE REGION. 

HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BEHIND THE COLD

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS AND DEW POINTS IN THE 50S IN PLACE OVER THE AREA HAS ALLOWED A 
CU FIELD TO FORM OVER OUR EASTERN MOUNTAINS.  AS A RESULT...A FEW 
ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  
OTHERWISE...THE UPPER RIDGE CURRENTLY POSITIONED OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION WILL DAMPEN TONIGHT AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
APPROACHES THE AREA.  IN ADVANCE OF THE ATTACHED FRONTAL BOUNDARY... 
THE AIR MASS WILL FURTHER DESTABILIZE AS LIFT AND MOISTURE INCREASE 
OVER THE AREA.  WITH LI/S OF MINUS 2 TO 3 AND CAPES NEAR 1500J/KG 
PROGGED OVER THE AREA ON THURSDAY...SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ARE 
EXPECTED TO FORM BY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON...WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR 
SOME STORMS TO BECOME STRONG AND CONTAIN GUSTY WINDS AND HAIL.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED
COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT AND 
FRIDAY. FAIRLY DECENT UPPER DYNAMICS AND COLD AIR ALOFT INCREASING 
INSTABILITY WILL SET THE STAGE FOR WIDESPREAD CONVECTION FOR BOTH 
THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. COLD AIR ALOFT...ESPECIALLY FOR FRIDAY...WILL
INCREASE THE THREAT OF LARGE HAIL WITH THE AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS.  CAPES
FRIDAY INCREASE TO 2500 J/KG WITH LIFTED INDICES BETWEEN -5 TO -7.  
PLAN ON ISSUING A SPS CONCERNING THE POTENTIAL OF SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS.  SEEMS MAIN THREAT WILL BE LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING

330 AM EDT WED MAY 18 2005

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION WITH A WEAK TROUGH ALONG THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS. 
THIS SURFACE TROUGH...ALONG WITH INCREASING MOISTURE AND WEAK 
INSTABILITY OVER THE CAROLINAS...SHOULD HELP TO PRODUCE SOME 
ISOLATED CONVECTION OVER THE MOUNTAINS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 
BOUNDARY LAYER WIND PROFILE WILL REMAIN WEAK THROUGH TONIGHT...SO 
THINK THAT THIS CONVECTION SHOULD REMAIN LARGELY CONFINED TO THE 
MOUNTAINS. 

MODELS ARE SHOWING SOME DISAGREEMENTS THIS RUN (AND ALSO COMPARED TO 
THEIR PREVIOUS RUNS) WITH THE TRACK OF A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
CURRENTLY OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS. LATEST MODEL RUNS INDICATE THAT 
THIS LOW WILL MOVE MORE EAST TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA...WITH THE 
NAM MODEL REVEALING THE MOST EASTERLY TRACK INTO THE MID ATLANTIC 
STATES BY FRIDAY. THE GFS MODEL ON THE OTHER HAND DROPS THIS LOW 
FARTHER SOUTH INTO THE DEEP SOUTH BY FRIDAY NIGHT. THE END RESULT 
APPEARS TO REMAIN THE SAME - SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING ACROSS 
THE AREA ON THURSDAY AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT...WITH THE GREATEST 
COVERAGE EXPECTED THURSDAY NIGHT AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES NEAR THE 
FORECAST AREA. WITH THE UPPER LOW NOW EXPECTED TO BE IN CLOSER 
PROXIMITY TO THE FORECAST AREA...THIS SHOULD RESULT IN STRONGER 
INSTABILITY ON THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT WITH AN INCREASED CHANCE 
FOR SEVERE TSTORMS. ON SATURDAY...WILL LEAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
CONVECTION IN THE FORECAST TO ACCOUNT FOR THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MAY STALL OUT OVER THE DEEP SOUTH (AS SUGGESTED 
BY THE GFS MODEL).

315 PM EDT TUE MAY 17 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...IT IS VERY EASY TO PICK OUT 
THE POSITION OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS TODAY AS CUMULUS CLOUDS 
HAVE FORMED AROUND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS TODAY THANKS TO LOW LEVEL 
SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW CAUSING UPSLOPE OVER THE APPALACHIANS. AS THIS 
FLOW DESCENDS IN THE EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY...SKIES ARE REMAINING 
MOSTLY SUNNY TO SUNNY. 

FORECAST IN THE SHORT TERM IS VERY TRANQUIL. ONLY CONCERN MAY BE FOR 
SOME LATE AFTERNOON CONVECTION TO DEVELOP OVER OUR MOUNTAIN 
COUNTIES. SOUNDING FROM GSO THIS MORNING REVEALS A RATHER STRONG CAP 
IN PLACE OVER THE EASTERN APPALACHIANS. HOWEVER...CONVECTIVE TEMPS 
ARE RATHER LOW (IN THE LOW 70S) AND ARE CLOSE TO BEING ACHIEVED. 
THETA-E RIDGE AT 850 MB IS PRESENT EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS...SO ANY 
CONVECTION FIRING ALONG OUR EASTERN BORDER WILL LIKELY NOT PERSIST 
FOR VERY LONG OR MAKE IT INTO THE VALLEY. THEREFORE...ONLY GOING 
WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS MOUNTAIN ZONES IN TENNESSEE AND NORTH 
CAROLINA THROUGH 01Z. 

EXPECT TEMPERATURES TONIGHT TO BE ABOUT 5 TO 7 DEGREES WARMER THAN 
LAST NIGHT MIN TEMPS. MAY EVEN STAY ABOVE 50 AT TRI CITIES. HAVE 
FOLLOWED A BLEND OF THE MET AND MAV GUIDANCE. AM SLIGHTLY CONCERNED 
ABOUT SOME MIST OR FOG AS RH TIME HEIGHT PLOTS INDICATE SUFFICIENT 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AT TRI CITIES. WILL NOT MENTION IN ZONES AS 
VISIBILITY RESTRICTIONS SHOULD REMAIN ABOVE 4 MILES. MAIN PLACEMENT 
OF THIS FOG SHOULD BE NEAR BODIES OF WATER IN THE REGION.

TOMORROW...EXPECT TO SEE A WARMER DAY AS TEMPERATURES WARM TO MID 
80S SOUTH TO NEAR 80 NORTH. THIS IS VERY CLOSE TO THE MAV GUIDANCE. 
ONCE AGAIN...MAY SEE SOME CONVECTION DEVELOP AFTER 2 PM TOMORROW IN 
THE MOUNTAINS. WITH GREATER INSTABILITY THAN TUESDAY AFTERNOON IN 
THE VALLEY ON WEDNESDAY...MAY SEE SOME SHOWERS MAKE THEIR WAY 
BRIEFLY INTO THE VALLEY LOCATIONS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS. 
HOWEVER...HAVE KEPT POPS AT THIS TIME OUT OF OUR VERIFICATION SITES. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPR LOW CURRENTLY 
SPINNING OVR WY WITH FAIRLY STOUT RIDGING TO ITS EAST. STRONG JET FM 
THE W PROGGED TO ACT AS KICKER...CRUSHING UPR LOW THROUGH TOP PART 
OF UPR RIDGE. UPPER TROUGH/LOW REACHES IOWA EARLY THU WITH SFC 
REFLECTION ACROSS OHIO RIVER VLY. SO WARMING TREND CONTINUES WITH 
INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND CHC SHWRS ON THU. MODEL SOLUTION DIVERGE 
ARND 18Z THU. GFS/ECMWF AND THE NOGAPS PREFER TO DROP UPR LOW 
SOUTHWARD ALONG E EDGE OF LARGE W CST RIDGE. NAM/GEM/UKMET PREFER A 
MORE SERLY TRACK MORE IN LINE WITH FLOW ARND NE U.S. LOW
WHICH TAKES THE SYSTEM TO A FAVORABLE PCPN SET UP FOR MRX CWA 
THU/FRI. HAVE GONE WITH A BLEND OF SOLUTION BUT FEEL POPS MAY NEED 
TO BE INCREASE THU/FRI WITH LATER PACKAGES. SEE PMDHMD FOR DETAILED 
MODEL DISCUSSION. WEAK FRONT MOVES INTO AREA AND RIDGE AXIS ALOFT 
SLIDES SE OF E TN ON SAT. SO PCPN CHC SHOULD DECLINE AND TEMPS COOL 
FOR THE WEEKEND. COOL HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BUILD DOWN ON E 
SIDE OF APPALACHIANS EARLY NEXT WEEK. WILL LIKELY SEE A STRONG 
TEMPERATURE GRADIENT ALONG TN/NC STATE LINE.

.DISCUSSION...MORNING VISIBLE SAT PIX SHOWS SOME OF OUR RIVER 
VALLEYS IN THE NORTHEAST HAD SOME PATCHY FOG COVER BUT THAT HAS 
SINCE BURNED OFF AND ALL OF THE FORECAST AREA IS NOW UNDER MOSTLY 
SUNNY TO SUNNY SKIES. CURRENT TRENDS FROM AROUND THE AREA SHOW 
TEMPERATURES RISING QUICKLY INTO THE MID AND UPPER 50S. 06Z GFS 
INDICATED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF -TSRA IN OUR MOUNTAINOUS COUNTIES IN TN 
AND NC TODAY. AGREE WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST ON THIS POSSIBILITY AFTER 
18Z TODAY AS MOISTURE FLUX DIVERGENCE CHARTS SHOW GOOD MOISTURE 
CONVERGENCE AT LOW LEVELS BETWEEN 925 AND 850 MB. GIVEN EXPECTED 
GOOD HEATING TODAY...WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOME CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT IN THE MOUNTAINS. MOVEMENT OF THESE -TSRA INTO THE 
VALLEY DOES NOT APPEAR LIKELY AS THETA-E VALUES DECREASE APPRECIABLY 
NORTHEAST OF THE TN/NC BORDER AND WILL THEREFORE NOT MENTION POPS IN 
THE VALLEYS.

ON THE UPDATE...WILL BE RAISING MAX TEMPS SLIGHTLY IN NC AND SW VA

315 AM EDT TUE MAY 17 2005

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE THAT AN UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD ACROSS 
THE MS RIVER VALLEY THROUGH MID WEEK...KEEPING DRY AND TRANQUIL 
WEATHER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH WEDNESDAY. A MOIST 
SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW ACROSS THE CAROLINAS WILL HELP TO PRODUCE SOME 
WEAK INSTABILITY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS LATER TODAY AND AGAIN ON 
WEDNESDAY. THIS INSTABILITY SHOULD RESULT IN THE FORMATION OF SOME 
ISOLATED DIURNAL CONVECTION ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS...BUT WITH AN 
ABSENCE OF STRONG TRIGGERING MECHANISMS...THINK THAT THIS ISOLATED 
CONVECTION SHOULD REMAIN CONFINED TO THE MOUNTAINS. 

THIS UPPER RIDGE IS PROGGED TO BREAK DOWN BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AS A 
STRONG UPPER LOW DEVELOPS OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY AND MOVES 
SOUTH ACROSS THE MS RIVER VALLEY. NAM AND GFS MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE TRACK OF THIS UPPER LOW INTO THE LOWER MS RIVER 
VALLEY BY THURSDAY NIGHT...BUT THE NAM SOLUTION REVEALS A WEAKER 
UPPER LOW COMPARED TO THE GFS SOLUTION. THINK THAT THE NAM SOLUTION 
WILL BE MORE REALISTIC SINCE THE GFS USUALLY SHOWS A BIAS TOWARD 
OVER-AMPLIFYING SYSTEMS IN THE MEDIUM FORECAST RANGES (DAYS 3 
THROUGH 5). THUS...WILL MENTION ONLY CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY. THIS UPPER LOW GETS CUT OFF FROM THE MAIN FLOW BY SATURDAY 
AND GRADUALLY DISSIPATES OVER THE GULF COASTAL REGION. BOTH THE NAM 
AND GFS MODELS INDICATE ONLY WEAK INSTABILITY DEVELOPING ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA FOR THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...SO THINK THE THREAT OF 
SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE LOW THROUGH THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE TO CURRENT 
FORECAST. SFC RIDGE AXIS REMAINS WEST OF AREA AS IT PULLS NE AND 
WEAKENS. WENT BELOW MOS NUMBERS FOR DPS AND MIN TEMPS FOR TONIGHT 
ESPECIALLY NORTH AREAS AS THE RIDGE CONTINUES TO NUDGE IN. IMPULSE 
ALOFT DRIVING FAIRLY DENSE CIRRUS ACROSS AREA THIS AFTN. EXPECT THIS 
FEATURE TO SUPPRESS SOUTH AS IT MOVES EAST OVERNIGHT. WARMING TREND 
GETS GOING TOMORROW WITH LIMITED CLOUDS.   

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...QUIET 
CONDITIONS CONTINUE THROUGH THE MEDIUM RANGE AS SURFACE RIDGE 
MAINTAINS ITS HOLD ON AREA WEATHER. MAY SEE A BRIEF SHOWER ON 
WEDNESDAY OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN AS THE RIDGE SHIFTS TO THE EAST OF 
THE AREA. ONLY INCLUDED A 20 PERCENT CHANCE AT BEST ACROSS OUR 
MOUNTAIN ZONES. TEMPERATURES WILL SLOWLY CONTINUE TO WARM AS HEIGHTS 
RISE THROUGH THE MEDIUM RANGE. HAVE FOLLOWED A BLEND OF THE NAM AND 
GFS MOS TO CREATE TEMP FORECAST.

THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY....OPERATIONAL MODELS INDICATE A RATHER ODD 
SCENARIO FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. AN UPPER LEVEL LOW IS PROGGED TO 
DIVE SOUTHWARD OUT OF THE HIGH PLAINS ON THURSDAY TOWARD THE GULF 
COAST. THIS APPEARS TO BE CAUSED BY A EAST TO WEST TILT OF A UPPER 
RIDGE OVER THE ROCKIES AND THE NEAR STATIONARY UPPER LEVEL TROF ON 
THE EAST COAST. JET FLOWS IN THE GFS ARE VERY WEAK SO I AM UNCERTAIN 
IF THIS WILL OCCUR. A COUPLE OF REASONS SUPPORT GOING WITH THIS 
UNUSUAL FEATURE. FIRST THE OPERATIONAL MODELS (GFS ECMWF UKMET AND 
DGEX) ALL INDICATE THAT AN UPPER LOW WILL DIVE SOUTHWARD OUT OF THE 
HIGH PLAINS. WHERE THEY DIFFER IS ON THE TRACK OF THIS 
AFOREMENTIONED LOW. AGREE WITH HPC THAT GFS HAS HAD BETTER RUN TO 
RUN CONSISTENCY OF THIS SITUATION. THAT BEING SAID...THERE STILL IS 
RUN TO RUN INCONSISTENCIES IN THE GFS. THE 00Z GFS HAD THE LOW 
MOVING WELL INTO THE WESTERN GULF. THE 06Z GFS HAD THE LOW MOVING 
INTO THE DEEP SOUTH AND GETTING ABSORBED BACK INTO THE MAIN FLOW 
OVER THE CAROLINAS. THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE WITH THE 12Z GFS AND NAM 
BOTH TEND TO AGREE MORE WITH A TRACK OF THIS UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVING 
FROM NORTH DAKOTA ON THURSDAY MORNING TO THE GULF COAST BY FRIDAY 
NIGHT. THIS IS INLINE WITH THE 00Z GFS. THEREFORE FOR THIS PERIOD OF 
THE FORECAST...HAVE LEANED CLOSER TO THE 00Z GFS AS ITS MOVEMENT IS 
MORE PREFERRED AND INDICATES A PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT OF THE SYSTEM. 

FOR WEATHER...WILL INCREASE POPS THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON THURSDAY AS 
GFS AND NAM BOTH INDICATE HIGH AMOUNTS OF OMEGA LIFT OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA BY 18Z THURSDAY. THIS MEANS THAT BY THE TIME WE GET 
INTO FRIDAY WE WILL HAVE TO DRASTICALLY RAISE POPS TO 50 TO 60 
PERCENT CWA WIDE...ESPECIALLY IN THE MORNING. INTO FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING...UPPER LOW WILL BE MOVING TO MY SOUTHWEST. THIS WILL 
ALLOW POPS TO SLOWLY DECREASE INTO THE OVERNIGHT ON FRIDAY. I AM 
STILL BELOW MEX MOS AND HPC PROGS. THIS IS INTENTIONALLY DONE 
BECAUSE THERE IS STILL SOME HIGH UNCERTAINTY DESPITE THE 12Z GFS 
COMING IN SO CLOSE TO THE 00Z GFS. AS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVES INTO 
THE DEEP SOUTH ON FRIDAY...WILL BEGIN TO LOWER POPS INTO SATURDAY 
MORNING WITH A POSSIBLE FRONTAL PASSAGE. BEHIND THIS FRONT ON 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON...SKIES WILL CLEAR FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AND 
TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE TO WARM ABOVE THE MID 70S. HOWEVER...WILL 
KEEP ON A SLIGHT CHANCE POPS NORTH TO CHANCE SOUTH THROUGH SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON AS COOLER AIR ALOFT MAY SQUEEZE OUT A FEW SHOWERS IN 
AFTERNOON HEATING.

SUNDAY AT THIS POINT LOOKS TRANQUIL. CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE 
SUNDAY NIGHT AS A RAPIDLY MOVING FRONT IS FORECAST TO MOVE THROUGH 
THE REGION. DUE TO THIS BEING IN THE FAR EXTENDED ON MONDAY HAVE 
ONLY MENTIONED SLIGHT CHANCE TSRA AS MOISTURE SUPPORT IS LIMITED.

SINCE THE MAIN EVENT IS PLANNED TO BE ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...WILL 
NOT ISSUE ANY STATEMENTS FOR POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE WEATHER BUT WILL 
MENTION THAT THREAT HERE. FORECAST SOUNDINGS ON THE ETA AND GFS BOTH 
INDICATE RATHER STEEP LAPSE RATES AROUND 8C/KM BETWEEN 850 AND 700 
MB. COUPLED WITH WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS AROUND 9500 FT FOR TRI AND 
11000 FOR CHA...HAIL WILL POSSIBLY BE A THREAT FOR ANY STORM THAT 
CAN GROW SOUTH OF THE SURFACE BOUNDARY...WHEREVER IT SETS UP. AN 
INVERTED V-NOTCH ON THESE SOUNDINGS ALSO INDICATES AN ISOLATED 
STRONG WIND THREAT. LATER SHIFTS WILL NEED TO WATCH THIS DEVELOPING 
SITUATION AND ISSUE STATEMENTS ACCORDINGLY.

OVER THE FORECAST AREA AS LEFT OVER LOW LEVEL MOISTURE HAS NOT QUITE

WINDS OF ABOUT 10 MPH SO DONT THINK CLOUDS WILL INCREASE BUT 
GRADUALLY DECREASE AS THE EVENING PROGRESSES. SOME HIGH LEVEL 
MOISTURE IS STREAMING INTO THE TN VALLEY FROM COMPLEX OF STORMS IN 
TEXAS BUT THIS WILL DECREASE LATER AS ACTIVITY DECREASES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...LAST BIT OF SHOWERS 
HAVE FINALLY EASED JUST EAST OF THE TN AND NC STATE LINE THIS 
AFTERNOON.  HOWEVER..BROAD 500 MB TROUGH AXIS IS STILL TO OUR WEST 
AND A GOOD AMOUNT OF CUMULUS CLOUDS REFORMED IN THE CLEAR AREA 
BEHIND THE COLD FRONT.  GENERALLY STARTED SKIES OUT AS PARTLY CLOUDY 
IN THE GRIDS...THEN ALLOWED FOR SOME CLEARING OVERNIGHT.  I KEPT IN 
PATCHY FOG FOR CONTINUITY...BUT NOT SOLD ON WIDESPREAD DENSE FOG 
SINCE...1) THE RAINS YESTERDAY AND OVERNIGHT WERE NOT AS HEAVY OR 
SOLID IN COVERAGE AS EXPECTED...AND 2) THINK THAT WINDS MAY STAY UP 
JUST ENOUGH TO ALLOW SOME OF THE DRIER AIR COMING IN TO MIX INTO THE 
BOUNDARY LAYER.  DEW POINTS FALLING NICELY INTO THE 40S OVER MIDDLE 
TN AND CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SO MOS MINS MAINLY IN THE 40S LOOKS GOOD.

FOR LATER PART OF THE SHORT TERM...NW FLOW ALOFT AS UPPER RIDGE 
GRADUALLY BUILDS EAST...AND SURFACE RIDGE MAINLY TO THE W AND N TO 
PROVIDE GENERALLY LIGHT NORTH WINDS.  A DRY FORECAST BUT NOT TOTALLY 
CLOUD-FREE...AS THE 850 MB FLOW BRINGS SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
FOR AT LEAST SCATTERED CUMULUS (LOW) CLOUDS IN THE DAYTIME.  ALLOWED 
FOR MORE CLOUDS IN THE FAVORED TERRAIN AREAS ON MONDAY...THEN LESS 
ON TUESDAY ACROSS THE BOARD.  VERY PLEASANT 60S AND 70S FOR HIGHS 
MONDAY...FOLLOWED BY SLIGHT WARMING ON TUESDAY.  OTHERWISE...40S AND 
50S AT NIGHT ARE TOUGH TO BEAT.    


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...WILL CONTINUE IDEA OF A 
DRY FCST FOR WED DAYTIME PERIOD AS DRY NW UPPER FLO EXISTS ON 
BACKSIDE OF DEPARTING UPR TROF. NEXT MAJOR WAVE WITH FRONTAL SYSTEM 
PRESSES THRU THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY AND INTO THE REGION THU 
INTO FRI AND RAISED POPS FOR SHRA/TSRA SLIGHTLY TO HIGH CHC MAINLY 
NRN PART OF THE FA FOR THIS POSSIBILITY. WILL DRY OUT MOST OF THE 
REGION ON FRI BUT MODELS SHOW SOME TRAILING S/WV ENERGY DROPPING SE 
ACROSS SW VA/NE TN ON THE BACK SIDE OF UPR TROF TO KEEP CHC TO SLGT 
CHC POPS FOR -SHRA ALIVE IN THIS REGION. HAD TO USE A SLGT CHC POP 
FOR SAT AS ANOTHER COLD UPR LOW FINDS A HOME OVR THE ERN GREAT 
LAKES/NERN U.S. WITH VORTS ROTATING AROUND THIS FEATURE. FINALLY 
BACK TO A DRY REGIME FOR ENTIRE FA ON SUN ALTHOUGH MAJOR MODEL 
UNCERTAINTY EXISTS ESPECIALLY AT THIS LONG TIME RANGE SO CHANGES MAY 
OCCUR LATE IN THE WEEKEND AS GFS TRIES TO USE AN UPR LOW OVR THE LWR 
MS VLY COMPLETE WITH INVERTED SFC TROF ALONG WITH ISENTROPICALLY

MODIFIED 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS INDICATED POSITIVE CAPES OF 1000

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MID MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY WITH A PRE- 
FRONTAL LINE OF CONVECTION ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. LOCAL 
RADARS INDICATE THAT EARLIER CONVECTION HAS DISSIPATED ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE LOCAL AIRMASS WILL BECOME 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING AHEAD OF THE COLD 
FRONT...BUT VERTICAL WIND PROFILES AND UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS ARE 
PROGGED TO BE MODEST. DUE TO THE MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS...A FEW 
TSTORMS SHOULD BECOME SEVERE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH THE 
MAIN THREATS BEING DAMAGING WINDS...LARGE HAIL AND LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL. ALTHOUGH VERTICAL WIND PROFILES ARE PROGGED TO BE MODEST 
TODAY...WILL PLAN TO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ISOLATED WEAK 
TORNADO OR TWO IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK...SINCE A DECENT 
AMOUNT OF CAPE WILL BE LOCATED NEAR THE SURFACE (BELOW 1 KM) WITH 
RELATIVELY LOW LIFTED CONDENSATION LEVELS EXPECTED. IN THIS KIND OF 
AIRMASS...ITS POSSIBLE THAT A FEW WEAK TORNADOES COULD SPIN UP 
ALONG PRE-EXISTING OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...SCATTERED SHOWERS LINGER 
BEHIND DEPARTING SURFACE COLD FRONT SUNDAY MORNING...MAINLY IN 
MOUNTAINS AND FAR EASTERN SECTIONS OF FORECAST AREA. SHORT RANGE 
ENSEMBLES ARE SLIGHTLY SLOWER WITH THIS PROCESS. UPPER TROUGH SLOWLY 
PULLS AWAY ALLOWING HEIGHTS TO RISE MARGINALLY. FLOW PROJECTED TO 
REMAIN NORTHWESTERLY ALOFT UNTIL AROUND 00Z THURSDAY WHEN MINOR 
RIDGING BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS WILL RESULT IN

957 AM EDT FRI MAY 13 2005

.DISCUSSION...YESTERDAYS WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS DIFFICULT TO 
LOCATE TO ME...BASED ON EITHER A WIND OR DEW POINT ANALYSIS.  UPPER 
AIR PLOTS SHOW VERY WARM 850 MB TEMPS ACROSS OUR REGION WITH MAIN 
BAROCLINIC ZONE FROM ERN OHIO VALLEY TO THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. 
THUS...DONT EXPECT THE WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY TO BE MUCH OF A FACTOR 
TODAY...LEAVING TERRAIN TO BE THE MAIN FOCUS FOR CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT.  PLOTS ALSO SHOW THAT THE UPPER RIDGE HAS SHIFTED JUST 
TO OUR SE...ALLOWING SLIGHTLY BETTER STEERING WINDS FOR STORMS TODAY
WITH A N TO NE MOTION AROUND 10 KNOTS EXPECTED.  

MODIFIED 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW SLIGHT TO MODERATE 
INSTABILITY WITH MAX TEMPS TOPPING OUT AGAIN WELL INTO THE 80S.  
CAPES GENERALLY OF 1000 J/KG (RNK) TO PERHAPS AS HIGH AS 2500 J/KG 
FOR MODIFIED OHX SOUNDING.  FREEZING/WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS 
RELATIVELY HIGH TODAY...AS IS THE EQUILIBRIUM LEVEL...SO SEVERE 
THREAT LOOKS MINIMAL.  I MAY ADJUST THE POPS SLIGHTLY IN THE MORNING 
UPDATE TO BE SURE TO HAVE CHANCE POPS IN ALL OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
AREAS...WITH SOME WEAK CONVECTION ALREADY TRYING TO START IN THE SRN 
MTNS.  PROBABLY WILL KEEP VALLEY/LOWER ELEVATIONS IN THE ISOLATED 
CATEGORY OF POPS.  

OTHERWISE...THINKING THAT PERSISTENCE ON MAX TEMPS TODAY IS A GOOD 
BET.  AFTER PLOTTING YESTERDAYS HIGHS...MAY NUDGE MAX TEMPS UP A 
FEW DEGREES IN MANY AREAS.  FULL UPDATE OF ZFP...GRIDS AND WEB 
PRODUCTS BY 11 AM EDT.

CONVECTIVE TEMPS ARE RELATIVELY LOW TODAY AND MOISTURE NOT 
IMPRESSIVE, BUT ADEQUATE, HAVE LEFT MENTION OF SHOWERS AND

.DISCUSSION...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AND
DIMINISH THIS EVENING DUE TO LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. A STATIONARY FRONT
IS LOCATED ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA.  RADAR SHOWS
AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MOVING SOUTH ACROSS THE KNOXVILLE AREA.  THESE BOUNDARIES
MAY PRODUCE AN ISOLATED SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM OVERNIGHT...BUT OVERALL A
DRY REST OF THE NIGHT IS ANTICIPATED.

WHERE RAIN OCCURRED THIS EVENING...AREAS OF FOG WILL BE POSSIBLE...SOME
MAY BE LOCALLY DENSE.  SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE HAVE THE
GREATEST POTENTIAL OF SEEING DENSE FOG OVERNIGHT.

CURRENT FORECAST LOWS LOOK GOOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...WEAK FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY JUST TO OUR NORTH HAS BEEN THE MAIN AREA OF LOW LEVEL 
CONVERGENCE THIS AFTERNOON.  PREVIOUS FORECAST AND GRIDS WERE SET UP 
WELL TO HANDLE THIS WEAK BOUNDARY SAGGING SOUTH OVERNIGHT.  DECIDED 
TO INCLUDE LOW POPS IN ALL AREAS TONIGHT...DUE IN PART TO THE AMOUNT 
OF INSTABILITY (AS TEMPS HAVE CLIMBED WELL INTO THE 80 TO 90 DEGREE 
RANGE) AND SOME ISOLATED STRONG STORMS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE 
SEQUATCHIE VALLEY COUNTIES...WHERE NO RAIN CHANCES WERE EARLIER 
INCLUDED.  STORMS IN THIS AREA ARE UNDERNEATH THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE 
WHERE STEERING WINDS ARE EXTREMELY LIGHT...SO EXPECT JUST A SLOW 
SOUTHWARD DRIFT OF THIS ACTIVITY OVER SE TN.  

OTHERWISE...THE WEAK BOUNDARY LIFTS NE TOMORROW...WHICH LEAVES NO 
CLEAR FOCUS FOR STORM DEVELOPMENT (OTHER THAN TERRAIN) UNTIL THE 
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND COLD FRONT APPROACH BY LATE SATURDAY.  ONLY 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE TO SLIGHTLY INCREASE RAIN CHANCES FROM THE 
WEST SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  TIMING STILL LOOKS GOOD FOR 
BRUNT OF SHOWERS/STORMS TO END EARLY SUNDAY MORNING.  FAVORED THE 
SLIGHTLY WARMER HIGH TEMPS...MORE TOWARD A PERSISTENCE FORECAST THAN 
CLIMO. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...CD FNT PROGGED TO SHIFT SE 
THRU FA EARLY SUN TAKING CHC SHRA/TSRA WITH IT. HOWEVER...BLENDED 
SLGT/SMALL CHC POPS WITH GFE NEIGHBORS WHICH PROVIDES BUFFER IN THE 
EVENT THAT FNT MOVES A LITTLE SLOWER. PERIOD OF COOLER/DRIER WX IN 
STORE BEHIND THIS SYSTEM AS UPR TROF PROGRESSES E ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES AND NERN U.S. WITH SFC RIDGE PRESSING E ACROSS THE MIDDLE 
ATLANTIC STATES ON TUE. DRY REGIME EXTENDS BASICALLY THROUGH TUE 
ALTHOUGH USED SLGT CHC POPS ACROSS THE MTNS AS NW FLO ENHANCES 
OROGRAPHIC LIFT. INTRODUCED SMALL/SLGT CHC POPS ACROSS SW VA/NE TN

SHOWS THIS BOUNDARY MOVING SLOWLY SOUTH ACROSS KENTUCKY OVERNIGHT.
I EXPECT INCREASING CLOUDS...ESPECIALLY NORTH SECTIONS OVERNIGHT...
BUT CONVECTION SHOULD HOLD NORTH OF THE REGION UNTIL DAYBREAK. MIDNIGHT
SHIFT MAY WANT TO UP POPS FOR THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY AS OUTFLOW
BOUNDARIES AND APPROACHING COLD FRONT WILL INCREASE THE COVERAGE OF
STORMS FOR TOMORROW.

.SHORT TERM...UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM WILL MOVE EAST OF AREA OVER THE 
NEXT FEW HOURS...AND IT PRESENTS ONE OF THOSE TIMING PROBLEMS.  IT 
WILL NOT BE RAINING EXCEPT FOR IN THE FAR NE PART OF OUR CWA COME 6 
PM...BUT IT IS RAINING IN A LARGER AREA AT THIS TIME.  I DECIDED TO 
STICK WITH THE CONCEPT OF A FORECAST...NOT A NOWCAST...AND GO WITH 
THE WEATHER AS I EXPECT IT TO LOOK AT THE START OF THE TONIGHT 
PERIOD.  AS SYSTEM MOVES AWAY, SHOULD SEE SOME CLEARING SKIES 
TONIGHT...AND THAT WILL LEAD TO FOG FORMATION BY EARLY MORNING.  
COULD BE FAIRLY LOW VSBYS FROM 10 TO 13Z...BUT EXPECT THAT ANYTHING 
UNDER 1 MILE WILL BE VERY LOCALIZED.

CHANCE OF RAIN FOR TOMORROW NOW LOOKS VERY LOW AND DID NOT MENTION.  
GUIDANCE TEMPS WERE REASONABLE AND WERE FOLLOWED CLOSELY.  WINDS 
WILL BE VERY LIGHT NEXT 24 HOURS.  LOTS OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL 
BE LEFT IN PLACE...AND THEREFORE OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL NOT BE AS LOW 
AS THEY HAVE BEEN RECENTLY.


.LONG TERM...(WED NIGHT THROUGH TUE)...UPPER TROUGH/ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT STILL PROJECTED TO PASS THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS 
WEEKEND. HOWEVER...DISCREPANCIES IN TIMING BETWEEN MEDIUM RANGE 
MODELS AND ENSEMBLES CAST DOUBT ON EXACT PROGRESSION OF THIS FEATURE 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. ECMWF IS CONSIDERABLY SLOWER THAN GFS 
WITH THIS PROGRESSION. THE CANADIAN GEM AND NOGAPS TENDS TO SUPPORT 
THE SLOWER ECMWF. THUS HAVE TENDED TO FAVOR ECMWF TIMING. 
HOWEVER...HAVE EXPANDED PRECIP CHANCES THROUGH MUCH OF SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY DUE TO UNCERTAINTY. HAVE OPTED FOR DRY FORECAST FOR EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...BUT AGAIN CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH.

LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD AS UPPER RIDGE AXIS IS PROJECTED TO REMAIN 
ANCHORED OVER THE APPALACHIANS AND KEEP APPROACHING MIDWESTERN

.LONG TERM...(MON NIGHT THROUGH SUN)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT IN 
BRINGING UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE AREA FROM THE WEST MON NIGHT 
THROUGH TUE NIGHT.  MOISTURE AND FORCING LOOK UNIMPRESSIVE...BUT 
ENOUGH TO COMBINE WITH INCREASING INSTABILITY TO INCLUDE SLIGHT CHANCE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...RAIN EVENT COMES TO AN END IN 
THE FIRST PERIOD AS UPPER TROUGH MOVES TO THE ATLANTIC COAST AND UP 
THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD. MODEL TIME HEIGHTS DEPICT SIGNIFICANT 
LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE LINGERS BEHIND DEPARTING UPPER TROUGH WHICH MAKES 
ANY SIGNIFICANT CLEARING DOUBTFUL UNTIL THE SECOND PERIOD AT THE EARLIEST. 
HOWEVER...LACK OF ANY LIFT DEPICTED IN THE TIME HEIGHTS SUGGESTS 
PRECIP WILL END BY AROUND OR SHORTLY AFTER 03Z IN ALL AREAS. UPPER 
RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE REGION IN THE SECOND PERIOD WITH GOOD HEIGHT 
RISES PROJECTED. THE RISING HEIGHTS ALONG WITH ANTICIPATED CLEARING 
SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO WARM NICELY TOMORROW. GENERALLY FAVORED BLEND 
OF GUIDANCE VALUES FOR TEMPS.

.LONG TERM...(FRI NIGHT THROUGH THU)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT 
THAT UPPER RIDGE WILL BEGIN BUILDING OVER THE AREA FRI NIGHT AND 
WILL CONTINUE INTO SUNDAY. WILL GO WITH DRY CONDITIONS AND MOSTLY 
CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS FRIDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY.  BY MONDAY 
NIGHT NEXT UPPER TROUGH WILL APPROACH...WILL CARRY LOW CHANCE TO 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MON NIGHT THROUGH TUE NIGHT WITH THIS 
SYSTEM.  AN UPPER RIDGE EXPECTED TO BUILD INTO THE REGION AGAIN WED 
AND THU...WILL GO DRY BOTH DAYS.   WILL NOT STRAY TOO FAR FROM GFS

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE RIDGING THAT WILL 
DOMINATE THE PATTERN FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS WILL WEAKEN JUST 
ENOUGH TODAY TO ALLOW SHOWERS TO MOVE NORTHWARD INTO MUCH OF THE 
CWA.  POPS WILL BE HIGHEST TO THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST...WITH LOWER 
POPS IN NE TN AND SW VA.  EXPECT CONSIDERABLE CLOUD COVER TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...AND THIS WILL HELP HOLD HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE 60S ALL 
AREAS...EXCEPT COOLER IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  LOWS TONIGHT WILL 
RANGE FROM NEAR 50 IN THE SOUTH TO THE LOWER 40S IN THE NORTH AND AT 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

EXPECT LIGHT QPF AMOUNTS TODAY INTO THIS EVENING DUE TO DRY AIR AT 
LOW LEVELS AND NOT TOO MUCH IN THE WAY OF ADVECTION ABLE TO KICK IN 
BEFORE THE INFLUENCE OF THE UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM SLIPS OFF TO THE 
EAST.  SHOWERS WILL BE TAPERING OFF BEFORE SUNRISE FRIDAY.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...ON FRIDAY MOISTURE WEST OF 
SMOKIES HANGS IN AS COOLER/DRIER AIR INFILTRATES EAST OF MOUNTAINS.  
ETA LEAVES DEW POINTS HIGH ENOUGH TO BE UNSTABLE IN THE 
AFTERNOON...BUT THINK VALUES ARE TOO HIGH AND SUBSIDENCE BEHIND TROF 
AXIS WILL HELP SUPPRESS CONVECTION.  NOT INSERTING ANY POPS AT THIS 
TIME.

RIDGE MOVES IN FOR THE WEEKEND.  THINKING AHEAD...MIGHT HAVE SOME 
FOG SATURDAY MORNING...BUT NOT CONVINCED IT WOULD BE THICK ENOUGH TO 
MENTION IN PRODUCTS THIS FAR AHEAD OF TIME. 

NEXT TROF SWEEPS INTO AREA LATE MONDAY OR TUESDAY DEPENDING ON 
TIMING.  HAVE BOOSTED THE POPS FOR MONDAY NIGHT.  ALSO FOR TUESDAY 
MORNING HAVE BUMPED UP MIN TEMPS AS CLOUDS AND RELATIVELY BREEZY 
CONDITIONS COUNTERACT RADIATIONAL COOLING.

WITH MORE CLOUDINESS UPSTREAM CLOSER TO THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH.  
EXPECT THAT PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES MIGHT WORK ACROSS THE BOARD

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...SKIES REMAIN MOSTLY SUNNY 
THIS AFTERNOON AS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE EASTERN GREAT 
LAKES CONTINUES A DRY NORTHEAST FLOW ACROSS THE TN VALLEY AND 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WAS MOST EVIDENT IN THE 
NORTHEAST WITH CU FORMATION BUT SKIES HAVE QUICKLY SCATTERED OUT. 
HIGH CLOUDINESS WAS SPREADING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN PART 
OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

GFS/NAM NOT IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH NEXT SYSTEM. A SOUTHERN  
SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER EAST TX IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST 
ACROSS THE GULF COAST TONIGHT AND THURSDAY WHILE A STATIONARY FRONT 
CONTINUES OVER THE GULF AND FLORIDA. THE SHORTWAVE IS EXPECTED TO 
FORM A WEAK LOW ALONG THE FRONT AND MOVE IT TO THE NORTHEAST OFF  
THE SOUTHEAST US COAST BY THURSDAY EVENING. THE NAM BRINGS THE 
MOISTURE MUCH FARTHER NORTH AND WEST THAN THE GFS. HAVE NOT CHANGED 
THE FORECAST MUCH AS THE GFS HAS BEEN MORE CONSISTENT. HAVE REMOVED 
POPS TONIGHT. WITH CURRENT LOW DEWPOINTS WENT BELOW ALL GUIDANCE ON 
LOWS A FEW DEGREES. HIGH CLOUDS SPREADING IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST 
AHEAD OF SOUTHERN SHORTWAVE SHOULD NOT LOWER UNTIL THE LATE NIGHT OR 
EARLY MORNING HOURS. PUT LIKELY POPS ACROSS SW NC AND THEN 40 
PERCENT CHANCE IN THE REST OF THE MOUNTAINS AND 30 PERCENT OR LESS 
IN THE VALLEYS AND PLATEAU. THICKENING CLOUDS THURSDAY SHOULD KEEP 
HIGHS COOL AGAIN TOMORROW MAINLY IN THE LOWER TO MID 60S...JUST 
BELOW MAV GUIDANCE.   

.LONG TERM...(THU NIGHT THROUGH WED)...GFS/NAM IN POOR AGREEMENT FOR 
THU NIGHT THROUGH SAT.  NAM APPEARS TO BE AN OUTLIER IN ITS HANDLING 
OF LOW NEAR THE SOUTHEAST COAST THU NIGHT THROUGH FRI NIGHT...WHILE 
THE GFS HAS MUCH BETTER SUPPORT FROM ENSEMBLES AND OTHER MODELS...SO 
WILL FOLLOW HPC LEAD AND GO CLOSE TO GFS SOLUTION.  BY SAT GFS IS 
NOT AS AMPLIFIED WITH THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDING IN...AND HAS 
WEAKENING SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVING SOUTHEAST DOWN THE EAST SIDE OF 
THE RIDGE.  THINK THE GFS MAY BE OVERDONE WITH THIS FEATURE...AND 
EVEN IT HAS NO PRECIP IN OUR AREA SAT.  WILL JUST GO PARTLY CLOUDY 
SAT AFTERNOON RATHER THAN MOSTLY SUNNY FOR NOW...WILL HAVE TO WATCH 
LATER TRENDS.  LOOKS LIKE UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN AND CONTROLS OUR 
WEATHER SUN AND MON...WITH NEXT SYSTEM BRINGING POSSIBILITY OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MON NIGHT THROUGH TUE NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL KEEP THINGS DRY TODAY. 
WATER VAPOR CLEARLY SHOWS NEXT WAVE OVER THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS.
THIS SHORT-WAVE WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
BY THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. THE NAM AND GFS CONTINUE TO DIFFER
GREATLY ON THE CHANCES OF RAIN WITH THIS SYSTEM. NAM IS MORE AGRESSIVE
IN BRINGING MOISTURE NORTH INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY...WHILE THE GFS
TENDS TO KEEP THE RAINFALL EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. 

WILL CONTINUE GFS TREND IN THE ZONES WITH ONLY 20-30 PERCENT CHANCE...
EXCEPT FOR 40-60 PERCENT FOR FAR EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND SOUTWEST
NORTH CAROLINA.

.LONG TERM...UPPER RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE AREA THIS WEEKEND AS UPPER TROUGH
EXITS THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES. GOOD HEIGHT RISES WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES
TO WARM TO AT OR ABOVE NORMAL BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGING
WILL ALSO DRY THINGS OUT WITH FAIRLY DECENT DIURNAL SWINGS IN THE
TEMPERATURES ANTICIPATED. SURFACE RIDGE MOVES EAST OF THE REGION BY TUESDAY
AND WEDNESDAY ALLOWING BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE TO RETURN.  SOME DIURNAL
CONVECTION IS POSSIBLE BY MONDAY...ESPECIALLY NEAR TERRAIN FEATURES...

.SHORT TERM...
HIGH PRESSURE STILL TRYING TO SETTLE INTO REGION.  LOOKING LIKE 
ANOTHER ROUND OF FROST POSSIBLE...WITH BEST CHANCES IN THE NORTHERN 
SECTIONS.  ALL MODELS ARE RUNNING SFC DEW POINTS TOO HIGH RIGHT NOW 
AND SOURCE REGION FOR AREA...NW-NE...OVERNIGHT SHOULD NOT PUMP IN 
ANY HIGHER DEW POINTS.  SO WILL KNOCK DOWN TD/S ACROSS ENTIRE AREA 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY.  THIS WILL ALSO ALLOW MIN TEMPS TO BE A LITTLE 
COOLER AND ALLOW FROST AGAIN IN MANY AREAS THAT HAD IT LAST NIGHT.

WONDERING ABOUT MID LEVEL CLOUDS FROM THIS MORNING REFORMING.  
MODELS SHOW BEST CHANCES OVER MOUNTAINS TO EAST...SO THINKING A 
LITTLE LESS OF A CHANCE OF FROST THERE EVEN THOUGH HIGH ELEVATION.

FOR THE MOST PART TEMP AND WIND GRIDS HAVE NEEDED FEW CHANGES.

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...MODELS IN POOR 
AGREEMENT WITH TRACK THE OF NEXT SYSTEM PROGGED INTO THE REGION ON 
THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT.  FOR NOW...WILL CONTINUE WITH A 
COMPROMISE SOLUTION WHICH PLACES THE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS ALONG 
OUR EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND LOWER POPS TO THE WEST.  SYSTEM MOVES OUT 
ON FRIDAY AS A STRONG RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR THE 
WEEKEND FOR DRY CONDITIONS AND WARMING TEMPERATURES.  MODEL AND RUN 
TO RUN CONSISTENCY CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THE HANDLING OF THE 
WEATHER SYSTEM PROGGED INTO THE THE AREA AROUND THE MONDAY/TUESDAY 
TIME FRAME.  CONFIDENCE IS LOW WITH THE HANDLING OF THIS SYSTEM SO 
FOR NOW WILL KEEP POPS LOW AND CONFINE PRECIP CHANCES TO TUESDAY.

THE AREA THIS MORNING...WITH GOOD COVERAGE ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
PLATEAU...TAPERING TO TRACE AMOUNTS IN THE TRI-CITIES.  ALL COUNTIES 
IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA REPORTED FROST AS WELL.  NO FROST WAS REPORTED 
IN THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS.

NOW ABUNDANT SUNSHINE AND LIGHT WINDS GETTING QUICK WARMUP STARTED.

EXPECTING GOOD COVERAGE OF CUMULUS FIELD AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON.  
WOULD EXPECT DEEPER CUMULUS ACROSS NORTH WHERE 850-700 LAPSE RATE AT 
ABOUT 8 DEG/KM VERSUS SOUTHERN AREAS WHERE IT IS ONLY ABOUT 4.5 
DEG/KM.

MID LEVEL CLOUDS IN SRN KY AND NORTHERN MID TN TRYING TO MOVE 
IN...BUT ARE ERODING ON LEADING EDGE.  THINK THIS EROSION WILL 
CONTINUE AS BOUNDARY LAYER CONTINUES TO DEEPEN.  

DONT THINK THESE MID CLOUDS WILL MOVE INTO TAF SITES...THEREFORE 
WILL LOWER CLOUD HEIGHTS IN TAFS TO CUMULUS HEIGHTS.

CURRENT GRIDS LOOK GOOD...THINK QUICK WARMUP WILL BE HALTED QUICKLY 
AS CUMULUS ABSORB HEATING FROM SURFACE.

.DISCUSSION...AREAS OF CI/CS AND SOME MID-LEVEL CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO

RIDGING WILL KEEP CONDITIONS DRY.  MOSTLY CLEAR SKY AND LIGHT WINDS
TONIGHT WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO DROP INTO THE MID AND UPPER 30S OVER
NORTHERN THIRD OF THE AREA AND PLATEAU AND FAR EASTERN MOUNTAINS.  WILL
INCLUDE SCATTERED FROST IN THESE AREAS AND ISSUE A SPS FOR TONIGHT.

MODELS DIFFER GREATLY IN RESPECT TO PHASING OF NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM
SHORT-WAVE MOVING TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR THURSDAY. NAM
DEPICTS A STRONGER SHORT-WAVE TROUGH WITH GREATER RETURN MOISTURE AND
PRECIPITATION OVER THE FORECAST AREA. GFS HAS A WEAKER WAVE WITH SURFACE
CYCLOGENSIS OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST...BUT KEEPING MOST OF THE RAIN EAST
OF THE FORECAST AREA.

WILL MAINTAIN CURRENT THINKING AND TREND TOWARD THE GFS MODEL...WHICH
IS ALSO FAVORED BY HPC.  WILL ONLY CALL FOR 20-30 PERCENT POPS FOR
THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT.

FOR THE EXTENDED...AS UPPER TROUGH MOVES EAST FRIDAY...UPPER AND SURFACE
RIDGING WILL BUILD OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
THIS WEEKEND ALLOWING FOR DRY AND WARMER CONDITIONS.  BY MONDAY...MOISTURE
BEGINS TO INCREASE AS UPPER RIDGE FLATTENS.  WILL MAINTAIN CHANCE POPS

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...DRY WEATHER WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY...AS NAM AND GFS MODELS BOTH INDICATE THAT 
MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED WITH A BROAD UPPER TROUGH ON TUESDAY. THIS 
UPPER TROUGH SHOULD BRING JUST AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS ON TUESDAY AS 
IT SWINGS ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WAS 
PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE DEEP SOUTH ON THURSDAY...BRINGING THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A FEW SHOWERS ON THURSDAY. HOWEVER...LATEST GFS MODEL 
RUN INDICATES THAT A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM MAY DEVELOP INSTEAD 
ALONG THE GULF COAST. THIS SCENARIO WOULD LIMIT ANY SURFACE LOW 
DEVELOPMENT OVER THE SOUTHEAST...WHICH WOULD RESULT IN LESS MOISTURE 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THUS...DRY CONDITIONS MAY CONTINUE 
FOR MOST OF THE WEEK. WILL LET LATER SHIFTS DECIDE WHETHER TO REMOVE 
POPS ON THURSDAY...SINCE MODEL CONTINUITY IN THE EXTENDED PERIODS 
HAS BEEN POOR LATELY.

FRONT TO FORM AND MOVE NORTH INTO SW VA AND SOUTHERN KY BY MORNING. 
THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS AS WARM AIR 
IS LIFTED NORTH. THE RUC INDICATES A SHORTWAVE MOVING FROM THE MS

WELL. ALSO PATCHY FOG IS BEGINNING TO FORM IN THE TN VALLEY. WILL

SHOWERS COVERING MUCH OF EASTERN TN AT THE CURRENT TIME. FAST MOVING
DISTURBANCES ALOFT HELPING WITH THE SHOWER ACTIVITY THIS AFTERNOON.
HIGH PRESSURE OFF THE GA COAST IS MOVING OUT OVER THE ATLANTIC
AND ITS INFLUENCE WILL CONTINUE TO WEAKEN.

STRONG WEST TO EAST JET ALOFT TO CONTINUE THROUGH TONIGHT WITH
FRONTOGENESIS ON ORDER ACROSS SOUTHERN KY INTO FAR SW VA. THUS...
WITH JUST A SLIGHT DEGREE OF INSTABILITY...THE BETTER CHANCES OF
RAINFALL AFTER MIDNIGHT WILL BE ALONG AND NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY.
THIS WILL INCLUDE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF EASTERN TN AND PARTICULARLY
ACROSS FAR SW VA. OTHERWISE...FOR THE EVENING HOURS...WILL GO WITH A
CHANCE OF SHOWERS FAR SOUTH...THEN LIKELY CHANCES TO THE NORTH.
MAY EVEN GO CATEGORICAL DEPENDING ON THE MOST RECENT RADAR TRENDS.

ON FRIDAY...INSTABILITIES WILL BE ON THE UPSWING...PARTICULARLY
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...PRECIP CHANCES WILL BE LOWER GIVEN
THE INTENSIFICATION OF A MUCH STRONGER SFC LOW LOCATED NEAR THE
ARKLATEX AROUND 18Z. THIS STRONGER SFC LOW WILL ACT TO MITIGATE
MUCH OF THE ENERGY DOWNSTREAM AND ALONG THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED
BOUNDARY. THUS...WITH THE SOUTHERLY WIND ON THE INCREASE...
TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM QUITE WELL DURING THE AFTERNOON. THIS IN
TURN...WILL HELP OUT WITH THE DESTABILIZATION PROCESS.

BY FRIDAY NIGHT...SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE POSSIBLE. UPPER TROUGH AND
AN ASSOCIATED VORT MAX ACROSS THE CENTRAL U.S. WILL ENHANCE THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SFC LOW TO OUR WEST. THIS LOW WILL QUICKLY TRACK
NORTHEAST AND WILL BE LOCATED OVER EXTREME SOUTHERN IN AROUND 06Z
SAT. INSTABILITY PROFILES DO KEEP THE BETTER CAPES AND LOWEST LI
VALUES TO THE WEST THROUGH THE EVENT. HOWEVER...WITH A 50-55 KT 850
MB FLOW WITHIN A STRONG REGION OF FORCING...CANT RULE OUT SVR
POTENTIAL. STORMS WILL BE VERY FAST MOVERS WHICH COULD FURTHER ADD
TO THE WIND DMG POTENTIAL IN ADDITION TO ANY DOWNWARD MOMENTUM
TRANSFER.

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE EARLY SATURDAY MORNING...
PARTICULARLY ACROSS EASTERN AREAS. THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL THEN
PUT AN END TO THE PRECIPITATION BY SATURDAY EVENING AS IT MOVES
EAST.

IN THE EXTENDED FORECAST...SFC HIGH WILL GOVERN THE WEATHER THROUGH
MONDAY. MOISTURE WILL THEN SPREAD BACK TOWARD THE AREA BY THE
MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. LATEST GFS POINTS TO A WET AND SLIGHTLY COOLER
THAN NORMAL SCENARIO AS A SFC LOW TRACKS ALONG THE GULF COASTAL
STATES. SEVERAL MRF RUNS HAVE HINTED TOWARD THIS SCENARIO.

A WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE STRETCHES FROM

NOW EXTENDS INTO SEQUATCHIE AND BLEDSOE COUNTIES.

AS FOR INSTABILITY AND TSTM CHANCES...CURRENT LIGHTNING RETURNS ARE
TO THE WEST OF THE MS RIVER. MODEL DATA KEEPS LI VALUES BELOW ZERO
OVER EASTERN TN TODAY SO THE BULK OF THE PRECIP WILL BE IN THE FORM
OF SHOWERS.

WIND WISE...PRESSURE GRADIENT TO TIGHTEN NOTICEABLY AFTER 18Z.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT)...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH THAT 
SUPPORTED INSTABILITIES TO GIVE US NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND EVEN SOME 
SMALL HAIL WEDNESDAY HAS NOW SWUNG WELL TO THE EAST.  DEEP WARM 
ADVECTION ALOFT SHOULD BEGIN TO STABLIZE AIR MASS FOR MOST OF THE 
PRECIP THAT MOVES IN THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.  WILL LEAVE IN 
ISOLATED THUNDER FOR WESTERN PORTIONS OF AREA LATE TODAY AND FOR 
MUCH OF THE AREA TONIGHT...BUT THINK MAJORITY OF PRECIP THROUGH 
TONIGHT WILL BE THUNDER-FREE.

FOR TONIGHT...WARM FRONT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE SETTING UP NEAR 
TN/KY.  WENT WITH TIGHT GRADIENT OF POPS AND QPF...THINKING THAT 
BETTER CHANCES OF BOTH WOULD BE NEAR AND NORTH OF THE FRONT.  
FOR NORTHEAST VALLEY HAVE ALLOWED HIGHER POPS SINCE COOL AIR NORTH 
OF FRONT MAY BE SLOW TO LIFT NORTHWARD.

HAVE TRIMMED HIGH TEMPS TEMPS 1-2 DEGREES IN GRIDS TODAY THINKING 
THAT CLOUD COVER THIS AFTERNOON WILL LIMIT INSOLATION.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...OVERALL THINK THAT GFS/NAM 
AND OTHER MED TO LONG RANGE MODELS ARE VERY SIMILAR FOR OUR AREA 
WITH THE STRONG SYSTEM LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY.  THE
PREVIOUS FORECAST AND GRIDS LOOKED ON TRACK...AND TIMING STILL 
SUGGESTS A COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE SAT MORNING.  THE BEST THREAT OF 
THUNDERSTORMS APPEARS TO BE FROM AROUND 06Z SAT TO 15Z SAT...THEN 
THE DEEP MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY IS EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. 
EXPECT STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS TO PROBABLY MAKE IT TO EASTERN PARTS 
OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SE TN BY 06Z SAT...THEN LIKELY WEAKEN 
AS STORMS ENCOUNTER MUCH LESS INSTABILITY ACROSS REMAINDER OF OUR 
FORECAST AREA.  STRONG WINDS WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE MAIN THREAT WITH 
WET BULB ZERO AND FREEZING HEIGHTS HIGH...WHILE STORM MOVEMENT LOOKS 
MUCH TOO FAST FOR ANY LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS OR FLOODING.  

OTHERWISE...KEPT POP GRADIENT N TO S IN ASSOCIATION WITH WARM FRONT 
FRIDAY...THEN SWITCHED TO A W TO E POP GRADIENT AS COLD FRONT AND 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACH FROM THE W FRIDAY NIGHT.  SEE POTENTIAL 
FOR MOS HIGHS ON FRIDAY TO BE REACHED...AS SOUNDINGS SHOW PLENTY OF 
DRY AIR INTRUSION AND LOW LEVEL WARM AIR ADVECTION.  SAT MAX TEMPS 
WERE LOWERED BY A FEW TO SEVERAL DEGREES ACROSS THE BOARD WITH 
COOLING BEHIND THE FRONTAL PASSAGE...WHICH ALSO FITS WELL WITH NEW 
MOS VALUES AND ADJUSTMENTS MADE BY MOST SURROUNDING OFFICES.

FOR LATER PERIODS...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE AT THIS POINT...

310 PM EDT WED APR 27 2005

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE LOWER MS 
RIVER VALLEY BUILDING INTO THE FORECAST AREA. CURRENT RADARS REVEAL 
SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA...IN ASSOCIATION 
WITH AN UPPER TROUGH WHICH HAS BROUGHT MUCH COLDER AIR ALOFT ACROSS 
THE REGION. A FEW REPORTS OF SMALL HAIL WERE RECEIVED EARLIER THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH HAIL COVERING THE GROUND IN SOME AREAS. THIS 
CONVECTION SHOULD DECREASE RAPIDLY AFTER SUNSET...WITH AREAS OF FOG 
DEVELOPING AFTER MIDNIGHT AS CLOUDS DECREASE AND WINDS DECOUPLE. 
AFTER TONIGHT...MODELS ARE IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH DEVELOPING A 
WARM FRONT ACROSS KY AND SOUTHWEST VA BY THURSDAY...WHICH SHOULD 
BECOME THE FOCAL POINT FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT FROM THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON THROUGH FRIDAY. A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO 
DEVELOP ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS BY FRIDAY MORNING...WHICH WILL 
THEN QUICKLY MOVE NORTHEAST INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY BY FRIDAY 
NIGHT. BREEZY SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL DEVELOP ON FRIDAY ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. RIGHT NOW...IT 
APPEARS THAT A LARGE OUTBREAK OF SEVERE TSTORMS COULD DEVELOP ACROSS 
WEST TN BY FRIDAY EVENING...BUT THEN WEAKEN AS THIS FRONT MOVES EAST 
TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA (INTO MORE STABLE AIR). HOWEVER...STRONG TO 
SEVERE TSTORMS WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATE 
FRIDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...CANADIAN MODEL PREFERRED 
EARLY IN THE PERIOD WITH ECMWF THE BEST MODEL BEGINNING DAY 6 AND 
FOLLOWED CLOSELY. EARLY WEEKEND UPR TROF AND ASSOCIATED CD FNT MOVES 
E OF THE FA BY SAT EVENING WITH POPS DROPPING OFF FROM HIGH CHC 
SHRA/TSRA ENTIRE REGION TO SLGT CHC -SHRA ACROSS SW VA/NE TN SAT 
NIGHT. A BREAK IN THE ACTION FOLLOWS FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AS UPR FLO 
TRANSITIONS TO MORE ZONAL PATTERN WITH LOW LVL RIDGING BUILDING 
ACROSS THE AREA. LATE IN THE FCST TUE/WED...WILL INTRODUCE SOME 
SLGT/CHC CHC POPS AS SRN STREAM WAVE RIDES ALONG BOUNDARY IN PLACE 
ALONG THE GULF COAST. KEPT SW VA/PART OF NE TN DRY EARLY IN THIS 
PERIOD AND THEN USED SLGT CHC HERE BY WED AS ISENTROPIC LIFT 
INCREASES AS WAVE BUILDS NE INTO THE SRN APPALACHIANS. STAYED PRETTY 
CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS THROUGH FCST.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES PROJECT 
UPPER TROUGH AXIS TO SWING ACROSS SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS DURING THE 
FIRST PERIOD.  ENOUGH LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL 
ACCOMPANY THE UPPER TROUGH THAT SCATTERED SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE... 
ESPECIALLY OVER THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA.  THUS 
HAVE KEPT LOW POPS FOR THOSE AREAS IN THE FIRST PERIOD. SECOND 
PERIOD LOOKS DRY AS FLOW BECOMES ANTI-CYCLONIC ALOFT AND SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN.  FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE VALUES ARE IN DECENT 
AGREEMENT AND APPEAR REASONABLE.  TENDED TO GO WITH BLEND OF THOSE 
GUIDANCE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THRU WEDNESDAY)...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE 
TO THURSDAY/THURSDAY NIGHT AS THE MAIN THREAT OF CONVECTIVE PCPN 
LOOKS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SURFACE LOW AND WARM FRONT IN THE 
MID MISS VALLEY REGION...WITH NEARLY ZONAL UPPER FLOW TO PUSH PCPN
EASTWARD.  PREVIOUS POP/WX GRIDS WERE STILL ORIENTED TO FAVOR HIGHER 
POPS ACROSS NRN MOST PARTS OF OUR FORECAST AREA.  NOT A LOT OF 
INSTABILITY OR STRONG LIFT UNTIL FRIDAY NIGHT...SO MODIFIED PCPN 
TYPE TO JUST SHOWERS UNTIL THE STRONGER SYSTEM ARRIVES LATE FRIDAY.

FOR THE 27/00Z MODEL RUN...FOUND NAM AND GFS IN BETTER AGREEMENT ON 
TIMING THE STRONGER SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND COLD FRONT INTO WRN PARTS 
OF THE FORECAST AREA LATE FRIDAY NIGHT.  BOTH THE NAM/DGEX AND GFS 
SUGGEST A FRONTAL PASSAGE (FROPA) BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON...ALTHO HPC 
MENTIONS THAT NCEP ENSEMBLE AND OTHER MED/LONG RANGE MODELS ARE NOT 
QUITE AS FAST AS THE OPERATIONAL GFS.  UPPER LEVEL PATTERN LOOKS 
PROGRESSIVE...AND HPC IS FAVORING THE GFS MODEL FOR NOW.  THUS... 
MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS FROM FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...INCREASING 
POPS TO VERY HIGH CHANCE BY 06Z SAT UP TO 18Z SAT.  THEN...LOWERED 
POPS TO JUST SLIGHT CHANCE AFTER 06Z SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING.   IF THIS FASTER TREND CONTINUES TO BE SUPPORTED...THEN 
LATER SHIFTS WILL NEED TO RAISE POPS TO LIKELY OR CATEGORICAL LATE 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY...AND CONSIDER COMPLETELY REMOVING 
POPS FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT.

OTHERWISE...VERY MINOR MAX/MIN TEMP ADJUSTMENTS MADE...AND SOME 
PRELIMINARY GRIDS WERE ALSO MADE FOR THE NEW DAY 7 (WEDNESDAY).

CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL
MIDNIGHT. LINE OF SHOWERS IS JUST AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT MOVING 
ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE.  A REPORT OF WIND DAMAGE HAS BEEN RECEIVED 
ACROSS BRADLEY COUNTY (SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE). HTX VWP SHOWS BOUNDARY
LAYER WINDS UP TO 40-45 KNOTS...WHICH LED TO THE WIND DAMAGE.  

SATELITE SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF CLEARING SOON AFTER FROPA...SO WILL KEEP
PARTLY CLOUDY FORECAST GOING AFTER SHOWERS END. ANOTHER BATCH OF SHOWERS
IS NOTED OVER WESTERN TENNESSEE-WESTERN KENTUCKY WHICH WILL MOVE BACK
INTO THE AREA LATE TONIGHT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WED)...COLD FRONT CURRENTLY MOVING ACROSS

INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THIS FRONT...BUT STILL CAN NOT RULE OUT A 
RUMBLE OR TWO OF THUNDER EARLY.  EXPECT SOME AT LEAST PARTIAL 
CLEARING BEHIND THE FRONT...BUT EXPECT CLOUDS TO INCREASE 
AGAIN...ESPECIALLY NORTH...AS UPPER TROUGH MOVES IN LATER TONIGHT.  
MAY SEE A FEW SHOWERS MAINLY NORTH TOMORROW...AS LAPSE RATES WILL BE 
FAIRLY STEEP WITH THE COLD AIR ALOFT. WILL CARRY 20 POPS CENTRAL AND 
30 NORTH.  WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS THIS RUN.  

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH BUILDS 
IN KEEPING WEDNESDAY NIGHT DRY.  MODELS INDICATING A WARM FRONT 
MOVING IN LATE THURSDAY...THINK BEST MOISTURE WILL STAY NORTH...BUT 
WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY AND CHANCE POPS FOR 
THURSDAY NIGHT.  FRONT STALLS NEAR THE AREA ON FRIDAY...WILL KEEP 
CHANCE POPS GOING FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT.  MODELS INDICATING DECENT 
INSTABILITY...ADDED THUNDER FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY  NIGHT.  A SURFACE 
LOW/COLD FRONT ENTERS THE PICTURE ON SATURDAY...BUMP UP POPS TO 50 
PERCENT FOR LATE FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY.  UPPER TROUGH FOLLOWING ON

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RADAR MOSAIC IS CURRENTLY 
SHOWING SCATTERED LIGHT CONVECTION BREAKING OUT IN WESTERN AND 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE IN ADVANCE OF UPPER TROUGH WHICH IS AMPLIFYING OVER 
UPPER MIDWEST. PRECIP WILL SPREAD SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE FIRST PERIOD PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE 
CONSENSUS. MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS DEPICT LITTLE OR NO INSTABILITY 
WITH THE EVENT...THUS NOT ANTICIPATING ANY CONVECTION TO GET TOO 
STRONG. NEVERTHELESS...HAVE CONTINUED TO MENTION THUNDER. UPPER 
TROUGH DEAMPLIFIES SOMEWHAT THROUGH THE SECOND PERIOD...BUT ENOUGH 
WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE IS PROJECTED TO KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING... 
ESPECIALLY OVER THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. FOR 
TEMPS...GENERALLY FAVORED GFS GUIDANCE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THRU TUESDAY)...FOR EARLY PARTS OF THE LONG 
TERM...KEPT IN SOME LOW POPS FOR EARLY WEDS MORNING BUT NOT BEYOND 
THAT TIME.  DID NOT SEE ANY ADDITIONAL SHORTWAVE/VORT MAX OR THE 
POTENTIAL FOR WRAP AROUND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FOR WEDS AFTERNOON...SO 
KEPT THE REST OF WEDS AND WEDS NIGHT DRY FOR NOW.  

FOR THU AND FRI...UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMES NEARLY ZONAL WITH ONE 
DEFINITE SURFACE FEATURE BEING A WARM FRONT THAT ENDS UP ACROSS KY 
TO W VA.  I SAW THE POTENTIAL FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ALONG THIS 
BOUNDARY WITH AN EASTWARD MOVEMENT (POSSIBLE MCS ACTIVITY)...SO POPS 
WERE RAISED FOR MY NRN AREAS (WHICH MESHES BETTER WITH JKL AND RLX 
GRIDS).  I ALSO INTRODUCED AT LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EVERYWHERE 
THU AFTERNOON...BUT NOT REAL IMPRESSED WITH THE INSTABILITY FOR THU 
OR FRI...SO KEPT TYPE AS SHOWERS.  

WEEKEND AND BEYOND...MODELS BEGAN TO DIFFER TO THE POINT THAT MUCH 
UNCERTAINTY EXISTS...SO NO CHANGES AT THIS POINT.  GFS MODEL IS FAST 
IN BRINGING A SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND COLD FRONT INTO THE REGION BY 
LATE FRI NIGHT INTO SAT...WHICH SUGGESTS INCREASING POPS.  HOWEVER...
AS HPC MENTIONS...THE ENSEMBLES AND ECMWF ARE MUCH SLOWER THAN GFS.
WILL DEFER ANY WEEKEND CHANGES TO NEXT SHIFT.  SOME BASIC GRIDS WERE 
ADDED FOR THE NEW DAY 7 (TUESDAY).

OTHERWISE...MINOR TEMP ADJUSTMENTS TO BLEND BETTER WITH NEIGHBORS 
AND 26/00Z MOS VALUES THROUGH THU.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LINGERING LOW TO MID DECK CLOUDS 
PLUS WINDS HAVE REALLY HINDERED HOW MUCH TEMPS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
FALL OVERNIGHT.  LATEST IR SATELLITE PICS SHOW A TREND FOR SRN END 
OF CLOUDS TO ERODE...WHICH WILL HELP TEMPS FALL OVER THE NEXT FEW 
HOURS.  HOWEVER...WEST WINDS OF 10 TO 15 MPH SEEM QUITE COMMON 
ACROSS SWRN VA AND NE TN...WHICH CERTAINLY WORKS AGAINST TEMPS 
DROPPING TO OR BELOW FREEZING THIS MORNING.  THUS...WE FEEL BEST 
COURSE OF ACTION WILL BE TO CANCEL THE FREEZE WARNING FOR MANY AREAS 
THIS MORNING.  BASED ON AVAILABLE RAWS/FIRE WX SITES AND SCHOOL NET 
OBSERVATIONS...SEEMS WISE TO CONTINUE THE FREEZE WARNING FOR JUST 
THE MTN COUNTIES ALONG THE TN/NC LINE.  THE NPWMRX PRODUCT HAS BEEN 
UPDATED TO REFLECT THESE CHANGES.

FOR LATER TODAY...ALREADY SEEING SOME MID TO HIGH CLOUDS INCREASE 
FROM THE WEST...SO EXPECT A PARTLY CLOUDY DAY.  MAV MOS HIGHS LOOKED 
QUITE GOOD FOR TODAY...WITH WINDS ADJUSTED CLOSER TO THE NGM MOS. 

FOR TONIGHT...OVERALL WE FEEL THAT LATEST MOS POPS ARE A BIT TOO 
HIGH FOR TONIGHT...GIVEN WEAK LIFT AND HARDLY ANY INSTABILITY OVER 
OUR REGION.  THOSE HIGH MOS POPS ACTUALLY INCREASE RAPIDLY JUST 
BEFORE 12Z TUESDAY...SO WE FEEL SAFE IN UNDERCUTTING MOS POPS AND 
GOING SOMEWHAT CLOSER TO THE ETA MOS POPS.  TRIED TO MESH AS BEST 
POSSIBLE WITH NEIGHBORS POPS...AND STILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO BEST THE MOS POPS AND SHORT RANGE MODELS QPF.  ALSO
...FAVORED THE MOS BLEND FOR MINS TONIGHT GIVEN THE INCREASING 
CLOUDS AND RISING DEW POINT TEMPS.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...PREFER THE SLOWER NAM WITH 
THE START OF SOLID PRECIPITATION INTO THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY AS 
COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE MS VALLEY. IT LOOKS LIKE THE WARM FRONT 
WILL STAY TO THE SOUTH OF TN HOWEVER ENOUGH DYNAMICS AHEAD OF THE 
FRONT SHOULD BRING SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS TO THE TN VALLEY AND 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. RAINFALL 
AMOUNTS SHOULD RANGE FROM A HALF TO ONE INCH WITH LOCAL AMOUNTS 
ABOVE ONE INCH SW NC AND SE TN. WINDS MAY GET STRONG ENOUGH TUESDAY 
FOR A WIND ADVISORY BEING REQUIRED IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AS THE 
FRONT APPROACHES. THIS FRONT IS FAST MOVING AND SHOULD BE EAST OF 
THE APPALACHIANS BY ABOUT MIDNIGHT. LINGERING WRAP AROUND MOISTURE 
WILL MOVE NORTHEAST WEDNESDAY MORNING SO WEDNESDAY SHOULD BE NICE AS 
TROUGH FLATTENS AND AIRMASS DRIES OUT. SOME HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE 
SPREADS OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THURSDAY AHEAD OF A STATIONARY 
FRONT EXTENDING FROM THE PLAINS WEST THROUGH THE ROCKIES BUT LOWER 
LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE STAY DRY. LOW PRESSURE BEGINS TO INTENSIFY 
FRIDAY OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AS HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
BRINGS MOISTURE NORTH INTO TN. A FEW SHOWERS MAY DEVELOP BUT THE 
DEVELOPING SYSTEM SHOULD AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY. MORE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LOOK LIKELY WITH 
TEMPERATURES WARMING INTO THE 70S MORE LIKE NORMAL TEMPERATURES FOR 
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY)...PRECIPITATION INCREASED OVER THE PAST HOUR 
OR SO...ESPECIALLY ACROSS NE TN AND SWRN VA (TRI BRIEFLY DOWN 3/4SM 
MILE VSBY WITH -SN).  DIFFICULT TIME OF THE DAY TO HAVE ANY GROUND 
TRUTH INFO FROM THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...SO FELT IT WAS BEST TO LET 
THE WINTER WX AND SNOW ADVISORIES RUN THEIR COURSE THRU NOON TODAY.  

PREVIOUS WX AND POP GRIDS ONLY REQUIRED MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO FIT 
LATEST RADAR DATA AND SURFACE TEMPERATURES...WITH 12 HOUR POPS 
ENDING UP VERY NEAR THE MOS BLEND FOR TODAY.  GIVEN THE COLD AIR 
ADVECTION...KEPT THE MAX TEMPS MORE IN LINE WITH OR JUST BELOW THE 
COOLER MAV MOS HIGHS.  ONLY PROBLEM TO THIS APPROACH IS THE 
POTENTIAL FOR A LOT OF SUNSHINE AT TIMES ACROSS WRN PARTS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA.

WIND SPEEDS NOT REAL IMPRESSIVE AT THIS TIME...BUT AGAIN NOT A LOT 
OF DATA AVAILABLE FROM THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  THE MRX WIND PROFILE 
(VWP) HAS CONSISTENTLY SHOWN ONLY 30 KNOT WINDS ALOFT TO MIX DOWN...
SO OPENED UP A LARGER RANGE OF WIND SPEEDS IN MOST GROUPS.  WIND 
ADVISORY CONTINUES THRU NOON TODAY FOR TN/NC MTN GROUPS.

.LONG TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...LAST LITTLE BIT OF ENERGY 
ROTATES AROUND UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVING INTO PA THIS EVENING WITH A 
FEW SNOW OR RAIN SHOWERS. PRESSURE GRADIENT BEGINS TO LOOSEN UP AND 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FINALLY MOVES OUT OF NE TN DURING THE EVENING AND 
SW VA AFTER MIDNIGHT. HAVE ISSUED A FREEZE WATCH FOR TONIGHT FOR SW 
VA AND THE MOUNTAINS. DID NOT ISSUE A FREEZE WARNING YET FOR THESE 
AREAS BECAUSE CURRENT FREEZE WARNING IN EFFECT THIS MORNING AND NOT 
QUITE CONFIDENT OF THE COVERAGE IN SW VA DUE TO LINGERING CLOUDS AND 
WIND. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE PLAIN STATES WILL WORK SE 
TOWARDS THE GULF SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. DRY WESTERLY FLOW KEEPS 
THE FORECAST AREA NICE WITH GOOD WARMING TEMPERATURES...10 TO 15 
DEGREES ABOVE TODAYS 40S AND 50S TO THE LOWER TO MID 60S. SURFACE 
LOW AND SYSTEM OVER THE EASTERN LAKES LIFTS NORTH INTO CANADA MONDAY 
AS CYCLOGENESIS DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WITH NEXT 
DEVELOPING FRONTAL SYSTEM. A SHORTWAVE IS ALSO EXPECTED TO DROP 
SOUTH OUT OF CANADA AND COMBINE WITH THE SOUTHERN SYSTEM. A LARGE 
AREA OF PRECIPITATION WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE PLAINS MONDAY NIGHT 
AND SPREAD EAST INTO THE TN VALLEY TUESDAY MORNING. FOLLOWED THE 
SLIGHTLY SLOWER NAM WITH SHOWERS DEVELOPING BY MORNING SOUTH AND 
WEST AND DURING THE MORNING EAST AND NORTH. LOOKS LIKE HEAVIEST RAIN 
AND CONVECTION WILL STAY SOUTH OF TN OVER THE GULF STATES. MOST OF 
THE TN VALLEY COULD GET ONE HALF INCH OR MORE OF RAIN TUESDAY. 
INCREASED POPS TUESDAY OVER ALL BUT THE NORTHEAST TO LIKELY 
CATEGORY. THE COLD FRONT PASSES QUICKLY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS WEDNESDAY WITH FLOW BECOMING ZONAL. ANOTHER 
WEAK FRONT MOVES THROUGH THURSDAY BUT NO RAIN IS EXPECTED. ANOTHER 
SOUTHERN SYSTEM DEVELOPS FRIDAY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND MAY 
GIVE THE AREA ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE

.SHORT TERM...LOW PRESSURE AREA WILL WOBBLE INTO SE CANADA THROUGH 
EARLY MONDAY. COLD NW FLOW WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE AREA. MOISTURE 
REMAINS PLENTIFUL OVERNIGHT AND BEGINS TO DECREASE BY MID DAY SUNDAY. 
THE FREEZING LEVEL WILL DROP TO NEAR THE SFC MOST LOCATIONS 
OVERNIGHT. RAIN WILL BECOME MIXED WITH OR CHANGE TO SNOW AND THE 
ACCUMULATING SNOW LEVEL LOOKS TO GET AS LOW AS 2200 FEET. SOME ICING 
IS ALSO POSSIBLE MAINLY ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS AS SOME SURFACES BEGIN 
TO FREEZE DESPITE BRISK WINDS AND CLOUD COVER THUS OPTED FOR WINTER 
WEATHER ADVSRY FOR SW VA. FREEZING TEMPS ARE ALSO POSSIBLE ACROSS 
PARTS OF NE TN BUT DURATION LOOKS BRIEF ENOUGH TO LEAVE THAT AREA 
OUT OF FREEZE WARNING. WINDS OF 20 TO 30 MPH MAY EXTEND THROUGH THE 
DAY ON SUNDAY AND WIND ADVSRY MAY HAVE TO BE EXTENDED INTO SUNDAY 
AFTN. OPTED NOT TO ISSUE FREEZE WATCH FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AS TO NOT 
CONFUSE THE ISSUE BUT ANOTHER MORE EXTENSIVE FREEZE WARNING WILL 
LIKELY BE REQUIRED SUNDAY NIGHT. WITH LESS CLOUD COVER NEAR FREEZING 
RECORD TEMPERATURES WILL BE APPROACHED OR EQUALED. A LOW PRESSURE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
535 AM EDT SAT APR 23 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SEVERE WEATHER THREAT OVER BUT 
MUCH SIGNIFICANT WEATHER CONTINUES.  SKIES BRIEFLY CLEARED BEHIND 
THE LAST BIT OF CONVECTIVE PCPN...BUT QUICKLY CLOUDED BACK OVER AS 
POST FRONTAL LOW CLOUDINESS ADVECTED IN.  THE COLD FRONT HAS PUSHED 
EAST WELL INTO WRN NC...BUT THE UPPER LOW IS STILL SPINNING SLOWLY 
OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS.  AREA RADARS STARTING TO SHOW 
SCATTERED VERY LIGHT SHOWERS CIRCULATING BACK ACROSS THE NRN 
TWO-THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA.  

MAIN CONCERNS FOR THE SHORT TERM ARE: 1) STRENGTH OF W-NW WINDS FROM 
LATER TODAY AND OVERNIGHT AS PRESSURE GRADIENT REMAINS TIGHT ACROSS 
THE REGION AND ADDITIONAL SHORTWAVE ENERGY ROTATES ACROSS THE REGION
...AND ALSO 2) THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IN 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS.  

DECIDED TO ISSUE WIND ADVISORY FOR ALL TN AND NC MTN COUNTIES FROM 
NOON TODAY THROUGH 8AM EDT SUNDAY...ALLOWING FOR GUSTS UP TO OR JUST 
ABOVE THE 850 MB JET MAX VALUES.  ELSEWHERE...RAN WITH 15 TO 25 MPH 
SPEEDS.  THE SNOW ACCUMULATION MAY BE DELAYED UNTIL TONIGHT...DUE TO 
WARM BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPS AND PARTIAL (1000-850 MB) THICKNESSES.
FOR NOW...WE LIMITED THE SNOW ADVISORY AREAS TO OUR THREE NRN MOST 
SW VA COUNTIES (1-3 INCHES TOTAL IN WISE...RUSSELL AND WASHINGTON)
...AND FOR THE SMOKY AND NE TN MTNS (2-4 INCHES TOTAL AND A HINT OF 
POSSIBLY MORE IN THE HIGHEST AREAS).  

GFS MOS ARRIVED TOO LATE TO HELP WITH THIS PACKAGE...BUT HOURLY 
TEMPS AND MAX TEMPS WERE CUSTOM MADE TODAY TO FIT THE SITUATION
(MORNING MAXES FOLLOWED BY STEADY OR FALLING TEMPS).  NOTICED THAT 
THE 23/00Z MOS MIN TEMPS FOR TONIGHT WERE SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE 
PREVIOUS FORECAST/GRIDS.  DUE TO STRONG WINDS AND CLOUDS...I NUDGED 
MINS UP TONIGHT CLOSER TO THIS NEW GUIDANCE.  PREVIOUS POP GRIDS 
WERE IN EXCELLENT AGREEMENT WITH SENSIBLE WEATHER AND LATEST MOS.

AN EQUIPMENT NOTE: TRI CITIES NOAA WEATHER RADIO REMAINS OFF THE AIR
DUE TO EQUIPMENT PROBLEMS.  WE ARE SORRY FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE THIS 
HAS CAUSED...AND HOPE TO BE BACK ON THE AIR LATER THIS MORNING.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...WOUND UP LOW OVER THE EASTERN 
GREAT LAKES WILL GIVE THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS A VERY COLD START 
SUNDAY WITH SURFACE TEMPERATURES IN THE 30S AND DOWN TO MID 20S AT 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. SHORTWAVE ENERGY ROTATING AROUND THE UPPER LOW 
CENTERED OVER PA BY 12Z TOMORROW WILL BE CREATING SNOW SHOWERS 
ACROSS THE EASTERN TN MOUNTAINS AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA WITH 
EVEN A FEW SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE IN THE VALLEYS MAINLY FROM I-40 
NORTH. THE PRECIPITATION SHOULD GRADUALLY TAPER OFF DURING THE 
MORNING BUT MAY CONTINUE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON. THE WIND ADVISORY MAY NEED TO BE EXTENDED IF THE SURFACE 
LOW MOVES AWAY SLOWER THAN EXPECTED. CLOUD COVER AND COLD AIR 
ADVECTION WILL CAUSE HIGHS TO STRUGGLE TO REACH THE 50S EXCEPT OVER 
SOUTHEAST TN. LOWS SUNDAY NIGHT SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO TONIGHTS LOWS 
BUT CLEARING WILL DEPEND ON HOW FAR NORTH THE UPPER LOW HAS MOVED.  
THE LATEST GFS WANTS TO KEEP WIND SPEEDS UP BUT THE NAM SHOWS A 
WEAKER GRADIENT AND MOVES THE MOISTURE OUT SOONER. LIKED ITS COOLER 
LOWS NEAR TO BELOW FREEZING. DRIER AIR SPREADS EAST MONDAY AND 
TEMPERATURES WILL WARM TO THE 60S BUT INCREASING MOISTURE SPREADS IN 
FROM THE WEST MONDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF THE NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM THAT 
MOVES INTO THE PLAINS FROM THE ROCKIES AND COMBINES WITH A SYSTEM 
DROPPING SOUTH OUT OF SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA. PATTERN SHIFTS AGAIN 
WEDNESDAY AS UPPER LEVEL LOW IN THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES SENDS A 
SERIES OF SHORTWAVES TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA IN A WET NORTHWEST 
FLOW. HIGH TEMPERATURES SHOULD STAY 5 TO 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL 
THROUGH THE WEEK.

308 PM EDT FRI APR 22 2005

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...TODAYS CONVECTION HAS 
TEMPORARILY STABILIZED THE ATMOSPHERE ACROSS THE AREA. BREAKS IN THE 
CLOUDS SHOULD ALLOW FOR SOME ADDITIONAL HEATING EARLY THIS EVENING. 
A SHORT WAVE WITH GOOD ROTATION WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA THIS EVENING 
AS A STRONG JET SWINGS UNDERNEATH. THE EXIT REGION OF THE JET MOVES 
INTO THE AREA AROUND MIDNIGHT. CAPES SHOULD REBOUND TO AROUND 800 
J/KG WITH LIS AGAIN BECOMING NEGATIVE. CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT IS 
LIKELY IN ADVANCE OF APPROACHING COLD FRONT AND STORM MOTIONS FAVOR 
THIS ACTIVITY GETTING AS FAR EAST AS THE SMOKYS. SO ANOTHER ROUND OF 
STRONG TO POSSIBLY SEVERE STORMS EXPECTED THIS EVENING. COLD FRONT 
WILL MOVE EAST THROUGH THE AREA OVERNIGHT. WRAP AROUND PRECIPITATION 
WILL PERSIST SAT AND SAT NGT FAVORING THE NORTHERN CWA. THE FREEZING 
LEVEL DROPS TO AROUND 3600 FEET BY SAT AFTN SO SOME MIXED PCPN CAN 
BE EXPECTED ACROSS HIGHER ELEVATION. 850 MB TEMPS DROP DOWN TO 
AROUND -7C OVERNIGHT SAT AND THE FREEZING LEVEL DROPS TO NEAR THE 
SFC MOST LOCATIONS BY SUNDAY MORNING. ACCUMULATING SNOWS ARE LIKELY 
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WITH NEAR FREEZING TEMPS ACROSS THE 
VALLEYS. RECORDS SET IN 1986 CHA 34 TYS 28 TRI 28 MAY BE CHALLENGED 
AT CHA BUT SHOULD STAND ELSEWHERE. DRIZZLES FLURRIES AND SNOW 
SHOWERS CONTINUE MAINLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS SAT NGT AND 
SUNDAY WITH BREEZY NW WINDS. TEMPS WILL REMAIN COLD SUNDAY NIGHT 
WITH RECORDS CHA 32 1974 TYS 33 1910 TRI 31 1969 APPROACHED. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BRINGING DRY 
WEATHER ON MONDAY.  COLD FRONT APPROACHING AREA LATE MONDAY 
NIGHT...KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY NIGHT.  BEST CHANCES ON 
TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT AS FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA.  UPPER 
TROUGH PASSES ON WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...KEPT 30 POPS FOR 
WEDNESDAY.  MOISTURE PUSHES EAST ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT...KEPT ONLY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS.  DRY WEATHER SHOULD RETURN FOR THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY.

.DISCUSSION...UPDATED POPS TO CATEGORICAL FOR TODAY AREAWIDE WITH 
UPPER DIFFLUENCE INCREASING AND AREA OF CONVECTION POISED TO SLIDE 
EAST INTO AREA. 

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FOLLOWS: 


SHORT TERM....SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MINIMAL COVERAGE OF 
SHOWERS/STORMS AT THIS TIME...WITH SCATTERED COVERAGE STILL NOTED 
ACROSS MIDDLE TN WHERE SOME INSTABILITY LINGERS.  EXPECT THIS AREA 
TO CONTINUE TO PUSH EAST THIS MORNING AS SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES 
AND AIRMASS BECOMES UNSTABLE ACROSS OUR REGION.  PREVIOUS GRIDS 
REFLECTED THIS QUITE WELL...ALTHO I DID RAISE POPS UP INTO 
CATEGORICAL VALUES THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS GENERALLY WRN PARTS OF EAST 
TN.  

SHORT RANGE MODELS SIMILAR WITH TIMING BRUNT OF SHOWERS AND STORMS 
TO DECREASE...ALTHO GFS IS JUST A FEW HOURS QUICKER TO END THAN NAM 
(ETA).  PREVIOUS WX/POP GRIDS LOOKED LIKE A GOOD COMPROMISE AND WERE 
LEFT AS IS.  THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS LATER TODAY AND EARLY TONIGHT 
LOOKS TO BE MAINLY DAMAGING WINDS...AS FREEZING LEVEL DOES NOT FALL 
SHARPLY UNTIL SATURDAY.  WE WILL UPDATE THE SPSMRX PRODUCT AND ALSO 
HIGHLIGHT THE MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE STORMS IN THE HAZARDOUS 
WEATHER OUTLOOK.

OTHERWISE...WENT CLOSE TO MAV MOS FOR HIGH TEMPS TODAY...THEN TRENDED
MIN TEMPS DOWN A BIT ACROSS THE BOARD FOR TONIGHT IN LINE WITH 
LATEST MOS.

LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...STRONG COLD FRONT WITH 
DEEP TROUGH WITH VERY COLD AIR FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR WILL CAUSE A 
BIG DROP IN TEMPERATURES SATURDAY AS COMPARED TO THE STRING OF DAYS 
IN THE 70S. THE FRONT SHOULD BE EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS BY MORNING AND 
HIGHS FOR THE DAY WILL PROBABLY BE REACHED DURING THE MORNING WITH 
STEADY TO FALLING TEMPERATURES DURING THE DAY. COLDER AND DRIER AIR 
ALOFT WILL DROP FREEZING LEVELS TO 3 TO 4 THOUSAND FEET BY EVENING. 
PRECIPITATION WILL DECREASE AND LIKELY END IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY 
AND SOUTHERN PLATEAU BY AFTERNOON. STRONG WINDS AT THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS MAY REQUIRE A WIND ADVISORY FOR SATURDAY. A BIG CONCERN 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SUNDAY WILL BE SNOWFALL. THE BEST CHANCE 
FOR ACCUMULATING SNOW WILL BE THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS OF THE SMOKIES 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WHERE TEMPERATURES WILL BE COLDEST AND ARE 
ALSO IN FAVORED UPSLOPE LOCATIONS. AT LOWER ELEVATIONS SNOW SHOWERS 
WILL BE LESS LIKELY AS AIRMASS DRIES OUT. GROUND TEMPERATURES SHOULD 
BE TOO WARM AT LOWER ELEVATIONS FOR ANY ACCUMULATIONS BUT HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS COULD SEE A COUPLE INCHES. LOWS SUNDAY MORNING WILL ALSO 
BE A SHOCK WITH READINGS IN THE 30S ONLY A FEW DEGREES ABOVE RECORDS 
FOR THE DATE. SOME LOCATIONS MAY EVEN DROP TO FREEZING OR BELOW 
ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN AND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE MOUNTAINS. 
COLD TEMPERATURES WILL PERSIST SUNDAY AS COLD UPPER LOW AND TROUGH 
LIFTS SLOWLY NORTHEAST. CLOUDS WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES IN THE 40S AND 
50S WITH STILL SHOWERS POSSIBLE NE HALF OF FORECAST AREA. TROUGH 
STAYS OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH MID WEEK WITH 
BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND ANOTHER SYSTEM MOVING IN MONDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT OVER 
SOUTHEAST KY AND SOUTHWEST VA...WITH SCATTERED CONVECTION AHEAD OF 
IT DIMINISHING OVER NORTHEAST TN. THIS FRONT SHOULD SLOWLY BEGIN TO 
LIFT NORTH AS A WARM FRONT LATER TONIGHT...AS SOUTHWESTERLY 850 MB 
FLOW STRENGTHENS AHEAD OF A DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
MID MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. SOME OUTFLOW FROM THE CONVECTION OVER 
THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY MAY TRIGGER SOME ADDITIONAL CONVECTION 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT. HOWEVER... 
THINK THAT POPS IN GENERAL SHOULD BE LOWERED ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
FORECAST AREA FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. WILL PLAN TO ALSO MENTION 
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVERNIGHT IN THE UPDATE. FORECAST TEMPS SEEM TO 
BE IN GOOD SHAPE AND WILL NOT PLAN TO CHANGE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SHORTWAVE TRACKING ACROSS 
AREA...TRIGGERING THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA.  ALSO GETTING 
SOME UPSLOPE CELLS DEVELOPING ALONG THE MOUNTAINS.  INSTABILITY TOO 
WEAK FOR SEVERE STORMS TONIGHT...BUT WILL KEEP LIKELY POPS INTO THE 
EVENING HOURS IN THE NORTH AND MOUNTAINS...AND CHANCE ELSEWHERE.  
MOST OF THE THUNDER SHOULD DISSIPATE THIS EVENING...BUT ANOTHER  
SHORTWAVE TRACKING THROUGH LATER TONIGHT...SO KEPT CHANCE POPS FOR 
SHOWERS GOING AFTER MIDNIGHT.  COLD FRONT APPROACHES AREA LATE 
FRIDAY.  DECENT LIFT...INSTABILITY AND WIND FIELDS AHEAD OF FRONT... 
SHOULD BE FAVORABLE FOR STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS BY LATE 
AFTERNOON.  WILL KEEP LIKELY POPS GOING ACROSS THE CWA. 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN FEATURE OF 
INTEREST REMAINS UPPER TROUGH WHICH WILL SIGNIFICANTLY AMPLIFY INTO 
THE EASTERN CONUS THROUGH THE WEEKEND PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE 
CONSENSUS. SURFACE COLD FRONT IS PROJECTED TO PUSH THROUGH THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY SATURDAY MORNING AND WILL BE PRECEDED BY A 
PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH OF CONVECTION PER NAM. INSTABILITY MARGINAL BUT 
DYNAMICS DEPICTED TO BE QUITE STRONG...SO CAN NOT RULE OUT SOME OF 
THE CONVECTION TO BE ON THE STRONG SIDE AS TROUGH PASSES THROUGH 
FRIDAY EVENING. SIGNIFICANTLY COLDER AIR POURS INTO THE AREA BEHIND 
FRONT WITH 850 MB TEMPS PLUNGING TO WELL BELOW ZERO C. UPPER LEVELS 
DRY OUT CONSIDERABLY AFTER FROPA...BUT LOW-LEVEL WRAP-AROUND 
MOISTURE WITH STRONG UPSLOPE FLOW SUGGESTS RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS WILL 
LINGER THROUGH MUCH OF SUNDAY..ESPECIALLY IN THE FAVORED UPSLOPE 
TERRAIN. REMAINDER OF PERIOD WILL FEATURE SLOW WARMING TREND TO NEAR 
CLIMATOLOGY BY MID-WEEK WITH ONLY WEAK DISTURBANCES IN THE EARLY TO 
MID-WEEK TIME FRAME. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO 
MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD GFS GUIDANCE VALUES.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A SHORT WAVE OUT AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL SPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
ACROSS THE MRX CWA THIS AFTERNOON.  ASSOCIATED DYNAMICS NOT OVERLY 
IMPRESSIVE AND MOISTURE WILL INCREASE BUT REMAIN LIMITED.  HOWEVER 
WITH THE AIR MASS BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE...BELIEVE LIFT AND 
MOISTURE SUFFICIENT FOR MOST LOCATIONS TO SEE SOME PRECIP.  WAVE 
MOVES OFF LATE THIS EVENING AND EXPECT A BREAK IN ORGANIZED PRECIP 
LATE TONIGHT BEFORE THE MAIN LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES IN ON 
FRIDAY.  WITH INCREASING CLOUDS AND SOME INCREASE IN DEW 
POINTS...TODAY/S HIGHS SHOULD BE A COUPLE DEGREES COOLER THAN 
YESTERDAY/S WHICH IS IN LINE WITH CURRENT GUIDANCE. 


.LONG TERM...(FRI THROUGH WED)...DIGGING TROUGH WILL CUT OFF...AND 
RESULTANT UPPER LOW WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE AWAY.  MODELS IN DECENT 
AGREEMENT IN HANDLING THIS...WITH JUST SOME DIFFERENCES ON THE 
DETAILS.  WILL TRY TO USE A COMPROMISE GFS/NAM SOLUTION WHERE 
DIFFERENCES EXIST THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT.  STRONG COLD FRONT WILL 
PUSH THROUGH THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT. WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS FOR 
FRI...THEN CATEGORICAL NORTH LIKELY ELSEWHERE FRI NIGHT.  MUCH 
COLDER AIR WILL PUSH IN SAT AND SAT NIGHT.  LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE 
ENOUGH MOISTURE AROUND...ALONG WITH STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES AND 
UPSLOPE FLOW TO KEEP SOME SHOWERS AROUND INTO AT LEAST SUNDAY.  AS 
COLDER AIR PUSHES IN WILL LIKELY SEE SNOW SHOWERS OVER THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN...AND SOME SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATIONS ARE NOT OUT OF THE 
QUESTION IN THESE AREAS.  ALSO SHOULD SEE SUB FREEZING TEMPS IN THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS...INCLUDING SOME AREAS WHERE THE SPRING FREEZE 
WARNING PROGRAM HAS BEGUN.  STILL UNCERTAIN IF FREEZING TEMPS WILL 
OCCUR IN VALLEY AREAS...SINCE CLOUDS AND WIND MAY INHIBIT TEMP 
FALL...BUT STILL WILL BE RATHER COLD.  WILL ISSUE AN SPS TO GIVE A 
HEADS UP FOR THIS WEEKENDS WEATHER.  WILL GENERALLY LEAVE THE LATER

NIGHT. ANTICIPATE SCATTERED CONVECTION TO ACCOMPANY THE FRONT WITH 
SIGNIFICANTLY COLDER AIR FOLLOWING. TEMPS WILL FALL TO WELL BELOW 
CLIMATOLOGY AND ONLY SLOWLY RECOVER THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE

CHANCE POPS FOR THU.  SHOULD BE A LULL THU NIGHT...SO ONLY SLIGHT 
CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS...THEN LOW PRESSURE FORECAST TO TRACK

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS A STAGNANT AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUING OVER THE EASTERN 
U.S. WITH AREA RADARS REVEALING A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE 
EASTERN SLOPES OF THE APPALACHIANS. THIS AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH WEDNESDAY...WITH UNSEASONABLY WARM AND DRY 
CONDITIONS CONTINUING. EXPECT ONLY A FEW CUMULUS CLOUDS TO DEVELOP 
AGAIN IN THE AFTERNOON...MAINLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO FOLLOW PERSISTENCE WITH THE STAGNANT AIRMASS IN 
PLACE.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...PERSISTENT HIGH 
PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES WILL BE SLOW TO DEPART WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT AND THURSDAY AS COLD FRONT DRIFTS SOUTH INTO THE OHIO VALLEY 
THURSDAY. HAVE LOWERED THE POPS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND SLOWED THE 
INCREASE IN RAIN CHANCES FROM NORTH TO SOUTH THURSDAY. INSTABILITY 
AND MOISTURE INCREASE AS THE FRONT APPROACHES AND WITH TEMPERATURES 
RISING TO THE 70S THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE AFTERNOON. FROM 
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MODELS DIFFER ON WHETHER AIRMASS WILL DRY 
OUT OVERNIGHT OR RECOVER AS NEXT FRONT OVER THE MS VALLEY 
APPROACHES. THE NAM IS FASTER AND BRINGS RAIN BACK IN THURSDAY NIGHT

THURSDAY NIGHT AND INCREASED BACK TO ABOUT 50 PERCENT FRIDAY. THIS 
SECOND SYSTEM BRINGS MUCH COLDER AIR INTO THE FORECAST AREA AS

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE STRETCHED ALONG THE 
EASTERN SEABOARD...WITH A STAGNANT AIRMASS REMAINING OVER THE 
REGION. THIS STAGNANT AIRMASS SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO RISE A DEGREE OR 
TWO WARMER THAN YESTERDAYS READINGS. MODELS AND MORNING SOUNDINGS 
INDICATE THAT SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY WILL DEVELOP OVER NORTHEAST 
TN AND SOUTHWEST VA LATER THIS AFTERNOON. WITH A LACK OF MOISTURE 
AND STRONG TRIGGERING MECHANISMS...THINK THAT ONLY ISOLATED TSTORMS 
WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER THE CENTRAL AND NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 

WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS MORNING TO MENTION ISOLATED 
TSTORMS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND TO TWEAK TEMPS UPWARDS A LITTLE.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL WEAKEN OVER 
THE REGION TODAY AT THE APPROACH OF THE NEXT SYSTEM.  THE AIR MASS 
WILL BECOME MILDLY UNSTABLE LATE THIS AFTERNOON...MAINLY OVER OUR 
NORTHEAST ZONES AS A WEAK IMPULSE SLIDES THROUGH ALOFT.  HOWEVER... 
THE ATMOSPHERE REMAINS RATHER DRY AND THIS LACK OF MOISTURE WILL 
INHIBIT CONVECTION.  THOUGH CAN NOT RULE OUT AN ISOLATED SHOWER 
COMPLETELY OVER THE NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS...BELIEVE MOSTLY LIKELY 
SCENARIO IS SCATTERED CU FORMATION...WILL THEREFORE LEAVE FORECAST 
DRY FOR THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING.  MODEL GUIDANCE LOOKS GOOD...SO WILL 
KEEP TEMPERATURES CLOSE TO THESE VALUES.

.LONG TERM...(WED THROUGH MON)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT ON THE 
BIG PICTURE EARLY ON AS RIDGE BREAKS DOWN AND COLD FRONT PUSHES IN WED 
NIGHT AND THU.  SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE DETAILS...AND THINK NAM 
SOLUTION LOOKS MOST REASONABLE FOR OUR AREA.  WILL KEEP WED 
DRY...THEN BRING POPS IN FOR WED NIGHT AND THU WITH THE FRONT...BUT 
NO HIGHER THAN CHANCE FOR NOW AS MOISTURE MAY BE LIMITED WITH NO 
GOOD INFLOW FROM THE GULF.  CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY FURTHER 
OUT...BUT LOOKS LIKE DECENT CHANCE FOR PRECIP FRIDAY AND FRIDAY 
NIGHT WITH NEXT SYSTEM...THEN COLDER AIR PUSHES IN FOR THE WEEKEND.  
WILL TREND TEMPS DOWN A BIT FOR SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...BUT NOT AS 
FAR AS CURRENT GFS WOULD INDICATE...GIVEN POOR RUN TO RUN

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...OPERATIONAL MODELS AND SHORT 
RANGE ENSEMBLES GENERALLY PROJECT PERSISTENT UPPER RIDGE TO MOVE 
SLOWLY EAST THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH RIDGE AXIS PASSING THROUGH THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY AROUND 12Z TUESDAY. RIDGE WEAKENS INTO A 
NEARLY ZONAL FLOW BY 00Z WEDNESDAY. MODELS/ENSEMBLES DEPICT SOME QPF 
CONFINED MAINLY TO MOUNTAIN REGIONS BY LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON. 
HOWEVER...MOISTURE PROFILE DEPICTED BY MODEL TIME HEIGHTS IS 
UNIMPRESSIVE AND LIFT IS ESSENTIALLY NON-EXISTENT. WILL CONTINUE 
WITH DRY FORECAST THROUGH THE FIRST TWO PERIODS...ALTHOUGH ISOLATED 
CONVECTION PROBABLY CANNOT BE TOTALLY RULED OUT IN THE MOUNTAINS AS 
MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW SOME INSTABILITY BY LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD. 
FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO GFS GUIDANCE VALUES AS THEY 
SEEM REASONABLE BASED ON PERSISTENCE.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...DRY PATTERN CONTINUES 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY ALTHOUGH FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL. AN 
UPPER LEVEL LOW LIES OVER THE WESTERN STATES AND A TROUGH STARTS 
DIGGING SOUTH OVER THE GREAT LAKES. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE VERY 
GRADUALLY ESPECIALLY AT LOWER LEVELS. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
HOLDS FIRM ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. A COLD FRONT MOVES 
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AND THEN THROUGH 
THE OHIO VALLEY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. NAM AND ETA BRINGS RAIN WITH THE 
FRONT LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY AS IT MOVES INTO SW VA AND 
NE TN. THE NAM IS A FEW HOURS QUICKER WITH THE PRECIPITATION THAN 
THE ETA. INTRODUCED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS LATE EVENING SW VA 
AND NE TN AND CHANCE BY MORNING. THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE 
THURSDAY AS THE FRONT MOVES SOUTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. HIGH  
TEMPERATURES WILL BE MUCH LOWER BEGINNING THURSDAY. BOTH NAM AND ETA 
DEVELOP ANOTHER SURFACE LOW ALONG THE FRONT TO THE WEST AND BRING 
THE LOW EAST THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY AFTERNOON INTO 
SATURDAY MORNING BEFORE WEAK HIGH PRESSURE MOVES BACK IN SATURDAY 
NIGHT. RIDGING BUILDS NORTH OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN STATES AND THE 
TROUGH OVER THE EAST DIGS SOUTH ON THE WEEKEND. NORTHWEST FLOW 
BEGINS A SERIES OF QUICK SYSTEMS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA FIRST 
SUNDAY AND THEN ANOTHER ONE ABOUT 24 HOURS LATER. AN UPPER LEVEL LOW 
DROPS SOUTHEAST OUT OF CANADA SUNDAY AND MOVES TO THE GREAT LAKES 
LATE MONDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOLER THAN NORMAL BECAUSE OF THIS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...PROTECTIVE RIDGING SFC AND 
ALOFT KEEPS SUBSIDENCE GOING WITH NO CHANCE FOR LOW LVL RETURN FLOW 
OF MOISTURE FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO. THEREFORE DRY WX EXPECTED WITH 
MAX TEMPS NEAR CLIMATOLOGICAL NORMS AND MIN TEMPS A FEW TO SEVERAL 
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL DUE TO MORE EFFICIENT RADIATIONAL CONDITIONS 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...RIDGING THROUGH EARLY 
MONDAY. LITTLE SHORT WAVE MOVES ACROSS NORTHEAST PARTS MONDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH VERY LIMITED RH AND POOR TIMING WITH SFC 
LIFT LIMITED, AS WELL. HAVE OPTED TO KEEP POPS ZERO FOR THAT TIME 
PERIOD WITH ONLY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN CLOUDS. NEXT SYSTEM COMES IN 
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING, AGAIN WITH VERY LIMITED MOISTURE 
AND LIFT. RIDGE REBOUNDS THROUGH THURSDAY WITH A TINY LITTLE WIGGLE 
MOVING OVER TOP, BUT, GUESS WHAT? LIMITED MOISTURE AND LOW LEVEL 
LIFT. PREVIOUS PACKAGE HAS 30 POP FOR THURSDAY AND THAT MIGHT BE A 
LITTLE HIGH BASED ON CURRENT GUIDANCE AND MODELS, BUT ITS SO FAR 
OUT IM NOT INCLINED TO MAKE CHANGES AT THIS JUNCTURE. PROBLEM O 
THE DAY IS THE TEMPERATURES, REALLY, AND THOSE LOOK OK WITH A FEW 
TWEAKS FOR CONSISTANCYS SAKE.

DRIZZLE LINGERING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL 
STRONG SUBSIDENCE IN THE WAKE OF THE UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER SOUTH

TODAY WITH SOME AFTERNOON CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT. 

IN THE EXTENDED...DRY AND TRANQUIL WEATHER LOOKS TO CONTINUE THROUGH 
EARLY NEXT WEEK...AS A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS MOST

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER TROUGH WILL CONTINUE
TO EXIT ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES WITH A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS.  INCREASING THICKNESS AND BOUNDARY
LAYER TEMPERATURES WILL ALLOW FOR A SLOW WARMING TREND THROUGH EARLY NEXT
WEEK. AN UPPER TROUGH WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS TOWARD
THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY FOR LATE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY OF NEXT WEEK.
THIS TROUGH AND INCREASING MOISTURE AS BOUNDARY WINDS BACK TO THE SOUTH

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ACROSS

ONLY A FEW SCATTERED SHOWERS AHEAD OF THIS OCCLUDED FRONT OVER

THIS AFTERNOON...SO DONT THINK ANY TSTORMS WILL BECOME TOO STRONG. 
MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE 
PROGRESSION OF THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM...AND PLACE IT OFF THE 
CAROLINA COAST BY SUNRISE ON THURSDAY. STRONG SUBSIDENCE IN ITS WAKE 
SHOULD DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY...BRINGING DRY AND

MAY GET SOME CONVECTION GOING ACROSS WESTERN/SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT OVER 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN...WITH A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY ASSOCIATED WITH A STRONG LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM CENTERED NEAR KANSAS CITY. AREA RADARS ARE NOT INDICATING 
MUCH CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY AHEAD OF THE COLD 
FRONT...BUT MODELS INDICATE THAT A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE 
ROTATING AROUND THE UPPER LOW WILL GENERATE ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND A 
FEW TSTORMS LATER THIS MORNING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. THIS LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL SLOWLY MOVE SOUTHEAST TODAY INTO THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY BY THIS EVENING. THERE WILL LIKELY BE A BREAK WITH THE 
RAINFALL ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...ALLOWING FOR SOME 
DAYTIME HEATING TO DESTABILIZE THE LOCAL ATMOSPHERE. NAM MODEL 
CONTINUES TO REVEAL A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS DEVELOPING BY LATE 
THIS AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA CLOSER TO THE UPPER LOW. ANOTHER ROUND OF CONVECTION SHOULD 
DEVELOP LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...AS THE COLDER AIR ALOFT 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS UPPER LOW APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA. THIS 
MUCH COLDER AIR ALOFT WILL ALSO BRING THE POSSIBILITY OF LARGE HAIL 
WITH SOME TSTORMS LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 

THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON 
WEDNESDAY...BRINGING ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY ESPECIALLY IN 
THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MODELS ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE PROGRESSION OF THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AND PLACE IT OFF 
THE CAROLINA COAST BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. DRY WEATHER LOOKS TO RETURN 
BY THURSDAY AND CONTINUE THROUGH THE REST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD... 
AS A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S.

.DISCUSSION...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY LIES OVER SW VA THIS EVENING. NO 
PRECIPITATION ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT MOISTURE HAS BEEN INCREASING 
OVER CENTRAL EAST TN AHEAD OF IT WITH RISING DEWPOINTS AND MID LEVEL 
RADAR RETURNS. RIDGING HAS HELD ON A LITTLE LONGER THAN EXPECTED. 
WIDESPREAD SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WELL IN ADVANCE OF COLD 
FRONT NOW OVER WESTERN AR AND LA WAS WEAKENING AND RUC MODEL SHOWS 
ENERGY HAS FOCUSED MORE TO THE SOUTH ALONG THE GULF COAST BUT 
ANOTHER AREA OF THUNDERSTORMS MAY DEVELOP OVER THE MID SOUTH LATE 
THIS EVENING AS VORT LOBE ROTATING AROUND UPPER LOW IN KS MOVES INTO 
AR. THIS NEXT AREA OF PRECIPITATION WOULD MOVE INTO THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU LATE TONIGHT. NOT REAL CONFIDENT ABOUT DROPPING POPS 
SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE REMAINDER OF TONIGHT. INSTEAD WILL UPDATE 
WORDING TO LATE OR MAINLY LATE FOR TIMING.

LOOK TO POP/QPF AS FAR AS TIMING OF PRECIP TONIGHT. MODELS REALLY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY GENERALLY ACROSS 
NORTHERN KY AND CENTRAL WEST VA. THIS FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY SAG 
SOUTH TODAY AND SETTLE OVER SOUTHWEST VA BY THIS AFTERNOON. MODELS 
INDICATE THAT A WEAK SHORT WAVE ALONG WITH SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY 
WILL COMBINE TO TRIGGER A FEW TSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
ALONG THIS FRONT OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. OTHERWISE...A 
LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVER THE LOWER MS 
RIVER VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING AHEAD OF AN ACTIVE COLD 
FRONT. THIS CONVECTION WILL LIKELY MOVE EAST AND WEAKEN ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO 
CONTINUE WITH WARMER TEMPS THAN GUIDANCE TODAY...SINCE THIS HAS BEEN 
THE TREND LATELY AND THIS TREND SHOULD CONTINUE WITH AN UPPER RIDGE 
AND SOUTHERLY FLOW CONTINUING.


.LONG TERM...SOME MINOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NAM AND GFS IN HANDLING
SYSTEM TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY BUT MAINLY IN BREAKS OF PRECIPITATION.
WENT ABOVE GFS NUMBERS FOR MAX MOST DAYS AS IT CONSISTENTLY HAS BEEN
RUNNING A LITTLE HIGH.  BREAK IN RAINFALL BEGINS LATE THURSDAY AND NEXT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...CUMULUS CLOUDS FORMED OVER OUR 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SWRN VA AND EXTREME ERN MOUNTAINOUS COUNTIES 
THIS AFTERNOON...BUT EXPECT THESE LOW CLOUDS TO DISSIPATE THIS 
EVENING.  HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD GRADUALLY THICKEN OVERNIGHT...WHILE 
WINDS REMAIN GENERALLY LIGHT AND VARIABLE.  THE SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL 
FLOW MAINLY RETURNS TO MIDDLE AND W TN OVERNIGHT...SO I STAYED QUITE 
CLOSE TO THE MAV LOWS OR NEAR THE BLEND OF SIMILAR MOS MIN TEMPS.

FOR MONDAY...THE UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES TO WEAKEN AS THE PLAINS LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES SLOWLY EAST.  ALL SHORT RANGE MODELS WANTED TO 
PRODUCE SHOWERS (POSSIBLY THUNDERSTORMS) ALONG THE WEAK FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY TO OUR NORTH.  THIS BOUNDARY SHOWS UP AT 850 MB LEVEL AND 
AT THE SURFACE AS AT LEAST A DEWPOINT DISCONTINUITY TODAY...SO I 
INTRODUCED LOW POPS FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON AS THIS FEATURE SAGS 
SOUTHWARD INTO THE REGION.  POPS WERE LIMITED TO NRN MOST AREAS 
INITIALLY...THEN AREA WIDE AS THE COLD FRONT TO OUR WEST DRAWS 
CLOSER.  MODELS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN 850 MB RH...SO MOS 
MAX TEMPS OF A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN TODAY SEEMED REASONABLE. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY WILL SLOWLY APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT MONDAY NIGHT 
AND TUESDAY. A WEAK BOUNDARY OR BACK DOOR COLD FRONT SOUTH OF A 
LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER NORTHEAST CANADA AND THE NORTHEAST 
STATES IS EXPECTED TO ALSO SAG SOUTH ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART OF THE 
FORECAST AREA MONDAY EVENING BRINGING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS TO 
NORTHERN SECTIONS. THIS BACK DOOR FRONT MAY HELP TO SLOW THE 
APPROACHING SYSTEM A LITTLE MORE. CLOUDS AND SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD CONTINUE TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY AS FRONT 
APPROACHES AND UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVES FROM THE MID MS VALLEY TO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. THURSDAY THE UPPER LOW 
MOVES TO THE EAST SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS BUT MOISTURE ROTATING 
AROUND IT WILL KEEP THE FORECAST AREA WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS JUST 
LIKE THE LAST SYSTEM LAST FRIDAY. MAY EVEN HAVE THUNDERSTORMS WITH 
COLDER AIR ALOFT. FRIDAY UPPER LOW MOVES OFF THE COAST AND SO ENDED 
RAIN BUT KEPT SOME CLOUDS. WITH THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF THE SYSTEM 
LATER SHIFTS MAY HAVE TO ADD RAIN CHANCES BACK IN FRIDAY. WEAK HIGH 
PRESSURE TRIES TO BUILD IN FOR THE WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE STRETCHED ALONG THE EASTERN U.S. WITH SATELLITE IMAGES 
REVEALING ONLY A FEW HIGH CLOUDS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS 
INDICATE THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA THROUGH TONIGHT...RESULTING IN UNSEASONABLY WARM AND TRANQUIL 
WEATHER CONDITIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO FOLLOW THE WARMER 
NGM NUMBERS FOR TODAY AND THE WARMER GFS NUMBERS FOR TONIGHT...SINCE 
THE UPPER RIDGE AND LIGHT SOUTHERLY FLOW SHOULD COMBINE TO ALLOW FOR 
WARMER TEMPS.


.LONG TERM...NEXT ROUND OF SHORT WAVES BEGIN TO SWING THROUGH ON 
MONDAY.  CURRENT THINKING IS FOR THE FIRST WAVE MONDAY AFTERNOON TO 
BE BASICALLY DRY BUT CANT TOTALLY RULE OUT AN ISOLATED SHOWER.  
THREAT INCREASES MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY AND LINGERING THROUGH 
THURSDAY BEFORE BEGINNING TO TAPER OFF.  THIS SYSTEM LOOKS VERY 
SIMILIAR TO LAST ONE...SO THERE WILL BE PERIODS WITHOUT RAIN BUT 
WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT WHEN THEY WILL BE.  

DRY AGAIN ON FRIDAY.  CURRENT FORECAST HAS SHOWERS IN ON SATURDAY 
BUT HAVE LOW CONFIDENCE THAT FAR OUT SO LEFT IN THE SHOWERS BUT 
BACKED OFF ON POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY.  

STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE ON TEMPS.  LOWERED MAXES MID WEEK

WILL STAY CLOSE TO MAV GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...RIDGING ALOFT AND 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST SHOULD HOLD ABOUT ONE 
MORE DAY ALTHOUGH CLOUDINESS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE MONDAY AND 
INCREASING INSTABILITY WILL BRING A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS BY EVENING. ALSO A WEAK FRONT WILL SAG SOUTH FROM THE 
OHIO VALLEY AND LIE ACROSS VA AND KY BY MONDAY EVENING. CONVERGENCE 
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS COULD GIVE THE MOUNTAINS SHOWERS FIRST 
IN THE LATE AFTERNOON. LOW PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT ACROSS 
THE CENTRAL PLAINS WILL WORK EAST INTO THE MS VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT.
THE NAM SHOWS SHORT WAVE ENERGY AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM MOVING INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY A LITTLE FASTER THAN THE 
GFS. LOW PRESSURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO 
THE TN VALLEY TUESDAY BUT THEN AS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW HOLDS BACK 
OVER THE MID MS VALLEY THE COLD FRONT WILL WEAKEN BUT BE A FOCUS FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH AT LEAST THURSDAY AS THE UPPER LOW 
FILLS AND MOVES SLOWLY EAST. LOOKS LIKE THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN WILL 
BE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL BE MILD MONDAY WITH 
HIGHS LOWERING TO THE 60S TUESDAY THROUGH THE WEEK AS LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE IS ABUNDANT AND THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS CONTINUES. ANOTHER

LOW...LOOKS LIKE BY 03Z TONIGHT ALL LIFT WILL BE OUT OF AREA AND

.SHORT TERM... (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH LOCAL RADARS 
REVEALING NOT MUCH PRECIP OVER THE FORECAST AREA AT THE MOMENT. WILL 
PLAN TO MENTION ONLY SCATTERED SHOWERS TODAY...SINCE RAIN COVERAGE 
SHOULD REMAIN LESS THAN INDICATED BY THE MODELS WITH SOME DOWNSLOPE 
EFFECTS AND ONLY WEAK INSTABILITY EXPECTED. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY MOVE EAST TODAY...AND SHOULD EXIT MOST OF 
THE FORECAST AREA BY THIS EVENING. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO 
FOLLOW PERSISTENCE SINCE UPSTREAM AIRMASS REMAINS SIMILAR TO THE 
AIRMASS CURRENTLY OVER THE FORECAST AREA.


.LONG TERM...AFTER PRECIP MOVES OUT THIS EVENING...SATURDAY THROUGH
MONDAY LOOK LIKE PLEASANT SPRING DAYS.  THE NEXT SYSTEM LOOKS VERY
SIMILIAR TO THE LAST FEW DAYS WITH A SERIES OF SHORT WAVES BEGINNING 
TO MOVE THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH NEXT FRIDAY MORNING.  WENT A

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...CONVECTION SLOWLY SPREADING

HEAVY RAINS AT THIS TIME.  THINK GOOD COVERAGE OF RAINS WILL 
CONTINUE INTO THIS EVENING OVER WESTERN PARTS OF AREA...BUT AS

BROKEN UP AS IT PASSES OVER MOUNTAINS...THINKING SOME DEGREE OF RAIN 
SHADOW EFFECT ON OUR SIDE OF SMOKIES.  ALSO LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE 
TRANSPORT AND WIND SHEAR IS FORECAST TO SLOWLY DIMINISH AS WELL.  SO 
THINKING THAT OVERALL...THE MAIN IMPACTS WILL BE MORE NUMEROUS 
BEFORE SUNSET.  NOT PLANNING ANY FLASH FLOOD WATCH FOR TONIGHT.

HAVE MENTIONED THUNDER IN FIRST PERIOD...BUT MAINLY EXPECTING 
SHOWERS FOR FRIDAY.  ALSO...AS SYSTEM EXITS AREA...HAVE LOWERED POPS

A LARGE BAND OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO MOVE SLOWLY
NORTH NORTHEAST TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA.  THE LEADING EDGE HAS MOVED INTO THE
PLATEAU COUNTIES.  A STRONG UPPER JET WILL ROUND THE BASE OF THE TROUGH
OVERNIGHT TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS HELPING TO INCREASE THE 
DIFLUENCE ALOFT OVER THE AREA.  ALSO...INCREASING LOW LEVEL JET WILL (AROUND
35-40 KNOTS AT 850 MB) WILL PULL GULF MOISTURE INTO THE REGION.

A LARGE BAND OF RAIN AND EMBEDDED STORMS CAN BE EXPECTED WITH NEAR 100
PERCENT COVERAGE OVERNIGHT. WILL UP POPS FOR THE SOUTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF
THE FORECAST AREA.  RAIN MAY BE HEAVY AT TIMES OVER THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN
HALF OF THE AREA...ESPECIALLY THE UPSLOPE AREAS. WILL INCLUDE THE POTENTIAL
OF HEAVY RAINS IN THE FORECAST.  HOWEVER...FLASH FLOOD POTENTIAL LOOKS TO
BE ISOLATED...SO WILL NOT ISSUE A FFA AT THIS TIME.

DUE TO INCREASING LOW LEVEL JET...PLAN ON INCREASING THE WINDS OVER THE

SYSTEM.  WE SHOULD SEE THESE CLOUDS THICKEN AND LOWER TO A MID DECK 
OVER NIGHT BEFORE BREAKING UP SOMEWHAT TOMORROW AFTERNOON.  LIMITED 
LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE MEANS THERE IS NO CHANCE FOR RAIN TONIGHT OR

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS 
AND ENSEMBLES APPEAR TO BE COMING IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE NEXT 
SIGNIFICANT EVENT IN THE LATE WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY TIME FRAME. 
SOME SUBTLE DIFFERENCES APPEAR BY 00Z SATURDAY AS THE CANADIAN GEM 
MODEL DEPICTS UPPER CLOSED LOW TO TRANSITION INTO AN OPEN 
WAVE...WHICH WILL EFFECT SPEED OF SYSTEM DEPARTURE. BOTH THE GFS AND 
THE ECMWF DEPICT THIS TRANSITION TO OCCUR SOMEWHAT LATER. TIMING THE 
END OF THE PRECIP EVENT REMAINS PROBLEMATIC AND HAVE NOT CHANGED 
EXISTING POPS GRIDS/FORECAST AT THIS TIME. HIGHLY AMPLIFIED RIDGE 
BUILDS IN BEHIND THE DEPARTING FEATURE OVER THE UPCOMING WEEKEND. 
THIS SUGGESTS TRANQUIL WEATHER AND MODERATING TEMPS INTO EARLY NEXT 
WEEK. HAD NO COMPELLING REASON TO SIGNIFICANTLY DEVIATE FROM GFS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...TRANQUIL WEATHER IN STORE 
THROUGH THE FIRST TWO PERIODS AS RIDGING CONTINUES TO BUILD IN AT 
THE SURFACE AND ALOFT. SIGNIFICANT HEIGHT RISES AS DEPICTED IN THE 
MODELS AND SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLES ALONG WITH RETURN FLOW AROUND 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO CLIMB TO ABOVE 
CLIMATOLOGY IN THE SECOND PERIOD. MODEL TEMP GUIDANCE IN REASONABLY 
GOOD AGREEMENT IN THE FIRST PERIOD...BUT NOT IN THE SECOND PERIOD. 
GENERALLY WENT WITH A BLEND IN BOTH CASES.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...RIDGING CONTINUES 
BUILDING IN ALOFT MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY...WITH SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE CENTERED TO OUR SOUTHEAST.  SHOULD BE DRY AND SEASONABLY 
WARM THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. MODELS STILL INDICATING A LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM...WHICH WILL BE CUT OFF ALOFT...MOVING RATHER SLOWLY EAST 
AND AFFECTING OUR WEATHER WEDNESDAY THROUGH AT LEAST FRIDAY.
STILL QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE DETAILS...BUT FOR NOW
WILL PUT POSSIBILITY OF PRECIP IN THE FORECAST FOR WED THROUGH 
FRI...THEN PLAY IT DRY FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...WITH HIGHER 
CONFIDENCE FOR A DRY SUNDAY THAN FOR SATURDAY.  LATEST RUNS

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A DEEP AREA OF LOW PRESSURE NEAR 
PHILADELPHIA WITH ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST. 
RADARS STILL INDICATE SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...IN ASSOCIATION WITH A DEEP UPPER- 
LEVEL LOW OVER CENTRAL VIRGINIA. REPORTS FROM EARLIER THIS EVENING 
INDICATED AROUND AN INCH OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IN WISE COUNTY VA... 
WITH UP TO TEN INCHES NEAR CLINGMANS DOME IN THE SMOKIES. THUS... 
WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE THE SNOW ADVISORIES AND WARNINGS OVERNIGHT... 
SINCE ADDITIONAL LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE UNTIL THE 
PRECIP ENDS AFTER MIDNIGHT.

LATEST VAD WIND PROFILE INDICATES THAT STRONG WINDS AROUND 30 KNOTS 
ARE OCCURRING ABOVE 3000 FEET. SURFACE OBS STILL SHOW BREEZY WINDS 
ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA...BUT WINDS HAVE BACKED OFF 
CONSIDERABLY ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ZONES. THUS...WILL PLAN 
TO CONTINUE THE HIGH WIND WARNING FOR THE MOUNTAINS OVERNIGHT...BUT

212 PM EST SAT APR 2 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...OPERATIONAL MODELS AND SHORT 
RANGE ENSEMBLES GENERALLY AGREE THAT VIGOROUS UPPER LOW CURRENTLY 
CENTERED OVER SOUTHWESTERN WEST VIRGINIA WILL RAPIDLY PULL NORTHEAST 
AND AWAY FROM THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH THE FIRST PERIOD. 
ANTICIPATE THAT SIGNIFICANT PRECIP WILL HAVE ENDED ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA BY 09Z. UNTIL THEN...EXPECT RAIN SHOWERS (AND SNOW 
SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS) TO CONTINUE ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA AS MOISTURE CONTINUES TO WRAP AROUND UPPER LOW. SNOW 
EVENT IN HIGHER TERRAIN WILL BE ENHANCED BY UPSLOPE FLOW COMPONENT. 
THUS WILL CONTINUE HEAVY SNOW WARNING FOR CENTRAL AND NORTHERN 
MOUNTAINS...AND ISSUE AN ADVISORY FOR SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA 
COUNTIES...MAINLY ABOVE 2500 FEET.

STRONG SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN DEPARTING SURFACE LOW 
PRESSURE AND HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
SUGGESTS STRONG WINDS WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE FIRST PERIOD. WILL 
ALSO CONTINUE WIND ADVISORIES/WARNINGS AS CURRENTLY CONFIGURED. 
POTENTIAL CLEARING SKY CONDITIONS LATE IN THE FIRST PERIOD MAY ALLOW 
TEMPS TO DROP TO NEAR PROJECTED DEWPOINT VALUES...AND TENDED TO 
FAVOR COOLER NGM MOS GUIDANCE VALUES IN THE FIRST PERIOD. GENERALLY 
WENT WITH A BLEND OF THE GUIDANCE VALUES IN THE SECOND PERIOD AS 
STRONG INSOLATION AND DOWNSLOPE FLOW SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO RECOVER 
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE SECOND PERIOD.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...WITH RIDGING BUILDING 
IN ALOFT...SHOULD BE DRY WITH A WARMING TREND FOR SUNDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT.  NEXT SYSTEM STILL LOOKS LIKE IT WILL 
APPROACH WEDNESDAY...GFS HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN SHOWING A MIDWEEK 
SYSTEM...BUT TIMING HAS VARIED A BIT FROM RUN TO RUN.  GFS STILL 
SHOWING THE UPPER LOW CUTTING OFF AND RATHER SLOW MOVEMENT...WITH 
PRECIP LINGERING FOR A WHILE.  FOR NOW...WILL GENERALLY TRY TO 
FOLLOW HPC SOLUTION AND WILL CARRY PRECIP FOR WED THROUGH 
FRIDAY...THEN DRY FOR SATURDAY.  IF 00Z GFS IS RIGHT...COULD BE SOME 
HIGHER ELEVATION SNOW ONCE AGAIN AS THE UPPER LOW TRACKS ACROSS THE 
AREA...BUT 12Z RUN IS WARMER. WITH THE UNCERTAINTY THAT FAR OUT...WILL 
KEEP SNOW OUT OF THE FORECAST FOR NOW.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
226 PM EST FRI APR 1 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...A VERY COMPLEX WEATHER 
PATTERN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  FIRST QUESTION IS SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  STILL FEEL 
THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR FAIRLY RAPID DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON SO 
HANGING ONTO HIGH POPS FOR THIS PERIOD.  THERE ALSO IS STILL THE 
POTENTIAL FOR SOME OF THESE STORMS TO BECOME SEVERE...PARTICULARLY 
IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY SO WILL WORD ACCORDINGLY.

NEXT BIG QUESTION IS THE WRAP AROUND MOISTURE BEHIND THE COLD FRONT 
AND ASSOCIATED PRECIPITATION...PARTICULARLY IN THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS.  FEEL THAT ANY SNOW WILL BE IN ELEVATIONS ABOVE 3000 
FT.  THE GROUND WILL BE FAIRLY WARM STARTING THE EVENT AND INITIALLY 
THE SNOW WILL BE MIXED WITH RAIN SO DO NOT EXPECT MAJOR 
ACCUMULATIONS AT THIS TIME.  THROUGH THE DAY SATURDAY SEE AROUND AN 
INCH OF SNOW BY SUNSET SATURDAY.  THESE SNOW WILL CONTINUE INTO 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND WILL LET THE LONG TERM ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS.  
WITH THE UNCERTAINTIES AND AMOUNTS WILL NOT ISSUE WARNING OR 
ADVISORY AT THIS TIME BUT WILL ADDRESS WITH A SPECIAL WEATHER 
STATEMENT.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS IN BETTER 
AGREEMENT THIS RUN THAN YESTERDAY. UPPER LOW PULLS AWAY SATURDAY 
NIGHT...BUT LINGERING MOISTURE...LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY...AND UPSLOPE FLOW 
SHOULD CONTINUE SHOWERS LINGERING INTO SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH SNOW 
SHOWERS OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  WILL USE HIGHEST POPS OVER THE 
NORMALLY FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS.   SHOULD SEE SOME ADDITIONAL 
ACCUMULATIONS OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  ALSO...IT WILL BE WINDY OVER 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN SAT NIGHT INTO EARLY SUNDAY.  LATER SHIFTS MAY
NEED TO ISSUE WIND ADVISORIES.  MOISTURE EXITS SUNDAY...AND 
WITH RIDGING BUILDING IN...SHOULD BE DRY THROUGH TUESDAY.  NEXT 
SYSTEM APPROACHES WEDNESDAY...AND IF UPPER LOW CUTS OFF AS DEPICTED 
BY GFS...MAY BE SLOW TO LEAVE.  FOR NOW WILL CARRY PRECIP FOR 
WEDNESDAY THROUGH THU NIGHT...BUT WILL BE GO DRY FOR FRI.

.DISCUSSION...OUR BRIEF BREAK IN A WET PATTERN IS SURE TO BE 
SHORT-LIVED AS PRESSURE FALLS HAVE ALREADY BEEN NOTED ACROSS THE 
LOWER MISS VALLEY REGION IN ADVANCE OF THE DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH 
OVER THE PLAINS STATES.  SURFACE LOW PRESSURE LOOKS TO BE DEVELOPING 
AS EXPECTED ACROSS LA/MS VICINITY...AND WILL RATHER QUICKLY HEAD NE 
AND SPREAD SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS OUR WAY FRIDAY.

GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE CURRENT CONVECTIVE PCPN IS MUCH FURTHER TO OUR 
SOUTH TONIGHT (THAN LAST NIGHTS)...AND THE STEERING WINDS ARE 
CONSIDERABLY WEAKER TONIGHT.  THUS...THE CURRENT SCENARIO FOR JUST 
CHANCE POPS IN OUR SOUTHERN AREAS LATE TONIGHT TO SLIGHT CHANCE NRN 
AREAS LOOKS GOOD (ALTHO POSSIBLY COULD REMOVE THE 20 PERCENT CHANCE 
FOR SWRN VA OVERNIGHT).

WILL CHECK MIN TEMP FORECAST AND CURRENT GRIDS FOR ANY NEEDED UPDATES
...BUT THE WORDING IN THE ZFP IS IN GREAT SHAPE WITH NO EVENING 
WORDING TO REMOVE.  LATER SHIFTS WILL NEED TO WATCH CLOSELY THE 
POTENTIAL FOR SOME HEAVY RAINS IN THE SRN MTNS FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING...AS WELL AS POSSIBLE LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IN THE 
HIGHEST TERRAIN ON SATURDAY.  HOWEVER...LATEST RUNS OF THE ETA(NAM)
AND GFS SEEM TO BE TRENDING MUCH LIGHTER ON POSSIBLE SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...BRIEF PERIOD OF DRY WEATHER 
IN STORE THROUGH EARLY FRIDAY MORNING AS SYSTEM WHICH PRODUCED THIS 
MORNINGS CONVECTION CONTINUES TO PULL AWAY. NEXT SYSTEM FOLLOWS 
CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF THE FIRST WITH PRECIP EXPECTED TO ENCROACH THE 
SOUTHERN TIER AROUND 06Z FRIDAY. THE PRECIP WILL OVERSPREAD THE REST 
OF THE FORECAST AREA BY AROUND 12Z. GFS IS A LITTLE SLOWER WITH THIS 
PROGRESSION. UPPER FLOW BECOMES MUCH MORE AMPLIFIED AS TROUGH 
CONTINUES TO DIG INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS DURING THE DAY ON FRIDAY. 
APPEARS THAT HEAVIEST PRECIP WILL REMAIN SOUTH OF OUR FORECAST 
AREA...ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE HEAVIER PRECIP MAY SNEAK INTO 
SOUTHEASTERN TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWESTERN NORTH CAROLINA. FOR 
TEMPS...GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS VALUES FAIRLY CLOSELY.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER TROUGH PASSES 
OVER THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT.  THIS SYSTEM...AND ESPECIALLY SURFACE 
LOW POSITION...STILL NOT HANDLED CONSISTENTLY BY MODELS...AND WITH 
POOR AGREEMENT AND CONSISTENCY CONFIDENCE IN THE DETAILS IS LOWER 
THAN AVERAGE.  WILL GENERALLY FOLLOW HPC LEAD AND USE A GFS/NAM BLEND.  
SHOULD BE SHOWERS AROUND FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY...AND AS COLDER 
AIR COMES IN...MAY SEE SOME SNOW SHOWERS MIXING IN OVER THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN.  WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING IN NORMALLY FAVORED 
UPSLOPE AREAS EARLY SAT NIGHT...EXPECT CLOUDS TO GRADUALLY BEGIN 
CLEARING FROM SW TO NE OVERNIGHT.  TROUGH EXITS AND HIGH PRESSURE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER TROF OVERHEAD WITH SFC 
FRONT APPROACHING FROM MID TN. BATCH OF CONVECTION FORMING IN STRONG 
SFC THETA E RIDGE OVER MID TN DOWN TO GMEX. E TN, THOUGH, IN STRONG 
THETA TROF SO CONVECTION THAT IS STRONG OVER MID TN AND AL IS 
WEAKENING OVER OUR AREA. AT BEST, THUNDERSTORMS ARE BORDERLINE 
SEVERE, BUT LATEST REPORTS HAVE STRONGEST STORMS AT AROUND 45 MPH 
WINDS WITH LIGHTNING AND RAIN...IN OTHER WORDS, THUNDERSTORMS.

THIS COMBO OF SFC FRONT AND UPPER TROF WILL AFFECT FORECAST THROUGH 
TONIGHT, AND THEN A SMALL BREAK IN THE  ACTION OCCURS, WITH UPPER 
LOW WITH LIMITED SUCCESS TO CUT OFF FRIDAY AND SFC INVERTED TROF 
PROVIDING LOW LEVEL SUPPORT. HENCE SHOWERS NEARLY CATEGORICAL 
FRIDAY. HAVE LEFT HIGH/LOWS AS IS, AND TWEAKED SKY COVER A TAD IN 
THE FAR NORTHEAST TO ACCOUNT FOR TONIGHTS BREAK AND TO MOVE MORE IN 
LINE WITH THOSE OFFICES DROPPING OF CLOUD COVER NEARLY ALTOGETHER 
FOR SEVERAL HOURS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPR TROF MOVS E TO AN 
ERN GT LAKES/SRN APPALACHIAN LINE BY 12Z SAT WITH COLD AIR SPILLING

AT THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS ALONG THE NC BORDER FRIDAY NIGHT/EARLY SAT 
MORNING. WRAP AROUND PRECIP LINGERS ACROSS SW VA/NE TN AND MTNS 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY BEFORE ENDING BY SATURDAY EVENING. KEPT MUCH 
OF THE REMAINDER OF THE FCST DRY UNTIL LATE TUE NIGHT INTO WED AS

755 PM EST WED MAR 30 2005

.DISCUSSION...A BEAUTIFUL DAY ACROSS THE REGION IS WINDING DOWN WITH 
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND VERY PLEASANT TEMPS IN THE MID 60S TO MID 70S 
NOTED.  SOME CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION (PCPN) IS FINALLY STARTING TO 
FIRE ACROSS THE GULF COAST (WHERE BEST INSTABILITY IS NOTED)...AND 
ALSO ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST AND WESTERN GREAT LAKES REGION 
(ASSOCIATED WITH THE SURFACE AND UPPER LOW TRACK).  THIS LEAVES OUR 
REGION IN BETWEEN THESE TWO AREAS AND CURRENTLY HAVING A VERY STABLE 
AIRMASS IN PLACE WITH NO LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AS OF YET.

I HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT THE SHORT RANGE MODELS MIGHT BE OVERDOING 
THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXTENT OF CONVECTIVE PCPN OVERNIGHT...AS QUITE 
OFTEN OUR AREA SEES SCATTERED OR LESS CONVECTION WITH UPPER LEVEL 
SUPPORT SO FAR NORTH OF US...AND BEST INSTABILITY TO OUR SOUTH OVER 
THE GULF COAST STATES.  I DID NOTICE TWO FEATURES THAT MIGHT HELP 
OUR CHANCES OF SHOWERS (POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS) BY THURSDAY MORNING 
...1) UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE UPPER LEVEL JET 
ACROSS THE SE STATES...AND 2) A 40 KNOT OR SO LOW LEVEL JET THAT 
COULD TRANSPORT SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE NORTHWARD IN ADVANCE 
OF THE SOMEWHAT WEAK COLD FRONT (ALTHO MODELS ONLY DEVELOP MARGINAL 
INSTABILITY THURSDAY).

WILL UPDATE THE ZFPMRX AROUND 9PM OR SO AND REMOVE ANY EVENING 
WORDING.  MAY ALSO SIMPLIFY THE WORDING A BIT...OPTING FOR 
INCREASING CLOUDS AND PERHAPS A SLIGHT DECREASE IN RAIN CHANCES THRU 
12Z THURSDAY (ESPECIALLY IF RADAR AND SATELLITE TRENDS SUPPORT 
THIS).  GRIDS AND WEB PRODUCTS WILL ALSO REFLECT ANY NEEDED CHANGES 
FOR TONIGHT.  HOWEVER...FOR NOW WONT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE SECOND 
PERIOD...PREFERRING THAT MIDNIGHT SHIFT LOOK OVER NEW 31/00Z MODEL 
RUN AND WATCH CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...RIDGE ALOFT BEGINS TO BREAK 
DOWN AS THE NEXT S/W SWINGS IN OVERNIGHT TONIGHT.  SUFFICIENT 
MOISTURE HAS RETURNED FROM THE GULF TO ALLOW SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO MOVE INTO THE AREA BEGINNING FROM THE SOUTHWEST 
OVERNIGHT AND SPREADING ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE REGION BY 12Z.  
GFS AND NAM IN CLOSE AGREEMENT SO NO REAL CHOICE THERE.  WENT WITH A 
BLEND FOR GUIDANCE NUMBERS.  

SHOWERS BEGIN TO CLEAR FROM THE WEST TOMORROW MORNING AND POPS DROP 
BACK INTO THE CHANCE CATEGORY BY LATE AFTERNOON.


.LONG TERM...(THU NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS IN POOR 
AGREEMENT FOR SYSTEM THU NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...ESPECIALLY WITH 
SURFACE LOW TRACK.  GFS IS FURTHER  NORTH WITH THE SURFACE 
LOW...ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE PERIOD. WILL GENERALLY FOLLOW HPC IDEA 
AND USE A BLEND...BUT HIGHER THAN NORMAL LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY FOR 
THIS PART OF FORECAST.  REASONABLE AGREEMENT THAT SURGE OF MOISTURE 
AND DECENT LIFT AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL BRING PRECIP TO AT LEAST 
SOUTHERN AREAS LATE THU NIGHT...THEN LIFT ACROSS THE AREA FRIDAY.  
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING INTERESTING...AS COLDER AIR SURGES 
IN...SHOULD SEE HIGHER ELEVATIONS CHANGE TO SNOW SHOWERS.  ETA 
BULLISH ON SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OVER THE MOUNTAINS...BUT USING A BLEND 
WOULD LIMIT AMOUNTS.  FOR NOW WILL JUST TREND COLDER AND ADD SNOW 
SHOWERS TO THESE AREAS FOR LATTER HALF OF FRI NIGHT INTO SATURDAY.  
FURTHER OUT...SHOULD BE DRY SUN THROUGH TUESDAY...THEN NEXT SYSTEM 
APPROACHES ON WEDNESDAY.

REACH THE 70S THIS AFTERNOON.  GENERALLY RUNNING ABOUT 2-3 DEGREES 
BEHIND MOS TREND...AND CURRENT DEWPOINTS WERE ALSO RUNNING LOWER 
THAN EXPECTED.  LATE AFTERNOON TEMP/DEWPOINT GRIDS WERE ADJUSTED TO 
REFLECT THIS...AND ALSO I RE-POPULATED WITH FWC MOS DEWPOINTS (BEST 
OF THE BUNCH).   

FOR TONIGHT...EXPECT JUST SOME PASSING THIN HIGH CLOUDS AT TIMES 
WITH BULK OF CLOUDINESS TO REMAIN TO OUR WEST.  GIVEN THESE MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKIES...VERY LIGHT WINDS AND CURRENT DEWPOINTS...I FAVORED AT 
OR JUST BELOW THE COOLER MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT.  A FEW AREAS OF DENSE 
FOG WERE NOTED THIS MORNING (MAINLY NE AREAS)...BUT SOME DRYING HAS 
OCCURRED THIS AFTERNOON...SO OPTED TO JUST MENTION SOME PATCHY AREAS 
OF FOG LATE TONIGHT IN THE FAVORED AREAS NEAR LAKES/STREAMS.  LATER 
SHIFTS CAN MONITOR AND ADD DENSE FOG IF NEEDED.

FOR WEDNESDAY...JUST A GRADUAL INCREASE IN CLOUDS/MOISTURE FROM THE 
WEST...TO NO WORSE THAN PARTLY CLOUDY BY THE AFTERNOON.  SOUTHWEST 
LOW LEVEL FLOW STRENGTHENS IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT SIGNIGICANT SYSTEM 
...WITH STRONGEST WINDS OVER WESTERN MOST PARTS OF THE AREA.  WAS 
NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO GO WITH THE WARMER ETA MOS FOR MAX TEMPS 
WEDNESDAY...SO STAYED CLOSE TO PREVIOUS HIGHS WHICH WERE NEAR THE

PRECIP.  COOLER...DRYER AIR WILL MOVE IN FOR SATURDAY.  MODELS IN

TODAY HAS OVERALL BEEN LESS THAN SHORT RANGE MODELS DEPICTED...ALTHO 
A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS CONTINUES TO ROTATE AROUND THE BACK SIDE OF 
THE UPPER LOW (WHICH HAS MOVED EAST TO ACROSS NE TN AND WRN NC). 
DECIDED TO GO AGAINST THE HIGHER ETA MOS POPS...AND MORE WITH A 
BLEND OF THE NGM/MAV MOS POPS.  HIGHEST RAIN CHANCES WILL BE NE 
PLATEAU AND SWRN VA AS LINGERING SHOWERS AT LEAST REACH THESE AREAS. 
NO LIGHTNING STRIKES NOTED AND AIRMASS SEEMS A BIT TOO STABLE FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS.  THINK THAT WINDS WILL STAY BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA 
THIS EVENING...AS LOW LEVEL JET LOOKS TO BE AROUND 30 TO 40 KNOTS 
PER ETA MODEL.  PREVIOUS GRIDS LOOKED GREAT WITH SOME 15 TO 25 MPH 
SPEEDS ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN EARLY TONIGHT.

PREVIOUS GRIDS ALSO HAD A NICE DECREASING CLOUD TREND ...WHICH WAS 
JUST SLIGHTLY ADJUSTED FOR REST OF THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING.  
TEMPS HAVE BEEN RUNNING ON THE COOL SIDE THIS AFTERNOON...BUT SHOULD 
NOT FALL TOO MUCH MORE GIVEN THE CLOUDS...WINDS AND LOW LEVEL WARM 
AIR ADVECTION NOTED LATE TONIGHT.  

FOR TUESDAY...DRY AND WARM AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS BRIEFLY INTO 
THE REGION.  NGM MOS MAX TEMPS SEEMED POSSIBLY OUT OF REACH...BUT 
THE MAV MAXES LOOKED A BIT LOW...SO I FAVORED CLOSER TO THE ETA MOS.

THE LATEST SATELLITE PICS.  SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS OVER MUCH 
OF EAST TN ATTM...AND A LARGER AREA OF SHOWERS IS ROTATING S TO SE 
AROUND THE BACK SIDE OF THE UPPER LOW INTO MIDDLE TN.  AGREE WITH 
SHORT RANGE MODELS THAT PCPN SHOULD CONTINUE TO FILL IN ACROSS MUCH 
OF THE FORECAST AREA INTO THIS AFTERNOON...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH 
HIGH LIKELY TO LOW CATEGORICAL POPS FOR REST OF TODAY.

MODIFIED THE 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS FOR MAX TEMPS IN THE 50S TO 
LOWER 60S...AND FOUND POSITIVE CAPES OF NEAR 100 TO 300 J/KG AS MID 
LEVEL TEMPS FALL SHARPLY WITH APPROACH OF THE UPPER LOW.  NOT SURE 
HOW WIDESPREAD THUNDERSTORMS BECOME...GIVEN WEAKENING LIFT AND 
MARGINAL INSTABILITY...SO MAY CHANGE WORDING TO SCATTERED OR A 
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS.

SOME CONCERN FOR WIND SPEEDS REACHING NEAR ADVISORY LEVELS...BUT 
APPEARS WINDS WOULD BE STRONGER THIS EVENING.  LATEST CHECK OF 
OBSERVATION SITES ONLY FOUND A FEW SPOTS WITH ANY GUSTS AT ALL...
SO FOR NOW WILL MONITOR WIND SPEEDS AND CONSIDER THIS AGAIN IN THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
INVERTED TROUGH STRETCHING NORTHEAST GENERALLY ALONG THE PLATEAU... 
WITH A DEEPENING SURFACE LOW OVER WEST-CENTRAL ALABAMA. TEMPS HAVE 
WARMED CONSIDERABLY INTO THE LOWER TO MID 70S ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...WHERE BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER OCCURRED 
EARLIER TODAY. A MODIFIED NASHVILLE SOUNDING WITH THESE TEMPS 
INDICATES THAT MODERATE INSTABILITY WILL DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING. THIS MODERATE INSTABILITY...COMBINED WITH THE HIGH HELICITY 
VALUES ALONG THE INVERTED TROUGH AND AHEAD OF THE SURFACE LOW... 
SHOULD HELP TO SET THE STAGE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUPERCELLS ALONG 
AND EAST OF THE TROUGH LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE THREAT 
OF MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION WITH LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL SHOULD 
DEVELOP THIS EVENING AS THE SURFACE LOW TRACKS INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA. MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE A SLOWER PROGRESSION OF THIS 
SURFACE LOW...WITH THE LOW EXPECTED TO BE LOCATED ACROSS CENTRAL 
EAST TN AROUND MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. THE DEEP UPPER LOW ASSOCIATED WITH 
THIS SYSTEM WILL LINGER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TOMORROW...HELPING

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN INVERTED TROUGH ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH A SURFACE LOW OVER WEST CENTRAL ALABAMA. THE MAIN 
WARM FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW WAS STILL LOCATED SOUTH OF THE 
AREA OVER CENTRAL ALABAMA AND CENTRAL GEORGIA...AND SHOULD REMAIN 
SOUTH OF THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL A MORE 
EXTENSIVE DRY SLOT AHEAD OF THE SURFACE LOW THAN EARLIER EXPECTED... 
AND MORNING SOUNDINGS INDICATE A STRONG CAPPING INVERSION IN THE MID 
LEVELS. THESE FACTORS APPEAR TO HAVE SUPPRESSED THE EXPECTED 
CONVECTION FOR THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING WITH THE WARM FRONT... 
BUT THIS DRIER SCENARIO SHOULD HELP TO ALLOW FOR A GREATER TEMP 
WARM-UP AHEAD OF THE LOW AS ITS TRACKS NORTHEAST INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS EVENING. A MODIFIED MORNING SOUNDING FROM NASHVILLE 
INDICATES THAT MODERATE INSTABILITY SHOULD DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON... 
WITH TEMPS EXPECTED TO RISE INTO THE 70S. THIS MODERATE INSTABILITY 
IN COMBINATION WITH THE HIGH HELICITY VALUES EXPECTED AHEAD OF THE 
SURFACE LOW SHOULD HELP TO SET THE STAGE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
SCATTERED SUPERCELL TSTORMS ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON. THE THREAT OF MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION WITH LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAINFALL SHOULD DEVELOP THIS EVENING AS THE LOW TRACKS INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA.

WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST TO REMOVE MENTION OF MOST MORNING 
PRECIP...BUT WILL MENTION REDEVELOPMENT OF TSTORMS FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON. ALSO...WILL RAISE TEMPS A CATEGORY AND LOWER CLOUD COVER 
FOR TODAY WITH TEMPS ALREADY RISING QUICKLY AS CLOUD BREAKS HAVE
DEVELOPED IN THE DRY SLOT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...A POWERFUL UPPER LOW...CURRENTLY 
OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...WILL HELP STRENGTHEN A SURFACE LOW OVER 
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT. IN RESPONSE TO THIS 
DEEPENING LOW...A STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN WILL PUSH A WARM 
FRONT NORTH TOWARDS SOUTHEAST TN BY SUNRISE. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW 
SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE LOCATION OF CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT LATE 
TONIGHT AND SUNDAY...BUT IT SEEMS APPARENT THAT WIDESPREAD 
CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP AHEAD OF BOTH THE WARM FRONT TONIGHT AND THE 
COLD FRONT ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. ELEVATED INSTABILITY 
COULD AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME SEVERE TSTORMS OVERNIGHT ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH ISOLATED TORNADOES 
POSSIBLE ALONG THE WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY TOWARDS SUNRISE ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TN. AS THIS WARM FRONT MOVES NORTHEAST THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA SUNDAY MORNING...A DRY SLOT SHOULD CREATE A BREAK IN 
THE RAIN BEFORE THE COLD FRONT NEARS IN THE AFTERNOON. WITH SOME 
DECENT TEMP RECOVERY EXPECTED BEFORE THE COLD FRONT...THINK THAT 
WIDESPREAD SEVERE WEATHER WILL DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT AS 
WIND DYNAMICS STRENGTHEN WITH THE APPROACH OF THE LOW. SEVERE 
PARAMETERS APPEAR TO BE COMING TOGETHER FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF 
NUMEROUS SUPERCELLS ACROSS THE TN VALLEY...WITH STRONG LONG-LIVED 
TORNADOES POSSIBLE NEAR THE TRACK OF THE SURFACE LOW. IN ADDITION TO 
THE SEVERE WEATHER... LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE 
OVERNIGHT AND SUNDAY AS THE REGION BECOMES LOCATED UNDER THE 
FAVORABLE LEFT EXIT DIFLUENT REGION OF A STRONG UPPER JET. SOME 
TRAINING OF TSTOMS COUILD ALSO DEVELOP ALONG THE TRACK OF THE LOW 
WHERE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...WIDESPREAD...LOCALLY 
STRONG THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE MRX CWA SUNDAY EVENING

THUNDERSTORMS WILL SLOWLY DECREASE IN INTENSITY OVERNIGHT. THE LOW 
PRESSURE CENTER WILL TRACK THROUGH THE AREA ON MONDAY CONTINUING 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO MONDAY AFTERNOON. 
CONVECTION WILL SLOWLY END FROM WEST TO EAST MONDAY EVENING. WE WILL 
BE BETWEEN SYSTEM TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE PUSHES 
THROUGH. MODEL CONSISTENCY POOR IN BOTH TIMING AND POSITION OF THE

250 PM EST FRI MAR 25 2005

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...ATMOSPHERE MARGINALLY UNSTABLE 
OVER THE MRX CWA THIS EVENING...HOWEVER...DON/T SEE GOOD TRIGGERING 
MECHANISM FOR CONVECTION. SO...HAVE LOWERED POPS A BIT FOR THE 
EVENING. RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY IN MODELS HAS BEEN POOR WITH DETAILS 
OF THE SERIES OF WAVES MOVING THROUGH THE UPPER FLOW. CURRENT RUN 
SHOWS A WEAK IMPULSE PROGGED INTO THE AREA TONIGHT...MAINLY JUST TO 
OUR NORTH. DIFFICULT SEEING THIS WAVE ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...MAY BE 
LOCATED OVER THE MID MS VALLEY PER IR. THE PROGGED TRACK SEEMS 
REASONABLE BASED ON MOVEMENT ON SAT IMAGERY...SO WILL KEEP SOME LOW 
POPS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. WE ONCE AGAIN DESTABILIZE SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON...BUT THE ATMOSPHERE IS MORE FAVORABLE FOR THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT TO OUR SOUTH. THERE APPEAR TO BE A COUPLE OF WEAK WAVES 
IN THE UPPER FLOW TO INITIATE CONVECTION ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND 
EXPECT THIS TO SPREAD SCATTERED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE MRX 
CWA IN THE AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL LOW 
OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL HELP DEVELOP A STRONG SURFACE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY BY SATURDAY NIGHT. 
THIS SURFACE LOW WILL CREATE A STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN 
ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH...WHICH WILL PUSH A WARM FRONT NORTH TOWARD 
THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT. GFS AND NAM MODELS ARE NOW 
REVEALING SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE TIMING OF THE SURFACE LOW AND 
THE RESULTING CONVECTION ALONG THE WARM FRONT ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
COLD FRONT ON SUNDAY. THE NAM MODEL IS NOW SLOWER WITH THE LOW AND 
DOES NOT GENERATE MUCH CONVECTION ALONG THE WARM FRONT SATURDAY 
NIGHT...BUT GENERATES A LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION ALONG THE COLD 
FRONT ON SUNDAY. THE GFS MODEL ON THE OTHER HAND TAKES THE OPPOSITE 
APPROACH AND DEVELOPS A LARGE AMOUNT OF CONVECTION ALONG THE WARM 
FRONT...BUT NOT MUCH ALONG THE COLD FRONT ON SUNDAY. WITH SUCH A 
DYNAMIC SYSTEM AND ITS ASSOCIATED STRONG WIND FIELDS...THINK THAT 
BOTH MODELS ARE RIGHT IN THAT CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP ALONG BOTH THE 
WARM AND COLD FRONTS. THEIR DIFFERENT CONVECTIVE PARAMETERIZATION 
SCHEMES IS LIKELY THE CULPRIT WITH THE OBSERVED DISCREPANCIES. BOTH 
MODELS INDICATE STRONG VEERING WIND PROFILES (RESULTING IN LARGE 
HELICITY VALUES) IN THE WARM SECTOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. THIS 
WOULD SUGGEST THE POTENTIAL FOR ISOLATED TORNADOES ACROSS SOUTHEAST 
TN AND SOUTHWEST NC SATURDAY NIGHT...AND ALL OF THE FORECAST AREA ON 
SUNDAY. THE WILD CARD FOR THIS POSSIBLE SEVERE WEATHER EVENT STILL 
INVOLVES THE AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY EXPECTED SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY. HOWEVER...THE SHORT RANGE MODELS HAVE BEEN TRENDING TOWARD 
MORE INSTABILITY FOR THE FORECAST AREA WITH THIS SYSTEM...SO WILL 
PLAN TO REMOVE THE UNCERTAINTY WORDING IN THE SPECIAL WEATHER 
STATEMENT. 

A DEEP UPPER LOW WILL SLOWLY TRACK ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON 
MONDAY...PRODUCING ADDITIONAL CONVECTION THROUGH MONDAY EVENING. 
ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL THEN APPROACH THE REGION ON THURSDAY... 
BRINGING ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR CONVECTION. GFS MODEL INDICATES THAT 
A LOW PRESSURE AREA WILL DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT BY FRIDAY OVER THE 
DEEP SOUTH...SO WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF RAIN THROUGH FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO DECREASE 
THROUGH THE EVENING. HOWEVER...A WEAK SHORT WAVE APPROACHING THE 
AREA LATE TONIGHT WILL AGAIN INCREASE CLOUD COVER BY MORNING. THIS 
WAVE WILL TRACK WELL TO OUR NORTH BUT LIMITED MOISTURE AND LIFT 
SHOULD PUSH IN...MAINLY OVER NORTHERN ZONES FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS 
FOR FRIDAY MORNING. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BECOME MILDLY UNSTABLE 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON AS A SECONDARY WAVE SLIDES IN DIRECTLY BEHIND THE 
FIRST FOR CONTINUE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A COLD FRONT IS PROGGED 
TO BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY AROUND THE SOUTHERN TN BORDER FRIDAY 
NIGHT...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES ZONAL OVER THE REGION. A 
WEAK SHORT WAVE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE ALONG THIS BOUNDARY INTO THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY...BUT THE NAM AND GFS MODELS REVEAL DISAGREEMENTS WITH 
THE TIMING OF THIS FEATURE FOR SOMETIME FRIDAY NIGHT OR SATURDAY 
MORNING. THUS...WILL COMPROMISE AT THIS TIME AND MENTION A CHANCE OF 
TSTORMS THROUGH THE PERIOD SINCE A MARGINAL UNSTABLE AIRMASS WILL 
REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE FORECAST AREA.
 
A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON SATURDAY WILL 
HELP DEVELOP A SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER 
VALLEY SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS SURFACE LOW WILL CAUSE THE QUASI- 
STATIONARY FRONT TO MOVE BACK NORTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AS A 
WARM FRONT SATURDAY NIGHT. STRONG UPPER DYNAMICS SHOULD HELP TO 
CREATE A LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION WITH THIS FRONT AS IT MOVES ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE THAT THERE WILL BE A LARGE AMOUNT 
OF HELICITY WITH THIS FRONT...BUT INSTABILITY APPEARS TO BE MARGINAL 
(AS HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH THE LAST FEW SYSTEMS). THUS...THE THREAT 
OF A SEVERE WX OUTBREAK FOR THE FORECAST AREA REMAINS UNCERTAIN. IF 
INSTABILITY CAN DEVELOP THIS FAR NORTH...THEN THERE IS CERTAINLY THE 
POTENTIAL FOR AN OUTBREAK. WILL PLAN TO REISSUE THE SPECIAL WEATHER 
STATEMENT CURRENTLY IN EFFECT...BUT WILL MENTION THE UNCERTAINTY IN 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERE WEATHER THIS WEEKEND. RIGHT NOW...IT 
APPEARS THAT THE MAIN SEVERE THREAT WOULD BE THE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY 
RAINFALL SATURDAY NIGHT. A STRONG UPPER LOW (SIMILAR TO YESTERDAYS 
SYSTEM) WILL SLOWLY TRACK ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY 
PRODUCING ADDITIONAL LINGERING CONVECTION...WITH SHOWERS FINALLY 
EXITING THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT.

LARGE EXPANSE OF SC CLOUDS THIS MORNING...WILL LIKELY CONTINUE 
CLOUDY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING EXCEPT POSSIBLY IN OUR NC 
COUNTIES WHERE DOWNSLOPING SHOULD BURN CLOUDS AWAY FASTER.  HAVE 
COOLED HIGH TEMPS ABOUT 1-2 DEGREES OVERALL TODAY...EXCEPT IN NC 
COUNTIES WHERE THE HIGHS HAVE BEEN RAISED 2-3 DEGREES.  IN HOURLY 
TEMP GRIDS...MADE DIRUNAL TEMP CURVE SLUGGISH THIS MORNING DUE TO 
CLOUD COVER...WITH RAPID WARM-UP THIS AFTERNOON AS CLOUDS ERODE.

FOR TONIGHT AND FRIDAY TILL NOON...AM GOING WITH LEADING SHORT WAVE 
AS THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ONE...INTRODUCING -SHRA LATE TONIGHT THAT 
TRACK QUICKLY ACROSS CWA.  HEIGHT OF ACTIVITY WITH THIS WAVE IS 
CENTERED AROUND 13Z.  AM LEAVING SOME POPS BEHIND THIS WAVE JUST IN

TURNED OVER REST OF FRIDAY AND DEEP CONVECTION THREAT TO LONG TERM 
DESK.


.LONG TERM...(17 UTC FRIDAY THROUGH DAY 7)...
SOME INSTABILITY LINGERS FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH 
WARM FRONT APPROACHING FROM THE SOUTH...AND ALSO A WEAK INVERTED 
SURFACE TROUGH AXIS NEARBY.  WITH AIRMASS DESTABILIZING IN THE 
AFTERNOON...MODELS SHOW SOME AREAS OF MOISTURE CONVERGENCE...AT 
LEAST IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS.  SINCE MAIN SHORTWAVE AND 
INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH AXIS ARE OVER NRN AREAS...ADJUSTED POPS UP 
TO REFLECT HIGHEST POPS NRN MOST AREAS (ALSO TO BLEND WITH HIGHER 
POPS OVER SE KY) AND LEAST CHANCES SRN AREAS.  WITH SURFACE 
BOUNDARIES NEARBY...AND POSSIBLE SHORTWAVE NOTED ON GFS FRIDAY 
NIGHT...KEPT AT LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING OVERNIGHT. 

TIMING THE STRONG SRN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH/UPPER LOW OVER THE 
WEEKEND IS STILL TRICKY AT THIS POINT.  00Z GFS MODEL SEEMED TO BE A 
BIT FASTER THAN ETA/DGEX AS WELL AS ECMWF AND UKMET...SO I LOWERED 
THE POPS FOR EARLY SATURDAY...AND GAVE HIGHER CHANCES FOR SW AREAS 
DOWN TO LEAST CHANCES NE AREAS.  DID NOT WANT TO RAISE POPS 
DRAMATICALLY JUST YET FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...BUT FELT THAT 
POPS COULD AT LEAST BE RAISED TO LIKELY FOR SE TN AND SW NC AREAS BY 
SATURDAY EVENING.  CONTINUED VERY HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR REST OF 
SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...AND WILL LET DAY SHIFT LOOK THIS OVER 
AGAIN AND MAKE MORE POP INCREASES IF TIMING BECOMES CLEARER.  IF 
SLOWER TRACK OF THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM PANS OUT...THEN HIGH POPS

316 AM EST WED MAR 23 2005

.DISCUSSION...MAIN CONCERNS ARE FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT AS THE STRONG 
UPPER LOW...NOW SPINNING OVER MO/IL AREAS...CONTINUES TO MOVE EAST 
TODAY.  CONVECTION OVER MIDDLE TN HAS WEAKENED CONSIDERABLY... 
ALTHOUGH SHORTWAVE ROTATING AROUND THE UPPER LOW HAS HELPED DEVELOP 
AN AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...MOVING NORTHEAST FROM NRN GA 
ACROSS MOST OF E TN AND SW NC AT THIS TIME.  THIS CONVECTION 
WARRANTS HIGH POPS FOR AT LEAST THE EARLY MORNING HOURS...ALTHO THE 
THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS SEEMS VERY MINIMAL NOW.  

MOS POPS WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN OUR POP/WX GRIDS IN MOST AREAS FOR 
LATER TODAY...AND CONSENSUS FROM COORDINATION CHAT WAS TO GENERALLY 
RAISE POPS ACROSS THE AREA.  THINKING WAS THAT THE WARM LOW LEVELS 
PLUS COLD AIR ADVECTION ALOFT WITH UPPER LOW PASSAGE...WILL CREATE 
GOOD INSTABILITY FOR THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS.  SHORT 
RANGE MODELS IN AGREEMENT ON BEST LIFT AND COVERAGE ACROSS NE PLATEAU
...NE TN...AND SWRN VA FOR LATER TODAY AND EARLY TONIGHT.  HIGHEST 
POPS FOR THOSE AREAS...WITH SE TN/CHA PROBABLY THE LEAST COVERAGE 
AND LOWEST POPS.  IN FACT...A DRY SLOT NOTED ON WATER VAPOR PICS 
...POSSIBLY TEMPORARY FEATURE...WILL LIKELY BRING AN END TO THE 
CONVECTIVE PCPN OVER SE TN BEFORE DAYBREAK.  

MOS MAX TEMPS WERE WELL SHORT OF THE MARK YESTERDAY (AS MUCH AS 10 
TO 12 DEGREES LOW)...SO I TRENDED TOWARD THE WARMER ETA MOS HIGHS.
MIN TEMP FORECAST FOR TONIGHT WAS RAISED SLIGHTLY IN LINE WITH THE 
00Z MOS VALUES.  OTHERWISE...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE FOR TONIGHT 
THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT.  

HAD TO INCREASE POPS SLIGHTLY FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...MAINLY 
TO BETTER MESH WITH HIGHER POPS FROM JKL AND GSP.  STILL LOOKS LIKE 
THE BEST CHANCE OF MORE SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS WILL COME 
INTO PLAY BY SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  NO SOLID AGREEMENT YET ON 
LONG RANGE MODELS...BUT THE ECMWF/DGEX/GFS ALL DEVELOP A STRONG SRN 
STREAM SYSTEM AND WIDESPREAD PCPN AS EARLY AS SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT 
MORE LIKELY ON SUNDAY.  WILL LET DAYSHIFT LOOK THIS OVER IN MORE 
DETAIL TODAY AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NEEDED.

WEB PRODUCTS ISSUED AND ZFPMRX WILL FOLLOW SHORTLY.

757 PM EST TUE MAR 22 2005

.DISCUSSION...FIRST SHORT-WAVE HAS MOVED EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH
THE AREA OF RAIN EXITING THE REGION. WARM FRONT REMAINS TO OUR SOUTH AND
EXTENDS FROM WEST TENNESSEE SOUTHEAST TO CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ALABAMA.
FAIRLY STRONG WEDGING REMAINS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...ESPECIALLY
EAST AND SOUTH OF THE MOUNTAINS...WHICH WILL HELP KEEP BEST INSTABILITY
WEST AND SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. SEVERE STORMS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP IN
THE WARM SECTOR OVER WEST TENNESSEE...MISSISSIPPI...AND ALABAMA WITH 
SPC ISSUING A TORANDO WATCH FOR MOST OF ALABAMA. 

AIRMASS OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE FAIRLY STABLE...SO DO NOT EXPECT ANY MAJOR
OUTBREAK OF SEVERE STORMS FOR THE FORECAST AREA. AN OUTSIDE CHANCE THAT 
A WEAKENING STORM MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE IT INTO THE PLATEAU AND SOUHEAST
TENNESSEE.  ISOLATED LARGE HAIL WILL BE MAIN POTENTIAL. HOWEVER...OVERALL
ONLY EXPECT SHOWERS WITH SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS LATER TONIGHT/WEDNESDAY
MORNING AS INCREASING QG FORCING RETURNS.

PLAN ON MAKING SOME TIMING CHANGES IN THE GRIDDS AND MAKE MINOR CHANGES
TO FORECAST LOWS FOR EVENING UPDATE OF GRIDDS AND PRODUCTS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...CURRENTLY WARM FRONT TO OUR 
SOUTH...AND FIRST ROUND OF PRECIP MOVING NORTH INTO OUR AREA.  UPPER 
LOW OVER EASTERN OKLAHOMA WILL TRACK NORTHEAST TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. 
MODELS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT...BUT DIFFER A BIT ON THE DETAILS.  
LOOKS LIKE THIS FIRST ROUND WILL MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE 
AREA...THEN THERE WILL LIKELY BE A LULL IN THE ACTION BEFORE ANOTHER 
WEAK WAVE AND THE OCCLUDED FRONT BRINGS A LESSER ROUND OF PRECIP 
LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY TOMORROW.  ATMOSPHERE REMAINS FAIRLY STABLE 
OVER THE AREA AT THE MOMENT...BUT SHOULD HAVE SOME ELEVATED 
INSTABILITY OVERNIGHT...SO WILL ALLOW FOR THUNDER.  WITH FAIRLY 
STRONG LOW LEVEL WEST TO SOUTHWEST FLOW TOMORROW...MAY SEE SOME SUN 
ESPECIALLY SOUTH AND CENTRAL. WILL GO HIGHER THAN MAV TEMPS FOR 
TOMORROW IN THESE AREAS. WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV FOR TEMPS 
TONIGHT.    

.LONG TERM (WED NIGHT THROUGH TUE)...UPR TROF MOVS E OF FA BUT NOT 
BEFORE POSSIBLY GENERATING A FEW MORE -SHRA WED NIGHT ACROSS TERRAIN 
AREAS INCLUDING CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND MUCH OF SW VA/NE TN AND SMOKY 
MOUNTAINS AS ENERGY ROTATES THRU BASE OF TROF. UPR RIDGE BUILDS 
ACROSS ERN U.S. ON THU WITH DRY WEATHER CONTINUING THRU THU NIGHT 
AND PERHAPS MUCH OF FRI. ALTHOUGH INCLUDED SLGT CHC -SHRA ON FRI CHC 
FOR PRECIP GRADUALLY INCREASES LATER FRI NIGHT INTO SAT EVENING AS 
NEXT UPR TROF AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT PRESS THRU MS VLY TOWARD THE 
APPALACHIANS. INCLUDED TSRA WITH -SHRA SAT INTO SUN AS ATMOSPHERE 
DESTABILIZES AHD OF FRONT. BACKED OFF POPS TO LOW/SLGT CHC LATER 
SUN/SUN NIGHT AS SYSTEM PUSHES SLOWLY E INTO THE CAROLINAS. UPR AND 
SFC RIDGING BRING ANOTHER PERIOD OF DRY WEATHER MON/TUE WITH 
CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO TEMPS HOLDING CLOSE TO CLIMATOLOGY AT THIS 
EXTENDED TIME RANGE. NATIONAL/REGIONAL COORDINATION DISCARDED GFS IN 
FAVOR OF ECMWF FOR EXTENDED FORECAST.

305 AM EST TUE MAR 22 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STACKED UPPER LOW CURRENTLY OVER 
OKLAHOMA IS PROJECTED TO DRIFT EASTWARD THROUGH THE PERIOD AND BE 
CENTERED NEAR THE THE IL/IN BORDER BY 12Z WED. THIS FEATURE WILL BE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING SCATTERED TO WIDESPREAD CONVECTION FOR 
THE FORECAST AREA AS IT ADVANCES. ANTICIPATE PRECIP TO COMMENCE IN 
THE SOUTHWESTERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA BY MID-MORNING AND 
SLOWLY SPREADING ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA BY MID-AFTERNOON 
WITH CATEGORICAL POPS EXPECTED OVER THE ENTIRE AREA BY 00Z 
WEDNESDAY. CAT POPS SPILL OVER INTO THE SECOND PERIOD...BUT POPS 
SHOULD TAPER TO CHANCE BY LATE IN THE PERIOD. INSTABILITY RATHER 
UNIMPRESSIVE FOR THE MOST PART...BUT HAVE INCLUDED THUNDER FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT AS UPPER FLOW BECOMES INCREASINGLY DIFLUENT. 
GENERALLY USED A BLEND OF GUIDANCE VALUES FOR TEMPS.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MINOR CHANGES MADE FOR 
WEDNESDAY WERE TO SLOW THE DECREASE OF POPS FOR WEDNESDAY MORNING.
SINCE THE UPPER LOW IS CLOSED OFF AND VERTICALLY STACKED (850 MB LOW 
BENEATH THE UPPER CENTER) THIS MORNING...DECIDED TO TREND MORE 
TOWARD THE NGM/ETA(NAM) SOLUTION OF A SLOWER EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF 
THE UPPER LOW.  EVEN THE FASTER GFS SOLUTION WOULD HAVE SOME PCPN 
LINGER WELL INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING...ESPECIALLY FOR SW VA AND NE TN 
AREAS.  LOCATION OF THE UPPER LOW AND SOME INSTABILITY FOR WEDNESDAY 
FAVORED KEEPING A MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS AT LEAST FOR THE MORNING 
HOURS.

MAX TEMP FORECAST FOR WEDNESDAY WAS TRICKY...BUT CONSIDERING THAT 
CLOUDS AND PCPN WILL BE SLOWER TO EXIT THE REGION...FELT THAT A 
BLEND OF THE ETA AND MAV MOS WAS BEST CHOICE.  NGM MOS LOOKED TOO 
WARM FOR CHA AND TYS...UNLESS WE GET A DRY SLOT OVER THOSE AREAS AS 
THE UPPER LOW BEGINS TO LIFT NE OF THE REGION.  

OTHERWISE...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE FOR WEDS NIGHT OR THURSDAY.
TEMPS FOR THOSE PERIODS LOOK TO BE AT OR ABOVE CLIMO...GIVEN NO COLD 
AIR ADVECTION BEHIND OUR TUES/WEDS SYSTEM.  KEPT THE DRY FORECAST 
GOING UNTIL FRIDAY NIGHT.  THE TIMING OF ANY SYSTEMS FOR THE WEEKEND 
LOOKS UNCERTAIN...GIVEN DIFFERING MODEL SOLUTIONS.  SINCE THE LATEST 
GFS MODEL RUN DID NOT SUGGEST ANY MAJOR CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS
...NONE WERE MADE AT THIS POINT FOR ANY PERIOD FROM FRIDAY AND 
BEYOND.

.SHORT TERM...
PRETTY WEATHER COMING TO AN END AS CLOUDS AND PRECIP ENTER THE SCENE 
LOCALLY.  THINK IT WILL BE DRY OVER MOST OF THE AREA FOR MOST OF THE 
NIGHT...BUT THEN INITIAL LIFT SHOULD WORK ITS WAY NORTHEASTWARD 
ACROSS AREA DURING THE DAY TUESDAY...WITH SECOND AREA OF MORE 
ORGANIZED LIFT MOVING IN DURING THE AFTERNOON.  INITIAL PRECIP 
SHOULD BE IN STABLE AIR MASS...BUT FOR THE AFTERNOON TUESDAY...AM 
MENTIONING CHANCE OF THUNDER AS AIR MASS DESTABLIZES SLIGHTLY. 

FOR TEMPS...NOT MUCH CHANGE TO PREVIOUS NUMBER ON LOW TEMPS...HAVE 
BACKED OFF HIGH TEMPS A COUPLE OF DEGREES ON TUESDAY SINCE CLOUDS 
AND PRECIP WILL BE MOVING IN FOR MUCH OF THE DAY.


.LONG TERM...
(TUE NIGHT THROUGH MON)...SOME DISAGREEMENT IN SPEED 
LOCATION OF SURFACE LOW BY 12Z WED...THINK A COMPROMISE GFS/NAM 
SOLUTION LOOKS BEST.  WILL GO WITH CAT POPS EARLY TUE NIGHT...AND 
WITH SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY MAY BE SOME THUNDER AROUND.  WITH LOW 
TO OUR NORTH AND DEEP MOISTURE DEPARTING...WILL BRING POPS DOWN TO 
JUST SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE IN CENTRAL AND NORTH WED.  EXPECT 
FAIRLY DECENT WEST TO SOUTHWEST FLOW LOW LEVELS WED...SO MAY SEE 
SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS AND FAIRLY MILD TEMPS. SHORT WAVE SKIRTS 
BY TO OUR NORTH WED NIGHT AND EARLY THU...BUT LOOKS LIKE NOT MUCH OF 
A PRECIP EVENT FOR OUR AREA.  WILL GO SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH WED 
NIGHT.  FURTHER OUT...CONFIDENCE LOW WITH POOR AGREEMENT OF 
MODELS...WILL GENERALLY TRY TO FOLLOW HPC SOLUTION.  WILL GO DRY 
FRI...THEN NEXT SYSTEM BRINGS ANOTHER ROUND OF PRECIP FOR THE 
WEEKEND.

405 AM EST MON MAR 21 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A WEAK SHORTWAVE/VORT MAX 
IS MOVING EAST ACROSS PARTS OF AL AND GA...PRODUCING A FEW WEAK 
RETURNS ON AREA RADARS.  THE WEAK RETURNS JUST TO OUR SOUTH APPEAR 
TO BE MAINLY MID TO HIGH CLOUDS...SO DID NOT MENTION ANY SPRINKLES 
OR CARRY LOW POPS FOR SE TN OR SW NC THIS MORNING. IN FACT...DECIDED 
TO REMOVE THE LOW POPS FOR ALL AREAS TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT THRU TUESDAY NIGHT...SHORT RANGE MODELS SEEM IN FAIR 
AGREEMENT ON SLOWING DOWN THE ONSET OF PCPN WITH THE DEVELOPING 
STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM...THAT MOVES INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND 
LOWER MISS VALLEY REGION LATE TONIGHT AND TUESDAY.  FEEL THAT ANY 
MEASURABLE PCPN THRU 12Z TUESDAY WILL BE CONFINED TO JUST SE 
TN...BUT TO MESH WITH NEIGHBORS GRIDS...SOME SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW 
CHANCE POPS WERE CONTINUED FOR ABOUT THE SRN TWO THIRDS OF OUR 
FORECAST AREA (MAINLY LATE TONIGHT).  RAIN CHANCES WERE ALLOWED TO 
INCREASE OVER THE MORNING HOURS TUESDAY...WITH HIGHEST POPS 
JUSTIFIED FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  THERE ARE MINOR TIMING 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GFS AND ETA/NAM...WITH THE GFS SLIGHTLY 
FASTER IN MOVING THE SURFACE LOW EAST...SO A COMPROMISE FAVORED 
KEEPING POPS RATHER HIGH FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND LINGERING CHANCE POPS 
FOR WEDNESDAY. 

CONCERNING THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS TUESDAY...APPEARS THAT THE BEST 
INSTABILITY WILL LIE TO OUR WEST AND ESPECIALLY SW NEARER TO THE 
WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY.  THUS...DAY 2 OUTLOOK HAS ONLY OUR WRN TWO 
THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA IN A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE.  WILL 
ADDRESS THIS IN THE HWOMRX PRODUCT...BUT NOT INCLUDE ANY SEVERE 
WORDING IN THE ZFPMRX PRODUCT.  HOWEVER...PLENTY OF LIFT AND SOME 
INSTABILITY TO WARRANT THUNDERSTORMS FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON...AND A 
LOT OF ELEVATED INSTABILITY TUESDAY NIGHT SO CARRIED THUNDERSTORMS 
FOR THAT PERIOD AS WELL.  

OTHERWISE...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE FOR WEDNESDAY.  THE SLOWER 
MOVEMENT OF THIS SYSTEM LED TO RAISING MIN TEMPS A GOOD BIT FOR 
TUESDAY NIGHT...IN LINE WITH LATEST MOS.  


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...NOT MUCH TO CHANGE 
IN THIS PART OF THE FORECAST. SLOWER TIMING OF TUESDAYS SYSTEM DOES 
NOT REALLY PUSH INTO LATE WEDNESDAY. HAVE UPPED POPS IN THE FAR TERM 
(NEXT WEEKEND) DUE TO MODELS DEPICTING ANOTHER SYSTEM WHERE ONCE 
THERE WAS NOT MUCH OF ONE, AND DUE TO SURROUNDING OFFICES HAVING 
SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS THAN WE. DID NOT MENTIONED THUNDER THIS FAR 
OUT. OTHERWISE, PRETTY STATUS QUO.

LATEST GFS MODEL RUN HAS TEMPS (ESPECIALLY 850 MB LEVEL) WARMER THAN 
PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT...SO NEXT SHIFT MAY WANT TO RAISE 
MIN TEMPS SOME...MAINLY MTN ZONES WHERE PCPN WOULD APPEAR TO BE ALL 
LIQUID FOR THIS EVENT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...OF ETA AND GFS, ETA APPEARS A 
LITTLE QUICKER AND STRONGER ON SHORT DEVELOPING IN SOUTHERN PLAINS 
AND APPROACHING FORECAST AREA LATE MONDAY AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING. 

VERY LEADING EDGE OF PRECIP ON ETA JUST ENTERS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE
BY 00Z TUESDAY, WITH SFC-H5 RH TIGHT GRADIENT OVER AREA. HIGHEST RH
OBVIOUSLY OVER SE TN (FAR SW EDGE OF FORECAST AREA). EVEN THE GFS 
HAS A LITTLE RH IN THAT AREA, BUT NO PRECIP BY THEN. HAVE OPTED TO 
GO MORE WITH ETA AND KEEP WITH PREVIOUS PACKAGE GENERALLY THINKING
OF SLIGHT CHANCE TO VERY LOW CHANCE POPS IN SE TN FOR LATE MONDAY...
NO MENTION OF THUNDER DURING THAT TIME. HAVE INCREASED POPS EVERY 
SO SLIGHTLY IN THE EXTREME SOUTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN 
TENNESSEE VALLEY LATE MONDAY TO BE MORE IN LINE WITH ADJACENT 
OFFICES. AS FOR TEMPS, HAVE KEPT MAINLY IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS PACKAGE
BUT DID RAISE MINS TONIGHT A HAIR WITH SOME CLOUDS ON THE WAY IN, 
AND FACT THAT TODAYS ACTUAL TEMPS WERE JUST A TAD HIGH. RAISED MAXES
MONDAY ALSO A LITTLE TO BE MORE IN LINE WITH THE BLEND MAXES.


.LONG TERM...THE BIG WEATHER MAKER FOR THIS FORECAST PERIOD IS TUESDAY
WHEN A STRONG NEGATIVELY TILTED TROF SWINGS THROUGH THE REGION BRING
RAINS BEGINNING EARLY TUESDAY MORNING.  THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW MUCH
CLEARING WILL OCCUR IN THE DRY SLOT TO ALLOW HEATING TUESDAY
AFTERNOON.  IF SUFFICIENT HEATING OCCURS THERE COULD BE SOME
SIGNIFICANT DESTABLIZATION AND A THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER WITH
ISOLATED SUPER CELLS POSSIBLE.  ENOUGH UNCERTAINITY AT THIS TIME THAT
WE ARE NOT PUTTING SEVERE WORDING IN THE ZONES AT THIS TIME...HOWEVER
THERE IS A HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK ISSUED THIS MORNING THAT COVERS
THE POSSIBLE THREAT.  

NEXT SHOT OF PRECIPITATION AFTER TUESDAY IS ON FRIDAY...HOWEVER AT
THIS TIME THIS DOES NOT APPEAR AS STRONG AS THE TUESDAY SYSTEM.
ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS POSSIBLE ON SUNDAY...HOWEVER AGAIN THIS ONE
DOES NOT SEEM AS DYNAMIC AS TUESDAY.  GENERALLY USED THE BLEND
FORECAST NUMBERS FOR GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...LAST SHORTWAVE IN SWLY FLOW 
MOVING NORTHEAST TOWARD CWA.  STRONG SUBSIDENCE THAT HAS BEEN 
PRESSING ON THIS FEATURE ALL DAY FROM NORTHWEST IS TAKING ITS TOLL.  
COOLER CLOUD TOPS...< M17 DEG C...NOW ALL BUT FADED AWAY.  THERE 
HASNT BEEN ANY PRECIP WITH THIS FEATURE ALL DAY...AND EVEN THOUGH 
IT IS MOVING INTO AN ALMOST SATURATED AREA THINK THAT IT WONT BE 
ABLE TO GENERATE ANY MEANINGFUL PRECIP AS IT PASSES THROUGH THE AREA 
BETWEEN 22Z AND 01Z.  AFTER THIS WAVE PASSES...SUBSIDENCE TAKE OVER 
CLEARING SKIES THIS EVENING.  ALTHOUGH MOS GUIDANCE SAID NO FOG 
TONIGHT...WENT AHEAD AND MENTIONED LIGHT FOG IN TAF PRODUCTS DUE TO 
CLEARING SKIES...LIGHT WINDS...AND MOIST GROUND.

WARMED UP LOW TEMPS A DEG OR TWO IN NORTH...OTHERWISE FEW CHANGES IN 
TEMPS.  WILL FINALLY SEE SUN FOR FIRST TIME IN SEVERAL DAYS ON 
FRIDAY.

.LONG TERM...(FRI NIGHT THROUGH THU)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES CONTINUE 
IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH UPPER FLOW PATTERN. HOWEVER...TIMING 
INDIVIDUAL FEATURES IN RELATIVELY PROGRESSIVE PATTERN IS PROBLEMATIC 
AT BEST. SURFACE COLD FRONT PASSES THROUGH THE AREA ON SATURDAY PER 
MODEL CONSENSUS. GFS PROJECTS MINOR FEATURE TO PASS ALONG THE 
SOUTHERN TIER OF THE FORECAST AREA LATE SUNDAY AND EARLY MONDAY BUT 
NAM PROJECTS THIS FEATURE TO TRANSLATE ALONG THE GULF COAST. HAVE 
CONTINUED LOW POPS FOR THIS TIME FRAME FOR CONSISTENCY SAKE. A MORE 
SIGNIFICANT FEATURE APPROACHES LATE TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. WENT WITH 
DRY FORECAST FOR DAY 7 (THURSDAY). FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY STAYED 
FAIRLY CLOSE TO GFS GUIDANCE VALUES WITH ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS 
BASED ON ENSEMBLES.

UPDATE TO PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...THINK THAT CLOUDS WILL TRY TO HOLD 
PRETTY FIRMLY FOR MOST OF AFTERNOON EXCEPT ALONG WEST AND NORTHWEST 
EDGE.  88D WINDS SHOWING DEEP LAYER OF EASTERLY WINDS THAT SHOULD 
KEEP WESTERN EDGE OF CLOUDS FAIRLY STRONG.  ANOTHER POSSIBILITY 
WOULD BE BREAKS WEST OF SMOKIES WHERE SUBSIDENCE MIGHT ERODE CLOUDS 
IN EASTERN AREAS.  WILL NOT GO WITH THIS NOW...BUT WILL BE ON THE 
LOOKOUT.



LIGHT PRECIP STILL OCCURRING ACROSS GOOD PART OF CWA...BUT SHOULD BE 
DIMINISHING SLOWLY AS BETTER LIFT MOVES OUT OF AREA.  HAD SOME 
CONCERN ABOUT SYSTEM IN NW GLFMEX...BUT ADJACENT SUBSIDENCE TO NW 
AND INCREASINGLY CONFLUENT FLOW INTO THAT REGION SEEMS TO BE 
WEAKENING THIS SYSTEM OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS.  CLOUD TOPS IN TN AND

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A FAIRLY STRONG SHORT WAVE IS 
EXITING THE AREA THIS MORNING.  THIS WAVE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CURRENT 
PRECIP ACROSS THE MRX CWA.  A MIX OF PRECIP IS OCCURRING WITH MAINLY 
RAIN WITH SOME SLEET IN THE SOUTH...A MIX OF RAIN...SLEET AND SNOW 
IN EAST CENTRAL TENNESSEE AND MAINLY SNOW ACROSS THE NORTHERN ZONES 
AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS.  SNOW ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED OVER HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS IN THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS WHERE A SNOW ADVISORY IS IN 
EFFECT.  WILL CONTINUE THIS ADVISORY EXCEPT FOR FAR SOUTHERN PORTION 
WHERE PRECIP IS BECOMING MORE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED.  SOME CONCERN 
FOR SNOW ACCUMULATION OVER SW VA AND THE NORTHERN PLATEAU...REPORTS 
GENERALLY HAVE MAINLY SNOW WITH LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATION AS YET.  
FOR NOW WILL HOLD OFF ON ADVISORY AND MONITOR.  THE WAVE WILL 
EXIT THIS AFTERNOON AND PRECIP SHOULD END FROM SOUTHWEST TO 
NORTHEAST FOR MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS TONIGHT

.LONG TERM...(FRI THROUGH WED)...FRIDAY STILL LOOKS LIKE WE WILL BE 
BETWEEN SYSTEMS...SO WILL GO DRY.  WEAK COLD FRONT PUSHES IN ON 
SATURDAY.  MOISTURE AND LIFT DO NOT LOOK ALL THAT IMPRESSIVE WITH 
THIS SYSTEM...BUT STILL WORTH LIKELY POPS NORTH AND CHANCE SOUTH.  
THERMAL PROFILES INDICATE THIS SHOULD BE MAINLY RAIN...ALTHOUGH 
THERE MAY BE SOME SNOW AT THE ONSET OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  
DRIER AIR MOVES IN SAT NIGHT AND SUNDAY...SO AFTER SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS EARLY SAT NIGHT IN NORTHEAST...WILL GO DRY.  FURTHER 
OUT...MODEL CONSISTENCY HAS BEEN POOR...SO WITH HIGH LEVEL OF

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA COAST WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH 
OVER THE APPALACHIANS. A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE OVER THE 
OZARKS WILL MOVE TOWARD THE TN RIVER VALLEY OVERNIGHT...GENERATING 
ADDITIONAL LIGHT PRECIP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. WITH 
TEMPS REMAINING ABOVE FREEZING ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA... 
THINK THAT MAINLY RAIN WILL OCCUR OVERNIGHT WITH POSSIBLY SOME SNOW 
TOWARDS SUNRISE. HOWEVER...WARM GROUND TEMPS WILL PREVENT ANY 
ACCUMULATIONS. ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET...SNOW 
WILL LIKELY DEVELOP EARLIER WITH SOME MINOR ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE.

CURRENT FORECAST SEEMS TO BE ON TRACK FOR THE MOST PART...BUT WILL

.SHORT TERM...
SYSTEM FROM LAST NIGHT NOW TRYING TO EXIT NORTHEASTERN PART OF AREA 
AS NEXT SYSTEM HEADING TOWARD US.  TRICKY SITUATION OVERNIGHT 
TONIGHT AS FAST-MOVING SYSTEM CROSSES AREA WITH LIGHT PRECIP.  
MODELS SHOW AIR MASS COOLING FAIR AMOUNT TONIGHT TO ALLOW PRECIP TO 
TURN OVER TO SNOW OVER MUCH OF AREA...BUT MODELS HAVE BEEN RUNNING A 
LITTLE COOL OVERALL ON SYSTEMS.  ALSO WITH WARM BOUNDARY LAYER AND 
VERY WET SURFACE...THINK THAT MOST OF THE SNOW THAT FALLS WONT DO 
MUCH TO ROADS ETC.  

THINKING THAT HEAVIEST SNOWS WOULD FALL IN EASTERN AREAS EVEN 
WITHOUT THE MOUNTAINS...SO THINK THERE WILL BE A TIGHT GRADIENT OF 
SNOWS INTO THE SMOKIES AND SOUTH APPS.  WILL PLAN ON ADVISORY FOR 
EASTERN MOUNTAINS...FROM SMOKIES NORTHWARD. LOOKS LIKE MOST OF 
PRECIP WILL EXIT AREA BY AROUND 18Z ON THURSDAY.

COULD SEE SNOWS AS FAR SOUTH AS SIGNAL MOUNTAIN W OF KCHA...NEAR TYS 
AS WELL...BUT THINK THAT IMPACT IN THOSE AREAS WILL BE MINIMAL DUE 
TO REASONS MENTIONED ABOVE.

WARMED UP TEMPS OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE AREA...AND HAVE MADE VERY 
SLUGGISH RISE TO TEMPS ON THURSDAY.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SEVERAL MORE WAVES 
HEADED OUR WAY IN MAINLY ZONAL FLOW THROUGH THE PERIOD...WITH TIMING 
ON ANY ONE WAVE DIFFICULT TO DO.  IT DOES APPEAR THAT FRIDAY WILL BE 
DRY...BUT AS OF SATURDAY AFTERNOON RIGHT THROUGH NEXT 
WEDNESDAY...THERE IS A CHANCE OF RAIN EACH PERIOD.  OF COURSE, IT 
WONT RAIN IN EACH OF THESE PERIODS...BUT RIGHT NOW IT IS IMPOSSIBLE 
TO RULE ANY ON ONE OF THEM OUT.  TEMPERATURES WILL BE MILD...NEAR OR 
ABOVE AVERAGE FROM SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.  THERE IS VERY LITTLE 
CHANCE OF SNOW DURING THE PERIOD...WITH THE ONLY MENTIONABLE CHANCE 
IN SOUTHWEST VA AND THE NORTHERN MTNS OF EAST TENN FOR THURSDAY

325 AM EST WED MAR 16 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION 
CONTINUES OVER THE MRX CWA THIS MORNING IN RESPONSE TO A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKING ACROSS THE GULF COAST NORTHEAST INTO THE 
CAROLINAS.  CURRENT TRACK WILL TAKE THE MAIN FORCING AND MOISTURE TO 
OUR EAST.  HOWEVER...STILL EXPECT DECENT PRECIP OVER THE AREA.  
PRECIP TYPE REMAINS THE MAIN QUESTION.  CURRENT REPORTS INDICATE 
SNOW OVER VA ZONES AND MUCH OF THE NORTH AND CENTRAL MOUNTAINS.  
RAIN MAINLY THROUGH THE VALLEY AND PLATEAU AREAS WITH A MIX OF RAIN AND 
SLEET...AND SOME SNOW IN THE NORTH.  THIS PRECIP BREAKDOWN IS 
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING HOURS...SNOW AND 
SLEET SHOULD DIMINISH OVER LOWER ELEVATIONS FROM SOUTH TO NORTH 
THROUGH THE MORNING.  THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS SHOULD CONTINUE TO SEE 
MAINLY SNOW WITH OCCASIONAL SLEET MIXED IN.  CURRENT ADVISORIES AND 
WARNINGS LOOK REASONABLE AND WILL CONTINUE THEM.  THE SYSTEM WILL 
EXIT THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH ANOTHER WEAKER SYSTEM 
NUDGING INTO OUR SOUTHERN AND EASTERN ZONES TONIGHT.  WITH 
THIS...EXPECT MAINLY RAIN SOUTH AND SNOW NORTH AND HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS.  SNOW AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT OVER HIGHER TERRAIN... 
GENERALLY LESS THEN 2 INCHES EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM...(THU THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS HAVE TRENDED DRIER FOR 
THURSDAY...ESPECIALLY NAM.  SHORT WAVE ENERGY TO MOVE ACROSS THE 
AREA...BUT APPEARS MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL BE LIMITED.  WILL GO WITH 
LIKELY POPS SOUTH...CHANCE NORTH AND CENTRAL. THERMAL PROFILES 
SUGGEST BOUNDARY LAYER WILL BE WARM ENOUGH FOR MUCH OF THIS TO BE 
RAIN...WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SNOW IN THE VALLEYS MAINLY EARLY IN 
THE DAY.  HIGHER ELEVATIONS MAY STAY SNOW ALL DAY...BUT AMOUNTS 
SHOULD BE LIMITED.  THIS SYSTEM SHOULD EXIT BY THU NIGHT...SO DRY 
THU NIGHT AND FRIDAY. WEAK COLD FRONT TO APPROACH SATURDAY...BUT 
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A BIG RAIN MAKER AT THE MOMENT.  APPEARS ANY 
PRECIP FOR LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY WILL BE MAINLY RAIN. GFS 
TRYING TO BRING RAIN BACK IN FOR SUNDAY...FOR NOW WILL JUST ADD A 
SLIGHT CHANCE TO SUNDAY NIGHT AND LET DAY SHIFT TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.  
WILL GENERALLY LEAVE LATER PERIODS AS THEY ARE FOR NOW.

.DISCUSSION...ISENTROPIC LIFT IS WELL UNDERWAY ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...WITH JUST RAIN INDICATED THUS FAR GIVEN 
THE SURFACE TEMPS AND 850 MB TEMPS.  RUC MODEL 850 TEMPS HAD LOOKED 
A LITTLE BIT WARM WHEN COMPARED TO THE UPPER AIR PLOTS JUST IN...BUT 
LATEST RUC MODEL RUN APPEARS MUCH CLOSER.  00Z NGM MODEL RUN JUST IN
SEEMS TO MISS THIS INITIAL LIGHT PCPN AREA.  WITH THE SURFACE LOW 
PLACEMENT CURRENTLY SO FAR SOUTH ALONG THE GULF COAST JUST SOUTH OF 
MISSISSIPPI...LOOKS LIKE THE NRN MOST PARTS OF OUR AREA WITH KEEP 
THE DRIEST AND COOLEST AIRMASS...WHICH SUPPORTS THE CURRENTLY 
FORECASTED TYPES OF PCPN.  OF COURSE...TIMING THE CHANGE OVER AND 
AMOUNTS OF SNOW AND/OR SLEET IS STILL UNCERTAIN.

AT THIS POINT...WITH NEW MODEL DATA JUST TRICKLING IN AND SO EARLY 
IN THE EVENT...IT SEEMS WISE TO ONLY MAKE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

310 PM EST TUE MAR 15 2005

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MIDWEST...BRINGING A COLD NORTHEAST 
SURFACE FLOW INTO THE FORECAST AREA. SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL 
SPREAD A WARM AND MOIST AIRMASS ACROSS THE REGION TONIGHT FROM A 
DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO. IT APPEARS 
THAT THE BATTLE GROUND BETWEEN THE WARM AND COLD AIR MASSES WILL BE 
ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. NAM AND GFS MODELS INDICATE 
SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEIR VERTICAL THERMAL PROFILES FOR TONIGHT 
AND TOMORROW MORNING...WITH THE NAM MODEL REVEALING A MORE NORTHERLY 
SURGE OF ABOVE-FREEZING AIR AROUND 700 MB INTO THE REGION. THIS WILL 
COMPLICATE MATTERS BY CREATING THE POSSIBILITY OF A WINTRY MIXTURE 
OF PRECIP TYPES ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. WILL 
TREND THE FORECAST TOWARD THE NAM MODEL WHICH HAS BEEN MORE ACCURATE 
THAN THE GFS WITH WINTER WEATHER THIS SEASON. WITH THIS IN MIND... 
EXPECT MAINLY SNOW ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND THE NORTHEAST TN 
MOUNTAINS WHERE SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS WILL LIKELY EXCEED WARNING 
CRITERIA. HOWEVER...SOME SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN MAY BE POSSIBLE AS 
WELL WITH THE WARM 700 MB LAYER ALOFT. ACROSS THE CENTRAL AREAS... 
THINK MAINLY RAIN WILL DEVELOP IN THE VALLEYS WITH SLEET AND SNOW 
MIXED IN AT TIMES AFTER MIDNIGHT AND EARLY TOMORROW MORNING. THIS 
WARM LAYER ALOFT WILL LIKELY CAUSE PRECIP TO FALL IN MANY FORMS 
ACROSS THE SMOKIES WHERE WARNING CRITERIA ACCUMULATIONS MAY HAVE A 
HARD TIME DEVELOPING. THUS...WILL GO WITH A WINTER WX ADVISORY FOR 
THE SMOKIES...AND FOR THE NORTHERN PLATEAU WILL JUST MENTION THE 
POSSIBILITY OF AROUND AN INCH OF ACCUMULATIONS. MODELS INDICATE THAT 
THIS SYSTEM WILL QUICKLY EXIT THE REGION BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON.


.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE UPPER AIR FLOW THROUGH THE 
PERIOD...ALTHOUGH EXACT TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL EVENTS WILL BE 
PROBLEMATIC. ANOTHER SHORT WAVE TROUGH IS PROJECTED TO APPROACH THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. ALTHOUGH QPFS ARE PROJECTED 
TO BE RELATIVELY LIGHT...THICKNESS VALUES SUGGEST POTENTIAL FOR SOME 
SNOW...ESPECIALLY OVER THE NORTHERN TIER AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 
HOWEVER...SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLES DEPICT A RATHER WIDE 
VARIABILITY...SO CONFIDENCE IN PRECIP TYPE IS LOW AT THIS TIME. THIS 
SYSTEM MOVES OUT BY LATE THURSDAY AND IS FOLLOWED BY WEAK SHORT WAVE 
RIDGING ON FRIDAY. A SURFACE COLD FRONT APPROACHES ON SATURDAY AND 
QUICKLY MOVES OUT BY LATE IN THE DAY PER MODEL CONSENSUS. REMAINDER 
OF WEEKEND LOOKS DRY BEFORE ANOTHER SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM 
APPROACHES ON MONDAY. A WARMING TREND IMPLIES AN ALL RAIN EVENT WITH 
THIS SYSTEM HOWEVER. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY WENT WITH BLEND OF GFS 
AND ENSEMBLE GUIDANCE VALUES.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
PROVIDE DRY AND SEASONAL CONDITIONS THIS AFTERNOON.  HOWEVER...THE 
WEATHER PATTERN WILL CHANGE TONIGHT.  A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKING 
ALONG THE GULF COAST WILL ROTATE OUR WIND FIELD TO THE NORTH AND 
NORTHEAST.  THIS CIRCULATION WILL PULL IN A COOLER AIR MASS.  
ADDITIONALLY...THE LOW WILL CIRCULATION A DEEP LAYER OF LOW TO MID 
LEVEL MOISTURE INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION.  ADDED DYNAMICS 
FROM AN UPPER LEVEL WAVE WILL AID LIFT...CREATING SUFFICIENT 
CONDITIONS FOR WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION.  THE FAR SOUTHERN ZONES 
SHOULD REMAIN ALL RAIN...THE CENTRAL TENNESSEE VALLEY AND NORTHERN 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WILL SEE A MIX OF RAIN...SNOW AND SLEET...WITH 
SNOW AMOUNTS IN THESE LOCATIONS EXPECTED TO BE LESS THAN 2 INCHES.  
THE REMAINDER OF THE CWA HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL 
WITH 3 TO 5 INCHES POSSIBLE AT LOWER ELEVATIONS AND 4 TO 7 INCHES 
OVER HIGHER TERRAIN.  FOR THESE AREAS A WINTER STORM WATCH HAS BEEN 
ISSUED.  THE SYSTEM WILL EXIT THE AREA AND PRECIP SHOULD END FROM 
WEST TO EAST WEDNESDAY LATE MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM...(WED NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS DEPICT SIGNIFICANT
SHORT WAVE TO MOVE ACROSS THE AREA THURSDAY.  NAM COLDER WITH THIS 
SYSTEM THAN THE GFS...AND HAS THE PRECIP FURTHER NORTH.  WILL 
GENERALLY GO WITH A BLEND FOR NOW...WHICH STILL WOULD ALLOW FOR 
ANOTHER ROUND OF SNOW IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...AND POSSIBLY SOME 
SNOW IN THE MIX FOR VALLEY AREAS.  WILL GO WITH LIKELY POPS ALL BUT 
SOUTH...WHERE WILL GO 80 POPS FOR THURSDAY.  NEXT PRECIP EVENT FOR 
THE WEEKEND LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD BE MAINLY RAIN.  WILL GENERALLY 
LEAVE LATER PERIODS ALONE FOR NOW.

BUILDING INTO THE TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEY. LOW CLOUDS STILL LINGER 
ACROSS THE WESTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE MOUNTAINS THIS AFTERNOON...BUT 
THINK THESE CLOUDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO SLOWLY DIMINISH TONIGHT. HIGH 
CLOUDS AHEAD OF ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER FLOW HAS GREATLY DE-AMPLIFIED
FROM YESTERDAYS PATTERN WITH MORE OF A ZONAL FLOW.  A COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED
ACROSS MISSOURI TO KENTUCKY WITH A SURFACE LOW OVER NORTHEAST OHIO.  NAM AND
GFS SHOW FRONT SLOWLY MOVING SOUTH INTO THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA
OVERNIGHT.  PRESSURE GRADIENTS WEAKEN THIS EVENING...SO WILL ALLOW WIND
ADVISORIES EXPIRE AT 4 PM. MODELS DIFFER SOME ON AMOUNT OF PRECIPITATION 
ASSOCIATED WITH FIRST WEAK WAVE MOVING IN FAST ZONAL FLOW INTO THE NORTHERN
SECTIONS OF THE REGION.  WILL CALL FOR HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
TO NO POPS FOR CHA AREA.

FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...FRONT WILL BECOME STATIONARY JUST SOUTH OF THE
FORECAST AREA LATE TOMORROW. ANOTHER STRONGER WAVE AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW
WILL RIDE ALONG THE FRONT SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING INCREASING THE
FRONTALGENSIS AND ISENTROPIC LIFT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. HAVE UPPED POPS
TO LIKELY AREA-WIDE FOR SUNDAY NIGHT WITH DECREASING POPS FROM EAST TO WEST
MONDAY MORNING. 

NAM SOUNDINGS SHOW TEMPERATURE PROFILE COLD ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A CHANCE OF
SNOW FOR PARTS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE.  MAY BE SOME
LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS...BUT WILL NOT HIGHLIGHT YET.  LATER SHIFTS MAY NEED TO 
ISSUE AN ADVISORY FOR THE EVENT.

FOR MONDAY THROUGH FIRST HALF OF TUESDAY...FRONT AND SHORT-WAVE MOVES EAST
ALLOWING WEAK RIDGING TO BUILD OVER THE FORECAST AREA.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS AND 
ENSEMBLES ARE NOT IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE PERIOD AS 
PROGRESSIVE PATTERN CONTINUES. ECMWF DEPICTS A CLOSED UPPER 
CIRCULATION DEVELOPING OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS BY 00Z FRIDAY. THIS 
FEATURE IS PROJECTED BY ECMWF TO PROGRESS TO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS BY 00Z SATURDAY. THIS FEATURE IS NOT DEPICTED BY EITHER 
GFS OR CANADIAN GEM. THUS HAVE CHOSEN TO DISCOUNT ECMWF SOLUTION AT 
THIS TIME...BUT CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH. GFS DEPICTS GENERALLY DRY 
WEATHER WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LATE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. HAVE NOT 
MADE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO PREVIOUS FORECAST/GRIDS WITH RESPECT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)..A SHORT-WAVE MOVING EAST ACROSS
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ALONG WITH COLD AIR ALOFT HAS PRODUCED NUMEROUS 
SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON.  DUE TO THE LOW WBZ...REPORTS
OF SMALL HAIL...SLEET AND SNOW HAVE BEEN REPORTED WITH THE SHOWERS.  AS THE
TEMPEATURE PROFILE CONTINUES TO COOL OFF REST OF TODAY...PRECIPITATION WILL
FALL MORE IN THE FORM OF SNOW WITH ACCUMULATING SNOWS POSSIBLE ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND MOUNTAINS OF EAST TENNESSEE.

NEXT SHORT-WAVE IS STILL PROGGED FOR TONIGHT (AFTER MIDNIGHT). STRENGTHENING
BOUNDARY LAYER JET WITH 850 MB WINDS APPROACHING 50 KNOTS AGAIN OVERNIGHT.
THE LOW LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY JET WILL INCREASE THE ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE
REGION...ESPECIALLY OVER THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE REGION. A SWATCH OF MODERATE
SNOW WILL MOVE ACROSS SOUTWHEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE...SO WILL
ISSUE A HEAVY SNOW WARNING THERE THROUGH NOON SATURDAY.

WILL ISSUE A SNOW ADVISORY FOR THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS GIVEN CURRENT SNOW SHOWER
ACTIVITY...BUT WILL END ADVISORY FOR THE MOUNTAINS BY 4 AM AS MOST OF THE 
ACTIVITY FROM SECOND WAVE WILL GO NORTH.

ELSEWHERE (TYS AND CHA)...A MIXTURE OF RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS ARE ANTICIPATED
WITH ONLY LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE FOR CENTRAL VALLEY AND SOUTHERN PLATEAU.

STRONG SOUTHWEST WINDS SATURDAY OVER MOST OF TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH
CAROLINA WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM NICELY TOMORROW.

ANOTHER WAVE AND COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT AND AGAIN
SUNDAY NIGHT...SO HAVE KEPT A CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION GOING FOR THOSE PERIODS. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...TROUGH OVER THE ROCKIES 
MOVES EAST AND RIDGING OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES BREAKS DOWN. A 
SYSTEM DEVELOPING IN THE CENTRAL PLAINS STATES WILL MOVE THROUGH THE 
SOUTHEAST THURSDAY AND OFF THE EAST COAST FRIDAY. THE LONG RANGE GFS 
BRINGS A DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW WITH THIS SYSTEM ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY INTO EASTERN KY THURSDAY. THIS MAY BRING STRONG 
WINDS TO THE FORECAST AREA. TEMPERATURES WILL BE CLOSER TO NORMAL 
WITH HIGHS IN THE 50S TO MID 60S. CLOUDS AND RAIN SHOULD KEEP LOWS

INTERESTING SCENARIO STILL TO PLAY OUT OVER NEXT 30-36 HOURS AS WEAK 
SYSTEMS MOVE ACROSS AREA.

FOR REST OF NIGHT HAVE BACKED OFF POPS BY 10-20% OVERALL...AND WITH 
WARM ADVECTION HAVE MADE ALMOST ALL THE PRECIP TYPE AS LIQUID.  
AFTER DAYBREAK SOME COOLER AIR FILTERS INTO REGION AND SHOULD ALLOW 
SOME SNOW AGAIN...ESPECIALLY OVER PLATEAU.  HAVE WARMED LOW TEMPS 
OVERNIGHT BY 1-3 DEGREES ACROSS THE AREA.  

OTHER BITS...TRACKED MAIN AXIS OF LIFT IN MODELS FRIDAY 
NIGHT...LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT MOVES THROUGH AREA IT WILL BE MOVING 
ABOUT 60 MPH...SO LOOKS LIKE INTENSE PRECIP EPISODE WILL BE LIMITED 
TO JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS...OTHERWISE UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL BE ABLE 
TO KEEP SHOWER ACTIVITY OFF/ON.

MAY BE A PRETTY GOOD GRADIENT OF SNOW N TO S FRIDAY NIGHT AS EXTREME 
NORTH PART OF AREA WILL LIKELY BE ALL SNOW...BUT MAY BE TRENDING 
TOWARD MORE IN THE WAY OF RAIN FROM TYS TO THE SOUTH FOR EVENT.  
PRESENT WATCH AREA STILL LOOKS LIKE GREATEST THREAT.

STILL LOOKS PRETTY GUSTY THROUGH THIS SAME TIME PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...CLOUDS ARE INCREASING AHEAD OF 
NEXT SHORTWAVE DIVING SOUTH THROUGH THE MS VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON. 
WINDS ARE ALSO INCREASING. DEEP SURFACE LOW WITH THIS NEXT SYSTEM 
OVER WISCONSIN IS HEADED SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE PA AND NY FRIDAY. AS 
SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS UP. WILL NEED TO ISSUE LAKE WIND 
ADVISORY FOR THE SECOND HALF OF TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES 
THIS AFTERNOON RANGE FROM AROUND 40 NORTH TO THE LOWER 50S SOUTH. 
DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE MID TEENS TO MID 20S. EXPECTING THE WINDS TO 
KEEP TEMPERATURES UP TONIGHT WITH RAIN SHOWERS DEVELOPING LATE OVER 
THE NORTHERN TWO THIRDS. HIGHER ELEVATIONS COULD SEE A LITTLE SNOW 
MIXED IN AND THEN ACCUMULATING TO UP TO AROUND AN INCH BY MORNING AS 
TEMPERATURES DROP. BELIEVE STRONG SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL KEEP 
TEMPERATURES UP ENOUGH FRIDAY SO ACCUMULATIONS WILL ONLY BE AT THE 
HIGHEST ELEVATIONS ABOVE 4000 FEET. BEST CHANCE OF ACCUMULATING SNOW 
WILL BE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. FOLLOWED THE 
COOLER MET NUMBERS FOR LOWS TONIGHT AND COOLER MAV NUMBERS FOR 
HIGHS.          

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN CONCERN IS STRONG SHORT-WAVE
DIGGING SOUTHEAST INTO THE LONG-WAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION.
NAM CONTINUES TO BE THE STRONGEST WITH THIS WAVE...BUT THE GFS HAS TRENDED
TOWARD THE NAM THE LAST COUPLE MODEL RUNS.  INITIALLY...AS COLD AIR ALOFT MOVES
OVER THE REGION FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...AIRMASS WILL BECOME UNSTABLE 
ENOUGH TO SUPPORT QUITE A BIT OF SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY OVER THE NORTHERN HALF
OF THE FORECAST AREA.

MAIN DYNAMICS WITH SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS AFTER MIDNIGHT FRIDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH MID-MORNING SATURDAY. NAM SHOWS BEST LIFT OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE...AND NORTH PLATEAU. SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OF 3 TO 6 INCHES
ARE POSSIBLE WITH LOCALLY HEAVIER AMOUNTS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATION.
HAVE ISSUED A WSW FOR THESE AREAS FROM 6 PM FRIDAY THROUGH NOON SATURDAY.

FOR TYS...ADVISORY CRITERIA SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE WITH A QUICK
BURST OF SNOWFALL POSSIBLE...MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT THROUGH DAYBREAK SATURDAY.
FOR CHA...ONLY LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS...GENERALLY LESS THAN 1 INCH ANTICIPATED...
EXCEPT FOR THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU WHERE AN ADVISORY MAY BE REQUIRED.

MODELS SHOW UPPER FLOW BECOMING LESS AMPLIFIED THIS WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT
WEEK WITH A SERIES OF FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVES EFFECTING THE AREA. TIMING 
DIFFICULT AND CONFIDENCE LOW. WILL MAINTAIN LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT
AND WEDNESDAY.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK LOW PRESSURE AREA CENTERED 
OVER SOUTHERN GA...WITH LOCAL RADARS INDICATING SOME SNOW FLURRIES 
ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS. THESE FLURRIES SHOULD DIMINISH BY SUNRISE AS 
THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW PATTERN TEMPORARILY BECOMES MORE ZONAL TODAY. 
THE LONG WAVE TROUGH PATTERN OVER THE EASTERN U.S...WHICH HAS 
BROUGHT A PERSISTENT NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT OVER THE FORECAST AREA... 
WILL CONTINUE THROUGH SATURDAY. AS A RESULT...A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL 
QUICKLY MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...BRINGING ANOTHER ROUND 
OF LIGHT PRECIP. THIS FRONT WILL BE FOLLOWED QUICKLY BY ANOTHER COLD 
FRONT ON FRIDAY...BRINGING ANOTHER ROUND OF LIGHT PRECIP INTO FRIDAY 
NIGHT. A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL ALSO DEEPEN ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY NIGHT...HELPING TO GENERATE MORE PRECIP 
AMOUNTS OVER THE REGION. AS A RESULT...SOME ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL 
APPEARS TO BE POSSIBLE FRIDAY NIGHT ACROSS A LARGE PART OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE DIFFERING SOLUTIONS IN REGARDS TO 
MOISTURE AVAILABILITY...BUT RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS THAT MAINLY LIGHT 
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE. WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE A SPECIAL 
WEATHER STATEMENT ADDRESSING THE SITUATION.

IN THE EXTENDED FORECAST...YET ANOTHER COLD FRONT MOVE INTO THE 
REGION ON SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...BRINGING ANOTHER ROUND OF 
LIGHT PRECIP. GFS MODEL INDICATES THAT THIS PERSISTENT LONG WAVE 
TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WILL FINALLY BEGIN TO CHANGE BY EARLY 
NEXT WEEK RESULTING IN MODERATING TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...A WEAK LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM TRACKING TO OUR SOUTH THIS EVENING WILL GENERATE SCATTERED 
RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS MAINLY OUR SOUTHERN CWA.  WEAK UPSLOPE 
FLOW DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT WILL AID ISOLATED TO SCATTERED LIGHT SNOW 
SHOWERS OVER NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS OVERNIGHT.  THE LOW IS EXPECTED TO 
MOVE THROUGH FAIRLY QUICKLY...EXITING THE REGION LATE TONIGHT...AND 
WITH THE TRACK KEEPING MAIN MOISTURE AND LIFT TO OUR SOUTH...PRECIP 
AMOUNTS SHOULD BE LIGHT.  WE WILL BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS ON THURSDAY 
WITH COOL NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT.  A WEAK COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
WILL SLIDE IN FROM OUR NORTHWEST ON THURSDAY NIGHT.  ATTACHED 
MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS IS LIMITED BUT SUFFICIENT FOR SCATTERED RAIN 
AND SNOW SHOWERS OVER THE MRX CWA.  MAIN SHOWER ACTIVITY WILL OVER 
OUR NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS...HOWEVER...LOW LEVEL FLOW NOT CONDUCIVE FOR 
GOOD UPSLOPE LIFT WHICH WILL LIMITED MOUNTAIN SNOWFALL AMOUNTS. 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HUDSON BAY UPPER LOW WILL
REMAIN IN THE START OF THE EXTENDED PERIODS WITH A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES
ROTATING DOWN INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN.  ONE
SUCH WAVE (SHEARED) WILL MOVE ACROSS FRIDAY MORNING...WITH A STRONGER
ONE SCHEDULED FOR LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING.  THE LATE
FRIDAY NIGHT WAVE WILL ALSO BRING WITH IT FAIRLY COLD AIR ALOFT WITH IT
WITH 500 MB TEMPERATURES DROPPING BRIEFLY INTO THE -30 TO -35 RANGE.
MESO-ETA SHOWS MODERATELY STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF THE SURFACE
WAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHORT-WAVE WITH 0.25 INCH OF PRECIPITATION
DEPICTED.  THERMAL PROFILE SUGGESTS PRECIPITATION WILL FALL IN THE FORM
OF SNOW OVER MOST OF THE REGION. LATER SHIFTS MAY WANT TO ISSUE A WINTER
STORM FOR LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING WITH 2 TO 4 INCH SNOWFALLS
POSSIBLE.

PLAN ON ISSUING A SPS CONCERNING THE POTENTIAL SNOWFALL.

FOR THE LATER HALF OF THE WEEKEND...UPPER FLOW BECOMES LESS 
AMPLIFIED AND FLATTENS...SO A WARM-UP IS IN THE OFFING.  SOUTHERN STREAM
BECOMES MORE ACTIVE LATE IN THE EXTENDED WITH NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN FOR

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY WITH A FEW SNOW FLURRIES LINGERING OVER SOUTHWEST VA 
AND NORTHEAST TN. THESE FLURRIES SHOULD DIMINISH BY SUNRISE AS THE 
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW PATTERN BECOMES ZONAL. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
CURRENTLY OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS THE DEEP 
SOUTH TODAY...SPREADING CLOUDS AND MOISTURE INTO THE FORECAST AREA. 
WITH TEMPS EXPECTED TO RISE INTO THE 40S TODAY...THINK THAT MOSTLY 
LIGHT RAIN WILL DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...ALTHOUGH THERE 
COULD BE A FEW SNOW SHOWERS TONIGHT IN THE MOUNTAINS AS WELL AS 
NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. ANOTHER CLIPPER SYSTEM FROM SOUTHERN 
CANADA WILL DIVE IN THE PERSISTENT NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT TOWARDS THE 
FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY. SURFACE TEMPS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE WARM 
ENOUGH FOR MAINLY RAIN THURSDAY NIGHT ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA...WITH SOME SNOW SHOWERS AGAIN POSSIBLE IN THE MOUNTAINS AS 
WELL AS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. A STRONG UPPER SHORT WAVE IS 
PROGGED TO SWING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY NIGHT...AS YET 
ANOTHER COLD FRONT DIVES TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE 
DIFFERING SOLUTIONS IN REGARDS TO MOISTURE AVAILABILITY...BUT IT 
APPEARS RIGHT NOW THAT ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE FRIDAY 
NIGHT ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA.

WAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. (WHICH HAS BROUGHT NUMEROUS COLD 
FRONTS INTO THE REGION IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT) WILL FINALLY 
BEGIN TO CHANGE TO MORE OF A ZONAL FLOW BY MONDAY. THE BAD NEWS IS 
THIS CHANGE WILL CAUSE A COLD FRONT ON SUNDAY TO STALL OUT NEAR THE 
FORECAST AREA THROUGH TUESDAY...BRINGING UNSETTLED WEATHER INTO 
EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WARMER WEATHER SHOULD RETURN 
WITH THIS PATTERN CHANGE WITH MOSTLY RAIN EXPECTED FOR EARLY NEXT

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE 
SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH WINDS SHIFTED TO THE NORTHWEST 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. TEMPS BEHIND THIS FRONT ARE IN THE 
30S OVER MIDDLE TN AND SOUTHEAST KY...AND EXPECT RAIN TO CHANGE OVER 
TO SNOW BY SUNRISE. IN FACT...THE CROSSVILLE AND LONDON OBSERVATIONS 
ARE ALREADY REPORTING LIGHT SNOW WITH TEMPS IN THE LOWER 30S. THE 
BIG QUESTION WILL BE HOW MUCH MOISTURE LINGERS OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS MORNING AS THE SUB-FREEZING AIR ARRIVES? MODELS INDICATE 
DIFFERING SOLUTIONS...BUT EXPECT MOST AREAS TO SEE SOME SNOW SHOWERS 
THIS MORNING BEFORE MOISTURE COMPLETELY EXITS THE REGION. THINK THAT 
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 
2000 FEET...SINCE GROUND AND NEAR SURFACE TEMPS SHOULD BE TOO WARM 
FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATIONS OUTSIDE OF THESE AREAS. WITH THIS 
IN MIND...HAVE ISSUED A SNOW ADVISORY FOR SOUTHWEST VA AND THE 
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN MOUNTAINS FOR TODAY. NORTHWEST WINDS WILL BE 
BREEZY TODAY...BUT RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS THAT WIND SPEEDS SHOULD 
REMAIN BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA.

ON WEDNESDAY...MODELS ARE REVEALING A MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK FOR THE 
NEXT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. WILL KEEP A LOW CHANCE FOR SOME SHOWERS IN 
THE FORECAST (ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC)...BUT 
THINK THAT ANY PRECIP WOULD BE ON THE LIGHT SIDE FOR WED AFTERNOON 
AND WED NIGHT. ANOTHER WEAK SYSTEM WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST FROM CANADA 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY THURSDAY NIGHT...BUT PRECIP AMOUNTS LOOK 
TO BE ON THE LIGHT SIDE AGAIN. EXTENDED MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS 
PERSISTENT NORTHWEST UPPER-LEVEL FLOW PATTERN LOOKS TO CHANGE BY 
NEXT WEEK...WITH WARMER WEATHER EXPECTED.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
410 PM EST MON MAR 7 2005

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...CURRENTLY A COLD FRONT OUT 
OVER THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IS SLOWING MOVING EASTWARD, AND SOUTH 
WINDS ARE GUSTING IN THE FORECAST AREA, DEWPOINTS INCREASING, WHILE 
TEMPS, IN THE LACK OF REAL SUNSINE, ARE HOLDING FAIRLY STEADY. WE 
HAVE BEEN PLACED IN A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS AREA ALL 
DAY, BUT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN A LACK OF ADEQUATE INSTABILITY. WITH 
LOWER DEWPOINTS AND TEMPS NOT RISING MUCH, PLUS A RELATIVELY WARM 
MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE, ITS BEEN TOUGH ALL AROUND. THERE IS A THETA E 
RIDGE AT THE SURFACE OVER MID-WEST TN, BUT WEVE HAD A SFC THETA E 
TROF OVER THE EAST, VA, NC WHICH HAS KEPT THINGS UNDER WRAPS. AN 
AREA OF SHOWERS IS CURRENTLY MOVING EASTWARD OVER US, BUT AMOUNTS 
ARE LIGHT AND THE NEAREST LIGHTING AS OF THE PUBLISHING OF THIS 
DOCUMENT IS OVER THE MS RIVER.

MODELS ARE IN MACABRE AGREEMENT TONIGHT WITH 100 POPS. HAVE GONE 
WITH THEM AS WHO CAN DISAGREE WITH THAT? THERE WILL BE A GAP IN THE 
PRECIP AS THE CURRENT PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION MOVES OUT, BEFORE THE 
ACTUAL FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA LATE TONIGHT. BUT 100 POPS IS THE 
WAY TO GO, IN MY VIEW. THE OTHER PROBLEM IS, WILL IT GET COLD 
ENOUGH TO SNOW, AND WILL THE DYNAMICS OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE 
COLD AIR? I BELIEVE THE ANSWER IS YES, HOWEVER, IT WILL ONLY BE 
COLD ENOUGH ABOVE ABOUT 2500 FEET AND FURTHER NORTH IN VA, WITH THE 
DYNAMICS LIMITED IN STRENGTH, AND MUCH OF IT IN THE FORM OF 
NORTHWEST LOW LEVEL FLOW. THIS NORTHWEST FLOW WILL CAUSE THE BIGGEST 
CONCERNS WELL INTO THE NC MOUNTAINS SO MUCH OF THE HEAVIEST SNOW 
WILL NOT OCCUR IN OUR FORECAST AREA. HENCE, HAS NOT ISSUED A WINTER 
STORM WATCH, AND HAVE OPTED INSTEAD TO UPDATE THE CURRENT SPECIAL 
WEATHER STATEMENT. HAVE REWORDED IT TO CALL FOR THE HEAVIEST OF THE 
1-4 INCH TOTALS ABOVE 3500 FEET, TOO. TEMPS I HAVE NOT TWEAKED TOO 
MUCH, AND HAVE LEFT WINDS ALONE EXCEPT TO ADD SOME GUSTINESS TONIGHT 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOWEST PRESSURE NEAR THE FRONT.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...ANGRY ATMOSPHERE CONTINUES 
TO PUMMEL FA WITH WAVE AFTER WAVE AFTER WAVE EMANATING FROM THE COLD 
WESTERN CANADIAN PROVINCES. FIRST S/WV IN THE LONG TERM BUILDS SE 
THROUGH THE PLAINS INTO THE OZARKS AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE TN VLY 
OF AL AND THE REST OF THE DEEP SOUTH. PRECIP TYPE APPEARS TO BE A 
MIX OF -RA/-SN WITH -SN MAINLY IN THE MOUNTAINS OF TN. USED SLGT CHC 
POPS N (WITH EXCEPTION OF MOST OF SW VA) AND CHC POPS SRN HALF FA 
FOR THIS EVENT. WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR LATER MODELS RUNS TO GET A 
BETTER FOCUS ON THIS SYSTEM AS SOME DISAGREEMENT IN TERMS OF TIMING 
AND TRACK BETWEEN GFS/NAM. FADE POPS OFF TO SLGT CHC WED EVENING AND 
DROP ENTIRELY MOST OF THE FA BY DAYBREAK THU. HOWEVER NEXT IN SERIES 
OF WAVES WITH FRONTAL SYSTEM DROPS INTO THE MS VLY ON THU AND 
CONTINUES SE THROUGH THE APPALACHIANS BY 12Z FRI. SLGT TO CHC POPS 
USED AT THIS LONGER TIME RANGE WITH A MIX OF -RA/-SN MAINLY MTNS AND 
NRN THIRD FA TO MATCH DIURNAL TEMP TRENDS WHICH DROP TO AROUND 
FREEZING OR BELOW OVERNIGHT INTO FRI. SUFFICIENT ENERGY/NW FLO/LOW LVL 
MOISTURE FILLING INTO THE BACK SIDE OF GREAT LAKES UPR TROF TO 
EXTEND CHC -RA WITH SOME -SN MTNS THROUGH FRI. NW UPSLOPE FLO 
CONTINUES ON SAT AND MAINTAINED SLGT CHC POP FOR MIX -RA/-SN SW 
VA/NE TN AND MTNS HERE. FCST MURKY AT SUCH LONG TIME RANGES WITH 
SYSTEMS MOVING RAPIDLY SE OUT OF CANADA SO WITH MY SURROUNDING FOS 
MAINTAINED SLGT CHC POPS OUT THROUGH DAYTIME PERIOD MON AGAIN USING 
MAINLY -RA WITH -SN FOR OVRNIGHT NRN THIRD OF FA AND MTN ZONES.

1005 AM EST MON MAR 7 2005

.DISCUSSION...FRONT STILL LIES WAY OUT WEST IN THE OZARKS, BUT SMALL 
SQUALL LINE IS FORMING IN WESTERN KENTUCKY AND MOVING EAST. ANOTHER 
PATCH OF WEAK (SO FAR) CONVECTION IS MOVING EAST ACROSS EXTREME 
SOUTHERN MIDDLE TENNESSEE. AN AREA OF PATCHY WEAK SHOWERS IS MOVING 
EAST ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. ANY CLOUD-FREE AREAS ARE SLOWLY 
CLOSING OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND DO NOT EXPECT MUCH SUNSHINE OVER 
THE FORECAST ARE TODAY. TEMPS WILL NOT WARM BECAUSE OF INSOLATION, 
BUT BECAUSE OF LOW LEVEL WAA. DEWPONTS STILL IN THE 20S AND 30S IN 
THE AREA, BUT IN THE 40S AND LOW 50S FROM MID TN OVER INTO AR. TEMPS 
ALSO MUCH WARMER OVER THERE. HENCE, SFC THETA E VALUES ARE QUITE LOW 
OVER HERE, AND HIGHER TO THE WEST WITH TIGHT GRADIENT BETWEEN. 
BELIEVE THIS TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE WEAK CONVECTION IN MIDDLE TN AND 
THE PLATEAU. THE SQUALL LINE IN WESTERN KY APPEARS TO BE DRIVEN BY 
THE SFC CONVERGENCE AHEAD OF THE FRONT, PLUS STRENGTHENED BY A SMALL 
THETA E RIDGE IN THE AREA.

WILL NOT ISSUE A ZONE FORECAST UPDATE THIS MORNING. BELIEVE THE 
WORDING IN THE ZONES ACCOUNTS FOR PRESENT CONDITIONS AND FOR CHANGES 
WHICH WILL OCCUR DURING THE DAY. A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT IS 
STILL VALID FOR TONIGHT AS TEMPS DROP AND PRECIP CHANGES TO SNOW 
SHOWERS IN THE LOW ELEVATIONS AND SOME ACCUMULATIONS IN THE HIGHER 
(2500+ FEET). QUESTION STILL REMAINS AS TO TIMING OF MOISTURE AND 
COLD AIR TONIGHT. IF ONE IS OFF, NOT MUCH WILL ACCUMULATE. WILL 
WATCH FOR AFTERNOON PACKAGE.

305 AM EST MON MAR 7 2005

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH 
SCATTERED CONVECTION OCCURRING ACROSS THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY AHEAD 
OF A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL RAPIDLY MOVE 
SOUTHEAST TODAY TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA...BRINGING A STRONG COLD 
FRONT ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 
MODELS STILL INDICATE ONLY MARGINAL INSTABILITY DEVELOPING AHEAD OF 
THE FRONT...BUT THE STRONG WINDS AND UPPER DYNAMICS EXPECTED SHOULD 
HELP TO GENERATE A LINE OF TSTORMS ACROSS THE TN VALLEY LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. DAMAGING WINDS APPEAR TO BE THE 
GREATEST THREAT WITH THESE STORMS...BUT WITH THE HIGH HELICITY 
VALUES PROGGED...THINK AN ISOLATED TORNADO OR TWO WILL BE POSSIBLE. 
THE OTHER FORECAST CONCERN FOR THIS PERIOD INVOLVES THE POSSIBILITY 
OF ACCUMULATING SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS...AS THE SUB-FREEZING AIR ALOFT
BEHIND THE FRONT TRIES TO CATCH-UP WITH THE EXITING MOISTURE AFTER 
MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. GFS AND NAM MODELS INDICATE SOME DISCREPANCIES 
WITH HOW MUCH MOISTURE WILL BE LINGERING AFTER MIDNIGHT AS THE 
SUB-FREEZING ENTERS THE REGION. RIGHT NOW...THINK THAT ONLY ONE TO 
FOUR INCHES WILL BE POSSIBLE AROUND SUNRISE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
ABOVE 2500 FEET. BOUNDARY LAYER APPEARS TO BE TOO WARM FOR ANY
ACCUMULATING SNOW ELSEWHERE. WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A SPECIAL WEATHER 
STATEMENT AND NOT A WATCH TO ADDRESS TONIGHTS SITUATION...SINCE 
ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD REMAIN BELOW WARNING CRITERIA. AS FOR TEMPS... 
ALTHOUGH INCREASING CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TODAY...WILL TREND TOWARDS 
THE WARMER NGM MOS NUMBERS FOR HIGHS TODAY WITH BREEZY SOUTHWEST 
WINDS. WINDS WILL REMAIN BREEZY BEHIND THE FRONT AS WELL THROUGH 
TUESDAY.


.LONG TERM (TUE NIGHT THROUGH SUN)...AFTER A BRIEF ALBEIT COLD 
RESPITE IN THE FOURTH PERIOD...NEXT IN A SERIES OF NORTHERN STREAM 
SHORT WAVES APPROACHES THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON WEDNESDAY. 
TIMING AND PLACEMENT OF THIS SYSTEM REMAINS PROBLEMATIC WITH GFS 
PROJECTING A MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK THAN NAM. THUS GUIDANCE POPS 
VASTLY DIFFERENT. DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A MAJOR EVENT AT ANY RATE 
WITH QPFS PROJECTED TO BE GENERALLY LESS THAN 0.1 INCHES. HAVE NOT 
MADE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO PREVIOUS FORECAST PACKAGE OTHER THAN 
TO SPEED UP ONSET TIMING SOMEWHAT. NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES IN THE 
LATE THURSDAY/EARLY FRIDAY TIME FRAME. GFS AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS 
SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT DEAMPLIFICATION OF EASTERN CONUS TROUGH BY 00Z 
SUNDAY. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN TEMPS MODERATING TO NEAR CLIMO BY LATE 
IN THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...MOST INTERESTING 
PERIOD WILL BE LATE MONDAY INTO TUESDAY MORNING...WITH A THREAT OF 
SEVERE STORMS FOLLOWED BY A GOOD CHANCE OF SIGNIFICANT SNOW (HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS MAINLY) BY TUESDAY MORNING.  MOST GRID CHANGES WERE TO 
MONDAY NIGHT...WHEN SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMS WERE INTRODUCED TO THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SWRN VA AND THE NE AND SMOKY MTNS OF E TN.  I 
ALSO PAINTED IN SOME LIGHTER SNOW ACCUMS FOR OUR NE PLATEAU COUNTIES.
AGREE WITH GSP THAT THE MTN AREAS MAY VERY WELL SEE MORE SNOW THAN 
IN CURRENT GRIDS...AND THIS POTENTIAL WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN MY UPDATED 
HWOMRX PRODUCT AROUND 1245 PM EST TODAY.  THE ETA AND GFS MODELS 
WERE IN QUITE GOOD AGREEMENT ON TIMING THE COLD AIR ARRIVAL BY 06Z 
TO 09Z TUESDAY...AS WELL AS BOTH SHOWING SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMS.
THE MOISTURE LOOKS DEEP ENOUGH ON TUESDAY WITH SUFFICIENT 
INSTABILITY AND LOW LEVEL FORCING (NW UPSLOPE WINDS) TO KEEP SNOW 
SHOWERS GOING INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS.  WILL LET MIDNIGHT SHIFT 
DECIDE IF SNOW AMOUNTS WILL BE IN THE ADVISORY RANGE OR POSSIBLY 
HIGHER FOR TUESDAY.  

OTHERWISE...I FOLLOWED THE MESO-ETA TIMING FOR INITIAL SHOWERS... 
THEN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BY MONDAY AFTERNOON...WHICH WAS ONLY 
MINOR CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS.  THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS FOR LATE 
MONDAY SEEMS TO BE ONLY LIMITED BY LACK OF INSTABILITY...AS WIND 
FIELDS LOOK QUITE FAVORABLE.  MAV MOS HAS PERFORMED RATHER POORLY OF 
LATE...SO I WENT MORE FOR THE BLEND ON MAX TEMPS...WITH LITTLE 
DIFFERENCES ON MINS FROM MOS.  MAX TEMPS TUESDAY WILL BE IN THE AM...
WHICH I GENERALLY TRIED TO LET THE GRIDS REFLECT.  


.LONG TERM...(WED THROUGH SUN)...S/WV AND ASSOCIATED SFC SYSTEM 
PRESS E ACROSS THE SE U.S. WED NIGHT INTO THU WITH ANOTHER CLIPPER 
COMPLIMENTS OF CANADA RIPPING SE FOR ARRIVAL THU NIGHT INTO FRI WITH 
MORE COLD AIR AND NW OROGRAPHICALLY ENHANCED LIFTING PROCESSES ON 
PLATEAU AND APPALACHIAN TERRAIN. ATMOSPHERE DEMANDS THAT SNOW BE 
VERY MUCH PART OF THE FCST FOR MUCH OF THE REGION ESPECIALLY WED 
NIGHT INTO THU WITH CLIPPER SYSTEM AS RELENTLESS NW FLO CONTINUES. 
THREAT FOR SNOW MAINLY NRN TWO THIRDS OF FA WITH EMPHASIS IN HIGHER 
TERRAIN AGAIN THU NIGHT INTO FRI. OROGRAPHICS ALONG WITH TRAILING 
S/WV ENERGY IN NEVER ENDING NW FLO WILL EVEN REQUIRE USE OF SLGT CHC 
POPS THROUGH DAYTIME PERIOD SAT WITH A MIXED BAD OF -RA/-SN DUE TO 
CHILLY ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE. TRIED TO GO WITH A DRY PERIOD SAT

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH SOME 
LOW CLOUDS LINGERING OVER NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. THESE LOW 
CLOUDS SHOULD GRADUALLY ERODE BY SUNRISE...WITH A FEW HIGH CLOUDS 
MOVING ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN FROM THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY. WITH 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...THINK THAT MOST OF THESE HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD 
REMAIN ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH THIS MORNING. THUS...WILL PLAN TO 
MENTION MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. HIGH 
CLOUDS WILL LIKELY INCREASE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...IN 
ADVANCE OF THE NEXT FAST-MOVING COLD FRONT DIVING SOUTHEAST FROM 
CANADA. AS FOR TEMPS...EXPECT ANOTHER NICE WARM-UP TODAY WITH 
SOUTHWEST WINDS AND MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES.

.LONG TERM (MON THROUGH SAT)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES CONTINUE TO 
ADVERTISE NEXT IN A SERIES OF SYSTEMS APPROACHING THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS ON MONDAY. MARGINAL INSTABILITY STILL REFLECTED IN 
MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS...SO HAVE CONTINUED TO MENTION THUNDER FOR 
MONDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. RELATIVELY STRONG DYNAMICS SHOULD AID 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. SURFACE COLD FRONT PASSES THROUGH THE AREA 
AROUND 06Z TUESDAY USHERING IN SIGNIFICANTLY COLDER AIR. ANY 
LINGERING PRECIP TUESDAY MORNING MAY CHANGE OVER TO SNOW ESPECIALLY 
IN THE MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEASTERN ZONES. MUCH DRIER AIR PUSHES INTO 
REGION BEHIND FRONT. HOWEVER...LINGERING LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE MAY 
PRECLUDE COMPLETE CLEARING ON TUESDAY. NEXT DISTURBANCE ARRIVES LATE 
WEDNESDAY. REMAINDER OF WORK WEEK CONTINUES UNSETTLED AS WEAK

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER SOUTHERN INDIANA...WITH ITS TRAILING COLD 
FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWEST ACROSS WESTERN KY AND WEST TN. A CLUSTER 
OF TSTORMS HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED THIS MORNING ACROSS NORTHERN KY IN 
ASSOCIATION WITH THIS LOW. MODELS INDICATE SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY 
DEVELOPING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING AS THE FRONT MOVES 
THROUGH. THUS...WILL KEEP A MENTION OF TSTORMS IN THE FORECAST. 
WINDS WILL BECOME BREEZY BEHIND THE PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT LATE 
THIS MORNING...BUT RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS THAT WIND SPEEDS SHOULD 
REMAIN BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SOME 
LINGERING PRECIP IN THE MOUNTAINS THIS EVENING...AS UPSLOPE FLOW 
COMBINES WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE TO POSSIBLY GENERATE A FEW 
RAIN OR SNOW SHOWERS. AS FOR TEMPS...EXPECT ANOTHER NICE WARM-UP 
TODAY AS BREEZY WESTERLY WINDS GENERATE A LITTLE ADIABATIC WARMING 
DUE TO DOWNSLOPE FLOW OFF THE PLATEAU.

.LONG TERM (SUN THROUGH FRI)...BRIEF RESPITE CONTINUES ON SUNDAY AS 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE REGION. ANOTHER SHORT WAVE 
TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONT APPROACH THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS ON MONDAY. ETA FORECAST SOUNDINGS AGAIN SHOW MARGINAL 
INSTABILITY AS THIS SYSTEM APPROACHES. WILL INTRODUCE SCATTERED 
THUNDER FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. GFS AND ENSEMBLES 
DEPICT LONGWAVE PATTERN RE-AMPLIFING AS UPPER RIDGE IN THE WEST AND 
UPPER TROUGH IN THE EAST BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED. THIS WILL RESULT IN

.DISCUSSION...SCATTERED SHOWERS HAVE QUICKLY DEVELOPED THIS EVENING 
ACROSS SE KY AND ARE MOVING INTO SW VA...THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU AND NE TN. ISOLATED LIGHTNING STRIKES HAVE ALSO OCCURRED IN 
THE ACTIVITY JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. THE 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE DEVELOPING GOOD ASCENT ALONG A WARM ADVECTION AND 
WESTERLY LOW LEVEL JET AXIS. STEEP LAPSE RATES ABOVE THE LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE HAVE CREATED MARGINAL INSTABILITY OVER THE NORTHERN PART OF 
THE FORECAST AREA AS PER SPC LATEST DAY 1 CONVECTIVE OUTLOOK. AT THE 
SAME TIME A COLD FRONT WITH STRONG VORTICITY MAXIMUM WILL DROP SE 
THROUGH THE MID MS VALLEY AND OH VALLEY TONIGHT AND INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY BY MORNING. SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ARE NOW 
OCCURRING ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF KY. THIS FRONT AND SHORTWAVE 
COULD SET OFF MORE THUNDERSTORMS LATE TONIGHT AS IT APPROACHES EAST 
TENNESSEE. WILL ADD SLIGHT CHANCE THUNDER INTO ZONES FOR ALL AREAS 
PROGRESSING FROM NORTH TO SOUTH DURING THE NIGHT. ALSO RAISING POPS 
NORTH FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT TO LIKELY. NO OTHER CHANGES 
ANTICIPATED.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...WEAK WARM ADVECTION 
AND ISENTROPIC LIFT HAS EASED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON
...BUT NOT RESULTED IN MUCH MORE THAN A MID DECK OF CLOUDS AND 
PERHAPS SPRINKLES.  THERE IS A LARGE GAP IN THESE CLOUDS/SPRINKLES 
AND THE UPSTREAM CLIPPER SHORTWAVE...SO HAD TO SCALE BACK RAIN 
CHANCES QUITE A BIT FOR CURRENT TIME AND MUCH OF THE EVENING HOURS.  
STILL BROUGHT IN GOOD SHOWER CHANCES LATER THIS EVENING...UP TO 
LIKELY EVENTUALLY...FOR NRN MOST AREAS.  MAV MOS HAS PERFORMED 
POORLY OF LATE ON BOTH MINS AND MAXES...SO WENT JUST A BIT BELOW MAV 
MIN FOR CHA AND TRI TONIGHT.  MY POPS ENDED PRETTY MUCH CLOSE TO THE 
MOS BLEND FOR TONIGHT.

ONLY MINOR CHANGES FOR SATURDAY THRU SUNDAY NIGHT.  KEPT IN A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS FOR SATURDAY...WHEN AIRMASS IS SLIGHTLY 
UNSTABLE WITH COLD MID LEVEL TEMPS MOVING THROUGH.  DID END THE PCPN 
CHANCES A BIT SOONER FOR SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH NOT MUCH THREAT OF 
ANY SNOW SHOWERS.  SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT STILL LOOK DRY AND MILD.

FROM MS VLY TO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC BY 12Z WED. AS COLDER AIR SPILLS

.DISCUSSION...CLOUDS ARE INCREASING ACROSS KY THIS MORNING WITH 
PATCHY AREAS OF VERY LIGHT RAIN...AND THIS IS THE AREA WHERE WARM 
AIR ADVECTION AND WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT IS OCCURRING.  THIS WEAK 
ISENTROPIC LIFT SHOULD SPREAD INTO OUR REGION THIS EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT...AS THE FAST MOVING UPSTREAM SHORTWAVE APPROACHES.

HOWEVER...UNTIL TONIGHT THE RAIN PROSPECTS LOOK SLIM AS REFLECTED IN 
THE CURRENT FORECAST OF 50 PERCENT CHANCE NORTH TO 20 PERCENT CHANCE 
SOUTH.  ALSO...IF CLOUDS DO NOT INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY THIS AFTERNOON
...THEN MAY NEED TO CONSIDER RAISING MAX TEMPS A BIT...ESPECIALLY 
OVER SRN AREAS.  OHX 12Z SOUNDING SUPPORTED HIGHS IN THE LOWER 60S 
TODAY...WHILE THE COOLER RNK 12Z SOUNDING INDICATED AROUND MID 40S

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS THE 
FORECAST AREA IN BETWEEN A WEAK TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF 
THE APPALACHIANS AND A WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE MID MS 
RIVER VALLEY. THIS LOW OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY WILL MOVE EAST 
TODAY ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...CREATING A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS 
BY THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS MAINLY THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. A FAST-MOVING CLIPPER SYSTEM (CURRENTLY OVER SOUTHERN CANADA) 
WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST TODAY IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...AND MOVE 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA AROUND MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. THIS SYSTEM SHOULD 
INCREASE THE COVERAGE OF SHOWERS TONIGHT...AS NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT 
HELPS TO CREATE SOME WEAK INSTABILITY OVER THE AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
AS FOR TEMPS...A NICE WARM-UP EXPECTED TODAY WITH SOUTHWEST WINDS 
DEVELOPING AHEAD OF THE CLIPPER SYSTEM.

.LONG TERM (SAT THROUGH THU)...NORTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE MOVES 
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON SATURDAY AS AREA REMAINS IN 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. NAM PROJECTS SOME INSTABILITY AS THIS 
DISTURBANCE MOVES THROUGH. THUS ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER ON 
SATURDAY. OTHERWISE DID NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO 
PRECEDING FORECAST/GRIDS. SURFACE FLOW TURNS NORTHWESTERLY BEHIND 
SURFACE FRONT BY SATURDAY NIGHT SETTING THE STAGE FOR POTENTIAL 
UPSLOPE FLOW SNOW SHOWERS FOR CENTRAL AND NORTHERN MOUNTAINS. NOT 
ANTICIPATING A MAJOR EVENT AT THIS TIME HOWEVER. DRIER AIR AND 
STRONG SUBSIDENCE MOVE IN ON SUNDAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS 
IN. NEXT IN A SERIES OF DISTURBANCES APPROACHES LATE MONDAY IN THE 
PERSISTENT NORTHWESTERLY FLOW REGIME. HAVE NOT MADE ANY CHANGES 
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK AS TIMING INDIVIDUAL

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE STILL ACROSS THE AREA...WITH JUST A FEW CLOUDS NOTED 
UPSTREAM IN THE NW FLOW ALOFT AND MORE CLOUDINESS TO OUR SOUTH 
ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES.  THE EXPECTED CLIPPER TYPE SHORTWAVE 
FOR FRIDAY INTO EARLY SATURDAY MAY NOT BRING IN ANY SIGNIFICANT 
CLOUDS UNTIL AFTER 12Z FRIDAY...SO WILL RUN WITH MOSTLY CLEAR TO 
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVERNIGHT.  GENERALLY FAVORED THE ETA MODEL ON 
HANDLING OF LIGHT PCPN WITH THIS SHORTWAVE FEATURE...WHICH KEEPS THE 
HIGHER CHANCES OF MEASURABLE PCPN OVER MY NRN AREAS.  THIS WAS ALSO 
SUPPORTED BY THE WRF MODEL RAN LOCALLY AT WFO HUNTSVILLE (PER CHAT 
COORDINATION).  THIS LIGHT PCPN COULD LINGER INTO SATURDAY NIGHT...
BUT LOOKS TO BE MAINLY A RAIN EVENT NOT SNOW.  CLEARLY THE LEAST 
CHANCE OF ANY PCPN LOOKS TO BE SE TN AREAS...WHERE POPS WERE KEPT IN 
THE SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE CATEGORY.

OTHERWISE...GIVEN THE INCREASING CLOUDS FRIDAY...PCPN LATE FRIDAY 
AND COLD AIR ADVECTION SATURDAY...I STAYED CLOSER TO THE COOLER MOS 
HIGHS BOTH DAYS.  MIN TEMP GUIDANCE WAS QUITE CLOSE AND GENERALLY 
ACCEPTED.   


.LONG TERM...(SUN THROUGH THU)...PLENTY OF NW FLOW TO KEEP TEMPS 
BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THE PERIOD. TWO S/WVS ARE DEPICTED TO DROP 
INTO THE REGION IN CLIPPER FASHION WITH PRECIP RANGING FROM -RA TO 
-SHSN/SHSN IN HIGHER TERRAIN AND MAINLY ACROSS SW VA/CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU. THE FIRST AFFECTS FA MON WITH BROADBRUSH TECHNIQUE FOR NW 
UPSLOPE PRECIP DEVELOPMENT INTO TUE. TAPER POPS OFF TO SLGT CHC TUE 
NIGHT. NEXT WAVE BUILDS SE INTO FA WED AND USED CHC POPS FOR WED 
TAPERING TO SLGT CHC WED NIGHT AND THU AS TRAILING S/WV ENERGY 
CONTINUES TO MOV THRU THE BASE OF PERSISTANT ONTARIO/QUEBEC CLOSED 
LOW/LONGWAVE TROF WHICH EXTENDS THRU MIDWEST AND APPALACHIANS LATE 
IN THE FCST PD. NOT SURE WHEN THE FA SEES MODERATION IN TEMPS AS 
SEEMINGLY NEVER ENDING NW FLOW PERSISTS INTO THE MIDDLE OF MARCH.

OTHERWISE...THE ZFPMRX LIKELY NEEDS NO UPDATE THIS MORNING.

FOR LATER PERIODS...SO FAR I LIKE THE ETA MODEL TIMING OF LIGHT PCPN

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...WEAK SHORTWAVE PUSHING 
THROUGH THE AREA TONIGHT...MOISTURE TOO LACKING TO ADD ANY POPS.  
SKY MAY BECOME MOSTLY CLOUDY FOR A BRIEF PERIOD TONIGHT...BUT IT 
SHOULD REMAIN PARTLY CLOUDY FOR MOST OF TONIGHT.  DRY WEATHER 
CONTINUES INTO THURSDAY.  WILL PROBABLY SEE SOME CLEARING IN THE 
AFTERNOON.  COOL TEMPERATURES CONTINUE...STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO MAV 
GUIDANCE FOR BOTH PERIODS. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THRU WEDNESDAY)...TWO SYSTEMS AFFECT 
THE REGION DURING THE LONG TERM...WITH THE FIRST A FAST MOVING 
CLIPPER TYPE SHORTWAVE IN THE NW FLOW ALOFT ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
SATURDAY.  SHORT RANGE MODELS (MAINLY GFS AND ETA) DIFFER SLIGHTLY 
ON THE TIMING AND COVERAGE AREA OF WHAT SHOULD BE VERY LIGHT QPF 
FROM THIS FEATURE.  FOR NOW...POPS WERE KEPT IN THE CHANCE RANGE 
WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS FOR URN AREAS...AND ALSO SINCE MIN TEMPS 
LOOK TO BE SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...THERE LOOKS TO 
BE LESS THREAT OF ANY SIGNIFICANT SNOW WITH THIS SYSTEM. 

THE NEXT SYSTEM IS POTENTIALLY MUCH STRONGER AND WETTER WITH SOME 
PROSPECTS FOR SNOW...AT LEAST IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS.  WE WILL 
NEED TO MONITOR THIS EVENT AS MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY DRAW CLOSER.
THE ECMWF MODEL WAS FAVORED BY HPC...AND MAY DIFFER SLIGHTLY FROM 
THE GFS AND ETA MODELS ON TIMING THE ONSET OF PCPN AS THE UPPER LOW 
OVER THE SW STATES MOVES EAST ON MONDAY.  A GOOD SURGE OF MOISTURE 
AND WARM AIR ADVECTION IN ADVANCE...SO MOSTLY RAIN UNTIL COLD AIR 
LOOKS TO MOVE INTO THE REGION TUESDAY AFTERNOON OR EVENING.  STRONG 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AND COLD AIR ADVECTION INTO WEDNESDAY WOULD 
KEEP AT LEAST SCATTERED RAIN OR SNOW SHOWERS INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
SINCE THIS IS A DAY 6 AND 7 EVENT...NOT CERTAIN ENOUGH TO GO ABOVE 
40 PERCENT CHANCE POPS JUST YET.  CONSENSUS FROM NEIGHBORING OFFICES 
WAS TO UNDERCUT MEXMOS BY SEVERAL DEGREES FOR HIGHS ON WEDNESDAY.  

OTHERWISE...ONE MINOR CHANGE WAS TO REMOVE THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS

.DISCUSSION...RADAR CONTINUES TO SHOW SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS MUCH
OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING.  SNOW SHOWERS ARE QUITE INTENSE REDUCING
VISIBILITIES TO LESS THAN ONE-QUARTER MILE AT TIMES AND COVERING AREA
ROADWAYS WITH SNOW AND ICE.  REPORTS FROM AREA LAW ENFORCEMENT 
INDICATE THAT BETWEEN 1 AND 1 1/2 INCHES OF SNOW HAVE FALLEN WITH THE
MORE INTENSE SNOW SQUALLS. MAIN CULPRIT FOR THE CONVECTIVE BANDS IS
THE VERY COLD AIR ALOFT MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH 500 MB 
TEMPERATURES DROPPING TO -35 OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE.

LATEST NAM SHOWS FAIRLY UNSTABLE BOUNDARY LAYER CONTINUING THROUGH MOST
OF THE AFTERNOON...SHOW EXPECT SCATTERED SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY TO 
CONTINUE. WILL MAINTAIN CURRENT WARNING/ADVISORIES GOING THROUGH 4 
PM.  WILL LOWER SNOW ACCUMULATIONS TO 1 INCH OR LESS FOR THE CHA 
AREA.

PLAN ON LOWERING HIGH TEMPERATURES TODAY MOST LOCATIONS A CAT OR SO
GIVEN THE COLD AIR ADVECTION INTO THE REGION.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE 
EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH BREEZY WEST WINDS 
ADVECTING COOLER AND DRIER AIR INTO THE FORECAST AREA BEHIND THIS 
FRONT. A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE MIDWEST THIS EVENING 
WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS BY SUNRISE. 
LIGHT SNOW HAS ALREADY BEEN REPORTED AT CROSSVILLE AND WISE VA THIS 
EVENING...WITH KOHX RADAR REVEALING SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS 
MIDDLE TN ASSOCIATED WITH MUCH COLDER TEMPS ALOFT. IN FACT...THE 
NASHVILLE EVENING SOUNDING REVEALED A COLDER VERTICAL PROFILE THAN 
THE GFS AND NAM/ETA MODELS (ESPECIALLY AROUND 700 MB)...WHICH SHOULD 
RESULT IN STEEPER LAPSE RATES FOR THE FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT. 
AS A RESULT...COVERAGE OF SNOW SHOWERS WILL LIKELY INCREASE TOWARDS 
SUNRISE AS THIS COLDER AIR ALOFT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION. UPSLOPE 
FLOW IN THE MOUNTAINS SHOULD ALSO ENHANCE THE COVERAGE AND INTENSITY 
OF SNOW SHOWERS THERE OVERNIGHT.

CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE OVERALL THIS EVENING... 
BUT WILL PLAN TO UPDATE TO REMOVE EVENING WORDING.

HOWEVER...AS COLD AIR ALOFT ASSOCIATED WITH DIGGING UPPER TROUGH MOVES
INTO THE REGION OVERNIGHT AND TUESDAY A GOOD DEAL OF SHOWERS WILL BREAK
OUT AS BOUNDARY BECOMES UNSTABLE. SATELLITE SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF
CELLUAR/CONVECTIVE NATURE TO THE CLOUDS OVER MISSOURI AND ILLINOIS 
ASSOCIATED WITH COLD AIR ALOFT. NAM SOUNDINGS RELATIVELY UNSTABLE 
CONDITIONS FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON. ANTICIPATE
A GOOD DEAL OF SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY WITH THE POTENTIAL OF BANDING
SNOW SQUALLS PRODUCING BRIEF MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOWS.  WILL EXTEND
HEAVY SNOW WARNING UNTIL 4 PM AND ISSUE A SNOW ADVISORY FROM MIDNIGHT
TONIGHT THROUGH 4 PM FOR THE NORTHERN PLATEAU...NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE...AND CENTRAL VALLEY.

FOR TUESDAY NIGHT...SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY WILL WEAKEN AS AIRMASS BECOMES
WELL MIXED AND DIMINISH TO FLURRIES OVERNIGHT. 

.LONG TERM...(WED THROUGH MON)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES IN GENERAL

INTO THE AREA. NOT ANTICIPATING THIS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT EVENT AT 
THIS TIME AND CONTINUED WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. ALSO...STILL SOME 
UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM. TEMPS WILL SLOWLY 
MODERATE FROM WELL BELOW CLIMO TO NEAR CLIMO BY LATE IN THE PERIOD

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER 
NORTHERN FLORIDA NEAR JACKSONVILLE...WITH A WEAK TROUGH GENERALLY 
ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. LIGHT RAIN HAS FINALLY MOVED ACROSS 
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...AS THE DRY BOUNDARY LAYER 
SLOWLY CONTINUES TO MOISTEN. KMRX VAD WIND PROFILE INDICATES A WARM 
AIR ADVECTION PATTERN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...WITH SOUTHEAST FLOW 
UP TO AROUND 8000 FEET. THIS SOUTHEAST FLOW WILL PRODUCE DOWNSLOPE 
EFFECTS OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEYS...WHICH 
SHOULD KEEP RAINFALL AMOUNTS ON THE LIGHT SIDE. MOST PRECIP TONIGHT 
WILL BE CONFINED TO THE WESTERN NC MOUNTAINS WHERE UPSLOPE FLOW WILL 
OCCUR. LATEST EVENING SOUNDINGS FROM GSO AND RNK REVEAL A SLIGHTLY 
COLDER VERTICAL PROFILE THAN THE MODELS...WHICH SUPPORTS THE CURRENT 
FORECAST OF ALL SNOW FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. PRECIP MAY START IN 
THE FORM OF A MIXTURE OF RAIN AND SNOW ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
THIS EVENING...BUT THIS RAIN SHOULD QUICKLY CHANGE-OVER TO SNOW 
BEFORE MIDNIGHT AS STRONGER LIFT (CURRENTLY OVER NORTHWEST GA) 
CROSSES THE SMOKIES CREATING STRONG DYNAMIC COOLING. ALSO...AN UPPER 
TROUGH OVER THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY WILL GRADUALLY MOVE TOWARD 
THE REGION BY SUNRISE...BRINGING MUCH COLDER ALOFT ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. FOR REST OF THE FORECAST AREA...THE BOUNDARY LAYER 
SHOULD REMAIN WARM ENOUGH FOR MOSTLY RAIN OVERNIGHT...SINCE 
DEWPOINTS CONTINUE TO RISE WELL ABOVE THE FREEZING MARK.

CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE OVERALL...BUT WILL PLAN 
TO UPDATE THIS EVENING TO START THE HEAVY SNOW WARNING NOW AND TO 
REMOVE EVENING WORDING.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...RATHER COMPLICATED SCENARIO 
SHAPING UP FOR THE SHORT TERM. MODELS HAVE COME INTO A LITTLE BETTER 
AGREEMENT ON THE TRACK OF THE SURFACE LOW...CURRENTLY CENTERED IN 
THE NORTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...GENERALLY ALONG THE ATLANTIC 
COAST. THIS TRACK DIMINISHES OUR QPF SOMEWHAT BUT ALSO RESULTS IN 
SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPS. THIS IS STILL A VERY BORDERLINE EVENT AND 
EVEN AN INCREMENTAL DEVIATION IN TEMPS WILL HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECTS 
ON SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. GENERALLY GOING WITH THE SLIGHTLY COOLER NAM 
WHICH SUGGESTS SIGNIFICANT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE...MAINLY 
IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. WILL ISSUE HEAVY SNOW WARNING FOR CENTRAL AND 
NORTHERN MOUNTAIN ZONES...ALONG WITH HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF 
SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA. SNOW ALSO POSSIBLE IN NORTHEASTERN AND EVEN 
CENTRAL VALLEYS...BUT BOUNDARY LAYER LOOKS TOO WARM FOR SNOW TO 
ACCUMULATE SIGNIFICANTLY.

UPPER NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH SWINGS TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
ON MONDAY. WRAP AROUND MOISTURE WITH THIS FEATURE WILL CONTINUE 
SHOWERY PRECIP ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. NAM SOUNDINGS 
INDICATE SOME INSTABILITY/CAPE AS THIS UPPER TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH. 
HOWEVER...RATHER WEAK FLOW AND NON-IDEAL UPSLOPE (WESTERLY) FLOW 
COMPONENT CASTS SOME UNCERTAINTY OF POTENTIAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN FOR THE SECOND PERIOD ALSO.

.LONG TERM...(MON NIGHT THROUGH SUN)...UPPER TROUGH DIGS IN MONDAY 
NIGHT...ALONG WITH STRONG COLD ADVECTION.  MOISTURE PROFILE AND LOW 
LEVEL LAPSE RATES LOOK LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT SNOW SHOWER 
ACTIVITY AROUND MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...ALTHOUGH LOW LEVEL 
FLOW MORE WESTERLY THAN IS IDEAL FOR UPSLOPE SNOW EVENT...WHICH 
SHOULD HELP LIMIT AMOUNTS.  STILL LOOKS LIKE FAIRLY HIGH POPS WILL 
BE NEEDED HOWEVER...AND SNOW AMOUNTS LOOK SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO 
CONTINUE HEAVY SNOW WARNING  FOR NORTHERN AND CENTRAL MOUNTAINS AND 
PARTS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT.   COLD ADVECTION 
AND UPSLOPE FLOW LINGER INTO EARLY WED...SO WILL GRADUALLY TAPER 
POPS TO JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE IN NORMALLY FAVORED UPSLOPE LOCATIONS 
BY EARLY WED...THEN DRY BY WED NIGHT.  FURTHER OUT...MODELS HAVING A 
HARD TIME RESOLVING ANY SHORT WAVE ENERGY COMING DOWN IN THE 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT.  CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH FOR LATE IN THE 
PERIOD...BUT FOR NOW WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SAT NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY AS WE MAY BE DEALING WITH A WEAK SYSTEM IN THAT TIME FRAME.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL 
BE EXITING THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT...BUT MOISTURE AND WEAK LIFT FROM 
WAVES ROTATING AROUND THE UPPER TROUGH COMBINED WITH LIMITED UPSLOPE 
FROM WESTERLY FLOW WILL CONTINUE SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE AREA.

SNOW IN THE TENNESSEE VALLEY DURING THE EVENING.  ON TUESDAY... 
ISOLATED SNOW SHOWERS...TURNING TO RAIN IN THE TENNESSEE VALLEY IN

238 PM EST SAT FEB 26 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...MAIN ISSUE FOR THE SHORT TERM 
PERIOD IS TIMING OF THE ONSET OF PRECIP IN THE SECOND PERIOD. 
SIGNIFICANT SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM...CURRENTLY AFFECTING MUCH OF 
TEXAS...IS PROJECTED TO PROGRESS NORTHEASTWARD OVER THE NEXT 24 
HOURS. THE NAM...GFS AND SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLES (SREF) ALL GENERALLY 
AGREE THAT PRECIP WILL ENCROACH THE SOUTHERN TIER BY 18Z SUNDAY AND 
PROGRESSIVELY OVERSPREAD THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 00Z 
MONDAY. GFS IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE SLOWER WITH THIS PROCESS THAN THE 
NAM...AND AM INCLINED TO FAVOR IT AS THE PROJECTED DOWNSLOPE FLOW 
COMPONENT WILL TEND TO DELAY PRECIP ONSET FOR CENTRAL AND NORTHERN  
SECTIONS. CANT COMPLETELY RULE OUT THE NAM TIMING THOUGH SINCE THE 
SREF TENDS TO SUPPORT IT. 

MEANWHILE...BENIGN WEATHER WILL RULE WITH ONLY AN INCREASE 
IN HIGH CLOUDS AS SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM APPROACHES. GUIDANCE TEMPS 
ARE GENERALLY CLOSE AND APPEAR REASONABLE. NOT ANTICIPATING AS LARGE 
A DIURNAL TEMP SWING AS INCREASING CLOUD COVER SHOULD PRECLUDE THAT.

.LONG TERM...(SUN NIGHT THROUGH SAT)...MODELS CONTINUE TO DEPICT 
COMPLEX SITUATION FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.  NAM/GFS DO NOT AGREE 
WELL...SINCE THE GFS NOW DEPICTS SIGNIFICANT COASTAL DEVELOPMENT OFF 
THE EAST COAST.  NAM STILL TRYING TO KEEP LOW PRESSURE CENTER 
FURTHER WEST.  WILL FOLLOW HPC LEAD ON THIS...AND GENERALLY GO 
CLOSER TO THE GFS SOLUTION.  THIS BRINGS MORE OF A POSSIBILITY OF 
WINTRY PRECIP TO PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND INTO THE 
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL MOUNTAINS...AS THERMAL PROFILES ARE CLOSE FOR 
SNOW...ESPECIALLY OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  ALSO...WHILE WIND 
DIRECTION IS NOT GREAT FOR A MAJOR UPSLOPE EVENT...A BIT TOO 
WESTERLY...SHOULD STILL SEE SOME SNOW SHOWERS IN THE STRONG COLD 
ADVECTION AS UPPER TROUGH DIGS IN MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY.  WHILE 
CONFIDENCE ON PRECIP TYPE TOO LOW AT THIS POINT FOR ANY 
WATCHES/ADVISORIES FOR SUN NIGHT AND MONDAY...WILL ISSUE SPS TALKING 
ABOUT POSSIBILITY OF SNOW...ESPECIALLY OVER SOME OF THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN...AND ALSO THE SNOW SHOWERS ON THE BACK SIDE MONDAY NIGHT 
INTO TUESDAY.  FURTHER OUT...MODELS STILL HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE 
DETAILS OF ANY SHORT WAVE COMING DOWN IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT.  
FOR NOW WILL CARRY LOW POPS FOR FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY...AS GFS 
DEPICTING SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOST LIKELY IN THAT TIME FRAME.

DEPICT A DRY ATMOSPHERE AT ALL LEVELS WITH GENERAL SUBSIDENCE BEFORE 
SOME HIGH-LEVEL MOISTURE BEGINS TO INVADE BY AROUND 12Z SATURDAY. 
GOOD RADIATIONAL CONDITIONS IN FIRST PERIOD SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO

AND TRACKING NORTHEAST...AS ANOTHER LOW TRACKS EAST SOMEWHERE NEAR 
THE GREAT LAKES.  COLD FRONT TO SWING THROUGH OUR AREA FROM THE 
WEST...BUT TIMING UNCERTAIN. FOR NOW WILL GENERALLY TRY TO FOLLOW 
HPC LEAD...SLOWING DOWN THE FRONT FROM THE GFS SOLUTION. WILL GO 
WITH A FRONTAL PASSAGE DURING MONDAY NIGHT.   SIGNIFICANT UPPER 
TROUGHING TO DIG INTO THE AREA...WITH RATHER COLD AIR PUSHING IN

SHOWERS WITH THIS SURGE OF COLD AIR.  PRECIP TYPE FOR EARLIER PRECIP 
STILL PROBLEMATIC...WITH THERMAL PROFILES SUGGESTING POSSIBILITY OF 
WINTRY PRECIP...AT LEAST IN PARTS OF NORTH AND MOUNTAINS.  WILL 
ALLOW FOR RAIN OR SNOW IN PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE 
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL MOUNTAINS FOR LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY 
MONDAY.  UNCERTAINTY STILL QUITE HIGH FOR DAYS 6 AND 7...BUT FOR NOW 
PLAN TO GO DRY BOTH DAYS AS HPC PREFERRED SOLUTION DEPICTS HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDING IN.

.DISCUSSION...PRECIP HAS PRETTY MUCH MOVED OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA
TO THE EAST. HOWEVER...MODELS INDICATE THAT A WEAK NORTHERN STREAM
SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE THROUGH EAST TENNESSEE THIS AFTERNOON.
EXPECT SOME PRECIP WITH THIS FEATURE OVER MAINLY THE NORTHEASTERN AND
MOUNTAIN ZONES. WILL UPDATE ZONES TO REMOVE POPS IN OTHER
LOCATIONS...AS WELL AS MORNING WORDING. TEMPS SOMEWHAT TRICKY AS VIS
SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW SOME CLEARING OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE. ANTICIPATE
CLOUDS TO BE THE RULE RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION HOWEVER. THUS WILL

.SHORT TERM...SHORT-WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH MODERATE
ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF THE WAVE WAS PRODUCING AN AREA OF LIGHT RAIN OVER
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS MORNING. BACK EDGE OF THE RAIN WAS ACROSS
THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE PLATEAU. WILL HAVE A SHARP GRADIENT FROM CAT POPS FAR
NORTHEAST TO LITTLE TO NO POPS FOR THE PLATEAU COUNTIES AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE.

LATEST NAM SHOWS FORECAST AREA REMAINING UNDER BROKEN-OVERCAST LOW STRATUS
CLOUDS TODAY. NORTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO
VALLEY TODAY PROVIDING EMPHASIS TO PULL INVERTED TROUGH OVER THE REGION
EAST OF THE AREA WITH COLD AIR ADVECTION WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE FOR LATE TODAY
AND THIS EVENING. WILL CONTINUE WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS SHOWERS/FLURRIES FOR
MAINLY THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST TENNESSEE...
AND SMOKY MOUNTAINS.  LITTLE TO NO SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ANTICIPATED.

FOR FRIDAY...NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AND SURFACE RIDGING WILL BE THE RULE WITH
AIRMASS DRYING OUT ALLOWING SKY TO GO MOSTLY CLEAR.  RETURN OF SUNSHINE WILL
ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM TO NEAR SEASONAL LEVELS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW AN
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING ACROSS THE EASTERN GULF COAST STATES THEN
MOVING NORTHEAST INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.
WILL CONTINUE WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN. ECMWF AND GFS HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENTS
TO UPPER TROUGH DIGGING INTO THE EASTERN UNITED STATES TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.
WILL FOLLOW ECMWF WHICH IS MORE CONSISTENT AND DEPICTS A SLIGHTLY SLOWER
EVOLUTION OF THE TROUGH. EITHER WAY COLDER TEMPERATURES BY MID-WEEK NEXT

.DISCUSSION...MID TO HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS RAPIDLY SPREADING NE 
ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...WITH 00Z TEMPS QUITE MILD IN 
THE MID 40S TO UPPER 50S.  WATCHING DEWPOINT TEMPS ACROSS MAINLY 
SWRN VA...WHERE CURRENT READINGS WERE IN THE MID TO UPPER 20S.  THE 
AREA OF RAIN IS SPREADING EAST ABOUT 30 TO 35 MPH FROM MIDDLE TN AND 
WRN AL...AND LATEST RADAR PICS SEEM MORE IN LINE WITH THE ETA MODEL
THAN THE SLIGHTLY FASTER GFS MODEL.  GIVEN THE WARM AIR ADVECTION 
ALOFT...PLUS CURRENT TEMPS AND DEWPOINTS...IT DOES APPEAR THAT OUR 
AREA SHOULD ESCAPE ANY WINTRY MIX OVERNIGHT AND AT LEAST WELL INTO 
THURSDAY.  THE ONLY THREAT WOULD BE IF SURFACE TEMPS COULD FALL 
BELOW FREEZING ACROSS THE NE TIP OF TN INTO SWRN VA...AND THIS LOOKS 
UNLIKELY AT THIS POINT.  THEN OF COURSE...A PERIOD OF RAIN/SNOW MIX 
OR SNOW SHOWERS FOR HIGHER ELEVATIONS POSSIBLE BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON 
AND/OR EVENING AS THE COLD AIR ADVECTS INTO THE REGION...AND LIGHT 
PCPN CONTINUES IN ADVANCE OF THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH.  

OTHER CONCERN WAS THE POSSIBILITY OF THUNDERSTORMS...DUE TO ELEVATED 
INSTABILITY...MAKING IT AS FAR NE AS OUR SE TN ZONES.  HOWEVER...THE 
LIGHTNING ACTIVITY HAS BEEN STEADILY DIMINISHING TO OUR SOUTH...SO 
THUNDERSTORMS LOOK TO REMAIN WELL TO OUR SOUTH OVERNIGHT.

.SHORT TERM...
LARGE AREA OF PRECIP STILL TRUDGING TOWARD AREA.  NO MAJOR PROBLEMS 
EXPECTED FROM THIS SYSTEM AS AIR MASS EXPECTED TO BE RELATIVELY 
WARM.  THINKING THAT BRIEF FZRA MIGHT FALL IN ISOLATED AREAS IN 
EXTREME NORTHEAST AT PRECIP ONSET...BUT SHOULD WARM OVERNIGHT AS WAA 
TAKES AFFECT ALOFT.  LOOKS LIKE MAIN COLD AIR DAMMING WILL STAY TO 
NORTHEAST OF REGION.  ALSO EXPECTING PRECIP IN THAT AREA TO STAY 
LIGHT.  LATE IN THE DAY ON THURSDAY AS COLD AIR COMES IN...COULD 
CHANGE OVER TO SNOW...BUT MOISTURE IS ON ITS WAY OUT. WILL NOT ENTER 
ANY SNOW AMOUNTS IN THURSDAY GRID.  

NOT PUTTING ANY THUNDER IN FORECAST FOR TONIGHT...THINK IT WILL STAY 
SOUTH.  ELEVATED THUNDER OCCURRING NOW IN NRN MS...ONE THING TO KEEP 
EYE ON THIS EVENING IS WHETHER IT TRIES TO MAKE A MOVE FARTHER NORTH.

HAVE WARMED UP TEMPS ON THURSDAY AS WARMING AHEAD OF FRONT SHOULD 
SPREAD ACROSS ALL OF REGION INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM...(THU NIGHT THROUGH WED)...COLD ADVECTION CONTINUES INTO 
EARLY THU NIGHT AND SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD HANG AROUND FOR A 
WHILE...BUT LOW LEVEL FLOW FAIRLY QUICKLY TURNS MORE ANTICYCLONIC 
AND LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES DO NOT APPEAR TO IMPRESSIVE...SO THINK ANY 
UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE LIMITED.  FOR NOW WILL JUST CONTINUE 
CHANCE IN THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL MOUNTAINS INTO SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA...AND QUICKLY TAPER TO FLURRIES.  SHOULD BE DRY FRIDAY INTO 
SUNDAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AND WEAK UPPER RIDGING TAKE 
CONTROL.  CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH ON NEXT SYSTEM MODELS IN SOME 
DISAGREEMENT. GENERALLY ACCEPTED THE HPC BLENDED SOLUTION...WHICH 
BRINGS A SURFACE LOW BY TO OUR SOUTH SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...THEN 
A COLD FRONT SWEEPS THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT.  UPPER TROUGH DIGS IN AND 
MODELS INDICATE SIGNIFICANT COLD ADVECTION INTO TUESDAY...SO MAY SEE 
SOME UPSLOPE PRECIP. WILL GO DRY FOR NOW ON WED.

.SHORT TERM...AREA OF LOW CLOUDS PERSIST ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND
ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. LATEST NAM SHOWS DOWNSLOPE
NORTHWEST WINDS KEEPING CLOUDS MAINLY WEST AND NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA...
EXCEPT FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. LOW CLOUDS WILL
EVENTUALLY DISSIPATE BY NOON...HOWEVER...HIGH/MID LEVEL CLOUDS ALREADY 
SPREADING RAPIDLY INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND WILL OVERSPREAD THE AREA
THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING.

NAM AND GFS ARE FAIRLY CLOSE IN REGARDS TO NEXT SYSTEM FOR TONIGHT THROUGH
THURSDAY EVENING. A FAIRLY FAST MOVING SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM WITH DECENT
ISENTROPIC LIFT AND MODERATE JET DYNAMICS. ALSO...MODELS SHOW AN INVERTED
TROUGH OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR TONIGHT AND THURSDAY.  PLAN ON UPPING POPS
TO CAT TONIGHT AND HIGH CHANCE SOUTH AND CAT NORTH FOR THURSDAY.

MAIN QUESTION WILL BE POSSIBILITY OF SNOW/SLEET FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS. LATEST MODELS SHOW TEMPERATURE PROFILE A
LITTLE WARMER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. WILL MAINTAIN A MIX OR CHANGEOVER TO SNOW
FOR HIGH ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE...BUT
FEEL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS LIMITED.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE SURFACE AND
ALOFT FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...BUT BOTH A SOUTHERN STREAM AND NORTHERN STREAM
ENERGY COMES TOGETHER LATE IN THE FORECAST.  BOTH THE ECMWF AND GFS DEPICT
A FAIRLY DECENT UPPER TROUGH ESTABLISHING ITSELF BY EARLY/MID WEEK NEXT WEEK.
HAVE BUMP UP POPS TO CHANCE FOR SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY.  HAVE ALSO LOWERED
HIGHS FOR TUESDAY GIVEN SUCH A DEEP UPPER TROUGH.

HAVE ALLOWED AREAS OF DENSE FOG TO FORM. VISIBILITIES HAVE DROPPED TO LESS
THAN ONE-QUARTER MILE AT LNP...TYS...OQT...MRX..AND RHP. LATEST NAM SHOWS
SURFACE RELATIVE HUMIDITY STAYING BETWEEN 97-100 PERCENT THROUGH 12Z. HAVE
ISSUED A DENSE FOG ADVISORY TO COUNT FOR THE AREAS OF DENSE FOG UNTIL MID-
MORING.

A GOOD DEAL OF FOG AND LOW CLOUDS WILL SLOWLY DISSIPATE THIS MORNING. NAM
SHOWS BOTH 925 MB AND SURFACE RELATIVE HUMIDITY LOWERING WITH SKY BECOMING
PARTLY CLOUDY THIS AFTERNOON.  SURFACE RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO
THE REGION TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY.  NAM SHOWS ENOUGH DRIER DEWPOINTS ADVECTING
INTO THE AREA FOR LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT...SO ANOTHER ROUND OF WIDESPREAD
DENSE FOG IS NOT ANTICIPATED.  MODELS SHOW INCREASING HIGH/MID LEVEL
CLOUDS FOR TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...SO PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS
EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNEDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IS 
POTENTIAL GULF COAST STATES SURFACE LOW DEVELOPMENT. NAM IS THE STRONGEST
IN DEVELOPING A LOW ACROSS AL/GA WITH A SURFACE INVERTED TROUGH INTO THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. GFS DOES DEVELOP A WEAKER AND FASTER SYSTEM ACROSS
THE GULF COAST STATES.  WILL TREND TOWARD THE NAM...BUT WILL NOT GO AS
HIGH AS NAM POPS FOR NOW AND WAIT AND SEE IF LATER RUNS CONTINUE TREND.
NEXT QUESTIONS IS POTENTIAL FROZEN PRECIPITATION FOR NORTHERN SECTIONS AND
MOUNTAINS. NAM SOUNDINGS SHOW A FAVORABLE TEMPERATURE PROFILE AND THICKNESS
FOR SNOW OR SNOW/RAIN MIX FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS
AND POSSIBLE NORTHERN PLATEAU FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY EVENING.

WILL NOT HIT SNOWFALL POTENTIAL TOO HARD YET DUE TO SYSTEM UNCERTAINTY. ALSO...
PRECIPITATION WILL LIKELY OCCUR DURING THE DAYLIGHT HOURS WHICH WILL LIMIT
SNOW ACCUMULATION POTENTIAL.  ALSO...GROUND TEMPERATURES RELATIVELY WARM
WHICH WILL LIMIT SNOWFALL. WILL INCLUDE POTENTIAL WINTRY CONDITIONS IN THE
HWO.

SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGING DOMINATES CONDITIONS FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.
NEW MEDIUM RANGE GFS SHOWS A POTENTIAL CYCLOGENSIS OFF SOUTHEAST COASTS FOR
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MODAY...BUT DUE TO LOW CONFIDENCE IN SYSTEM WILL KEEP THINGS

957 AM EST MON FEB 21 2005

.DISCUSSION...MAIN CONCERN THIS MORNING IS THE MCS OVER WRN HALF OF 
TN...AND HOW FAR EAST THE THREAT OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS EXISTS THIS 
MORNING.  THE AIRMASS OVER E TN/SW NC/SW VA IS CONSIDERABLY MORE 
STABLE THAN W AND MIDDLE TN...BOTH SURFACE BASED AND ELEVATED.  THE 
BEST THREAT FOR OUR AREA WILL BE SE TN...WHICH IS CLOSEST TO THE 
WARM FRONT WHICH WAS LOCATED JUST SW OF CHA AT 13Z.  THE INITIAL MCS 
DID WEAKEN UPON REACHING OUR FORECAST AREA...AND SPC IS MONITORING 
MIDDLE TN CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY FOR POSSIBLE NEW WATCH TOWARD 15Z.

OTHERWISE...HIGH POPS IN CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS GOOD FOR TODAY WITH 
A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS.  IF A WATCH IS ISSUED INTO E TN...THEN 
WILL WORD THUNDERSTORMS A LITTLE STRONGER.  ALSO...MAY NEED TO LOWER 
MAX TEMP FORECAST A FEW DEGREES IN THE COOLEST AND MOST STABLE PARTS 
OF THE FORECAST AREA (SW VA AND EXTREME NE TN).

FRIDAY NIGHT...MOISTURE LIMITED AGAIN...WILL ONLY KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS FOR OUR NORTHERN ZONES AND THE MOUNTAINS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...A WARM FRONT TRACKING NORTH 
ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE THIS EVENING WILL CONTINUE WIDESPREAD PRECIP 
ACROSS THE AREA THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.  WEAK INSTABILITY WILL BEGIN 
TO DEVELOP OVERNIGHT AS TEMPERATURES AND DEW POINTS SLOWLY CLIMB.    
AS THE AIR MASS BECOME UNSTABLE...PRECIP WILL BECOME MORE CONVECTIVE 
IN NATURE...CREATING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORM FORMATION LATE 
TONIGHT.  ANOTHER ROUND OF PRECIP WILL DEVELOP ON MONDAY AS THE COLD 
FRONT APPROACHES THE REGION.  WITH THE ATMOSPHERE CONTINUING TO 
DESTABILIZE THROUGH THE DAY...THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WILL INCREASE. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...COLD FRONT SHOULD MOVE 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY MONDAY NIGHT...WITH A FEW POST-FRONTAL 
SHOWERS POSSIBLE AS AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE 
REGION. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY ACROSS 
THE DEEP SOUTH ON TUESDAY...WITH THE GFS MODEL REMAINING CONSISTENT 
WITH ITS MORE SOUTHERLY LOCATION CLOSER TO THE GULF COAST. THE OTHER 
EXTENDED MODELS ARE BEGINNING TO MOVE CLOSER TO THIS SOLUTION...SO 
WILL TREND THE EXTENDED FORECAST TOWARD THE GFS WITH SMALL POPS 
CONFINED TO SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE DEEP SOUTH NEARS THE

APPROACHING THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TONIGHT. IN ADVANCE OF 
THIS SYSTEM...CLOUDS HAVE MOVED IN ACROSS THE AREA. A FEW SPRINKLES 
OR LIGHT RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE THIS EVENING...BUT MAIN MOISTURE AND 
LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH A WARM FRONT WILL REACH INTO THE AREA BETWEEN 
06Z AND 12Z...SPREADING MAINLY RAIN OVER THE MRX CWA. HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS...ESPECIALLY OVER NORTHEASTERN TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA WILL SEE A MIX OF RAIN...SNOW AND POSSIBLY BRIEFLY SLEET 
OVERNIGHT.  WITH WARM SOUTHWESTERN FLOW...UPSLOPE NOT A SIGNIFICANT 
FACTOR...SOME MINOR ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE MAINLY ABOVE 4000 TO 5000 
FEET OVER THE SMOKYS...ACCUMULATIONS OF LESS THAN TWO INCHES 
POSSIBLE OVER 2500 TO 3000 FEET OF ELEVATION IN THE NORTHEAST 
MOUNTAINS OF TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA.  WIDESPREAD PRECIP 
WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON SUNDAY WITH WARM 
ADVECTION CONTINUING...THE WARMING TEMPERATURES WILL CHANGE PRECIP 
TO ALL RAIN BY MID AFTERNOON.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...WARM FRONT SHOULD BE 
LOCATED ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA BY SUNDAY EVENING. 
TEMPS WILL REMAIN STEADY OR SLOWLY RISE ON SUNDAY NIGHT OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA...AS SOUTHWERLY WINDS ADVECT WARM AND MOIST AIR BEHIND 
THIS WARM FRONT. MODELS CONTINUE TO REVEAL SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH SURFACE-BASED 
INSTABILITY DEVELOPING BY MONDAY MORNING. THUS...WILL CONTINUE A 
MENTION OF THUNDER FOR SUNDAY NIGHT (MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT) AND 
MONDAY MORNING...AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE MISSISSIPPI AND 
LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEYS. THIS COLD FRONT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY ON MONDAY...WITH DRIER 
AND COOLER AIR MOVING INTO THE AREA BY MONDAY AFTERNOON AND MONDAY 
NIGHT. 

BY TUESDAY...THIS COLD FRONT BEGINS TO STALL-OUT OVER THE DEEP 
SOUTH...BUT ITS EXACT LOCATION BECOMES PROBLEMATIC. EXTENDED MODELS 
CONTINUE TO REVEAL LARGE DISCREPANCIES WITH THE GFS MODEL CONTINUING 
TO INDICATE A MORE SOUTHERLY FRONTAL LOCATION THAN THE OTHER 
EXTENDED MODELS. THUS...THE GFS MODEL SOLUTION INDICATES THAT PRECIP 
WILL BE SUPPRESSED FURTHER SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA THAN THE 
ETA...ECMWF...CANADIAN AND UKMET MODELS AS WELL AS THE ENSEMBLE 
MEANS. ITS HARD TO IGNORE THE GFS MODEL SOLUTION...SINCE ITS HAS 
BEEN CONSISTENT FOR SEVERAL RUNS NOW. HOWEVER...THE OTHER MODEL 
SOLUTIONS CONTINUE TO INSIST THAT THE STATIONARY FRONT WILL BE 
FARTHER NORTH WITH AN ACTIVE SOUTHERN JET STREAM BRINGING MOISTURE 
INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY. AT THIS POINT...IT SEEMS A COMPROMISE IS 
THE BEST SOLUTION AND WILL KEEP LOW POPS IN THE FORECAST ACROSS MOST 
OF THE AREA TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
DEEP SOUTH NEARS THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY...WITH RAIN CHANCES 
INCREASING SLIGHTLY AS IT SPREADS SOME MOISTURE NORTHWARD. DRY 
WEATHER SHOULD RETURN IN THE WAKE OF THIS SYSTEM FOR FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...QUIET WEATHER PATTERN IN PLACE 
FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT REMAINS IN PLACE OVER 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TONIGHT WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
DOMINATING AREA WEATHER.  A DRY AND COOL AIR MASS IS POSITIONED OVER 
THE AREA PROVIDING CONTINUED DRY AND SLIGHTLY COOL CONDITIONS.  WEAK 
COLD ADVECTION BEGINS TO MODERATE BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON WITH 850 MB 
TEMPS WARMING A COUPLE OF DEGREES. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL 
MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH MAINLY JUST AN 
INCREASE IN CLOUDS EXPECTED SINCE MOISTURE SHOULD BE LIMITED ALONG 
WITH WEAK UPPER DYNAMICS. THIS FRONT IS PROGGED TO STALL-OUT JUST 
SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY...AND THEN MOVE NORTH AS A 
WARM FRONT LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. A DEVELOPING LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS WILL HELP TO STRENGTHEN THE 
SOUTHERLY FLOW AND RESULTING ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
ON SUNDAY...PRODUCING AREAS OF RAIN. RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS THAT MOST 
AREAS WILL REMAIN ABOVE FREEZING AROUND SUNRISE SUNDAY MORNING...BUT 
SOME POCKETS OF FREEZING TEMPS COULD BE LINGERING ACROSS THE VALLEYS 
OF EXTREME NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA...SO WILL MENTION THE 
POSSIBILITY OF BRIEF FREEZING RAIN OR SLEET AS RAIN MOVES INTO THESE 
AREAS SUNDAY MORNING. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN INDICATES THAT SOME 
MARGINAL INSTABILITY WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON 
MONDAY...AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT APPROACHING FROM THE MID MISSISSIPPI 
AND LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEYS. THUS...WILL ADD A MENTION OF THUNDER 
FOR MONDAY FOR THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS EVEN 
INDICATE SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY ON SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL LEAVE 
THUNDER OUT OF SUNDAY NIGHTS FORECAST FOR NOW SINCE UPPER DYNAMICS 
LOOK TO BE WEAK. 

BY TUESDAY...EXTENDED RANGE MODELS BEGIN TO DIVERGE QUITE A BIT WITH 
THE GFS MODEL INDICATING HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA...WHILE THE ECMWF MODEL INDICATES THAT THE COLD FRONT WILL 
BECOME STATIONARY OVER THE FORECAST AREA AS ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM DEVELOPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THE ECMWF SOLUTION IS 
THE PREFERRED SOLUTION FOR THIS TIME FRAME...SINCE IT IS SUPPORTED 
MORE BY THE ENSEMBLE MEANS. THUS...WILL KEEP A MENTION A RAIN IN THE 
FORECAST ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...BUT WILL ONLY MENTION A SLIGHT 
CHANCE DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...S/W MOVING THROUGH TODAY WILL 
HAVE SOME ASSOCIATED MID TO UPPER LEVEL CLOUDINESS.  A RE-ENFORCING 
SHOT OF COOL AIR WILL DROP TEMPS A COUPLE OF DEGREES BUT STILL VERY 
PLEASANT CONSIDERING THE SEASON.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MINOR CHANGES MADE FOR 
FRIDAY INTO SUNDAY MORNING...AND SOME PRELIMINARY NEW DAY 7 
(THURSDAY) GRIDS WERE CREATED.  CHANGES FOR FRIDAY WERE TO SLIGHTLY 
INCREASE CLOUD COVER...GIVEN THE COLD AIR ADVECTION AND A SLIGHT

LATEST GFS AND DGEX MODEL RUNS DELAY THE ONSET OF PCPN FOR SATURDAY

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE 
APPALACHIANS...WITH COLDER AND DRIER AIR CONTINUING TO FLOW INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA ON NORTHWEST WINDS. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
INDICATING ENOUGH MOISTURE TO PRODUCE A FEW SCATTERED FLURRIES 
ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST VA TONIGHT...AS AN UPPER TROUGH 
DEEPENS OVER THE REGION. OTHERWISE...HIGH PRESSURE EXPECTED TO 
CONTINUE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH FRIDAY. ANOTHER WEAK COLD 
FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA BY FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL ONLY 
MENTION AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS AT THIS TIME SINCE MOISTURE APPEARS TO 
BE LIMITED. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS GUIDANCE VALUES APPEAR REASONABLE 
WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPS EXPECTED THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COLD FRONT STILL POISED TO MOVE 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BETWEEN 12Z AND 15Z TODAY. MODEL TIME 
HEIGHTS DEPICT MOISTURE CONFINED MAINLY BELOW 700 MB. THIS PLUS THE 
EXPECTED RAPID PROGRESSION OF FRONT SUGGESTS ONLY LIGHT QPF WILL BE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT. MODELS AND ENSEMBLES GENERALLY AGREE 
THAT PRECIP WILL HAVE ENDED IN ALL BUT THE EASTERN-MOST PORTION OF 
THE FORECAST AREA BY 21Z. HEIGHTS SLOWLY FALL BEHIND THIS SYSTEM AS 
UPPER TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE EASTERN CONUS. TIME HEIGHTS SHOW 
MOISTURE LINGERS IN THE MID LEVELS BEHIND FRONT...SO NOT 
ANTICIPATING SIGNIFICANT CLEARING THROUGH THE FIRST TWO PERIODS. 
BASED ON THIS EXPECTED CLOUD COVER...TENDED TO FAVOR COOLER GUIDANCE 
TEMPS IN THE FIRST PERIOD AND THE WARMER GUIDANCE TEMPS IN THE 
SECOND PERIOD.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...VERY LITTLE CHANGES MADE 
IN THE LONG TERM FOR NOW...ALTHO DAY SHIFT MAY NEED TO REALLY 
CONSIDER DROPPING PCPN CHANCES ON SATURDAY TO LESS THAN 15 PERCENT...
AS BOTH THE DGEX AND GFS NOW SHOW 500 MB HEIGHTS RISING PLUS SURFACE 
RIDGING DOMINANT OVER THE SE STATES DURING THE DAYTIME HOURS 
SATURDAY.  UNTIL THEN...THE UPPER FLOW STAYS W TO NW AND KEEPS SOME 
AMOUNT OF MID/HI LEVEL CLOUDINESS PLUS LINGERING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
AS WELL.  THUS...CANT GO ANY BETTER THAN PARTLY CLOUDY FOR THURSDAY 
THRU FRIDAY NIGHT.  HAD TIME TO ADD SOME PRELIMINARY GRIDS FOR THE 
NEW DAY SEVEN (WEDNESDAY)...AND DAYSHIFT CAN FINE TUNE THEM SOME.  

FOR TEMPS...DECENT AMOUNT OF COLD AIR ADVECTION LINGERS INTO EARLY

.DISCUSSION...
LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS COLD FRONT FROM EXTREME NORTHERN OHIO TO
CENTRAL INDIANA...SOUTH-CENTRAL ILLINOIS TO SOUTHERN MISSOURI.  A WEAK
WAVE OF LOW PRESSURE IS OVER SOUTHEAST MISSOURI. A FEW LIGHTNING STRIKES
HAVE BEEN NOTED OVER SOUTHEAST MISSOURI THIS EVENING...BUT HAVE FADED
LATELY. LATEST MESO-ETA AND GFS CONTINUED TO SHOW FRONT MOVING 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BY AROUND DAYBREAK WEDNESDAY WITH SCATTERED-
BROKEN SHOWERS DEVELOPING ALONG AND JUST BEHIND FROPA.  ALL IS COVERED
WELL BY CURRENT FORECAST.

MAIN CONCERN FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD IS POTENTIAL OF LOCALIZED DENSE
FOG. GROUND REMAINS FAIRLY WET AND TEMPERATURE/DEWPOINT SPREAD IS 
NARROWING. HOWEVER...SATELITTE SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF HIGH/MID LEVEL
CLOUDS DEVELOPING OVER MID AND EAST TENNESSEE WHICH WILL LIMIT TO A
CERTAIN DEGREE THE RADIATIONAL COOLING. LATEST MESO-ETA DOES SHOW HIGH
SURFACE RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOR CHA AND TYS AREAS OVERNIGHT...SO WILL 
INCLUDE PATCHY DENSE FOG...BUT HIGH/MID LEVEL CLOUDS SHOULD LIMIT 
COVERAGE SOME.

HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

425 AM EST MON FEB 14 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RAIN CONTINUES THIS MORNING 
ACROSS THE BULK OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH LEAST COVERAGE FROM NEAR 
MRX NE TO TRI DUE TO DOWNSLOPING.  THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS IS 
NEARING THE MISS RIVER WITH SIGNIFICANT AREA OF RAIN EXTENDING WEST 
TO A MSL (AL) TO BNA (TN) LINE.  DEWPOINT TEMPS ARE AS HIGH AS THE 
MID 50S ACROSS W TN JUST AHEAD OF THE WEAK COLD FRONT/SFC 
TROUGH...BUT ONLY IN THE UPPER 30S TO MID/UPR 40S ACROSS OUR 
FORECAST AREA. THUS...INSTABILITY IS QUITE LACKING TODAY SO JUST 
SHOWERS FOR US AS BEST INSTABILITY STAYS SOUTH ACROSS THE GULF COAST 
STATES.

MAIN CHANGES TO TODAYS WX/POP GRIDS WAS TO SPEED UP THE END OF THE 
SHOWERS A BIT SOONER...WITH THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS PASSING TO OUR 
EAST BETWEEN 18Z AND 00Z.  ENDED UP WITH SOME SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE 
POPS EARLY THIS EVENING...TO MESH WITH NEIGHBORS GRIDS AND IN CASE 
THE SLOWER GFS MODEL IS MORE CORRECT.  INTRODUCED SOME AREAS OF FOG 
LATE TONIGHT DUE TO WET GROUND AND MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER.  HOWEVER...
DID NOT MENTION DENSE FOG YET...BECAUSE OF 1) UNFAVORABLE WESTERLY 
WINDS AND 2) UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW MUCH SKIES ACTUALLY CLEAR.  THE 
SURFACE RIDGE AXIS DOES BUILD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH HIGH LOW 
LEVEL RH...SO THE AMOUNT OF CLEARING AND HOW MUCH WINDS DECOUPLE 
WILL BE IMPORTANT FACTORS.  

OTHERWISE...STAYED QUITE CLOSE TO THE MAV/GFS MOS FOR HIGHS TODAY...
THEN A BIT CLOSER TO THE BLEND NUMBERS FOR MINS TONIGHT...SINCE NOT 
MUCH COLD AIR ADVECTION IF ANY IS EXPECTED BEHIND THE FRONT.   

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...COLD FRONT MONDAY WILL  
ACTUALLY HAVE A WARMING EFFECT WITH DRIER AIR AND NO COLD AIR 
ADVECTION BEHIND IT. RAISED TEMPERATURES A FEW MORE DEGREES TO GO 
ALONG WITH THE LATEST MAV GUIDANCE. FAST ZONAL FLOW WILL MOVE 
SURFACE HIGH QUICKLY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY. INCREASING 
SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL WARM TEMPERATURES 10 TO POSSIBLY 15 DEGREES 
ABOVE TODAYS TEMPERATURES. NEXT SHORTWAVE DIVES SOUTH TOWARD THE 
REGION TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. ETA SHOWS SOME INSTABILITY WITH 
LIS UP TO -3 AND CAPES TO ABOUT 1000 J/KG. STRONG LOW LEVEL JET 
BRINGS SOUTHWEST WINDS OF 30 TO 35 KNOTS OVERHEAD WEDNESDAY. HAVE 
INCREASED RAIN CHANCES TO ABOUT 50 PERCENT WEDNESDAY. DID NOT 
INCLUDE THUNDER FOR WEDNESDAY YET. I FOLLOWED THE COOLER MAV 
GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS. IF ETA IS RIGHT AND TEMPERATURES WARM TO THE 60S 
ISOLATED STORMS ARE NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION. COLDER AIRMASS RETURNS 
THURSDAY AS UPPER TROUGH OVER EASTERN CANADA DIGS SOUTH. HIGH 
TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY STAY IN THE 40S THURSDAY BUT SUNSHINE WILL 
BE ABUNDANT. NEXT SYSTEM MOVES OUT OF THE ROCKIES INTO THE PLAINS 
FRIDAY AND THEN THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR THE WEEKEND. TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE ON A WARMING TREND NEXT WEEKEND WITH RAIN DEVELOPING BY 
SATURDAY.

415 AM EST SUN FEB 13 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AREA OF LIGHT RAIN SLOWLY 
WORKING EAST THIS MORNING...JUST ABOUT IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS TIMING 
IN THE GRIDS.  DID CHANGE BACK TO STRATIFORM AS PCPN TYPE FOR BOTH 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...SINCE MAIN AREAS OF INSTABILITY LOOK TO BE THE 
LOWER MISS VALLEY AND GULF COAST REGIONS FOR THESE PERIODS.  ALSO 
...NOTED THAT SPC HAS REMOVED OUR FORECAST AREA FROM THE DAY ONE 
CONVECTIVE OUTLOOK (NOT IN GENERAL THUNDER).  500 MB TEMPS COOL A 
BIT MORE ON MONDAY...AND AS THE COLD FRONT DRAWS CLOSER...THE PCPN 
TYPE SHOULD BE MORE SHOWERY AT THAT TIME.  

ETA MODEL SUGGESTS A POSSIBLE BREAK IN THE RAIN LATER TODAY OR 
EVENING...BUT THE GFS DOES NOT.  CONSIDERED INDICATING THIS IN THE 
POP/WX GRIDS...BUT WITH ALL MOS POPS SO HIGH FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT I 
DID NOT WANT TO DRIFT TOO FAR BELOW MOS.  FOR THIS REASON AND TO 
BETTER MESH WITH NEIGHBORS GRIDS...THE POP GRIDS FOR NE TN AND SWRN 
VA WERE RAISED SLIGHTLY INTO THE LOWER END OF CATEGORICAL LATER 
TODAY.  

OTHERWISE...TEMPS TRICKY FOR TODAY GIVEN THE MUCH BELOW MOS VALUES 
FOR CURRENT 06-07Z TEMPS DUE TO THIN HIGH CLOUDS AND VERY LIGHT 
WINDS.  ADJUSTED THE 07Z TEMP GRIDS DOWN TO MATCH REALITY IN MOST 
LOCATIONS...THEN ALLOWED FOR WARMING INTO THE 45 TO 55 DEGREE THIS 
AFTERNOON.  MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT WERE QUITE CLOSE AND ACCEPTED.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...COLD FRONT LIES OVER LOWER 
OHIO VALLEY AND WEST TN MONDAY MORNING WITH ETA MODEL INDICATING 
STRONGEST LIFT OVER AL AND GA AND NORTH OF FORECAST AREA.  MODELS 
HAVE SPEEDED THE MOVEMENT UP OF THE FRONT AND TROUGH.  THE FRONT 
MOVES QUICKLY EAST DURING THE DAY AND ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING.  GOOD SOUTHWEST FLOW AHEAD 
OF THE FRONT WILL KEEP IT BREEZY IN THE MOUNTAINS BUT NOT HIGH 
ENOUGH FOR AN ADVISORY.  HAVE ENDED PRECIPITATION A LITTLE EARLIER 
THAN LAST FORECAST PACKAGE BUT WILL FOLLOW THE GFS MODELS SLOWER 
ENDING THE PRECIPITATION AROUND 15/06Z.  UPPER TROUGH WEAKENS AS IT 
MOVES EAST AND WITH NO COLD AIR ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT AND ZONAL 
FLOW AND SUNSHINE HAD TO RAISE HIGHS SEVERAL DEGREES TUESDAY. 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY SHORTWAVE MOVES SOUTHEAST FROM THE 
GREAT LAKES AND DROPS A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. 
TEMPERATURES WILL DROP DOWN TO BELOW NORMAL ONCE AGAIN AS RIDGING 
ALOFT RETURNS TO THE WESTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY.  PATTERN BEGINS TO 
CHANGE ONCE AGAIN FOR THE WEEKEND AS SOUTHWEST FLOW BRINGS MOISTURE 
WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN AND WARMER TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE REGION.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE RIDGE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING HAS RESULTED IN VERY LIGHT WINDS...EVEN 
IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS BASED ON LIMITED OBSERVATIONS TO CHECK.  
WIND GRIDS WERE FRESHENED WITH MAV MOS WINDS...ALTHOUGH HIGHEST 
ELEVATIONS ALONG THE TN-NC LINE WERE NUDGED UP INTO THE 10 TO 20 MPH 
RANGE FOR LATER THIS MORNING INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON.  

THE UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD EASTWARD FROM THE PLAINS STATES TODAY 
WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE ON TAP...PLUS ALREADY SOME WEAK WARM AIR 
ADVECTION UNDERWAY AS THE 850 MB THERMAL TROUGH HAS PUSHED OFF TO 
OUR EAST.  OVERALL LITTLE DIFFERENCE FROM MOS CHOICES FOR MAX TEMPS 
FOR TODAY...AND I GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO THE MAV MOS.

FOR TONIGHT...CLOUDS INCREASE AFTER MIDNIGHT AS SHORTWAVE ENERGY 
MOVES ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS...BUT THE THREAT OF MEASURABLE PCPN 
SEEMS LIMITED TO MAINLY SE TN AREAS VERY LATE (09Z TO 11Z PERIOD).  
MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A GRADUAL SATURATION AND LITTLE THREAT 
OF ANY SIGNIFICANT PCPN FOR NE TN AND ESPECIALLY SWRN VA AREAS UNTIL 
WELL AFTER 12Z SUNDAY.  PCPN TYPE WILL BE LIGHT RAIN WITH MIN TEMPS 
NOT EXPECTED BELOW MID 30S ANYWHERE...DUE TO WARM AIR ADVECTION AND 
INCREASING CLOUDS.  SLIGHTLY MILDER MAV MOS MINS LOOKED THE BEST.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...RAIN MOVING IN MUCH FASTER 
SUNDAY THAN MODELS INDICATED 24 HOURS AGO AND HAVE ADJUSTED HIGH 
TEMPERATURES DOWN A FEW DEGREES BASED ON CLOUDS AND RAIN. ETA PLACES 
COLD FRONT TO THE MS RIVER WITH SYSTEM MONDAY EVENING WITH SURFACE 
LOW OVER OHIO. GFS ABOUT 6 HOURS SLOWER THAN THE ETA WITH FRONT 
THROUGH REGION BY EARLY EVENING MONDAY. PREFER THE SLOWER GFS SO 
DID NOT DROP POPS OFF UNTIL LATER MONDAY NIGHT. TOTAL RAINFALL 
AMOUNTS SUNDAY AND MONDAY COULD REACH ONE TO ONE AND A HALF INCHES 
WITH THE HEAVIEST RAIN IN SE TN AND SW NC. QUICK MOVING SYSTEM IS 
QUICK ON ITS HEELS TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT AS FLOW BECOMES ZONAL. 
THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE MUCH MOISTURE BUT WITH COLDER AIR MOVING 
IN BY EARLY WEDNESDAY COULD PRODUCE A LITTLE SNOW ESPECIALLY IN THE 
MOUNTAINS. WEDNESDAY TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER EASTERN STATES AND A 
SHORTWAVE ROTATES ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY

FLURRIES ENDING THIS MORNING AND A DECREASE IN CLOUDS...EXCEPT FOR 
THE UPSTREAM SHORTWAVE (NOW PASSING ACROSS WRN GREAT LAKES AN NRN 
IL).  THIS FEATURE BRUSHES AT LEAST THE NRN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA EARLY THIS AFTERNOON...SO THE SKY GRIDS WERE SLIGHTLY INCREASED 
FOR TODAY.  ALSO...PROLONGED THE FLURRIES FOR SW VA AND NE TN UP TO 
17Z GRID.  W-NW WINDS MAY BE ON THE BRISK SIDE THIS AFTERNOON AS THE 
SHORTWAVE PASSES...AND THE WIND GRIDS ALREADY RELFECT THIS.  

OTHERWISE...CLEARING OR DECREASING CLOUDS TONIGHT WITH ONLY SLIGHT

PERSISTED ACROSS MOST OF MRX CWA TODAY. ROAD SURFACES AND AIR TEMPS
REMAINED SLIGHTLY ABOVE FREEZING NEGATING ACCUMULATIONS IN MOST
LOCATIONS. IMPULSE FM NW WILL ENHANCE THE SHOWERS THIS EVENING

FAVORABLE UPSLOPE RIDGES. VWP PLOT PROGRAM SHOWS SURROUNDING 
ELEVATED WINDS AROUND 25 KTS. LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ACCELERATING NE 
OFF THE NE US CST TNGT. EXPECT BRISK NW WINDS NE AND MNT AREAS BUT 
SHOULD REMAIN BELOW WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA. NEXT SHORTWAVE DIVING SE

PUSHING IN TODAY.  850MB TEMPS WILL DROP TO AROUND MINUS 10 DEGREES 
C BY THIS AFTERNOON.  MAIN LIFT HAS EXITED THE AREA BUT EXPECT A FEW 
ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE MRX THIS MORNING.  GOOD UPSLOPE CONDITIONS 
DEVELOPING IN NORTHWESTERLY FLOW.  THIS COMBINED WITH LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE AND WEAK DYNAMICS WILL PRODUCE LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OVER MUCH 
OF THE EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF

THIS FEATURES DRAGS COLD FRONT WITH IT AND DEEPENS LOW PRESSURE AREA
THAT MOVES ACROSS VIRGINIA. GOOD LIFT PROVIDED ALONG FRONTAL BOUNDARY
SO POP VALUES REMAIN HIGH TONIGHT ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS NOT 
EXPECTED. RAIN WILL MIX WITH AND CHANGE TO SNOW AFTER MIDNIGHT 
ACROSS HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND BECOME NEARLY ALL SNOW BY DAYBREAK. 
MOST VALLEY SURFACES WILL BE TOO WARM FOR ACCUMULATIONS BUT 
MEASURABLE SNOW LIKELY ACROSS HIGHER ELEVATIONS. JET MAX SLIDES SE 
OF E TN TONIGHT WITH DRYING IN THE MID LAYERS. LOW PRESSURE TO THE 
NE CONTINUES TO DEEPEN RESULTING IN BRISK NW WINDS THU. MORNING SNOW 
SHOWERS AND FLURRIES DECREASING ACROSS SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEYS 
BY AFTN. ACCUMULATING...MAINLY UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWERS CONTINUE INTO

SUFFICIENT TO UNDERCUT MOS TEMPS. ANOTHER FAIRLY STRONG SHORT WAVE 
DIGS DOWN INTO AREA ON FRIDAY BUT WITH LIMITED MOISTURE BUT BRIEFLY 
BRINGING ADDITIONAL CAA FRI NGT. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS AND 
ENSEMBLES ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH OVERALL UPPER AIR 
FLOW IN RELATIVELY PROGRESSIVE PATTERN. SOME DIFFERENCES STILL EXIST 
IN TIMING INDIVIDUAL EVENTS. GFS STILL THE FASTEST WITH THE SUNDAY 
EVENT. WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD OFF MENTIONING POPS UNTIL AFTER 12Z 
SUNDAY...BUT SOME UNCERTAINTY STILL LINGERS. APPEARS UPSLOPE FLOW 
COULD AGAIN OCCUR LATE MONDAY AND TUESDAY AFTER PASSAGE OF SURFACE 
FRONT. HOWEVER...TEMPS WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY MILD KEEPING MOST OF 
PRECIP AS RAIN. UNCERTAINTY LINGERS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT OVER WESTERN MIDDLE TN...WITH LOCAL 
RADARS REVEALING ONLY PATCHY LIGHT DRIZZLE OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
WITH AN ABSENCE OF STRONG FORCING MECHANISMS EXPECTED TONIGHT... 
THINK THAT ONLY ISOLATED LIGHT SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE. AREAS OF 
FOG WILL LIKELY DEVELOP OVERNIGHT WITH PLENTY OF BOUNDARY LAYER 
MOISTURE IN PLACE...BUT WILL NOT MENTION DENSE FOG SINCE CLOUD COVER 
SHOULD HELP TO KEEP VISIBILITIES FROM DROPPING TOO MUCH. THIS FRONT 
WILL FINALLY MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AROUND NOON TOMORROW... 
AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEEPENS ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. THIS 
UPPER TROUGH SHOULD TRIGGER ADDITIONAL POST-FRONTAL SHOWERS IN THE 
AFTERNOON...BUT RAINFALL AMOUNTS LOOK TO REMAIN ON THE LIGHT SIDE.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MOISTURE WRAPPING 
AROUND AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH AND GOOD UPSLOPE FLOW SHOULD INDUCE 
SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN...THROUGH 
THURSDAY NIGHT. TEMPS WILL BE WELL BELOW CLIMO ON THURSDAY. UPPER 
TROUGH AXIS SWINGS THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS EARLY FRIDAY 
WHICH SHOULD EFFECTIVELY CUT OFF UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWER EVENT. SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN DURING THE DAY ON FRIDAY AND TEMPS MODERATE 
BUT WILL REMAIN SOMEWHAT BELOW CLIMO. GENERALLY BENIGN WEATHER WILL 
PERSIST INTO MUCH OF THE WEEKEND.

FURTHER OUT...FAIRLY MAJOR MODEL DIFFERENCES APPARENT IN THE TIMING 
OF THE NEXT EVENT LATE IN THE UPCOMING WEEKEND. GFS IS SIGNIFICANTLY 
FASTER THAN DGEX IN BRINGING PRECIP INTO OUR FORECAST AREA. VARIOUS 
MODEL ENSEMBLES DO NOT HELP APPRECIABLY IN FORMING A CONSENSUS FOR 
THIS TIMING. THEREFORE...HAVE GENERALLY CONTINUED PREVIOUS TIMING 
AND KEPT ALL AREAS DRY UNTIL AFTER 12Z SUNDAY. DEPENDING ON FUTURE 
MODEL RUNS...THIS SCENARIO IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE HOWEVER. PRECIP 
LOOKS TO BE ALL LIQUID AT THIS TIME AS TEMPS RISE TO NEAR CLIMO BY 
ONSET OF PRECIP. TEMPS ARE PROJECTED TO RISE TO ABOVE CLIMO EARLY 
NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
AN ELONGATED AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD...WITH A COLD FRONT OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND 
SOUTHERN PLAINS. A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT 
CONTINUES TO SLOWLY MOVE EAST ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND CENTRAL KY THIS 
AFTERNOON. THESE SHOWERS SHOULD MOVE EAST INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS EVENING...BEFORE GRADUALLY DIMINISHING IN AREAL COVERAGE AFTER 
MIDNIGHT AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL. AS A RESULT OF 
THE ZONAL FLOW ALOFT...THE COLD FRONT WILL ALSO STALL-OUT OVER 
MIDDLE TN ON TUESDAY...WITH MILD CONDITIONS CONTINUING ACROSS THE 
REGION.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...GFS AND NAM (ETA) 
DISAGREE QUITE A BIT ON SIGNIFICANCE OF WEDNESDAYS EVENT IN A 
RELATIVELY PROGRESSIVE UPPER AIR FLOW PATTERN REGIME. BOTH SHOW 
HEIGHTS CONTINUING TO FALL AS TROUGH BEGINS TO DIG INTO THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION. THE NAM PROJECTS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER GUIDANCE POPS 
THAN GFS GUIDANCE. THE SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLES FAVOR THE NAM SOLUTION 
WHILE THE CANADIAN GEM GENERALLY SUPPORTS THE GFS. DUE TO 
UNCERTAINTY...HAVE MAINTAINED CHANCE POPS FOR ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. 
PRECIP TAPERS OFF WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS SURFACE COLD FRONT PUSHES EAST 
OF THE APPALACHIANS. SNOW SHOWERS WILL LIKELY LINGER IN THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN WITH GOOD UPSLOPE FLOW HOWEVER. SPRAWLING SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE THEN BUILDS IN THROUGH THE BALANCE OF THE WORK WEEK AND 
INTO MUCH OF THE WEEKEND. NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES LATE IN THE 
WEEKEND. TEMPS WILL FALL TO BELOW CLIMO AFTER PASSAGE OF COLD FRONT 
ON WEDNESDAY AND SLOWLY MODERATE TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE CLIMO BY EARLY 
NEXT WEEK AS SURFACE HIGH MOVES EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA.

ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH A FEW FLURRIES OR DRIZZLE OCCURRING 
MAINLY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. VISIBLE SATELLITE PICTURES SHOWING 
A BREAKUP OF CLOUDS BEGINNING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA AND ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS. UPPER TROUGH 
IS MOVING THROUGH THE APPALACHIANS NOW AND THERE MAY BE A FEW SPITS 
OF RAIN OR SNOW EARLY. OTHERWISE HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AND FRIDAY. GFS IS A LITTLE 
FASTER WITH MOVING LOW CLOUD DECK TONIGHT THAN ETA WITH BOTH MODELS 
SHOWING NO CLOUDS BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON. FOLLOWING MORE PESSIMISTIC 
ETA WITH DECREASE OF CLOUDS TONIGHT AND FRIDAY. FOLLOWED MAV 
GUIDANCE FRIDAY FOR HIGHS BUT SLIGHTLY ABOVE MAV NUMBERS TONIGHT 
BECAUSE OF LINGERING CLOUDS.   

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS
AGREE WITH BUILDING A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT RIDGE OVER THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. SOME CI/CS
ANTICIPATED TO MOVE INTO THE REGION BY SUNDAY AS THE RIDGE AXIS MOVES
EAST OF THE AREA...BUT OVERALL A CLEAR SKY FORECAST.

THE ECMWF SEEMS TO BE THE MODEL OF CHOICE AGAIN TODAY WITH BEST
TELECONNECTIONS AND CONSISTENCY.  WILL BASE NEXT WEEKS FORECAST MAINLY
OFF THE ECMWF MODEL WHICH DEVELOPS A FAIRLY DEEP TROUGH OVER THE MID-
SECTION OF THE NATION FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. THICKNESS AND 850 TEMPERATURES
WARM SIGNIFICANTLY WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES ANTICIPATED. ISENTROPIC
LIFT INCREASES MONDAY AND TUESDAY WITH FROPA ANTICIPATED FOR LATE

CURRENT RADARS INDICATING LIGHT PRECIPITATION ACROSS NORTHEAST TN 
AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER TO MID 30S. 
THE LOWER ELEVATIONS ARE REPORTING LIGHT RAIN BUT HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
MAY BE GETTING FREEZING RAIN OR SNOW. REPORTS FROM THE SMOKY 
MOUNTAINS ARE OF FREEZING RAIN AT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. FREEZING 
LEVELS SHOWN ON PROGGED SOUNDINGS WERE FROM 3000 TO 3500 FEET FOR NE 
TN AND SW VA AND EXPECTED TO DROP TO 3500 TO 4000 FEET IN THE 
SMOKIES BY THIS AFTERNOON AS UPPER TROUGH OVER THE OHIO VALLEY MOVES 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST BY 18Z 
AND THIS SHOULD CHANGE THE PRECIPITATION TO SNOW AT THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. THE MOISTURE LOOKS TO MOVE OUT BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN INVERTED TROUGH OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA...WITH AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE 
COAST. LIGHT RAIN CONTINUES ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA...AND IS QUICKLY EXITING THE AREA. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE 
UPPER TROUGH OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL PUSH MOST OF THIS MOISTURE 
OUT OF THE REGION LATE THIS AFTERNOON. THUS...WILL PLAN TO LOWER 
POPS QUICKER TODAY WITH CLEARING OF THE CLOUD COVER FINALLY EXPECTED 
BY FRIDAY. WILL CONTINUE THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY TODAY FOR THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA AND EAST TN...BUT WILL CHANGE THE 
EXPIRATION TIME TO 4 PM TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FASTER MOISTURE EXIT. 
HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY SNOW REPORTS YET...BUT WITH THE UPPER TROUGH 
AND ITS COLDER AIR ALOFT YET TO SWING ACROSS THE AREA...THINK SNOW 
AND SOME FREEZING RAIN SHOULD STILL DEVELOP IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
ABOVE 2500 FEET THIS MORNING. 

OTHERWISE...LOOKS LIKE A TRANQUIL WEATHER PATTERN FOR THE WEEKEND 
WITH A GRADUAL WARMING TREND. ANOTHER FRONT IS PROGGED TO BRING THE 
NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN BY SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...WITH UNSETTLED 
WEATHER POSSIBLE FOR MOST OF NEXT WEEK. THE GOOD NEWS IS MODEL 
SOUNDINGS AND THICKNESS VALUES INDICATE THAT PRECIP NEXT WEEK SHOULD 
BE ALL RAIN.

ACROSS THE REGION TONIGHT AND THURSDAY.  ASSOCIATED MOISTURE IS QUITE 
DEEP...THOUGH LIFT IS SOMEWHAT WEAK.  IN RESPONSE...WIDESPREAD BANDS 
OF PRECIP WILL CONTINUE TO DRIFT ACROSS THE MRX CWA TONIGHT.  VALLEY 
TEMPS WILL REMAIN ABOVE FREEZING FOR MAINLY RAIN.  HOWEVER...HIGHER 
ELEVATION TEMPS WILL FALL TO AROUND FREEZING WITH RAIN CHANGING TO 
SNOW OVERNIGHT.  SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OF 1 TO 4 INCHES ARE 
POSSIBLE...MAINLY ABOVE 2500 FEET BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON.  
THEREFORE...A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY WILL BE ISSUED OVER THE EAST 
TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS FROM THE SMOKY MOUNTAIN NP NORTHWARD AND THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA.  RAIN AND SNOW WILL BECOME 
SCATTERED THURSDAY AFTERNOON WITH A FEW LINGERING AREAS OF PRECIP 
CONTINUING GENERALLY OVER EASTERN ZONES THROUGH THE END OF THE DAY. 

...LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HAVE GENERALLY 
FOLLOWED THE ECMWF MODEL FOR THE MEDIUM RANGE...PER NCEP DISCUSSION.
MODELS SHOW WEAK RIDGING SETTING UP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE
WEEKEND ALLOWING FOR RETURN TO DRY CONDITIONS AND MILD TEMPERATURES.
SURFACE RIDGE MOVES EAST OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS MONDAY WITH 
UPPER FLOW BECOMING MORE SOUTHWEST EARLY NEXT WEEK AS A UPPER TROUGH
BECOMES ESTABLISHED OVER THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES.  THIS SETS THE
STAGE FOR INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT THROUGH MID-WEEK WITH A SERIES
OF SHORT-WAVES EJECTING NORTHEAST MOVING ACROSS THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY.  PERIODS OF RAIN IS ANTICIPATED...BUT TIMING OF BEST COVERAGE
IS A TOUGH CALL.  HAVE CALLED FOR CHANCE POPS BEGINNING MONDAY NIGHT
AND TUESDAY.  A STRONGER SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO AND

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS CONTINUES TO SHOW A WEAK INVERTED TROUGH 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
ALONG THE LOUISIANA GULF COAST. LIGHT RAIN SHOULD SLOWLY SPREAD 
NORTHEAST FROM THIS GULF LOW TODAY IN THE WARM SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. 
LOCAL RADARS INDICATE A LARGE AREA OF LIGHT RAIN ALREADY OVER 
NORTHERN AL THIS MORNING...WITH TEMPS REMAINING WELL ABOVE FREEZING 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN. MODELS APPEAR TO FINALLY BE COMING TOGETHER ON 
A SIMILAR SOLUTION FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW. THIS INCLUDES RAIN FOR 
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...WITH SNOW DEVELOPING AFTER 
MIDNIGHT TONIGHT ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST VA. MODELS 
INDICATE ONLY LIGHT PRECIP AMOUNTS TODAY WITH THE SURFACE LOW 
REMAINING OVER THE DEEP SOUTH. 

MOST PRECIP FOR THE FORECAST AREA IS EXPECTED AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT 
AND THURSDAY MORNING...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH SWINGS ACROSS THE 
REGION. THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL BRING COOLER TEMPS ALOFT WHICH SHOULD 
CHANGE THE RAIN OVER TO SNOW ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE BOUNDARY LAYER 
WILL REMAIN TOO WARM FOR SNOW ELSEWHERE. RIGHT NOW... EXPECT 
GENERALLY 1 TO 4 INCHES OF SNOW ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON. IN ADDITION TO THE 
SNOW...SOME FREEZING RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS LATE 
TONIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT BEFORE THE COMPLETE CHANGEOVER TO ALL SNOW. 
HOWEVER...THINK THAT ANY ICE ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE LIGHT AND OCCUR 
BRIEFLY TOWARDS SUNRISE. WITH ALL OF THIS IN MIND...WILL PLAN TO 
ISSUE A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT TO ADDRESS THE POSSIBILITY OF 
ADVISORY CRITERIA WINTER PRECIP IN THESE AREAS LATE TONIGHT INTO 
THURSDAY. 

SURE HOPE THE GROUNDHOGS DONT SEE THEIR SHADOWS TODAY...SINCE THIS 
FORECASTER IS TIRED OF WINTER.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
340 AM EST TUE FEB 1 2005

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING ACROSS MOST 
OF THE EASTERN U.S. WITH A WEAK TROUGH ACROSS THE WESTERN FOOTHILLS 
OF THE APPALACHIANS. RADARS INDICATE AREAS OF LIGHT DRIZZLE ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...WITH TEMPS REMAINING WELL ABOVE 
FREEZING IN THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S. THIS DRIZZLE SHOULD END BY 
SUNRISE AS ITS ASSOCIATED WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE EXITS THE 
REGION. SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL EXTENSIVE CLOUDINESS ACROSS MOST OF 
THE EASTERN U.S. AND WILL NOT TRY TO BE OPTIMISTIC WITH CLOUD 
COVER...SINCE THERE DOESNT APPEAR TO BE ANY SIGNIFICANT DRYING OF 
THE ATMOSPHERE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 

A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ALONG THE GULF COAST NEAR LOUISIANA 
WILL BEGIN TO INFLUENCE THE REGIONS WEATHER BY LATER TONIGHT. 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL ADVECT MOISTURE FROM THIS GULF SYSTEM 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...BUT EXPECT ONLY LIGHT 
RAIN WITH TEMPS REMAINING ABOVE FREEZING. GFS AND NAM/ETA MODELS 
CONTINUE TO BE IN DISAGREEMENT WITH THE TRACK OF THIS LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM BY WED NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. THE NAM/ETA MODEL REVEALS A MORE 
AMPLIFIED 500 MB TROUGH...WHICH RESULTS IN A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK OF 
THE SURFACE LOW THAN THE GFS MODEL. OTHER MODELS SUCH AS CANADIAN/ 
UKMET/ECMWF AND FSU SUPERENSEMBLES SUPPORT THE GFS SOLUTION OF A 
MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK OF THE SURFACE LOW...RESULTING IN LESS PRECIP 
FOR THE FORECAST AREA. THUS...EXPECT SOME PRECIP TO DEVELOP ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...BUT AT THIS TIME IT 
APPEARS THAT IT WILL BE MOSTLY RAIN WITH LIGHT AMOUNTS GENERALLY 
LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN INCH.

.SHORT TERM (MON NIGHT THROUGH WED NIGHT)...WEAK S/WV MOVS E ACROSS 
THE REGION TONIGHT. SYSTEM IS WEAK AND VORTICITY IS CHANNELED. 
HOWEVER DECIDED TO KEEP THE PREVIOUS FORECAST WORDING FOR 
POSSIBILITY OF SOME DRIZZLE OR FLURRIES. QUITE A BIT OF LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE IN STORE MUCH OF THE AREA AT LEAST THROUGH A GOOD PART OF 
THE MORNING TUE WITH SOME BREAKS TO REVEAL PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS 
BY AFTERNOON MAINLY CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY ZONES. DRY FORECAST 
HAD TO BE ADJUSTED TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN DRY FOR WED AND WED NIGHT 
AS GFS MODEL HAS TRENDED MUCH CLOSER TO THE NAM ALTHOUGH DIFFERENCES 
REMAIN AS USUAL WITH NAM BEING MORE AMPLIFIED WITH SRN PLAINS TROF 
AS IT PRESSES E INTO THE TN VLY. WITH GREATER AMPLIFICATION NAM 
BRINGS MORE WARM AIR NORTH INTO APPALACHIANS THAN GFS. WITH MORE 
CLOUDS EXPECTED THAN SUN THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS AND E TO NE LOW LVL 
FLO TEMPS WILL NOT BE QUITE WARM ENOUGH TO STAY AWAY FROM A THREAT 
FOR MIXED PRECIP OR PLAIN OLD SNOW BY LATE WED NIGHT AS ISENTROPIC 
LIFT INCREASES AHEAD OF STORM SYSTEM. WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR BETTER 
MODEL AGREEMENT TO GET INTO THE COMPLEXITY OF TRANSITIONING PRECIP 
TYPES IN LATER FORECAST ISSUANCES. STAYED CLOSE TO TEMP GUIDANCE 
BLEND FIRST THREE PERIODS AND WENT A LITTLE CLOSER TO GFS MAXES ON 
WED AS CLOUDS ADVANCE AHEAD OF SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...A RAIN AND SNOW MIX EXPECTED 
THURSDAY BECOMING MOSTLY RAIN IN THE VALLEYS BY AFTN. SCT SNOW 
SHOWERS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FRI MORNING AS HIGH PRESSURE AND COLD 
AIRMASS BUILDS IN FM THE NW. MODELS ARE NOT CONSISTENT OR IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT BUT ACCUMULATIONS LOOKING BETTER FOR THE MNTS. SOME 
SUNSHINE AND RETURN FLOW EXPECTED LATE WEEK EARLY WEEKEND. ANOTHER 
BOUT WITH PCPN EXPECTED LATE SUNDAY AS ANOTHER COLD FRONT APPROACHES

248 AM EST MON JAN 31 2005

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING ACROSS MOST OF THE EASTERN 
U.S. WITH AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDS COVERING MOST OF THE TN AND OH 
RIVER VALLEYS. SOME WESTWARD-MOVING CLEARING OF THE LOW CLOUDS FROM 
THE MID ATLANTIC REGION MAY MOVE INTO PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA AND 
EXTREME NORTHEAST TN THIS MORNING...BUT HIGH CLOUDS IN THE ZONAL 
FLOW ALOFT SHOULD HELP TO KEEP SKIES MOSTLY CLOUDY THROUGH TONIGHT 
EVERYWHERE. A WEAK SHORT WAVE IS PROGGED TO SWING ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...POSSIBLY GENERATING A FEW AREAS OF DRIZZLE 
THIS EVENING AND SNOW FLURRIES AFTER MIDNIGHT. AS FAR AS TEMPS ARE 
CONCERNED...WILL UNDERCUT GUIDANCE BY A FEW DEGREES TODAY WITH THE 
EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THRU SUNDAY)...OPERATIONAL MODELS AND SHORT 
RANGE ENSEMBLES GENERALLY AGREE THAT SOUTHERN STREAM WILL REMAIN 
ACTIVE THROUGH THE PERIOD...BUT ACTIVITY WILL MAINLY BE CONFINED TO 
GULF COAST. SOME UNCERTAINTY EXISTS FOR LATE WED/EARLY THU AS 
ETA/NAM PUSHES SOME OF THE SOUTHERN STREAM PRECIP ACTIVITY INTO OUR 
FORECAST AREA AS POSITIVELY-TILTED SHORT WAVE TROUGH APPROACHES. 
HOWEVER...BOTH THE GFS AND CANADIAN GEM KEEP THE PRECIP TO OUR 
SOUTH. POOR AGREEMENT AMONG GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS PROVIDES LITTLE 
HELP. DUE TO UNCERTAINTY...WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY FOR NOW. WEAK 
UPPER RIDGING IS PROJECTED TO BUILD BACK INTO THE REGION BY FRIDAY 
AND PERSIST THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THUS...ANTICIPATE SOME TEMPERATURE 
MODERATION DURING THAT TIME FRAME.

315 PM EST SUN JAN 30 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THRU MONDAY NIGHT)...WEATHER FINALLY TAKING A 
TURN FOR THE BETTER THIS AFTERNOON...ALTHOUGH OVERCAST CLOUD DECK 
HAS ONLY GRADUALLY LIFTED WITH JUST SOME DECENT BREAKS ACROSS 
WESTERN NC.  TRIED TO ALLOW FOR SOME OF THIS CLEARING TO WORK WEST 
INTO THE E TN MTN AND SW NC COUNTIES INTO THE EARLY EVENING HOURS...
THEN BACK TO MOSTLY CLOUDY ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA.  TEMPS 
HAVE WARMED JUST ABOUT RIGHT UP TO FORECASTED HIGHS...AND WONT 
LIKELY FALL TOO MUCH UNDER THE MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES TONIGHT.  THIS 
MEANS ANY BELOW FEEEZING TEMPS WILL BE LIMITED TO HIGHER ELEVATIONS
...AND ALSO RADAR/SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THE DRIZZLE OR 
FLURRY ACTIVITY HAS ENDED.  HOWEVER...WILL INCLUDE PATCHY FOG AS 
TEMPS DROP TO NEAR DEWPOINTS TONIGHT...BUT NO DENSE FOG ATTM.

FOR MONDAY...EXPECT A GOOD CHANCE OF SOME PARTIAL SUNSHINE GENERALLY 
ACROSS THE AREA BY LATE MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON AS RIDGE BUILDS.  
WILL NEED TO SWITCH BACK TO MOSTLY CLOUDY BY MONDAY NIGHT AS A 
SHORTWAVE PASSES ACROSS NRN TN...KY AND SW VA OVERNIGHT.  FOR NOW I 
HAVE LIMITED ANY PCPN TO JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SNOW FOR SWRN VA...
AND FLURRIES OVER EXTREME NE TN.  WILL LET LATER SHIFTS SEE IF THIS 
FEATURE IS WORTH SPREADING LOW POPS ANY FURTHER SOUTH.  

FOR TEMPS...PRIOR TO OUR WINTER WEATHER EVENT...MAV MOS HAD BEEN TOO 
COOL ON BOTH MINS AND MAXES.  WITH THIS IN MIND...DECIDED TO GO 
CLOSER TO THE MOS BLEND MOST LOCATIONS...EXCEPT RHP WHERE THE MAX 
SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN CHA OR ANY OF THE MOS CHOICES.  FOR MINS MON 
NIGHT...INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH AND INCREASE IN CLOUDS SEEMED TO 
JUSTIFY GOING A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE THE MAV MOS.


.LONG TERM...(TUE THRU SUN)...A LITTLE TOO MUCH VARIABILITY IN 
MODELS DURING THIS PERIOD OF THE FCST FOR ANYTHING APPROACHING 
MODERATE LEVEL CONFIDENCE IN EXPECTED WX. THE GENERAL IDEA WAS TO 
STAY WITH DRY REGIME AS MAINLY WEAK SRN STREAM S/WVS RIP ALONG TO 
THE E THRU THE SRN THIRD OF THE U.S. WITH DEEPEST MOISTURE AND 
BETTER LIFT FARTHER SOUTH OF MRX FA. IF PRECIP WERE TO DEVELOP BEST 
CHC OF OCCURRENCE WOULD BE WED NIGHT THRU THU NIGHT AS HIGHER 
AMPLITUDE TROF BUILDS E THRU THE LWR MS VLY INTO THE GULF COAST 
STATES. DECIDED TO LEAVE DRY FOR NOW AND WAIT FOR MORE CONSISTENCY 
IN MODELS. AFTER THIS THREAT PASSES RIDGING STRENGTHENS ALLOWING FOR 
CONTINUED UNEVENTFUL WX WITH MAX/MIN TEMPS HOLDING NEAR 
CLIMATOLOGICAL NORMS.

.DISCUSSION...LINGERING LIGHT PCPN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SHOULD 
BE JUST TRACE AMOUNTS OF DRIZZLE OR SNOW FLURRIES TODAY.  SOME 
LOCATIONS STILL INDICATING PATCHY DENSE FOG...BUT VISIBILITIES HAVE 
GENERALLY IMPROVED TO ONE MILE OR MORE.  THIS TRACE PCPN AND FOG IS 
WELL COVERED IN THE SHORT TERM FORECAST.  

THE 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS QUITE 
DEEP...FROM AT LEAST 750 MBS TO THE SURFACE.  UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW 
WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION AT 850 MBS...WITH RUC MODEL SHOWING 
CONTINUED WEAK COLD AIR OR NEUTRAL ADVECTION THIS AFTERNNON.  THUS...
I DONT LOOK FOR TEMPS TO WARM BY MORE THAN 5 DEGREES OR SO FROM THE 
CURRENT VALUES.  WILL UPDATE AND REMOVE MORNING WORDING...PLUS MAKE 
ANY SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS TO TEMPS AND/OR WINDS AS NEEDED.

FOR LATER PERIODS...THE SHORT WAVE TROUGH HAS PASSED TO OUR EAST 
WITH UPPER RIDGE TO BUILD IN FOR TODAY THRU MONDAY.  A FEW WEAK 
IMPULSES MAY APPROACH THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...BUT THE 
TROUGHING ACROSS THE SW STATES GENERALLY HOLDS IN PLACE.  THIS 
SHOULD KEEP OUR WEATHER MOSTLY DRY THROUGH TUESDAY AS REFLECTED IN

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS WITH 
TEMPS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA REMAINING SLIGHTLY ABOVE FREEZING. 
RADARS INDICATE THAT MOST OF THE EARLIER PRECIP HAS EXITED THE 
FORECAST AREA...AND WILL PLAN TO LET THE LAST OF THE WINTER STORM 
WARNINGS FOR NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA EXPIRE AS SCHEDULED. 
MODELS INDICATE THAT SOME PATCHY DRIZZLE WILL BE POSSIBLE THIS 
MORNING...BUT TEMPS SHOULD STAY ABOVE FREEZING AS DEWPOINTS REMAIN 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE FREEZING AT ALL OB SITES. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE 
THAT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET WILL BE BELOW FREEZING 
THIS MORNING...WHERE A FEW SNOW FLURRIES BE POSSIBLE WITH SOME 
REFREEZING OF LEFTOVER MOISTURE POSSIBLE ON THE ROADS. OTHERWISE... 
IT APPEARS IT WILL BE MOSTLY CLOUDY AND DRY THROUGH TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THRU SATURDAY)...GENERALLY UNEVENTFUL WEATHER 
ANTICIPATED THROUGH THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK AS SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
BECOME SANDWICHED BETWEEN ACTIVE NORTHERN STREAM ALONG THE CANADIAN 
BORDER AND SOUTHERN STREAM ALONG THE GULF COAST. LATEST GFS 
INDICATES SOME POTENTIAL FOR A LITTLE PRECIP TO SNEAK INTO THE 
SOUTHERN TIER OF THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY...BUT THIS APPEARS TO 
BE INSIGNIFICANT AT THIS TIME. THUS WILL NOT CHANGE EXISTING DRY 
GRIDS/FORECAST FOR THAT PERIOD. TEMPS WILL GENERALLY AVERAGE NEAR TO 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE CLIMATOLOGY THROUGH THE PERIOD.

(FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE ETA) MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THEIR SAME 
VERTICAL TEMP PROFILE DISCREPANCIES...BUT THE NAM MODEL APPEARS TO 
BE VERIFYING BETTER COMPARED TO THE SPECIAL 06Z BNA SOUNDING AND 
WITH THE CURRENT FREEZING RAIN/RAIN CONDITIONS. THUS...WILL 
GENERALLY FOLLOW THE NAMS DEPICTION OF A WARMER 850 MB SOUTHERLY 
FLOW PRODUCING MAINLY FREEZING RAIN ACROSS THE AREA. HOWEVER... 
NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA WILL LIKELY EXPERIENCE SOME SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS AS WELL...SINCE COLDER AIR WILL BE MORE FIRMLY 
ENTRENCHED HERE AS COLD-AIR DAMMING INTENSIFIES ACROSS THE CAROLINAS 
AND VIRGINIA. WILL MENTION UP TO 4 TO 8 INCHES OF SNOW ACROSS 
EXTREME NORTHEAST TN AND WASHINGTON COUNTY VA (CLOSER TO THE COLDER 
AIR)...WITH 1 TO 3 INCHES POSSIBLE ELSEWHERE. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THRU FRIDAY)...MAIN FORECAST ISSUE FOR LONGER TERM 
PERIOD IS THE TIMING OF THE ENDING OF CURRENT PRECIP EVENT ON SUNDAY 
IN AN OTHERWISE UNEVENTFUL FORECAST. MODELS AND ENSEMBLES ARE IN 
REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT THAT PRECIP WILL HAVE ENDED IN ESSENTIALLY 
ALL LOCATIONS BY 18Z SUNDAY AS UPPER TROUGH AXIS SHIFTS EAST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS. CURRENT GRIDS CONFIGURED APPROPRIATELY FOR THIS 
SCENARIO AND NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE. UPCOMING WORK 
WEEK IS PROJECTED TO BE GENERALLY DRY WITH TEMPS SLOWLY MODERATING 
TO SOMEWHAT ABOVE CLIMATOLOGY BY LATE IN THE WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...PRECIPITATION HAS STARTED IN SOUTHEAST TN DURING THE 
PAST COUPLE HOURS AND DEWPOINTS BOTTOMED OUT IN THE SINGLE DIGITS 
BEFORE LIGHT RAIN STARTED. TEMPERATURES ARE NOW IN THE MID 30S IN 
THIS AREA WITH DEWPOINTS AROUND 20. WARM LAYER AT 850 MB CONTINUES 
WITH VERY DRY LOWER LAYER. INCREASING WARM AIR ADVECTION IS EXPECTED 
TO MAINTAIN THE WARMING AS PRECIPITATION FALLS. TEMPERATURES SHOULD 
DROP BELOW FREEZING SOON PER SWOMCD DISCUSSION 126. HOURLY RAINFALL 
RATES MAY BE OVER 0.05 INCHES PER HOUR AS IT CONTINUES TO DEVELOP 
LATER TONIGHT. 

WILL UPDATE WINTER STORM WARNING TO 1/4 TO 1/2 INCHES OF TOTAL ICE 
ACCUMULATION ACROSS SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL SECTIONS OF FORECAST AREA 
EXCLUDING THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS OF EAST TN. WILL CHANGE TOTAL SNOWFALL 
AMOUNTS FOR THE PLATEAU AND CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEYS TO 1 TO 5

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THRU SATURDAY NIGHT)...MAIN CONCERN IS THE 
APPROACHING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM (UPPER LOW NOW OVER OK AND KS) AND 
SURFACE LOW DEVELOPING ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.  
FORECAST FOR THIS PACKAGE WAS BASED ON A BLEND OF THE WARM ETA AND 
COLDER GFS MODEL...NOTING THAT MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS FROM THE WRF 
MODEL (PER HUNTSVILLE OFFICES HELP) WERE ALSO SLIGHTLY COLDER THAN 
THE ETA.  WE DONT FEEL THAT THE ETA IS ACCOUNTING FOR THE VERY DRY 
AND COOL AIR THAT MAY GET DRAWN INTO THE NE AND SE AREAS AT THE 
SURFACE...FROM THE EXTREMELY STRONG COLD AIR WEDGE TO OUR EAST.  ALSO
THE EVAPORATIVE COOLING WILL BE A FACTOR...PLUS STRONG ADIABATIC 
COOLING FROM THE SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT IN ADVANCE OF THE TROUGH (AIDED 
BY ISENTROPIC LIFT AS WELL).  THUS...WE FAVORED THE GFS SOLUTION OF 
A MORE SUBSTANTIAL SNOW AND ICE POTENTIAL...LEADING TO ISSUANCE OF A 
WINTER STORM WARNING FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA...WITH THE THREAT 
LOOKING TO END OVER SE TN AND SW NC BY NOON SATURDAY.  ELSEWHERE THE 
THREAT OF WINTRY PCPN LINGERS INTO THE EVENING HOURS SATURDAY.  THIS 
IS ALL ALSO IN LINE WITH THE LATEST HPC AND WWE GRAPHICS FOR THIS 
EVENT.

SNOW AMOUNTS OVER EXTREME SWRN VA AND NE TN COULD EASILY EXCEED THE 
FORECASTED AMOUNTS...IF GFS MODEL IS MORE CORRECT.  KEPT MAX TEMPS 
DOWN TOWARD THE COLDER MOS FOR SATURDAY.  THIS IS CERTAINLY A RATHER 
COMPLEX AND INTERESTING WINTER WEATHER EVENT.  THANKS TO ALL FOR THE 
COORDINATION ON THIS FORECAST PACKAGE.    


.LONG TERM...(SUN THRU FRI)...UPR TROF EXITS SUN LEAVING AREA WITH 
LOW LVL MOISTURE ON NWLY FLO. JUST A SLGT CHC PRECIP SUN MORNING. 
NEXT SYSTEM WILL BE A WEAK DISTURBANCE RIDING E MON NIGHT INTO TUE 
WITH AGAIN JUST SLGT CHC POPS. RIDGING PRESSES E ACROSS THE REGION 
WED AND MUCH OF THU BUT WILL NEED TO ADD SLGT TO SMALL CHC POPS THU

430 AM EST FRI JAN 28 2005

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED STATES 
WITH AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING ACROSS DEEP SOUTH TEXAS. 
THIS AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHEAST ALONG THE 
GULF COAST TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH A CUT-OFF 500 MB LOW SWINGING 
EAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS. THIS UPPER LOW WILL HELP TO SPREAD 
MOISTURE NORTHEAST FROM THE SURFACE LOW INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION TONIGHT...RIDING OVER THE SUB-FREEZING AIR AT THE 
SURFACE. THE GFS AND NAM (FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE ETA) MODELS ARE 
SHOWING SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THEIR VERTICAL TEMP PROFILES...WHICH 
DOESNT HELP MATTERS WITH AN ALREADY DIFFICULT FORECAST. NAM MODEL 
REVEALS A WARMER 850 MB AIRMASS THAN THE GFS...WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY 
RESULT IN A BETTER POTENTIAL FOR FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET ACROSS THE 
AREA. ITS DIFFICULT AT THIS POINT TO KNOW WHICH MODEL WILL PERFORM 
CLOSER TO REALITY...BUT WILL DECIDE TO HANG MY HAT ON THE NAM 
MODEL SINCE IT HAS PERFORMED BETTER WITH WINTER WEATHER EVENTS IN 
THE PAST. BESIDES...THE GFS MODEL ALWAYS SEEMS TO HAVE A COLD BIAS 
(ESPECIALLY IN THE MID RANGES) SO WILL ASSUME THIS IS AGAIN THE 
CASE. EITHER WAY...THE BOTTOM LINE REVEALED BY BOTH MODELS IS THE 
POTENTIAL FOR A WINTRY PRECIP SCENARIO ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST 
AREA. NAM MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT MOSTLY FREEZING RAIN WILL 
OCCUR ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC...ALTHOUGH IT WILL LIKELY 
BEGIN AS RAIN MIXED WITH SLEET. FARTHER NORTHEAST ACROSS CENTRAL 
EAST TN...MOSTLY FREEZING RAIN IS EXPECTED AS TEMPS WILL LIKELY FALL 
TO AROUND THE FREEZING MARK AS THE PRECIP BEGINS. ACROSS NORTHEAST 
TN AND SOUTHWEST VA....EXPECT MAINLY SNOW AT THE PRECIP ONSET LATE 
TONIGHT...BUT PRECIP SHOULD CHANGE TO FREEZING RAIN AFTER SUNRISE AS 
THE 850 MB SOUTHERLY FLOW WARMS ABOVE FREEZING. SURFACE TEMPS SHOULD 
SLOWLY WARM ABOVE FREEZING BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON...WITH PRECIP 
CHANGING BACK TO MOSTLY RAIN FOR MOST OF THE AREA. THE EXCEPTION 
BEING WASHINGTON COUNTY VA AND JOHNSON COUNTY TN...WHERE TEMPS MAY 
STAY BELOW FREEZING FOR MOST OF THE DAY AS COLD-AIR DAMMING 
INTENSIFIES ACROSS THE CAROLINAS AND VIRGINIA.

.LONG TERM (SAT NIGHT THRU THU)...PRECIP LINGERS INTO FOURTH PERIOD 
AS SHORT WAVE TROUGH AXIS MOVES THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. ANTICIPATE BRIEF DRY PERIOD DURING 
THE DAY ON SUNDAY AS SHORT WAVE RIDGING BUILDS IN BEFORE THE NEXT 
SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM APPROACHES. SOME DISCREPANCIES EXIST BETWEEN 
ETA AND GFS REGARDING THIS SYSTEM WITH ETA BRINGING ROUND OF PRECIP 
INTO OUR FORECAST AREA BEFORE 12Z MONDAY WHILE GFS HOLDS OFF 
ANYTHING UNTIL AFTER 12Z...AND EVEN THEN ONLY VERY LIGHT QPF. ETA 
MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THIS SYSTEM. CANADIAN GEM TENDS TO SUPPORT 
GFS. HOWEVER...DUE TO UNCERTAINTY...WILL NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT 
CHANGES TO CURRENT GRIDS/FORECAST. TEMPS WILL TEND TO AVERAGE NEAR 
TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE CLIMATOLOGY THROUGH THE PERIOD PER GFS MODEL 
GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THRU SAT NIGHT)...MOST OF TIME SPENT ON FRIDAY 
NIGHT INTO SATURDAY NIGHT GRIDS...SO HOPEFULLY DID NOT OVERLOOK 
ANYTHING IN THE FIRST AND SECOND PERIOD.  POP AND WEATHER GRIDS WERE 
BASED MORE IN LINE WITH THE COLDER AND STRONGER GFS MODEL...SO SOME 
UNCERTAINTY IF THE WARMER/WEAKER ETA MODEL PROVES MORE CORRECT.  

GFS MODEL SOUNDINGS GENERALLY SUPPORTED A WINTRY MIX FOR SOUTHERN 
TWO THIRDS OF OUR FORECAST AREA...WITH MAINLY SNOW FOR NORTHERN 
THIRD AND MTN AREAS.  I DID SPEED UP THE ARRIVAL OF THIS WINTRY MIX 
AND ALLOWED FOR A POSSIBLE LIGHT ICE ACCUMULATION IN THE SOUTHERN 
AREAS WHERE PCPN STARTS THE EARLIEST.  MTN AREAS MAY SEE MORE 
SNOWFALL THAN INITIALLY PUT IN THE GRIDS...BUT WANTED TO WAIT FOR 
ANOTHER MODEL RUN OR TWO BEFORE GOING TOO HEAVY ON THE SNOW.  THE 
WWE SNOW/ICE GRAPHICS...PLUS HPC INPUT ON THE CHAT...WERE VERY 
HELPFUL.  WINTER STORM WATCH FOR 4AM SAT TO 4AM SUN HAS ALREADY BEEN 
ISSUED WITH MUCH MORE DETAILS THAN I CAN PUT IN THE AFD.

FOR TEMPS...HEDGED TOWARD THE BLEND TONIGHT WITH AN INCREASE IN HIGH 
CLOUDS EXPECTED...THEN FAVORED THE WARMER ETA MOS FOR HIGHS FRIDAY 
SINCE HIGHS TODAY ONCE AGAIN SOARED ABOVE ANY OF THE MOS VALUES.
I EXPECT THE CLOUDS AND WINTRY PCPN TO HOLD TEMPS DOWN ON SAT...SO
STAYED CLOSER TO PREVIOUS GRIDS WHICH WERE BELOW ALL OF THE MOS 
CHOICES.

OTHERWISE...WEB PRODUCTS AND WSW ALREADY ISSUED...WITH ZFP TO FOLLOW 
SHORTLY.

TYPES FROM LATE FRIDAY NIGHT THRU SATURDAY NIGHT.  HOWEVER...WILL 
WORK MORE ON THIS FOR THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE.  I NOTICED THAT THE GFS 
APPEARS TO BE STRONGEST WITH THE UPPER LOW (POSSIBLY TOO STRONG?)...
AND THE GFS SOUNDINGS LOOKED A LITTLE COLDER THAN THE ETA SOUNDINGS 
FROM AND BEYOND 00Z SUNDAY.  IF GFS IS TOO STRONG WITH THE UPPER LOW
...THEN PERHAPS THE GFS QPF AMOUNTS ARE LIKELY TOO HEAVY AS WELL.

FOR THE MORNING UPDATE...LOW CLOUDS HAVE ERODED OVER NRN PARTS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA AS WELL AS ACROSS CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES OF NC.
ELSEWHERE...MID AND HIGH CLOUDS SEEM TO ALREADY BE ADVANCING EASTWARD
INTO THE FORECAST AREA...POSSIBLY SLOWING THE CLEARING TREND.  WITH 
THE EARLY ARRIVAL OF HIGH CLOUDS TODAY...PROBABLY WILL KEEP SKIES NO 
BETTER THAN PARTLY CLOUDY.  THE 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS SEEMED TO 
SUPPORT HIGHS REACHING THE 30S TO MID 40S WITH SOME SUNSHINE...WHICH 
IS IN LINE WITH CURRENT FORECAST.

WILL UPDATE THE ZFP...GRIDS AND WEB PRODUCTS SHORTLY.  I EXPECT MORE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THRU FRIDAY NIGHT)...THE COLD FRONT IS 
NEARING A LOZ TO CSV TO SE OF BNA LINE WITH MILD TEMPS STILL NOTED 
ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON (MID 60S AT CHA).  MID AND 
HIGH CLOUDS IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT HAVE CLEARED SOME...BUT THE LOW 
CLOUDS WITH AND BEHIND THE COLD FRONT HAVE ALREADY DROPPED TO NEAR 
THE KY/TN STATE LINE AND INTO SWRN VA.  NO RADAR ECHOES NOTED SINCE 
AROUND MID MORNING TODAY...BUT WITH THE COLD AIR OVERNIGHT...FELT IT 
WAS WISE TO CONTINUE THE SLIGHT CHANCE OF SNOW OR FLURRIES FOR NRN 
MOST AREAS.  SRN MOST AREAS MAY STAY PARTLY CLOUDY FOR MUCH OF 
TONIGHT...MORE IN LINE WITH THE MAV MOS SKY COVER.  ELSEWHERE... 
EITHER A MOSTLY CLOUDY OR VARIABLY CLOUDY NIGHT.  MOS MINS WERE 
CLOSE AND GENERALLY ACCEPTED.

FOR THE BULK OF THE REST OF THE SHORT TERM PERIODS...DRY WEATHER IS 
EXPECTED WITH THE COLDEST NIGHT TO BE THURSDAY NIGHT AS THE SURFACE 
RIDGE HAS BUILT INTO THE REGION AND SKIES REMAIN MOSTLY CLEAR.  
THERE STILL LOOKS TO BE A LOW CHANCE OF SOME LIGHT MIXED RAIN OR 
FREEZING RAIN TOWARD DAYBREAK SATURDAY.  WARM AIR ADVECTION WILL 
CERTAINLY DEVELOP LATE FRIDAY NIGHT IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT SYSTEM...
BUT THIS MAY MAINLY OCCUR OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WITH SURFACE 
TEMPS NEAR OR JUST BELOW FREEZING IN SE TN AND SW NC.  PREVIOUS POP 
AND WEATHER GRIDS COVERED THIS SITUATION QUITE WELL...WITH LITTLE 
CHANGES OR MAJOR CONCERNS AT THIS POINT.  

OTHERWISE...MOS BLEND LOOKED GOOD FOR HIGHS.  I DID ADJUST MIN TEMPS 
A GOOD BIT ON FRIDAY NIGHT IN LINE WITH LATEST MOS (FAVORING THE 
WARMER ETA MOS FOR LNP DUE TO WARM AIR ADVECTION AND INCREASING 
CLOUDS).  


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SHORTWAVE PUSHING UP 
FROM SOUTH ON SATURDAY.  GFS INDICATING WARM AIR PUSHING IN ALOFT 
WITH BELOW FREEZING SURFACE TEMPERATURES...MAY SEE SOME FREEZING  
RAIN SATURDAY MORNING IN OUR SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL ZONES.  SURFACE  
TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM SUFFICIENTLY FOR ALL RAIN BY AFTERNOON.   
PRECIP SHOULD STAY SOUTH OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA UNTIL THE AFTERNOON WHEN IT WILL BE WARM ENOUGH FOR ALL 
RAIN.  THE CHANCE OF RAIN WILL CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING HOURS... 
SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH FOR ALL LIQUID PRECIPITATION.  SURFACE TROUGH 
ENTERS REGION ON SUNDAY WITH SUFFICIENT MOISTURE TO KEEP CHANCE POPS 
GOING FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT.  THICKNESSES INDICATE ALL RAIN 
FOR SUNDAY NIGHT.  UPPER TROUGH ENTERING REGION MONDAY AND MONDAY 
NIGHT.  MOISTURE ADEQUATE ENOUGH TO CONTINUE CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY 
AND MONDAY NIGHT.  AGAIN...LOOKS LIKE TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE WARM 
ENOUGH FOR ONLY RAIN MONDAY NIGHT.  UPPER TROUGH PUSHING THROUGH ON 
TUESDAY...MOISTURE IS LIMITED SO WILL ONLY CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
FOR SOME RAIN SHOWERS.  DRY WEATHER RETURNS TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY.

.DISCUSSION...12Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS 
LOCATED FROM SW VA TO SW CORNER OF NC THIS MORNING...WITH 850 MB 
LEVEL TEMPS RANGING FROM 4 TO 6 DEGREES CELSIUS.  AREA RADARS 
ALREADY SHOW THE BAND OF SHOWERS WEAKENING OVER NRN MOST PARTS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA.  THIS PRECIPITATION IS BECOMING SCATTERED IN 
COVERAGE AND LIGHT IN INTENSITY.  ALSO...SURFACE OBSERVATIONS (ASOS 
AND OTHER SITES) SHOW SURFACE TEMPS ARE GENERALLY NO COLDER THAN THE 
LOWER TO MIDDLE 30S ACROSS MOST OF SW VA AND EXTREME NE TN.  THE 
REMAINING AREAS HAD WARMED INTO THE 40S OVERNIGHT...SO THE THREAT OF 
ANY WINTRY MIXED PRECIPITATION HAS ENDED.

FOR THE FORECAST...CURRENT FORECAST AND GRIDS LOOK GOOD WITH CHANCE 
POPS NORTHERN AREAS FOR A BIT LONGER THEN DECREASING TO SLIGHT 
CHANCE IN THE AFTERNOON.  AFTERNOON HIGHS CLOSER TO THE COOLER 
GFS/MAV MOS NUMBERS LOOKS LIKE THE BEST CHOICE...WHICH IS IN LINE 
WITH CURRENT FORECAST.  AN UPDATE WILL BE REQUIRED...MAINLY TO 
REMOVE THE EARLY THEN AFTERNOON WORDING.  

FOR THE LATER PERIODS...THE 06Z GFS MODEL JUST IN...LOOKS DRY FOR 
FRIDAY NIGHT WITH 850 MB TEMPS WARMING WELL ABOVE ZERO OVER THE 
WEEKEND...AHEAD OF THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE NEAR CHICAGO 
WITH ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT EXTENDING ACROSS THE MID MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY. SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDINESS 
ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE OVER THE OZARKS...WITH 
SOME PATCHY LIGHT RAIN DEVELOPING ACROSS MIDDLE TN AHEAD OF IT. AS 
THIS SHORT WAVE MOVES EAST TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT... 
EXPECT IT TO WEAKEN SOMEWHAT WITH A DRIER AIRMASS OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA HELPING TO LIMIT RAINFALL POTENTIAL. 

AS FOR TEMPS...DEWPOINTS HAVE BEEN SLOW TO RISE THIS EVENING AND 
TEMPS HAVE FALLEN A LITTLE FASTER THAN EXPECTED. MAIN FORECAST 
PROBLEM OVERNIGHT WILL BE DETERMINING WHETHER TEMPS RISE ABOVE 
FREEZING ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA BEFORE SUNRISE WHEN 
THE PATCHY LIGHT RAIN ARRIVES. CURRENT TEMPS ARE ALREADY IN THE 
LOWER TO MID 30S ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA...BUT EXPECT  
NEAR-SURFACE WINDS TO INCREASE AS THE COLD FRONT AND SHORT WAVE 
APPROACH AFTER MIDNIGHT. THESE WINDS SHOULD HELP TO MIX THE WARMER 
850 MB TEMPS DOWN TO THE SURFACE...CAUSING SURFACE TEMPS TO SLOWLY 
RISE AFTER MIDNIGHT BEFORE ANY LIGHT RAIN ARRIVES. 

OVERALL...EXPECT ONLY A FEW PATCHY AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN TOWARDS 
SUNRISE BUT WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE ZONES TO RAISE POPS A LITTLE 
ACROSS ALL ZONES. WILL ALSO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE TO REFLECT CURRENT 
TRENDS AND TO MENTION RISING TEMPS AFTER MIDNIGHT.

250 PM EST TUE JAN 25 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...WV IMAGERY SHOWS AN 
UPPER VORT CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER NORTH CENTRAL OKLAHOMA.  THIS 
FEATURE IS PROJECTED TO CONTINUE ITS EASTWARD TREK AND APPROACH THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY 12Z WED...WEAKENING SOMEWHAT AS IT GOES.  
ALTHOUGH OPERATIONAL MODEL GUIDANCE POPS HAVE INCREASED OVER THE 
PAST FEW RUNS...AM STILL NOT VERY IMPRESSED WITH THIS FEATURE.  
MODEL TIME HEIGHTS DEPICT UNIMPRESSIVE MOISTURE PROFILE WITH ONLY 
WEAK LIFT.  SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLES SHOW NO QPF OVER OUR FORECAST AREA 
AT ALL...AND ETA DEPICTS ONLY WIDELY SCATTERED LIGHT QPF.  BASED ON 
THESE FACTORS...AND THAT CURRENT RADAR RETURNS FROM THIS SYSTEM ARE 
GENERALLY LIGHT AND SPOTTY AND EXPECTED TO WEAKEN EVEN 
FURTHER...WILL CONTINUE WITH ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS.  WILL ALSO 
CONTINUE TO MENTION FLURRIES IN HIGHER TERRAIN FOR WED NIGHT AS 
UPSLOPE FLOW DEVELOPS BRIEFLY.  GENERALLY TRANQUIL WEATHER WILL 
PREVAIL THROUGH THE BALANCE OF THE SHORT TERM AS RIDGING BUILDS INTO 
THE AREA BOTH AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT.  OVERALL...HAVE NOT MADE 
MANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO EXISTING GRIDS/FORECAST.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...THE SOUTHERN STREAM WILL 
BECOME MORE OF A PLAYER DURING THE MEDIUM RANGE FORECAST.  THE NEW 
GFS MODEL IS LESS AMPLIFIED WITH SHORT-WAVE MOVING INTO THE PLAINS 
STATES FRIDAY AND OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND TENNESSEE 
VALLEY FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT.  PLAN ON DIS-COUNTING NEW 
GFS RUN FOR NOW...GIVEN BETTER CONTINUITY BETWEEN THE OLD GFS AND 
ECMWF MODELS. WILL CONTINUE TO PULL MOISTURE AND PRECIPITATION BACK 
INTO THE REGION FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT.  STRONG WEDGING 
EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS WILL TEND TO FUNNEL COLD AIR INTO THE 
SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

THERMAL STRUCTURE AND EXPECTED EVAPORATIVE COOLING SUPPORTS A 
POTENTIAL OF FREEZING RAIN ON THE ONSET OF THE PRECIPITATION 
SATURDAY MORNING...ESPECIALLY FOR THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES. AFTER WARM 
AIR ADVECTION CONTINUES...PRECIPITATION WILL CHANGE TO ALL RAIN.

SYSTEM MOVES OUT FOR SUNDAY WITH A BRIEF PAUSE OF DRIER WEATHER FOR 
SUNDAY NIGHT...THEN ANOTHER STRONG SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE MOVES TOWARD
THE AREA FOR MONDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...MODELS AND SHORT 
RANGE ENSEMBLES GENERALLY AGREE THAT UPPER AIR FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO 
SLOWLY DEAMPLIFY AS INTENSE UPPER LOW CONTINUES TO PULL AWAY INTO 
THE CANADIAN MARITIMES. HOWEVER...GENERAL LONG WAVE PATTERN TREND OF 
RIDGE WEST/TROUGH EAST WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. THIS 
RESULTS IN CONTINUATION OF NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION. WEAK SHORT WAVES WILL TRANSLATE THROUGH THIS 
FLOW WITH THE NEXT WAVE PROJECTED TO MOVE THROUGH OUR FORECAST AREA 
IN THE TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY MORNING TIME FRAME. MOISTURE AND LIFT 
NOT IMPRESSIVE WITH THIS FEATURE PER MODEL TIME HEIGHTS. ENSEMBLES 
SUGGEST ANY PRECIP ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE WILL REMAIN NORTH OF 
OUR FORECAST AREA...WHILE OPERATIONAL MODEL GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO 
SHOW GENERALLY LOW POPS. WILL CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR 
THE THIRD AND FOURTH PERIODS FOR MOST OF FORECAST AREA...BUT THIS 
SYSTEM APPEARS RATHER INSIGNIFICANT. MODERATING TEMPS ARE PROJECTED 
THROUGH THE PERIOD BUT AM INCLINED TO FAVOR COOLER GFS MOS GUIDANCE 
IN NORTHWESTERLY FLOW REGIME.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS SHOW
UPPER FLOW DEAMPLIFING WITH STRONG SURFACE HIGH MOVING FROM THE
GREAT LAKES EAST INTO THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES BY FRIDAY MORNING. 
COLD AIR DAMMING DEVELOPS EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS AS SURFACE HIGH 
BUILDS INTO THE MID ATLANTIC STATES FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...SO 
HAVE LOWER MAXES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

SOUTHERN STREAM JET BECOMES ACTIVE WITH A SHORT-WAVE MOVING FROM
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. HAVE UPPED POPS
AREA-WIDE BEGINNING LATE FRIDAY NIGHT SOUTH...THEN AREA-WIDE FOR
SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURE PROFILE SUGGESTS A POTENTIAL
OF LIGHT FREEZING RAIN AT THE BEGINNING...THEN CHANGING TO ALL RAIN.

SOUTHERN STREAM TROUGH MOVES EAST FOR SUNDAY ALLOWING A WEAK UPPER

CONDITIONS.

THIS CLOUD COVER WILL HAVE ON TEMP RECOVERY IF ANY AND HOW LONG THE

TODAY AS SURFACE RIDGE SLIDES EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS SHOULD
PROMOTE DECENT WARMING IN SPITE OF TRANSITORY CLOUDS AND FEEL

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...GENERALLY BENIGN...OR AT LEAST 
DRY...WEATHER ANTICIPATED THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS DEEP UPPER 
TROUGH PULLS AWAY ALLOWING UPPER FLOW TO DEAMPLIFY SOMEWHAT PER 
MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. FLOW ALSO BECOMES ANTICYCLONIC. THIS 
WILL PERMIT MODEST TEMPERATURE MODERATION IN THE SECOND PERIOD. 
HOWEVER AREA REMAINS IN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AND TEMPS WILL STILL 
TEND TO BE WELL BELOW CLIMATOLOGY. OVERNIGHT TEMPS WILL AGAIN BE 
VERY COLD UNDER GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS. HOWEVER...WINDS 
SHOULD BECOME A NON-FACTOR AS SURFACE RIDGE AXIS DRIFTS THROUGH THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS SHOULD PRECLUDE 
WIND CHILLS FROM AGAIN BECOMING AN ISSUE.

.LONG TERM...(MON NIGHT THROUGH SUN)...DRY WEATHER SHOULD CONTINUE 
THROUGH TUESDAY...THEN MODELS CONTINUE TO DEPICT SHORT WAVE ENERGY 
SLIDING BY TO OUR SOUTH TUES NIGHT/WED AND THEN A NORTHERN STREAM 
SHORT WAVE MOVING BY TO OUR NORTH WED...WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT 
PUSHING THROUGH WED.  NONE OF THIS LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD BE A MAJOR 
PRECIP PRODUCER FOR HERE...AS MOISTURE AND LIFT APPEAR LIMITED.  
HOWEVER...WILL CARRY A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR LATE TUE NIGHT INTO 
EARLY WED NIGHT.  GFS COLDER THAN ETA...BUT EVEN IT LOOKS LIKE ANY 
PRECIP SHOULD BE MAINLY LIQUID...SO WILL CARRY ONLY RAIN SHOWERS FOR 
NOW.  MODELS INCONSISTENT HANDLING OF WEAK SYSTEMS FURTHER OUT DOES 
NOT INSPIRE MUCH CONFIDENCE.  FOLLOWED HPC IDEA...GENERALLY 
SUPPORTED BY THE 00Z GFS...WHICH KEPT THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY 
DRY...THEN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN GRIDDED DATABASE FOR SUN NIGHT AS 
NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES.  HOWEVER...12Z GFS BRINGS A SYSTEM THROUGH 
ON SATURDAY.  GIVEN HIGH LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY...WILL STICK WITH 
EARLIER IDEA FOR NOW AND KEEP SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY DRY.

845 PM EST SAT JAN 22 2005

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE 
EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH STRONG NORTHWEST FLOW 
OCCURRING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. A CONVECTIVE BAND OF HEAVY SNOW 
(MIXED WITH SOME SLEET AND OCCASIONAL THUNDER) DEVELOPED EARLIER THIS 
EVENING IN RESPONSE TO SOME CONDITIONAL SYMMETRIC INSTABILITY ACROSS 
THE AREA. EQUIVALENT POTENTIAL VORTICITY PROGS FROM THE MESO-ETA 
MODEL REVEAL THAT THIS INSTABILITY HAS SHIFTED EAST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA...AND DO NOT EXPECT ANY MORE CONVECTIVE BANDS TO DEVELOP THIS 
EVENING. THIS EVENT APPEARS TO BE EVOLVING INTO MAINLY AN UPSLOPE 
FLOW EVENT...WITH HIGHER AMOUNTS EXPECTED ACROSS THE NORTHWEST- 
FACING SLOPES OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. EXPECT THE BULK OF THE 
SNOWFALL TO FALL BEFORE MIDNIGHT...WITH SNOW SHOWERS GRADUALLY 
DIMINISHING IN COVERAGE AND INTENSITY THEREAFTER. BREEZY NORTHWEST 
WINDS SHOULD CONTINUE OVERNIGHT WITH WIND CHILL READINGS DROPPING 
BELOW ZERO ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN MOUNTAINS...AND SOUTHWEST 
VA. 

CURRENT FORECAST STILL APPEARS TO HAVE THE SITUATION WELL COVERED... 
BUT WILL UPDATE TO REMOVE EVENING WORDING. ALSO...EXPECT BLACK ICE 
TO DEVELOP TONIGHT ACROSS THE ADVISORY AND WARNING AREAS...AS THE 
RESULT OF FREEZING OF EARLIER RAIN AND SNOWPACK. WILL PLAN TO 
MENTION THIS IN THE UPDATED ADVISORIES AND WARNINGS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH 
MAIN FEATURE OF INTEREST THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. TROUGH AXIS PASSES 
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS OVERNIGHT PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE 
CONSENSUS. WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUGH AXIS 
SHOULD KEEP UPSLOPE SNOW EVENT GOING AND THUS WILL CONTINUE SNOW 
ADVISORIES/WARNINGS AS CURRENTLY CONFIGURED. WILL ALSO CONTINUE WIND 
ADVISORIES AND INCLUDE WIND CHILL ADVISORY FOR CENTRAL AND NORTHERN 
MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA AS WIND CHILL VALUES WILL 
APPROACH -20 F IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES TO 
PULL AWAY THROUGH THE SECOND PERIOD WITH MODELS INDICATING THAT 
PRECIP WILL GENERALLY END BY 12Z MONDAY WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION 
OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN WHERE UPSLOPE FLOW WILL ENHANCE SNOW SHOWER 
ACTIVITY. ANTICIPATE ALL PRECIP TO END BY AROUND 22Z TOMORROW. 
STRONG WINDS SHOULD SLOWLY DIMINISH DURING THE SECOND PERIOD AS 
SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENTS RELAX WITH SURFACE RIDGE NOSING INTO THE 
AREA. SKY COVER WILL BE PROBLEMATIC AS LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE LINGERS 
THROUGH AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF THE SECOND PERIOD. PREVIOUS 
TEMPERATURE GRIDS LOOK REASONABLE AND GENERALLY STAYED WITH THOSE.

.LONG TERM...(SUN NIGHT THROUGH SAT)...LOOKS LIKE DRY WEATHER WILL 
CONTINUE THROUGH TUESDAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS TO OUR 
SOUTH...AND ANY WEAK ENERGY STAYS NORTH AND SOUTH OF OUR AREA. LOW 
CONFIDENCE IN TIMING ANY WEAK FEATURES FOR THE MIDDLE TO LATE PART 
OF THE WEEK...MODELS IN POOR AGREEMENT.  WILL GENERALLY FOLLOW HPC 
IDEA AND STRAY AWAY FROM THE GFS.  WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR A WEAK WAVE AND FRONT IN THE WED/WED NIGHT TIME 
FRAME. APPEARS THERE MAY BE ANOTHER WEAK SYSTEM FOR SATURDAY...BUT 
WITH HIGH LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY WILL JUST GO DRY FOR THE THU THROUGH 
SAT PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT) LOW PRESSURE DEEPENS TODAY OVER KY 
AND MOVES EAST THROUGH APPALACHIANS THIS AFTERNOON. TRAILING COLD 
FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH MOST OF THE AREA BY THIS AFTERNOON. SW WINDS 
INCREASE IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT AND AID IN DRAWING IN SOME LOW

OVERNIGHT MAINLY ACROSS CENTRAL AND NORTHERN AREAS. AVAILABLE RH 
MARGINAL BUT STEEP LAPSE RATES AND GOOD MOISTURE BELOW -10C RAISED 
CONFIDENCE IN SNOW POTENTIAL. POST FRONTAL WINDS STAY UP AND WIND 
CHILLS WILL BE FALL ACCORDINGLY. ADVISORIES WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED 
EARLY SUNDAY FOR CHILLS. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE  
THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL EXIT THE AREA SUNDAY MORNING.  
ASSOCIATED SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE EASTERN 
TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND OUR VIRGINIA COUNTIES THROUGH MUCH OF THE

238 PM EST FRI JAN 21 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...BRIEF LULL IN ACTION 
CONTINUES TONIGHT BEFORE SIGNIFICANT SHORT WAVE TROUGH APPROACHES 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY 12Z SATURDAY. APPEARS ONSET OF PRECIP 
WILL GENERALLY HOLD OFF UNTIL AFTER 12Z ALTHOUGH SOME LIGHT PRECIP 
MAY COMMENCE IN THE NORTHERN-MOST ZONES SOMEWHAT BEFORE THAT TIME 
PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. ALSO APPEARS THAT LOW-LEVELS WILL 
WARM ENOUGH TO PRECLUDE ANY SIGNIFICANT WINTER PRECIP AND EVENT WILL 
START AS MAINLY A RAIN EVENT. MINOR ICE POSSIBLE IN ELEVATED VALLEYS 
IN MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN IN SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE...BUT NO MAJOR PROBLEM WITH ICING IS EXPECTED AT THIS 
TIME. SHORT WAVE AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONT MARCHES THROUGH 
FORECAST AREA AROUND 18Z. SIGNIFICANTLY COLDER AIR WILL FOLLOW 
FRONTAL PASSAGE WITH RESIDUAL PRECIP CHANGING OVER TO 
SNOW...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHERN SECTIONS. EXPECT ANY SNOW TO BE 
SHOWERY IN NATURE AT THIS TIME WITH NO MAJOR ACCUMULATIONS 
ANTICIPATED BEFORE 00Z SUNDAY. GENERALLY FAVORED GFS MOS GUIDANCE 
FOR TEMPS THROUGH THE FIRST TWO PERIODS.

.LONG TERM...(SAT NIGHT THROUGH FRI)...MODELS IN SOMEWHAT BETTER 
AGREEMENT IN HANDLING EXITING SYSTEM SAT NIGHT AND SUNDAY.  TREND 
CONTINUES TO BE FOR PRECIP TO EXIT MORE QUICKLY.  ANOTHER TREND THAT 
CONTINUES IS COLDER AIR PUSHING IN FASTER...SO BULK OF ANY PRECIP 
SAT NIGHT SHOULD BE SNOW SHOWERS.  WILL GO WITH LIKELY POPS IN THE 
NORMALLY FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL MOUNTAINS 
AND SW VA...CHANCE ELSEWHERE ALL BUT FAR SOUTH WHERE WILL GO WITH 
SLIGHT CHANCE.  WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS IN FOR SUNDAY MORNING FOR 
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL MOUNTAINS AND SW VA...DRY SOUTH AND FLURRIES IN 
BETWEEN.  MAY NEED WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR SAT NIGHT IN NORMALLY 
FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS...AND WINDS MAY MEET ADVISORY OR LAKE WIND 
ADVISORY CRITERIA AS WELL.  SINCE STILL THIRD PERIOD AT THIS 
POINT...WILL DEFER TO THE MIDNIGHT SHIFT AND JUST CONTINUE SPS.  
FURTHER OUT DECENT CONFIDENCE IN THE BASIC PATTERN...BUT DETAILS OF 
ANY WEAK SYSTEMS THAT MAY AFFECT THE AREA UNCERTAIN.  MAY HAVE A 
WEAK SHORT WAVE AND COLD FRONT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK...SO WILL 
CARRY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR WED.  DRY OTHERWISE FOR NOW.

SKY CONDITIONS PREVAIL SOUTH OF THIS BOUNDARY WITH LOW OVERCAST
PERSISTING TO ITS NORTH. RATHER STRONG TEMPERATURE GRADIENT ALSO
ASSOCIATED WITH FRONT. NO CLEAR INDICATION OF DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT

INCHES OF SNOW IN HONAKER (NRN RUSSELL CO VA) AND AROUND 1 INCH IN 
SHADY VALLEY (JOHNSON CO TN)...AND LESS THAN 1 INCH IN WISE CO VA.
THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE MUCH MORE THAN FLURRIES SOUTH OF THESE 
COUNTIES...ALTHO A REPORT JUST IN OF LIGHT SNOW AT NEWFOUND GAP 
(SEVIER CO TN - 5000 FEET).  

AREA RADARS SHOW THE BAND OF PCPN REMAINS IN PLACE FROM SE KY ACROSS 
SW VA...WITH ABOUT 3 TO 4 MORE HOURS OF LIFT REMAINING.  THUS...I 
THINK I WILL ISSUE A SNOW ADVISORY FOR WISE...RUSSELL...WASHINGTON

3 INCHES OF SNOW...WHILE OUTSIDE OF THESE AREAS IN SW VA AND NE TN 
SOME WORDING AS UP TO 1 INCH OR UP TO 2 INCHES IN HIGHEST ELEVATIONS

.DISCUSSION...MONITORING PCPN DEVELOPMENT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS SWRN 
VA...TO SEE IF AN UPDATE TO THE FORECAST IS NEEDED.  CALLS AROUND 
FOUND MAINLY FLURRIES OR SCATTERED LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS WITH NOT MUCH 
MORE THAN A DUSTING ANYWHERE IN SWRN VA JUST YET...AND THIS WAS ALSO 
NOTED INTO JOHNSON COUNTY IN THE NE TIP OF TN.

THE LATEST RUC AND ETA 12KM MODELS SHOW THE SRN EXTENT OF ANY 
ACCUMULATING SNOWS SHOULD FALL NO FURTHER SOUTH THAN ALONG A WISE 
COUNTY VA TO JOHNSON COUNTY TN LINE.  ETA MODEL SHOWED ISENTROPIC 
LIFT WILL OCCUR GENERALLY RIGHT UP TO AROUND 06Z...THEN IT RAPIDLY 
WEAKENS LEAVING JUST SOME WEAK UPSLOPE LOW LEVEL FLOW AND COLD AIR 
ADVECTION.  

IT IS TEMPTING TO UPDATE AND ADD A SNOW ADVISORY FOR PARTS OF SWRN 
VA INTO NE TIP OF TN...BUT I PREFER TO WATCH SATELLITE AND RADAR 
TRENDS FOR ANOTHER HOUR OR SO...SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE A MENTION OF 
UP TO 2 INCHES OF SNOW POSSIBLE IN THOSE AREAS.  IR SATELLITE PICS 
SHOW THE ENHANCED AREAS ALREADY SCOOTING OFF TO OUR EAST...WHICH 
DOES NOT BOOST MY CONFIDENCE IN GETTING ADVISORY AMOUNTS OF SNOW 
OVER THE REST OF THE EVENING.  WE WILL STAY IN CLEAR AIR MODE WITH 
THE KMRX RADAR TO BETTER DETECT ANY AREAS OF SNOW.

STAY TUNED FOR ANOTHER AFD UPDATE...WITH UPDATES TO GRIDS...WEB

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...NORTHWEST UPPER AIR FLOW REGIME 
CONTINUES AS RIDGE WEST/TROUGH EAST LONG WAVE PATTERN PERSISTS. NEXT 
IN A SERIES OF WEAK SHORT WAVE TROUGHS IN THIS NORTHWESTERLY FLOW 
CONTINUES TO APPROACH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. ITS EFFECTS WILL BE 
CONFINED MAINLY TO THE NORTHEASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA PER 
MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. PRECIP STILL EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY 
LIGHT...ALTHOUGH ONE TO TWO INCHES OF SNOW ARE POSSIBLE IN 
SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA. COLUMN TEMPS AND THICKNESS VALUES SUGGEST 
MOSTLY A SNOW EVENT IN THAT AREA. WILL CONTINUE SPS TO HIGHLIGHT 
THIS EVENT. THERE WILL BE A TRANSITION TO PRIMARILY A RAIN EVENT TO 
THE SOUTHWEST PER MODEL TEMPERATURE PROFILES. THIS FEATURE IS A 
RAPID MOVER AND WILL BE MOSTLY OUT OF THE AREA BY 12Z FRIDAY. SECOND 
PERIOD ANTICIPATED TO BE DRY...ALTHOUGH LINGERING LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE 
MAY IMPEDE WIDESPREAD CLEARING. FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE VALUES ARE 
GENERALLY CLOSE AND APPEAR REASONABLE. WENT WITH A BLEND OF THE 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR THE MOST PART.

.LONG TERM...(FRI NIGHT THROUGH THU)...MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW POOR 
AGREEMENT IN HANDLING WEEKEND SYSTEM.  ETA FURTHER NORTH WITH THE 
SURFACE LOW AND WARMER...WHILE GFS FURTHER SOUTH AND COLDER.  WILL 
FOLLOW HPC IDEA AND GO WITH A BLEND FOR NOW.  ONE TREND WORTH NOTING 
IS THAT THE MODELS HAVE BEEN CONTINUING TO EXIT THE SYSTEM A BIT 
FASTER. SYSTEM ALSO APPEARS MORE LACKING IN MOISTURE. WILL KEEP 20 
POPS FOR LATE FRI NIGHT IN NORTH...THEN CATEGORICAL ALL ZONES SAT. 
WILL ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME MIXED PRECIP AT THE ONSET 
NORTH...THEN ALL LIQUID FOR THE BULK OF SATURDAY.   COLDER AIR 
PUSHES IN RAPIDLY SAT NIGHT...TURNING ANY REMAINING PRECIP TO SNOW 
SHOWERS.  WILL GO WITH LIKELY POPS NORTH AND MOUNTAINS...TO LOW 
CHANCE SOUTH FOR EARLY SAT NIGHT...THEN DRY SOUTH AND CHANCE POPS 
NORTH AND SMOKIES FOR EARLY SUNDAY.  DRY SUNDAY NIGHT EXCEPT SLIGHT 
CHANCE SW VA AND NORTHERN AND CENTRAL TN MOUNTAINS.  STILL LOOKS 
LIKE SOME OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN COULD SEE SIGNIFICANT 
ACCUMULATIONS...SO WILL CONTINUE SPS.  AFTER THIS SYSTEM EXITS...NOT 
MUCH OF SIGNIFICANCE IN THE MODELS FOR MON THROUGH THU.  COULD BE A 
WEAK SYSTEM MID WEEK...BUT WILL LEAVE DRY FOR NOW.

.DISCUSSION...
A FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST FROM THE OHIO VALLEY 
INTO THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TODAY AND TONIGHT.  
FAIRLY DECENT ISENTROPIC LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM WHICH WILL
MOVE MAINLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. 
MOISTURE IS LIMITED...BUT ENOUGH LIFT WARRANTS RAISING POPS TO CAT
NORTH TO 20-30 PERCENT TYS AND CHA AREAS. THERMAL PROFILE SUGGESTS
A MIX BAG OF RAIN AND SNOW WITH MAINLY SNOW OVER THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. WILL INCLUDE 1 INCH OR LESS FOR THE NORTHEAST COUNTIES 
WITH UP TO 2 INCHES ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN.

MAIN SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION THIS WEEKEND. BOTH THE GFS
AND ETA ARE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT IN MOVING COLD FRONT ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. GOOD LIFT ASSOCIATED 
WITH FROPA AND UPPER TROUGH LATER HALF OF SATURDAY...SO HAVE UPPERD 
POPS TO NEAR 100 PERCENT. INSTABILITY IS LIMITED...BUT FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS DO SHOW SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY. WOULD NOT BE SUPRISED 
TO SEE ISOLATED THUNDER...BUT WILL LET LATER SHIFTS TO INCLUDE IF
NEEDED.

STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION BEHIND FRONT WILL QUICKLY DROP 
TEMPERATURES SATURDAY NIGHT WITH TEMPERATURE PROFILES CHANGING RAIN 
TO SNOW SHOWERS AREA-WIDE AFTER MIDNIGHT. FAIRLY DECENT CYCLONIC 
FLOW WITH STRONG UPSLOPE COMPONENT INTO THE MOUNTAINS LATE SATURDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST SUNDAY EVENING.  ALSO...ANOTHER VORT DROPPING 
INTO THE BASE OF THE UPPER TROUGH BY 12Z SUNDAY WILL SET THE STAGE 
FOR THE POTENTIAL OF SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALLS FOR FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE 
MOUNTAINS WITH LIGHTER SNOW ACCUMULATIONS FOR PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA. 

SYSTEM MOVES OUT SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING WITH DRIER WEATHER 
FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK.

340 AM EST FRI JAN 20 2005

.SHORT TERM...TODAY...LIGHT RAIN/LIGHT SNOW WILL CONTINUE TO DECREASE
EARLY TODAY AS IMPULSE MOVES EAST OF NORTHERN PART OF MRX CWA.
ANTICYCLONIC FLOW MOVES IN WITH CAA PUSHING INTO NORTHERN AND
EASTERN AREAS. EXPECT WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO HANG ACROSS SW
PARTS SO KEPT TEMPS UP THOSE AREAS. LAYER DRIES OUT BUT LOW 
CLOUDS WILL LINGER MOST OF TODAY WITH DECENT CAP AROUND 850 MB.

.LONG TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...POOR CONSISTENCY IN MODELS 
CONTINUE FOR THE SYSTEM MOVING IN ON SATURDAY.  ONE OF THE TRENDS 
HAS BEEN TO MOVE THE FRONT THROUGH AT A FASTER PACE.  AS SUCH...HAVE 
TWEAKED TIMING OF MAIN BAND OF PRECIP UP A COUPLE OF HOURS AND 
CLEARED THE SYSTEM OUT OF THE AREA A BIT SOONER.  OTHERWISE... 
CONTINUING WIDESPREAD RAIN OVER THE AREA ON SATURDAY...CHANGING 
THINGS OVER TO SNOW OVERNIGHT.  MAIN QUESTION WITH THE SYSTEM IS 
TIMING OF RAIN CHANGING TO SNOW AND THE POTENTIAL FOR SNOW 
ACCUMULATION...MAINLY OVER HIGHER TERRAIN.  A FEW LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS 
WILL LINGER INTO SUNDAY MORNING AS DRIER AIR PUSHES.  WE STAY UNDER 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT FOR MUCH THE REMAINDER OF THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD.  A FEW WEAK DISTURBANCES MOVE THROUGH THE UPPER FLOW...BUT 
MODELS ARE CURRENTLY KEEPING MAIN MOISTURE AND LIFT TO OUR NORTH

SIGNIFICANT WARM AIR INTO THE AREA AHEAD OF THE SURFACE LOW...WHICH 
IS EXPECTED TO TRACK BY JUST TO OUR NORTH.  THIS SHOULD LIMIT ANY

FRI NIGHT WILL HAVE TO ALLOW FOR A MIX AT THE ONSET NORTH.  GOOD 
SURGE OF MOISTURE AND DECENT LIFT INDICATED FOR SATURDAY...SO WILL 
GO HIGH LIKELY POPS.  MUCH COLDER AIR WILL PUSH IN SATURDAY 
NIGHT...TURNING ANY REMAINING PRECIP TO SNOW.  GFS DEPICTS FAIRLY 
SHARP UPPER TROUGH SWINGING ACROSS THE AREA SUNDAY...WHICH MAY HELP 
TO ENHANCE SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY. COULD SEE SOME SIGNIFICANT SNOW 
ACCUMULATION IN THE NORMALLY FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS...WILL CONTINUE

.DISCUSSION...A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO AND
TENNESSEE VALLEYS TODAY AND THURSDAY. MOISTURE IS LIMITED WITH BOTH SYSTEMS
WITH DEWPOINTS CURRENTLY IN THE SINGLE DIGITS AND TEENS. BEST LIFT AND
MOISTURE REMAINS NORTH OF THE AREA...BUT WILL CONTINUE WITH LOW 
CHANCE POPS FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE.  A MIX BAG
OF RAIN/SNOW ANTICIPATED TODAY CHANGING TO SNOW SHOWERS FOR 
OVERNIGHT.  BEST CHANCE OF SNOW WILL ALONG WITH WEST/NORTHWEST FACING
SLOPES. DUE TO THE LIMITED MOISTURE...FEEL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL 
BE MINIMAL.

THURSDAYS SYSTEM SEEMS EVEN WEAKER AND PLAN ON KEEPING POPS TO SLIGHT
CHANCE FOR MAINLY THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. ELSEWHERE...MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS WILL BE THE 
RULE WITH A MODERATION OF TEMPERATURES.

MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IS THIS WEEKENDS SYSTEM. MODELS ARE TRENDING WITH
A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK OF THE SURFACE LOW WITH FAIRLY STRONG SOUTHWEST
WINDS ANTICIPATED FOR SATURDAY.  IN RESULT WILL BE MAINLY A RAIN 
EVENT FOR SATURDAY.  AS SURFACE MOVES EAST OF THE REGION SATURDAY 
NIGHT...RAIN WILL CHANGE TO SNOW SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY FOR THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. AGAIN...A SIGNFICANT SNOWFALL IS POSSIBLE LATE SATURDAY 
NIGHT AND SUNDAY FOR THE FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA.  LATEST MESO-ETA SHOWS BETWEEN 6 
AND 10 INCHES OF SNOW FOR THE FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS WITH 
UP TO A FOOT FOR THE HIGHEST TERRAIN.  SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OF 1 TO 3 
INCHES ARE POSSIBLE FOR THE NORTH PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA.  
WILL ISSUE A SPS CONCERNING THIS POTENTIAL.

GENERALLY ONLY A DUSTING OR LESS FOR THE VALLEY LOCATIONS OF EAST 
TENNESSEE.

300 PM EST TUE JAN 18 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...THE COLD AIR IN PLACE ACROSS 
THE NRN MOST AREAS IS OBVIOUSLY HOLDING THIS AFTERNOON...AS TEMPS 
WERE STRUGGLING TO BREAK ABOVE 20 DEGREES ACROSS SWRN VA.  REST OF 
OUR AREA HAS WARMED INTO THE MID 20S TO MID 30S.  

THE UPSTREAM SHORTWAVE DROPPING QUICKLY SE FROM THE UPPER MIDWEST 
STATES...WILL BRING INCREASING CLOUDS LATE TONIGHT AND WED...BUT THE 
MAIN AREAS OF LIGHT PCPN (SNOW) SHOULD BE MOSTLY TO OUR NORTH.  I 
DID INCLUDE SOME 15 TO 25 PERCENT POPS FOR MAINLY SW VA AND NE TN
ON WED...WITH SOME SPRINKLES OR FLURRIES ALSO MENTIONED BRIEFLY FOR 
THE CENTRAL TN VALLEY COUNTIES.  HOWEVER...THIS IS A FAST AND 
PASSING FEATURE SO QPF...BOTH LIQUID AND SNOW AMOUNTS...WERE KEPT 
EXTREMELY LOW.  MAIN CHANGE TO WEATHER GRIDS WAS TO INDICATE THE 
TYPE OF PCPN AS SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES INSTEAD OF MIXED RAIN/SNOW
GIVEN THE COLD 850 MB TEMPS AND MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS. 

FOR TEMPS...SKIES WILL REMAIN CLEAR POSSIBLY RIGHT UP TO MIDNIGHT... 
THEN THE CLOUDS INCREASE ALONG WITH LOW LEVEL WARM AIR ADVECTION.  
MY MIN TEMP GRIDS WERE DRAWN TO REFLECT THIS WITH LOWS OCCURRING 
AROUND 06Z OR 07Z...THEN TEMPS SHOWN TO REMAIN STEADY OR RISE A BIT.
LOWS NEAR THE MOS BLEND LOOKED REASONABLE.  FOR MAX TEMPS ON WED...
FELT THAT THE COOLER MAV HIGHS WERE THE BEST CHOICE...ALTHO THE SRN 
VALLEY COULD EXPERIENCE AT LEAST PARTIAL SUNSHINE IN THE AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...COUPLE OF WEAK WAVES 
WILL MOVE THROUGH THE UPPER FLOW TO OUR NORTH WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH FRIDAY.   MAIN MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL BE TO OUR NORTH WITH 
SOME WEAK UPSLOPE FLOW DEVELOPING.  THIS WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS CONFINED TO NORTHERN AND EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAIN ZONES.   
MODELS BRING A RATHER STRONG COLD FRONT INTO THE REGION FOR 
SATURDAY.  SIGNIFICANT WARMING IS PROGGED OVER THE AREA IN ADVANCE 
OF THE FRONT.  IF THIS OCCURS AS DEPICTED...EXPECT MAINLY RAIN AHEAD 
OF THE FRONT...WITH A RAIN/SNOW MIX OVER HIGHER TERRAIN AND FAR 
NORTHERN ZONES.  BEHIND THE FRONT...SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY... 
COLDER AIR WILL MOVE IN...SWITCHING ALL LINGERING PRECIP TO LIGHT 
SNOW.  A COUPLE OF WEAK WAVES MOVE THROUGH TO OUR NORTH ONCE AGAIN 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY.  CONFIDENCE REMAINS LOW ON TIMING AND STRENGTH 
...THOUGH WAVES DO LOOK FAIRLY WEAK.  THEREFORE...FOR NOW...WILL 
KEEP FORECAST DRY FOR THIS PERIOD.

.DISCUSSION...LOTS OF SUNSHINE ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING WITH 
CLOUDS WELL OFF TO OUR NW AND S.  IN SPITE OF THE SUNSHINE...CURRENT 
TEMPS ARE ONLY IN THE SINGLE DIGITS OVER THE NORTH AND MAINLY TEENS 
ELSEWHERE.  12Z UPPER AIR PLOTS STILL SHOWED COLD 850 MB TEMPS 
RANGING FROM AROUND -5 DEG C SE TN TO -16 DEG C OVER SWRN VA.  12Z 
OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS SUPPORT HIGHS MOSTLY IN THE LOWER 20S TO LOWER 
30S TODAY.  THE BEST LOW LEVEL WARM AIR ADVECTION WILL OCCUR THIS 
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT...SO THE LINGERING COLD AIR MAY OFFSET SOME OF 
THE SUNSHINE TODAY.  I WILL MONITOR TEMPS FOR THE REST OF THE 
MORNING HOURS...AND ONLY UPDATE IF TEMPS SEEM TO BE RUNNING BEHIND

337 AM EST TUE JAN 18 2005

.DISCUSSION...RIDGE HIGH PRESSURE WILL HOLD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
TODAY ALLOWING FOR PLENTY OF SUNSHINE. AFTER A VERY COLD START...
ABUNDANT SUNSHINE WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM INTO THE 30S TO
UPPER 20S MOST LOCATIONS.

NEXT UPPER TROUGH WILL SWING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY.
MOST OF THE DYNAMICS AND MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH SYSTEM WILL STAY 
NORTH OF THE REGION...HOWEVER...EXPECT SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS OR 
FLURRIES FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SMOKY MOUNTAINS
LATE WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

A WEAK FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT
WITH ANOTHER CHANCE OF RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS...HOWEVER...STRONGER SYSTEM 
IS DEPICTED BY THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. 
CURRENT THINKING IS THAT INITIAL SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE NORTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA BEFORE REDEVELOPING OFF THE CAROLINA COASTS SUNDAY 
MORNING. A MIX BAG OF RAIN AND SNOW IS EXPECTED. COULD BE SOME 
SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL ACROSS THE FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND 
POSSIBLY SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING.

SURFACE RIDGE BUILDING ACROSS THE TN AND OHIO VALLEYS OVERNIGHT. 
SKIES SHOULD REMAIN CLEAR UNLESS A SCANT AMOUNT OF MID TO HIGH 
CLOUDS MOVE OVER FROM THE NW FLOW ALOFT.   THIS WILL FAVOR THE 
COLDER MOS MIN TEMPS...GENERALLY SINGLE DIGITS ALL BUT EXTREME SRN 
ZONES WHERE LOWS WILL FALL INTO THE 10 TO 14 DEGREE RANGE.  NW TO N 
WINDS WILL DIMINISH THIS EVENING...SO WE SHOULD HAVE WIND CHILL 
VALUES OF NO LOWER THAN -5 TO +5 DEGREES OVERNIGHT.  LOW TEMPS WONT 
BE ANYWHERE NEAR THE RECORD LOW TEMPS FOR THE 18TH (CHA 6...TYS 
0...TRI -3).  

FOR TUESDAY...MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES EXPECTED WITH A SLIGHT WARMING 
TREND.  MOS MAX TEMPS WERE QUITE CLOSE AND HARD TO DISAGREE WITH FOR 
THE CENTRAL AND NRN AREAS...WHILE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE CHOICES 
FOR THE SRN AREAS LOOKED BEST.

AIR MASS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALAHCINA REGION THROUGH WEEDNSDAY.  A 
WEAK SHORT WAVE WILL DROP THROUGH THE UPPER FLOW WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON/EVENING.  THE WAVE WILL BRUSH THROUGH OUR NORTHERN ZONES

300 PM EST SUN JAN 16 2005

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...A SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
OUR NORTHERN ZONES THIS EVENING AS A TROUGH AXIS ROTATES THROUGH.  
THIS WILL BRING THE MEAN FLOW FROM THE NORTHWEST. SHALLOW...LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE ATTACHED TO THE WAVE AND THE STRONG NORTHWEST 
(UPSLOPE) FLOW WILL GENERATE LIGHT SNOWFALL OVER EASTERN MOUNTAINS.  
SCATTERED SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED...MAINLY ABOVE 2500 FEET 
FROM THE SMOKY MOUNTAIN NP NORTHWARD.  SNOW AMOUNTS WILL BE 
GENERALLY LESS THAN 2 INCHES. HOWEVER...THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS COULD 
SEE LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS. ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUGH AXIS 
WILL BE LOCALLY BREEZY WINDS OF 10 TO 20 MPH WITH HIGHER GUSTS. THIS 
COMBINED WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF 10 TO 15 
DEGREES FAHRENHEIT WILL GENERATE WIND CHILLS OF NEAR ZERO DEGREES. 
ANOTHER PUSH OF DRY AND COLD AIR WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE AXIS ON 
MONDAY. DEW POINTS WILL FALL INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS AND AFTERNOON 
TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE TO REACH THE FREEZING MARK.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A COLD ARCTIC AIRMASS 
WILL SETTLE OVER THE REGION THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT BRINGING DRY 
CONDITIONS. A FAST-MOVING COLD FRONT WILL RACE TOWARD THE FORECAST 
AREA ON WEDNESDAY...WITH THE LATEST GFS MODEL RUN CONTINUING TO 
INDICATE LIMITED AVAILABLE MOISTURE. THUS...WILL PLAN TO MENTION 
MAINLY JUST AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS...BUT WILL ADD A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND THE MOUNTAINS OF NORTHEAST TN 
WHERE A FEW ISOLATED SNOW SHOWERS COULD BE GENERATED BY THE UPSLOPE 
FLOW. ANOTHER FAST-MOVING CLIPPER SYSTEM WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA 
ON SATURDAY...BRINGING THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME WINTRY PRECIP. 
HOWEVER...MOISTURE APPEARS TO AGAIN BE LIMITED WITH THIS SYSTEM... 
AND DONT EXPECT MUCH PRECIP TO BE GENERATED. GFS MODEL INDICATES 
THAT TEMPS WILL BE ABOVE FREEZING FOR MOST OF THE AREA...EXCEPT 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA...NORTHEAST TN AND THE MOUNTAINS WHERE LIGHT 
SNOW WILL BE POSSIBLE. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN ALSO INDICATES ANOTHER 
FAST-MOVING CLIPPER SYSTEM FOR SUNDAY...BUT THIS SCENARIO IS NOT 
SUPPORTED BY THE ENSEMBLE MEANS AND WILL PLAN TO KEEP THE FORECAST 
FOR SUNDAY DRY FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...COOL...DRY AIR WILL REMAIN IN 
PLACE AS HIGH PRESSURE STAYS IN CONTROL OF AREA WEATHER FOR THE REST 
OF THE WEEKEND. LOW TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECT TO FALL BELOW FREEZING 
OVERNIGHT WITH ONLY A FEW HIGH CLOUDS DRIFTING THROUGH FOR MINIMAL 
REDUCTION IN DIURNAL COOLING. ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON...A WEAK WAVE WILL 
MOVE THROUGH TO OUR NORTH. THE COMBINATION OF ITS ASSOCIATED 
MOISTURE AND UPSLOPE FLOW COULD GENERATE A FEW FLURRIES OVER HIGHER 
TERRAIN LATE IN THE DAY.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTINUE ACROSS THE APPALACHIAN REGION THROUGH WEDNESDAY...BRINGING 
SEASONAL TEMPS AND DRY CONDITIONS. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN HAS BACKED 
OFF WITH THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEXT FRONT ON 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...SO WILL PLAN TO MENTION ONLY AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS 
WITH DRY CONDITIONS CONTINUING THROUGH FRIDAY. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS FRIDAY NIGHT...AND 
SHOULD MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY. GFS MODEL INDICATES 
THAT IT WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR MIXED WINTER PRECIP...BUT ENSEMBLE 
MEANS SUGGEST THAT TEMPS WILL BE WARMER ON SATURDAY. WILL PLAN TO 
MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF MIXED PRECIP FOR SATURDAY...BUT RIGHT NOW 
THINK IT WILL MAINLY BE RAIN EXCEPT ACROSS NORTHEAST TN...SOUTHWEST 
VA AND THE MOUNTAINS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...A COOL...DRY AIR MASS HAS MOVED 
IN BEHIND YESTERDAY/S COLD FRONT WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
CONTINUING TO BUILD INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. ASSOCIATED 
SUBSIDENCE WILL PROVIDE CLEARING SKIES...WHICH COMBINED WITH 
LOWERING DEW POINTS AND DECREASING WINDS...WILL ALLOW OVERNIGHT 
TEMPS TO FALL INTO THE 20S IN MOST LOCATIONS. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A 
MOIST GROUND FROM YESTERDAY/S RAINFALL...THE LOW DEW POINTS WILL 
PREVENT SIGNIFICANT FOG FORMATION. HOWEVER...LIMITED PATCHY FOG IS 
POSSIBLE...MAINLY ALONG AREA LAKES. HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO 
CONTROL AREA WEATHER INTO SATURDAY FOR A DRY...SUNNY AND SLIGHTLY 
WARMER DAY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTINUE ACROSS THE APPALACHIAN REGION THROUGH WEDNESDAY...BRINGING 
SEASONAL TEMPS AND DRY CONDITIONS. A COLD FRONT SHOULD QUICKLY MOVE 
THROUGH THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WITH THE LATEST GFS MODEL RUN 
INDICATING ENOUGH MOISTURE WITH THIS FRONT FOR SOME PRECIP WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT AND THURSDAY. HOWEVER...ENSEMBLE MEANS SUGGEST THAT THE UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH DEPICTED BY THE LATEST GFS RUN FOR THURSDAY MAY BE TOO 
AMPLIFIED. ALSO...SINCE THE GFS MODEL HAS A FAIRLY CONSISTENT WET 
AND COOL BIAS IN THE EXTENDED...WILL CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST AT 
THIS TIME THROUGH FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
A COLD FRONT EXTENDING ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO AND LOWER MS RIVER 
VALLEYS WITH A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND ITS ASSOCIATED LINE OF SHOWERS 
ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. THIS LINE OF SHOWERS WILL LIKELY 
PRODUCE SOME GUSTY WINDS AS A STRONG LOW-LEVEL JET CONTINUES AROUND 
850 MB. HOWEVER...IT APPEARS THAT MOST OF THE 850 MB WINDS ARE NOT 
REACHING THE SURFACE...AS SURFACE OBS AND KMRX VAD WIND PROFILE 
REVEAL THAT WINDS ARE REMAINING BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA. THUS...WILL 
CANCEL THE WIND ADVISORIES FOR THIS EVENING. RAINFALL AMOUNTS WITH 
THESE SHOWERS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY MODEST....SO THINK THE THREAT OF 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL APPEARS TO BE MINIMAL. RAIN SHOULD MOVE OUT 
OF MOST OF THE AREA BY LATER TONIGHT...WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING 
INTO THE AREA ON FRIDAY. 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...COOL SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND AND WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL OF AREA WEATHER FOR MUCH OF NEXT 
WEEK.  ALOFT...AN UPPER TROUGH WILL BE POSITIONED OVER THE EASTERN 
U.S. PUTTING US UNDER ZONAL TO NORTHWESTERLY FLOW.  THIS WILL ALLOW 
COOLER...MORE SEASONAL TEMPERATURES TO FILTER INTO THE AREA.  A WEAK 
WAVE WILL DROP THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT BUT EXPECT GENERALLY AN INCREASE 
IN CLOUD COVER ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE.  ANOTHER WAVE MOVES IN 
FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  THIS ONE LOOKS STRONGER BUT STILL INSUFFICIENT 
FOR PRECIP.  HOWEVER...AS MODELS GET A BETTER HANDLE ON THIS FEATURE 
....MAY NEED TO INTRODUCE SOME LOW POPS ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT OR INTO 
THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SYSTEM STEAMING TOWARD AREA 
NOW...AND SHOULD BE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF AREA BY 12Z FRIDAY.  
EXPECTING ALL AREAS TO GET MDT TO HVY RAINS TONIGHT.  IF SYSTEM 
WASNT PROGRESSING SO STEADILY...WE MIGHT HAVE ISSUED A FF WATCH.  
THINK MOST AREAS WILL GET A GOOD 4-6 HOURS OF RAIN WITH EMBEDDED 
THUNDER.  PRECIP TOTALS SHOULD GENERALLY RANGE FROM 1.0-1.5 
INCHES...WITH MAYBE A FEW ISOLATED 2 INCH AMOUNTS.

HAVE ISSUED WIND ADVISORIES GENERALLY FOR HIGHER TERRAIN WEST AND 
EAST THAT STARTS UP LATER THIS MORNING...WITH GRADIENT WINDS TODAY 
AND CONVECTIVELY ENHANCED GRADIENT WINDS LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND 
TONIGHT.

FOR SEVERE POTENTIAL...THINKING IT MAY BE HARD TO GET MUCH ORGANIZED 
THIS FAR NORTH.  EVEN WITH STRONG DYNAMICS...LOOKS LIKE CAPE 
VALUES...SURFACE DURING THE DAY...AND ELEVATED TONIGHT...WILL REMAIN 
BELOW 300 J/KG.  850-500MB LAPSE RATES ONLY ABOUT 5.5DEG/KM AS 
WELL.  LOOKING LIKE MORE OF A HEAVY RAIN EVENT OVERALL.

TEMPS SHOULD BE WARM AGAIN TODAY...BUT FAIRLY EARLY HIGH TEMPS DUE 
TO INCREASING CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP MOVING INTO WESTERN AREAS.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MOST ATTENTION SPENT ON 
EDITING GRIDS ONLY AS FAR OUT AS FRIDAY.  HOWEVER...MINOR CHANGES 
WERE MADE TO MESH WITH NEIGHBORS ON LATER PERIODS...ESPECIALLY FOR 
MONDAY WHEN NW FLOW ALOFT MAY BRING A BIT MORE CLOUDINESS TO THE 
AREA THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.  OTHERWISE...THIS WILL BE A DRY PERIOD 
EXCEPT FOR LINGERING SHOWERS UP TO AROUND 14Z FRIDAY.

MODELS AND MOS SEEM TO HAVE FLIP-FLOPPED ON HOW MUCH COLD AIR 
ADVECTS INTO THE REGION FOR THIS WEEKEND.  GFS WANTS TO ADVECT MUCH 
COLDER AIR INTO THE REGION FOR SAT AND SUN THAN ETA...WHICH RESULTS 
IN A LARGE DISCREPANCY ON MIN TEMPS FRI NIGHT AND MAX TEMPS SATURDAY.
GIVEN THE MODEL INCONSISTENCIES FROM RUN TO RUN...MY CONFIDENCE ON 
WHICH WAY TO ADJUST TEMPS WAS LOW.  FOR NOW I KEPT TEMPS FOR THOSE 
PERIODS CLOSE TO THE MOS BLEND.  HOWEVER...I WILL COMMENT THAT THE 
UPPER FLOW ADJUSTING BACK TO A NEARLY ZONAL FLOW OVER THE WEEKEND...
WOULD NOT FAVOR THE STRONGER COLD AIR ADVECTION FROM THE GFS.  

ALL PRODUCTS...INCLUDING WEB PRODUCTS AND GRAPHICS...HAVE BEEN 
ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  THANKS TO ALL FOR THE COORDINATION THIS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS REVEALS A DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA... 
WITH SOME DOWNSLOPING OFF THE MOUNTAINS CREATING BREAKS IN THE 
CLOUDS ACROSS THE NORTHEAST HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS HAS 
ALLOWED TEMPS TO RISE TO ABOVE RECORD LEVELS ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST VA. HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO ADVECT INTO THE REGION 
FROM THE SOUTHWEST TONIGHT...PRODUCING MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES ACROSS 
MOST OF THE REGION. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH BRINGING THE 
NEXT COLD FRONT AND ITS ASSOCIATED RAINFALL INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND EVENING. A STRONG LOW-LEVEL 850 MB JET 
APPROACHING 50 TO 60 KTS IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE FRONT 
BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON...BRINGING BREEZY CONDITIONS ACROSS MOST OF 
THE AREA...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WITH SOME 
MARGINAL INSTABILITY EXPECTED TO DEVELOP TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING...THINK THAT SCATTERED TSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH SOME OF 
THESE TSTORMS BRINGING THE STRONGER WINDS ALOFT DOWN TO THE SURFACE. 
IN ADDITION TO THE LOW-LEVEL JET...THE REGION BECOMES LOCATED UNDER 
THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF A 250 MB JET STREAK...WHICH SHOULD HELP 
TO ENHANCE THE LIFT AND POTENTIAL FOR LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA. RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF ONE TO TWO INCHES APPEAR TO 
BE POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC...BUT 
FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE VALUES REMAIN FAIRLY HIGH. ALSO...THIS RAIN 
SHOULD MOVE FAIRLY QUICKLY THROUGH THE AREA...SO WILL HOLD OFF WITH 
A FLOOD WATCH AND INSTEAD MENTION LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IN THE 
ZONES AND IN A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS

FRONT.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT ACROSS THE 
MID WEST WITH DEEP SOUTHWEST FLOW ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. PATCHY 
DENSE FOG EARLIER THIS MORNING APPEARS TO EVAPORATING WITH MOSTLY 
CLOUDY SKIES CONTINUING ACROSS MOST OF THE SOUTHEAST. CLOUD COVER 
WILL BE THE TRICKIEST PART OF THE FORECAST THIS AFTERNOON...BUT 
THINK THAT WITH THE DEEP SOUTHWEST FLOW...THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD MIX 
ENOUGH FOR PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES TO DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON. 

CURRENT FORECAST TEMPS LOOK TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE WITH THE TRI-CITIES 
AREA LIKELY SETTING A NEW RECORD HIGH. WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE 
FORECAST THIS MORNING MOSTLY TO REMOVE MORNING FOG WORDING.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
355 AM EST WED JAN 12 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES GENERALLY 
AGREE THAT MAINLY BENIGN WEATHER WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE FIRST TWO 
PERIODS. UPPER LEVEL FLOW AMPLIFIES AS UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES FROM 
WEST. FLOW REMAINS ANTICYCLONIC OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
THROUGH THE FIRST TWO PERIODS. BASED ON UPPER FLOW REGIME AND 
GENERALLY DRY MID-LEVELS...HAVE LOWERED POPS SOMEWHAT IN THE SECOND 
PERIOD. GOOD SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW SHOULD ALSO CAUSE TEMPS TO APPROACH 
RECORD HIGHS TODAY...ESPECIALLY AT TRI. DID NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT 
CHANGES TO EXISTING TEMP GRIDS/FORECAST AS THEY AGREE WELL WITH GFS 
GUIDANCE TEMPS.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THRU TUESDAY)...MAIN SYSTEM FOR THIS PERIOD 
IS THE STRONG SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND COLD FRONT EXPECTED ON THURSDAY.
OPERATIONAL MODELS AND ENSEMBLES STILL SEEM IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE 
BRUNT OF THE CONVECTIVE PCPN TO OCCUR THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING
...WITH LITTLE IF ANY PCPN LEFTOVER AFTER 12Z FRIDAY.  SOME MINOR 
CHANGES WERE REQUIRED IN THE TIMING OF THE INITIAL ARRIVAL OF 
SHOWERS AHEAD OF THE FRONT THURSDAY MORNING...WITH GENERALLY ALL 
OFFICES AROUND DECREASING POPS FOR THURSDAY MORNING AND SHIFTING THE 
HIGHEST POPS TO AROUND 22Z TO 06Z PERIOD (LATE THU AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING).  ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WERE INTRODUCED DUE 
TO SOME INSTABILITY (MORE ELEVATED THAN SIMPLY USING SURFACE BASED 
LIFTED INDICES OR CAPES)...PLUS SOME STRONG POSITIVE OMEGA (LIFT)
AIDED BY PROLONGED PERIOD OF UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE OVER OUR REGION 
AS WE FALL UNDER THE RIGHT REAR QUADRANT OF A VERY STRONG UPPER 
LEVEL JET (GREATER THAN 150 KNOTS).  WOULD BE SURPRISED IF WE DO NOT 
NEED A WIND ADVISORY (AT LEAST) FOR HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...AS BOTH THE ETA AND GFS ADVERTISE THE LOW 
LEVEL JET REACHING 50 KNOTS OR BETTER.  

IF ANY BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS OCCUR...OR IF THE SHOWERS ARE A LITTLE 
LATER TO ARRIVE...THEN WE COULD EASILY REACH OR JUST EXCEED THE 
WARMER ETA MOS HIGH TEMPS THU.  OTHERWISE...OTHER CHANGES MADE WERE 
MAINLY TO SLIGHTLY RAISE TEMPS (MAX AND MIN) FROM FRIDAY THRU SAT 
NIGHT.  THIS WAS DUE TO LESS COLD AIR ADVECTION THAN EARLIER EXPECTED
...WITH BRUNT OF COLD AIR STAYING TO OUR NORTH OVER THE OHIO VALLEY 
AND GREAT LAKES REGION.  THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW LOOKS TO RETURN TO A 
ZONAL PATTERN AFTER PASSAGE OF THIS STRONG SHORTWAVE AND FRONT.  I 
DID NOT RAISE TEMPS OVER THE WEEKEND UP TO THE NEW MOS VALUES JUST 
YET...PREFERRING TO LET DAY SHIFT ADD SOME DEGREES IF THIS STILL 
LOOKS TO BE THE CASE.  ALSO...DID NOT WANT TO EXCEED TEMPERATURE 
TOLERANCES WITH NEIGHBORING OFFICES GRIDS.

.DISCUSSION...UPDATED THIS EVENING FORECAST TO INCLUDE THUNDERSTORMS FOR
THE PLATEAU...CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY.  AREA RADARS SHOW 
SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS MOVING ACROSS THE PLATEAU JUST EAST OF CSV.
ELEVATED INSTABILITY NOTED ON BNA SOUNDING THIS MORNING. GIVEN ISENTROPIC
LIFT OVER AREA AND WEAK SHORT-WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE REGION...FEEL 
CONTINUED CHANCE OF CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE THROUGH MIDNIGHT.  
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS WILL BE MAIN CONCERN DUE TO SOME TRAINING OVER

239 PM EST TUE JAN 11 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WED)...EXITING SHORTWAVE MAY KEEP SOME 
SHOWERS IN THE AREA EARLY TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY NORTH.  WILL GO WITH 
CHANCE POPS NORTH AND SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH FOR BEFORE MIDNIGHT 
SHOWERS.  THINK THUNDER CHANCES WILL HAVE DIMINISHED BY THEN...SO NO 
PLANS TO MENTION THUNDER FOR TONIGHT.  BIGGEST QUESTION FOR TOMORROW 
IS HOW MUCH CLOUD COVER...AND THUS HOW HIGH WILL THE TEMPS GET.  MET 
NUMBERS ARE RECORD VALUES FOR BOTH CHA AND TRI...AND EVEN THE MORE 
CONSERVATIVE MAV HAS A RECORD FOR TRI.  THINK THERE WILL BE QUITE A 
BIT OF CLOUDINESS AROUND...BUT PERHAPS A BIT LESS DURING THE 
AFTERNOON.  FOR NOW PLAN TO GO CLOSE TO MAV NUMBERS FOR LOWS TONIGHT 
AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE FOR HIGHS TOMORROW...BUT WOULD NOT BE TOO 
SURPRISED IF WE SEE TEMPS A FEW DEGREES HIGHER TOMORROW AFTERNOON.  

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MOISTURE INCREASES 
AHEAD OF A STRONG COLD FRONT WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BUT THINK PRECIP WILL 
HOLD OFF UNTIL THURSDAY.  WILL KEEP LOW CHANCE POPS FOR LATE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  SHOULD BE BREEZY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY WITH MODELS INDICATING 50-60KT AT 850MB 
AHEAD OF FRONT.  THE COLD FRONT IS ALSO MOVING A BIT QUICKER THAN 
PREVIOUS RUNS...WILL GO FOR LIKELY POPS BEGINNING THURSDAY MORNING 
AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON.  SHOULD BE A LITTLE DRIER ON 
THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH BEST CHANCES IN THE EARLY EVENING...THEN 
DECREASING POPS AFTER MIDNIGHT AS DRIER AIR WORKS ITS WAY IN BEHIND 
THE FRONT.  MOST OF THE AREA SHOULD BE DRY BY FRIDAY...BUT KEPT 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE MOUNTAINS ON FRIDAY MORNING.  DRY WEATHER 
SHOULD CONTINUE INTO TUESDAY.  COOLER WEATHER EXPECTED TO PUSH IN 
BEHIND THE FRONT...BRINGING A RETURN TO MORE SEASONAL TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHORTWAVE TROUGH STILL PROJECTED 
TO MOVE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY MID DAY TODAY. MOISTURE 
PROFILE NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE AND LIFT IS ONLY MODERATE WITH THIS 
FEATURE PER MODEL TIME HEIGHTS. THUS...DO NOT ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT 
RAIN EVENT ALTHOUGH COVERAGE COULD APPROACH LIKELY CATEGORY 
ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHERN TIER. THIS SYSTEM MOVES OUT BY 06Z 
WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE LINGERS SUGGESTING SKY 
CONDITIONS WILL REMAIN GENERALLY CLOUDY THROUGH THE SECOND PERIOD. 
TEMPS REMAIN WELL ABOVE CLIMO AS UPPER RIDGE RE-AMPLIFIES OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST. GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO BLEND OF GUIDANCE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...WARM FRONT LIFTS WELL 
NORTH OF THE REGION WEDNESDAY...AND WE EXPECT A BREAK IN THE RAIN 
UNTIL STRONGER SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT APPROACH LATE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  THUS...LOW POPS WERE REMOVED FOR WEDNESDAY 
MORNING.  MOST OPERATIONAL MODELS (EXCEPT ECMWF) AND ENSEMBLES 
SUPPORT A FAST TROUGH AND COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE THURSDAY NIGHT.  THIS 
LEAVES VERY LITTLE CHANCE OF SHOWERS AFTER 12Z FRIDAY...SO POPS WERE 
REMOVED FOR ALL BUT THE EXTREME ERN AREAS FRIDAY MORNING (WITH JUST 
20 PERCENT THOSE AREAS).  NO ADDITION OF THUNDERSTORMS FOR THURSDAY 
AT THIS POINT...BUT WILL RE-EVALUATE THIS AGAIN AS THURSDAY DRAWS 
CLOSER.  THE MOISTURE AND LIFT EXIT THE REGION WELL AHEAD OF THE 
ARRIVAL OF COLD AIR AND BELOW ZERO DEGREE C 850 MB TEMPERATURES ON 
FRIDAY...SO NO THREAT OF ANY WINTRY PCPN WITH THIS SYSTEM.  

FOR TEMPERATURES...MORE PLEASANT AND UNSEASONABLY MILD TEMPS IN THE 
PICTURE UNTIL THE FROPA ON FRIDAY MORNING.  MOS MAX TEMPS GENERALLY 
IN THE 60S WEDNESDAY LOOKED GOOD...FOLLOWED BY VERY MILD LOWS MOSTLY 
IN THE 50S WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  THURSDAY MAX TEMPS MORE CHALLENGING...
GIVEN THE ETA MOS MID 60S TO LOWER 70S VERSUSES THE MUCH COOLER 
MAV/GFS MOS HIGHS.  CONSIDERING THAT BOTH THE ETA AND GFS SUPPORT 
THE FAST TRACK...AND BRING IN MUCH CLOUDINESS AND NUMEROUS SHOWERS 
EARLY THURSDAY...I STAYED MUCH CLOSER TO THE COOLER MAV/GFS HIGHS 
FOR THURSDAY.  

OTHERWISE...NO CHANGES CONSIDERED OR MADE BEYOND FRIDAY FOR NOW.

UPPER LOW MOVING INTO SOUTHWEST DEEPENS THE TROUGH OUT WEST AND A 
SURFACE LOW OVER THE ROCKIES INTENSIFIES AS IT MOVES INTO THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS WEDNESDAY. INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL BRING 
LOW TEMPERATURES UP SEVERAL DEGREES TUESDAY NIGHT AND EVEN WITH 
CLOUD COVER WARM TEMPERATURES A FEW MORE DEGREES FROM THE MID 60S 
TUESDAY. SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS TN THURSDAY. A LINE 
OF SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WILL LIKELY FORM AHEAD 
OF THE FRONT DUE TO THE STRONG LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION...STRONG 
LIFT AND INCREASED SHEAR TO THE WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA IN WEST OR 
MIDDLE TN BUT NOT SURE IF THERE IS ENOUGH INSTABILITY FARTHER EAST 
AS THE CONVECTION MOVES INTO EAST TN. HAVE NOT ADDED THUNDER TO 
THURSDAYS WEATHER BUT LATER SHIFTS MAY NEED TOO AS THE TIMING AND 
INTENSITY OF THE SYSTEM BECOMES CLEARER. INCREASED POPS SLIGHTLY 
THURSDAY. BIG COOL DOWN STILL LOOKS LIKELY BEHIND THE FRONT FRIDAY 
BUT MOISTURE SHOULD BE OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA BEFORE A CHANGEOVER 
TO FROZEN PRECIPITATION COULD OCCUR. ARCTIC HIGH WITH ORIGINS IN 
NORTHWEST CANADA SETTLES OVER AREA FOR A DRY AND COLD WEEKEND. MOST

445 AM EST SUN JAN 9 2005

.DISCUSSION...SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLEAR ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
MORNING WITH SOME LOW CLOUD COVER OVER MAINLY THE WESTERN 
COUNTIES...THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES. SOME PATCHY FOG AND LOW 
CLOUDS ARE OVER PARTS OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. THE LOW CLOUDS ON THE WESTERN BORDER 
EXTEND WEST TO CENTRAL ARKANSAS AND SOUTHWEST ACROSS NORTHERN AL AND 
INTO CENTRAL MS. THESE LOW CLOUDS HAVE REMAINED IN THE SAME SPOT ALL 
NIGHT AND ON SOUNDINGS SHOW UP BELOW ABOUT 900MB. SKIES SHOULD 
BECOME MOSTLY SUNNY ACROSS THE PLATEAU BY LATE MORNING AS THE LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE MIXES OUT. DROPPED HIGH TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES 
FROM PREVIOUS PACKAGE BASED ON COOLER START THIS MORNING WITH A 
LITTLE MORE COLD AIR ADVECTION BEHIND SATURDAYS FRONT.

HIGH PRESSURE NOW LIES OVER THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTH CENTRAL STATES 
WITH ZONAL FLOW ALOFT THROUGH MONDAY. A NEW SURFACE LOW IS EXPECTED 
TO DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TUESDAY AND BRING MOISTURE NORTH 
AS A WARM FRONT INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT AND THE CHANCE OF LIGHT 
RAIN MAINLY TUESDAY AND TUESDAY EVENING AS A SHORTWAVE MOVES EAST. 
THE LOW PRESSURE AREA MOVES NORTHEAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND TAKES 
THE HEAVIER PRECIPITATION NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY. THEN 
COLD FRONT FORMS WEDNESDAY OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AS WESTERN UPPER 
TROUGH DIGS SOUTH. THIS SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT SHOULD MOVE ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS AND INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THROUGH TN THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY. A SIGNIFICANT COOL DOWN IS EXPECTED WITH THIS 
FRONT DROPPING TEMPERATURES FROM THE 60S THURSDAY TO 40S FRIDAY AND 
EVEN COLDER SATURDAY. 

TEMPERATURES MONDAY MORNING SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN 
TODAY AS SOUTHWEST FLOW BEGINS AS HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO SHIFT 
EAST. CROSS SECTION DATA INDICATES LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND LIGHT 
WINDS CONDUCIVE TO MORE EARLY MORNING FOG. TEMPERATURES MONDAY 
SHOULD WARM A FEW DEGREES ABOVE TODAYS WITH SOUTHWEST WINDS WITH 
LOWS MONDAY NIGHT SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER AS CLOUDS INCREASE. 
TEMPERATURES TUESDAY LOOK TO BE A DEGREE OR TOO WARMER THAN MONDAY 
AS SOUTHERLY FLOW INCREASES AND WARM FRONT PASSAGE. FOLLOWED A 
MAV/ETA BLEND FOR POPS WITH BEST CHANCE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. NO 
CHANGES TOO LATER PERIODS OF THE FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM...COLD FRONT SLOWED DOWN SOME E OF THE AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON. VERY EFFECTIVE DOWNSLOPE FLOW OFF CUMBERLAND PLATEAU HAS 
RESULTED IN GOOD CLEARING AND WARMING ACROSS VALLEY LOCATIONS. 
TEMPERATURES ARE HOLDING STEADY OR RISING SOME BUT DPS ARE STARTING 
TO DROP. LARGE CLOUD FIELD ON W SIDE OF PLATEAU MAKES OVERNIGHT 
SKIES WORRISOME. HOWEVER SOME MIXING WILL CONTINUE THIS EVENING AS 
LAYER CONTINUES TO DRY OUT. FCST SOUNDING DO NOT SHOW A STRONG CAP 
SO WILL STAY WITH PARTLY CLOUDY WORDING. WINDS DECOUPLE LATER AND 
EXPECT GOOD TEMP FALL. SHALLOW COOLED INVERSION SETS UP AND DESPITE 
GOOD T/TD SPREADS IN MOS DATA RECENT RAINS WILL LIKELY RESULT IN 
PATCHY FOG DEVELOPMENT. SUNDAY WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE WILL AGAIN 
SEE TEMPS WELL ABOVE NORMAL. A RELATIVELY FLAT WAVE MOVES ACROSS N 
PART OF CWA SUN NGT SUPPRESSING THE SFC RIDGE SOUTHWARD. MOISTURE IS 
LIMITED BUT A BIT OF CAA ADVECTION OCCURS WITH THE WAVE PASSAGE 
EARLY MON MORN. GOOD WARM UP FOR MONDAY WITH TEMPS NEARLY 20 DEGREES 
ABOVE NORMAL. LAYER FLOW INCREASINGLY SW MON NGT CONTINUING WARM 
TREND.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A WARM FRONT PUSHES 
THROUGH THE AREA ON TUESDAY...DECENT MOISTURE AVAILABLE...SO WENT 
WITH CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY.  SOME MOISTURE LINGERS INTO THE MIDDLE 
OF THE WEEK...BUT NOT MUCH OF A TRIGGER...SO KEPT ONLY 20 POPS FOR 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY.  STRONG COLD FRONT ENTERING REGION 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WENT WITH 30 POPS FOR LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  BEST 
CHANCES STILL ON THURSDAY WITH FROPA...WILL ALSO KEEP CHANCE POPS

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE LOW HAS TRACKED FROM 
CENTRAL MS NE INTO AND THRU MIDDLE TN OVERNIGHT...TO CURRENT 
LOCATION OVER NE KY.  THE ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT WAS ABLE TO PUSH 
JUST INTO SE TN...WITH COLD FRONT HAVING JUST MOVED EAST OF A BNA TO 
HSV LINE.  THERE WAS A VERY BRIEF TSRA AT CHA AIRPORT...BUT OVERALL 
THE COVERAGE AND INTENSITY OF SHOWERS HAS BEEN ON THE DECLINE DURING 
THE WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING.  HAD TO DRAW POP/WX GRIDS TO MATCH 
LATEST RADARS...AS WELL AS MESH WITH NEIGHBORS GRIDS.  THUS...MAY 
VERY WELL HAVE TO UPDATE THE GRIDS AND ZFP AROUND DAYBREAK IF THE 
SHOWERS CONTINUE TO MOVE RAPIDLY EAST AND DIMINISH.

MODELS INDICATED THE STRONGEST LOW LEVEL JET UP TO AROUND 09Z THEN 
DIMINISHING AS THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES QUICKLY NE AWAY FROM 
OUR REGION.  USING OUR MESONET OF FIRE WX AND SCHOOL SITES...WE 
FOUND ONLY A FEW HIGHER SPOTS GUSTING UP TO 24 MPH...AND MOST 
LOCATIONS BARELY IN THE 10 TO 20 MPH RANGE SUSTAINED.  THUS...WE 
FELT IT WAS PRUDENT TO CANCEL THE LAKE WIND ADVISORY FOR OUR E TN 
MTNS AND CHEROKEE/CLAY COUNTIES JUST BEFORE THE ZONE ISSUANCE.

THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS A BIT SHARPER/DEEPER THAN EARLIER THOUGHT 
AND SOME COLD AIR ADVECTION IS POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON.  HOWEVER...
THERE IS ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME CLEARING FROM THE WEST THIS 
AFTERNOON (AS WELL AS WEAK DOWNSLOPE LOW LEVEL WINDS).  SO...OPTED 
FOR A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE THE COOLER GFS/MAV MOS MAX TEMPS TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...NEW MOS AND 08/00Z MODELS INDICATED CLEARING SKIES AND 
A LITTLE COOLER MIN TEMPS THAN PREVIOUS FORECAST.  GRIDS WERE 
ADJUSTED IN THIS DIRECTION...BUT NOT AS COLD AS THE GFS/MAV MOS JUST 
YET.  

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...ZONAL FLOW WITH SURFACE HIGH 
OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL AND SOUTHEAST STATES AND RIDGING ALOFT WILL 
PREVAIL SUNDAY AND MOST OF MONDAY. THIS WILL KEEP THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY AND THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS MILD WITH HIGHS IN THE 60S AND 
LOWS IN THE MID 30S TO MID 40S. MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY FLOW 
BECOMES MORE SOUTHWEST AS CLOSED UPPER LOW MOVES INTO CA AND SURFACE 
LOW DEVELOPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INCREASING MOISTURE OVER THE 
MS VALLEY AND INTO THE TN VALLEY. A WARM FRONT LIFTS ACROSS THE AREA 
TUESDAY WITH ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR A CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN POSSIBLY 
LINGERING INTO WEDNESDAY BUT. NEXT SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT DUE TO 
ARRIVE THURSDAY NIGHT WHICH SHOULD DROP TEMPERATURES FINALLY DOWN TO 
MORE NORMAL TEMPERATURES ON FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM....SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOTS OF MID AND HIGH 
CLOUDS ALREADY STREAMING NE...WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE SHORTWAVE 
EXPECTED TO MOVE EAST FROM THE CENTRAL ROCKIES LATER TODAY.  THESE 
CLOUDS HAVE INHIBITED RADIATION FOG FROM DEVELOPING THIS 
MORNING...SO I OPTED FOR NO MENTION OF FOG IN TODAYS WEATHER 
GRIDS.  SOME QUESTION IN MY MIND AS TO HOW FAST RAIN ACTUALLY 
DEVELOPS LATER TODAY...WITH NGM SLOWEST TO PRODUCE LIGHT RAIN.  FOR 
CONSISTENCY AND TO MESH WITH NEIGHBORS GRIDS...I CHOSE TO STAY THE 
ETA/GFS COURSE IN BRINGING LIKELY OR HIGHER POPS EVERYWHERE BY LATE 
AFTERNOON TODAY.  THE ISENTROPIC LIFT AND SATURATION OF THE AIRMASS 
DOES SEEM TO JUSTIFY THE HIGHER MOS POPS FOR THE FIRST PERIOD.  GFS 
MOS HIGHS LOOKED BETTER THAN THE WARMER ETA VALUES.

FOR TONIGHT...LOOKS LIKE A WIDESPREAD LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN EVENT...
WITH HIGHEST POPS ROUGHLY FROM 00Z TO 06Z...SO POPS WERE NUDGED UP 
TO 100 PERCENT ACROSS THE BOARD AT THAT TIME.  ALSO...LOWERED QPF 
GRID FROM 06Z TO 12Z AS LIFT AND MOISTURE WILL BE DIMINISHING BY 
THAT TIME.  A BLEND OF ETA/GFS MOS FOR MIN TEMP FORECAST LOOKED 
BETTER THAN GOING RIGHT WITH THE COOLER GFS LOWS.  

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL HAVE 
PASSED THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY AT 12Z WITH RAIN 
QUICKLY COMING TO AN END. BOTH ETA/GFS END THE RAIN AROUND 12Z SO 
POPS ARE A LITTLE HIGHER THAN ETA GUIDANCE DUE TO THE RAIN ENDING IN 
THE MORNING. ETA WANTS TO HOLD ONTO LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SATURDAY WITH 
THE GFS CLEARING SKIES OUT DURING THE AFTERNOON. WITH WINDS STAYING 
WEST TO SOUTHWEST BEHIND FRONT NO COLD AIR ADVECTION AND ACTUALLY 
WARMER TEMPERATURES. ODDLY ETA HAS TEMPERATURES SEVERAL DEGREES 
WARMER EVEN WITH CLOUDS SATURDAY. PREFER THE COOLER MAV NUMBERS 
SATURDAY AND USED A BLEND SATURDAY NIGHT. OVERALL UPPER AIR PATTERN 
REMAINS UNCHANGED WITH TROUGH IN THE WEST AND RIDGING SOUTHEAST 
WHICH KEEPS THE FORECAST AREA IN A MILD SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. ETA 
TRIES TO SHOW ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE MOVING THROUGH SUNDAY TO GIVE A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN AND CONSIDERABLE CLOUDS BUT STAYED WITH THE 
DRY AND SUNNIER GFS. ANOTHER WEAK SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER THE LOWER MS 
VALLEY MONDAY...THEN MOVES NORTHEAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TUESDAY 
AND STRENGTHENS. A STRONGER SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
WEDNESDAY AND BRINGS A MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANCE OF RAIN TO THE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...PRECIP ASSOCIATED WITH A FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY IS APPROACHING THE CWA THIS MORNING.  THESE SHOWERS WILL 
SPREAD WEST TO EAST ACROSS THE AREA THROUGHOUT THE MORNING... 
LINGERING OVER WESTERN ZONES INTO THE AFTERNOON.  ADDITIONALLY... 
WINDS WILL INCREASE WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE.  LOCALLY GUSTY 
CONDITIONS WILL DEVELOP WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS EXPECTED OVER 
HIGHER TERRAIN.  A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS MAY REMAIN OVER FAR 
NORTHWESTERN MOUNTAIN INTO THE EVENING HOURS...BUT THE MAIN SYSTEM 
WILL HAVE EXITED THE AREA AND WE WILL BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS FOR THE 
NIGHT.  BEHIND THE FRONT...COOLER TEMPS WILL BEGIN TO FILTER IN.  
TONIGHT/S LOWS ARE EXPECTED TO BE NEAR 10 TO 15 DEGREES COOLER THAN 
THIS MORNINGS READINGS.  
 
.LONG TERM...(FRI THROUGH WED)...MODELS GENERALLY AGREE THAT WE WILL 
HAVE A FAIRLY WET PERIOD FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND FRIDAY NIGHT. A 
SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS THROUGH THE OHIO 
VALLEY...AND LOW LEVEL SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL BRING CONSIDERABLE 
MOISTURE.  UPPER DYNAMICS SHOULD BE AIDED BY A ROUND OF ISENTROPIC 
LIFT.  WILL GO LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL FOR POPS FRI AND CATEGORICAL 
ALL ZONES FRI NIGHT.  DRIER AIR IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN MOVING IN 
SATURDAY...SO WILL END POPS BY AFTERNOON.  DRY WEATHER SAT NIGHT 
INTO MONDAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE MOVES OVER AND THEN OFF TO OUR 
EAST...AND SHALLOW RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE AREA.  WILL GENERALLY LEAVE 
LATER PERIODS OF THE FORECAST AS THEY ARE FOR NOW.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ACROSS 
THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY WITH ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH 
ACROSS WEST TN. TEMPS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA REMAIN UNSEASONABLY 
MILD THIS EVENING...AND SHOULD ONLY SLOWLY FALL OVERNIGHT WITH 
STEADY SOUTHERLY WINDS...EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER AND HIGH DEWPOINTS. 
AREA RADARS REVEAL THAT RAIN REMAINS CONFINED MOSTLY TO THE OHIO AND 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEYS...AND THAT THINK THE FORECAST AREA WILL 
REMAIN DRY UNTIL LATER TONIGHT TOWARDS SUNRISE. WILL PLAN TO UPDATE 
THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO MENTION RAIN AFTER MIDNIGHT AND TO 
TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY WITH 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OFF THE GA AND SC COAST. AREA RADARS REVEAL 
ONLY A FEW PATCHY AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA...WITH THE BEST COVERAGE ACROSS NORTHERN MIDDLE TN AND 
SOUTHEAST KY. SCATTERED AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN SHOULD CONTINUE THIS 
EVENING ACROSS THE NORTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA AS A 
WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE MOVES THROUGH. UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES 
MORE AMPLIFIED TOMORROW AS A TROUGH DEEPENS ACROSS THE LOWER MS 
RIVER VALLEY. AS A RESULT...AN UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA BRINGING DRY AND CONTINUED UNSEASONABLY MILD 
CONDITIONS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY WITH 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OFF THE GA AND SC COAST. AREA RADARS REVEAL 
ONLY A FEW PATCHY AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA...WITH THE BEST COVERAGE ACROSS NORTHERN MIDDLE TN AND 
SOUTHEAST KY. SCATTERED AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN SHOULD CONTINUE THIS 
EVENING ACROSS THE NORTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA AS A 
WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE MOVES THROUGH. UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES 
MORE AMPLIFIED TOMORROW AS A TROUGH DEEPENS ACROSS THE LOWER MS 
RIVER VALLEY. AS A RESULT...AN UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA BRINGING DRY AND CONTINUED UNSEASONABLY MILD 
CONDITIONS.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION

306 PM EST SUN JAN 2 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...SHORTWAVE IS NOW EXITING 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND HAS WEAKENED. ONLY A 
FEW HUNDREDTHS WERE OBSERVED AT MOST LOCATIONS EXCEPT ABOUT A 
QUARTER OF AN INCH AT BIG SOUTH FORK ON THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU. SKIES HAVE BEEN MOSTLY CLOUDY WITH SOME BREAKS THIS 
AFTERNOON OVER SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE PLATEAU AREAS. WIDE RANGE 
OF MID AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES DEPENDING ON CLOUD COVER FROM THE MID 
50S TO MID 60S. TODAYS WEATHER PATTERN HAS BASICALLY REMAINED 
UNCHANGED THE LAST FEW DAYS EXCEPT FOR A LITTLE MORE LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE AND THE PATTERN DOES NOT CHANGE MUCH THROUGH MONDAY WITH A 
BREAK IN THE PRECIPITATION FOR MOST OF TONIGHT. ANOTHER WEAK 
SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH LATE TONIGHT WITH A STRONGER SHORTWAVE 
MONDAY AFTERNOON AS A COLD FRONT SAGS A LITTLE FARTHER SOUTH TO NEAR 
THE OHIO RIVER. HAVE FOLLOWED CLOSER TO THE GFS DUE TO ITS BETTER 
HANDLING OF TODAYS RAIN. WILL HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE RAIN TONIGHT MAINLY 
LATE EXCEPT BEST CHANCE EARLY NORTHEAST SECTIONS. WENT JUST BELOW 
GUIDANCE TEMPERATURE BLEND BASED ON PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES FOR AWHILE 
THIS EVENING AND TRENDS THE LAST FEW NIGHTS. ADDED SOME PATCHY FOG 
IN TONIGHT TOO.      

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)
AN INTERESTING MEDIUM RANGE DISCUSSION FROM NCEP THIS MORNING.  THE 
UPPER LEVEL FLOW PATTERN WILL REMAIN GENERALLY WEST TO SOUTHWEST 
THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 11 DAYS.  THE OVERALL PATTERN ACROSS NORTH
AMERICA WILL CORRELATE WELL WITH THE JAN 1950 PATTERN.  AFTER REVIEWING
JAN 1950 CLIMATOLOGY ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE...REVEALS THAT JAN 1950 WAS
THE WARMEST JANUARY ON RECORD AT TRI...TYS...AND CHA.  ALSO, JAN 
1950 WAS THE 2ND WETTEST AT TRI...8TH WETTEST AT TYS AND 15TH WETTEST
AT CHA.  ALL STATIONS HAD BETWEEN 8 AND 9 INCHES FOR JAN 1950.  THE 
PATTERN COULD EASILY SWITCH BACK TO A COLDER PATTERN LATE THIS 
MONTH...BUT FOR NOW SEEMS THE FORECAST AREA WILL REMAIN MILD AND 
WETTER.

NOW FOR THE EXTENDED...MONDAY NIGHT-WEDNESDAY...COLD FRONT WILL TRY TO
PULL SOUTH TOWARD THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA BEFORE 
STALLING.  A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES IN WEST-SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL 
BRING PERIODS OF SHOWERS OVER THE REGION WITH THE BEST CHANCE NEAR 
THE FRONT.  WILL CONTINUE WITH HIGHEST POPS FOR THE NORTHERN HALF OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. OTHERWISE...RIDGING OVER FLORIDA WILL CONTINUE TO 
KEEP THE AREA UNSEASONABLY MILD.

FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...A STRONGEST SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE 
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY PROVIDING ENOUGH EMPHASIS TO 
PULL A WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY MORNING. 
WILL UP POPS TO LIKELY AREA-WIDE FOR THURSDAY MORNING.  GIVEN THE 
FAST WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT...SURFACE HIGH WILL QUICKLY BUILD INTO THE 
AREA THEN MOVE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS THURSDAY NIGHT.

FOR FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASES AS THE FLOWS 
RETURNS TO THE SOUTH...SO WILL MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH INCREASING 
CLOUDS AND SHOWER CHANCES.  ANOTHER FRONT WILL PULL INTO THE AREA 
FOR SUNDAY...KEEPING THE WET PATTERN GOING.

246 PM EST SAT JAN 1 2005

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS AFTERNOON. SKIES HAVE BEEN MOSTLY SUNNY 
FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH TEMPERATURES REACHING NEAR 70 IN 
A FEW SPOTS WITH MOSTLY MID TO UPPER 60S ACROSS THE AREA. UPPER 
LEVEL RIDGING CONTINUES OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH A PERSISTENT 
TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN STATES. A STATIONARY FRONT OVER THE NORTHERN 
OHIO VALLEY SEPERATES MUCH COLDER AIR TO THE NORTH AND MILD AIR TO 
THE SOUTH. THIS FRONT WILL MOVE LITTLE THROUGH SUNDAY. A SHORTWAVE 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MID MS VALLEY TONIGHT AND ACROSS THE OH AND TN 
VALLEYS LATE TONIGHT AND SUNDAY. THE BEST LIFT WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
ON THE NORTHERN EDGE OF THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT AND SUNDAY. 
TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO BE MILD WITH LOWS IN THE 40S AND HIGHS 
IN THE 60S. WENT SLIGHTLY BELOW GUIDANCE TONIGHT FOR LOWS BECAUSE OF 
THE EXISTING RELATIVELY CLEAR SKIES ALTHOUGH DEWPOINTS HAVE RISEN TO 
THE MID 40S TO NEAR 50. FOR HIGHS SUNDAY FOLLOWED CLOSER TO MET 
NUMBERS WITH MOST LOCATIONS NOT GETTING RAIN AND WITH A MOSTLY 
CLOUDY SKY. IF BREAKS DEVELOP AND SUN COMES THROUGH TEMPERATURES MAY 
REACH NEAR 70 AGAIN.     

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)
FOR SUNDAY NIGHT-TUESDAY...WEST TO SOUTHWEST FLOW CONTINUES ALOFT 
KEEPING STATIONARY FRONT TO OUR NORTH.  A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES WILL 
MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY PRODUCING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS...MAINLY 
OVER THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA.  MAIN STORY WILL BE 
CONTINUED PRESENCE OF UPPER HIGH OVER THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES 
WITH UNSEASONABLY WARM AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES FOR JANUARY.

FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING...A STRONG SHORT-WAVE AND 
ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WITH A COLD 
FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY MORNING.  HAVE UPPED CHANCES OF 
SHOWERS FOR THIS TIMEFRAME GIVEN EXPECTED FROPA.  HAVE DECIDED TO 
KEEP CHANCE OF THUNDER OUT FOR NOW SINCE LIFTED INDICES REMAIN 
GENERALLY STABLE.

FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...SURFACE HIGH BUILDS INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA THEN MOVES EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. GFS SHOWS A QUICK 
RETURN OF SOUTHERLY WINDS ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE HIGH WITH 
INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT BY LATE FRIDAY.

FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL 
SPREAD CLOUDS BACK INTO THE REGION WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN SPREADING 
NORTH ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS.
