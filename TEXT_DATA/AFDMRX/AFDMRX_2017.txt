.DISCUSSION...Radar, observations, and webcams show area of snow 
across far east Tennessee and Mountains are diminishing to 
flurries. Even though additional snow accumulations will be light 
with only one-half to one inch across the higher elevations, plan 
on keeping winter weather advisory until 1 am. 

After talking with local EMs and media, light snow accumulations
this evening has produced numerous slick spots on area roadways,
especially across the higher ridges and Mountains. Due to heavy
traffic through early morning, will continue winter weather
advisory through 1 am ET.

Made some minor adjustments to going Mins and hourly temperatures.

.AVIATION...A broad long wave trough is holding position over the
eastern states with a couple weak short waves riding through the
fast flow aloft. One wave is generating some lower vfr ceilings
mostly east of interstate 40. Tough to get these clouds to
dissipate in the cold resident air mass across the Great Valley,
but would expect some clearing rather soon at tys followed by the
formation of another lower vfr ceiling late tonight into Monday.
Some lower vfr decks will hang around tri through much of the

244 PM EST Sun Dec 31 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...Colder air will continue to 
push in overnight.  The cold temperatures will combine with the wind 
to produce wind chill values easily in the wind chill advisory range 
for the mountains of E TN, and a bit more borderline in the 
plateau/SW VA/much of SW NC area although still low enough to keep 
the current advisory running in those areas as well. The remaining 
lower clouds are expected to clear out late this afternoon/early 
evening, but additional clouds are expected to move into at least 
northern central areas in the cold advection later tonight into 
early Monday before clearing out again in the late morning/early 
afternoon.

.LONG TERM...(Monday Night through Sunday)...Cold. Nothing new 
there. Northern Valley might be stuck below freezing until next 
Sunday, with the only probable exception of this Wednesday. 
Fortunately, dry weather will accompany the cold spell, except for
20% pops over the northern mountains of northeast TN and 
southwest VA on Thursday. But return flow will bring milder and 
more moist air back into the area beginning Sunday, with precip 
moving in Sunday night (possibly precipitating into a slightly 
subfreezing air mass during Monday morning).

of the sky cover given persistent low clouds in much of the

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The cold air will continue to build over the region on Sunday as a
large 1050mb surface high slides southeastward from Alberta and
into the northern Great Plains. A shortwave will rotate through 
the longwave trough across the Eastern CONUS today deepening the
trough and ushering in more cold air. Lift ahead of the shortwave 
will also bring some additional clouds to northeast Tennessee and 
southwest Virginia, but do not expect any precipitation with such 
a dry boundary layer. PWs are expected to drop below 0.2 inch by
Sunday evening as the Arctic airmass continues to advance into 
the region.

Sunday night, minimum temperatures are expected to range from the
low single digits to mid teens across the region. Additionally, 
winds are expected to be between 5 and 10 kt with slightly higher 
winds possible at times across the higher elevations as well as
the southern plateau and ridgetops around Chattanooga. This will 
lead to very cold wind chills of -5 to -10 along the higher 
elevations of the mountains, southwest Virginia, southwest North 
Carolina, and the Cumberland Plateau. For these areas, have issued
a Wind Chill Advisory between midnight and noon on Monday. The 
Valley is currently expected to see wind chills between 0 to 5 
which is above criteria for our forecast area. However, have continued
an SPS for the entire forecast area to highlight the dangerously 
cold wind chills across the region. The air will also be very dry
with PWs of around 0.1 inch or less and Td near zero across lower
elevations and below zero across the higher terrain.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...
A very cold Arctic air mass will remain over the Southern 
Appalachian Region through the extended. This will mean overnight 
lows generally in the teens and single digits and highs mainly in 
the teens and 20s and occasional low 30s. With these 
temperatures...even light winds can create significant wind 
chills. On Monday night when the coolest air is expected to settle
into the area...higher elevations could see wind chills of minus 
10 to minus 20 degrees and a Wind Chill Advisory or possibly a 
Wind Chill Warning may be needed. A couple of weak impulses riding
trough the upper flow may briefly generate an occasional band of 
clouds and could produce a few pockets of light snow or flurries 
across far northern areas and over the higher elevations of the 
East TN Mountains. The initial impulse should move in Wednesday 
night into Thursday and another around Friday. With the very dry 
and cold air mass in place...there will be little moisture 
available and should see little if any accumulations.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...Cold advection will weaken 
overnight and the lower clouds and any lingering higher terrain 
flurries will move out. Wind chill values will be low overnight 
especially in the higher terrain, but appears they will not be low 
enough for any wind chill advisory. A weak surface wave will be 
moving by well to our south on Sunday, and may push some clouds into 
the far south/southeast areas, but any precipitation should stay out 
of our area. Elsewhere Sunday there should just be some mainly high 
clouds especially north as next weak upper disturbance slides by. 
Will generally undercut MAV temps a bit for especially Sunday as 
they look high given strength of the arctic air.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday Night through Saturday)...Cold. The northern
Valley may only see above-freezing temperatures during Wednesday 
afternoon alone. Brrr. High temps in the southern valley will be 
in the 30s through the period. Precipitation will be slim to none,
with slim mostly meaning 20% pops over the northern mountains of 
northeast TN and southwest VA Thurs and Fri. Beyond this forecast 
period, a pattern change will allow milder and more humid air back
into the area around Days 8 or 9.

VFR conditions still expected to continue through the period. Low
clouds will be on the increase this morning, but expect ceilings 
to remain at or above 3000 feet. Can't rule out brief MVFR 
ceilings at TYS and TRI, but confidence is too low to include in 
the TAF. Winds begin to increase from the west today with winds 
turning to the north after 0z Sunday behind the cold front. Winds 
are not expected to be very strong but could be gusty at times 
this afternoon, especially at TRI.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Longwave troughing continues across the Eastern CONUS in the short
term. Isentropic upglide leading to low-level clouds on Saturday 
ahead of a cold front that is expected to move through late in the
afternoon. There is very little moisture associated with this 
front, so do not expect much, if any, precipitation with it. One 
of the main forcing mechanisms for precipitation will be weak 
northwest flow behind the front with the potential for some very 
light snow or flurries across the higher elevations. However, 
because of the weak upslope component of about 10 kt or less and 
limited moisture and lift, do not expect more than a potential 
dusting to a couple tenths of an inch of snowfall across the 
highest elevations. With continued troughing and low clouds, 
expect temperatures to be about 5 to 10 degrees below normal on 
Saturday.

A much colder and drier airmass advects into the area tonight in
the wake of the cold front, and it should stick around for the
foreseeable future. This will result in temperatures plummeting
into the teens across much of the forecast area. Light winds will
make it feel even colder with wind chill values expected to be in
the single digits across the plateau, parts of NE TN, and SW VA
with potential wind chill values between 0 and -5 across the 
higher terrain of SW VA late Saturday night and early Sunday 
morning.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...
The weather pattern through the extended generally has a cold 
surface high pressure in control with a large...broad upper trough
positioned over the eastern U.S. As a result...expect little 
change in the weather with very cold air in place. Weak 
disturbances in the upper flow will occasionally ride through the 
upper trough and bring additional surges of cold air. Overnight 
lows in the teens and single digits across the Tennessee Valley 
can be expected each night. Sunday may see highs in the mid 30s to
mid 40s but for the rest of the time frame...temperatures will 
struggle to climb into the 20s...and maybe occasional into the low
30s. Overall...it looks dry through the period...however...a weak
disturbance on Wednesday night and another around the Friday time
frame may generate a few areas of light snow or flurries...mainly
over far northern locations and along the East TN Mountains. No 
accumulations are expected at this time.

Small adjustments will be made with the evening update to better
match the forecast up with obs, which have fallen a little faster
than forecast. Low temps may also need a slight downward nudge
based on the latest LAMP guidance, but with increasing high and
midlevel clouds and some light wind, we will not have ideal
radiational cooling conditions. Low clouds will start to increase
toward sunrise, and tomorrow will likely begin with overcast
clouds in most spots.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...About to start the plunge 
into the deep freeze. Frontal passage Saturday morning will be the
first wave of colder air. By Sunset Saturday, many places will be
hovering around freezing and about to take the dive into the sub-
freezing world for several days. Specifically, everything should 
be pretty quiet most of the night tonight, then early tomorrow 
morning, as the front comes through west to northwest winds will 
pick up and clouds will roll in. The cloud cover will probably 
hold in most of the afternoon across the northern 1/2 to 2/3 of 
the area, but may erode across the southern counties. Putting in a
mention of snow showers or flurries for tomorrow afternoon in the
northeastern valley as well as in the mountains from the Smokies 
northward. The cold air in the lower levels of this airmass will 
likely support small ice crystal growth in these areas, but this 
moisture is several thousand feet below the dendritic growth 
zones, where it is expected to be dry--so accumulations should be
minimal.


.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...Will see little change 
in the overall weather pattern through the extended forecast period 
with a very cold air mass remaining in place.  Upper trough firmly 
in place over the eastern CONUS will keep temps below normal. 
Additional surges of cold air will cycle through the trough next 
week, reinforcing the cold temperatures. In fact, there is a good 
chance from Saturday night through Wednesday afternoon that much of 
the area will remain below freezing. 

For the most part, despite the cold temperatures, we will stay 
mainly dry through the extended forecast period. A weak wave on 
Saturday night may bring some light flurries across far northern 
areas and the higher elevations of the East TN mountains. However, 
with very little moisture available, nothing more than a dusting is 
expected. Another wave on Wednesday night may produce similar 
flurries, but at this point, not enough moisture is present to 
include snow showers in the grids.

.AVIATION...
Abundant sunshine across the area now, but will begin our
transition toward the end of this forecast period that will be the
first of many cold waves into the area for the next week or more.
For the rest of this afternoon and overnight, generally few
problems with light winds throughout, and only some VFR low clouds
late tonight developing ahead of a cold front. Immediately after
the cold front there will likely be OVC conditions from then thru
the end of the forecast. Thinking frontal passage roughly 12-13z
at the three sites. Also post-frontal winds be picking up from 
the west or northwest. Going with CIGS of 040 for now, though tough
to get a feel for this height as looking upstream and on NAM 
trajectories, the air mass that hits us behind the front will be 
undergoing some modifications along the way. Also, SREF CIG 
guidance all over the place with quite a few members showing CIGS 
around 015--but thinking that 040 is a more likely middleground.

Next surface ridge is settling into the area after trough and
stratocumulus clouds moved to the east. Today's forecast is in
good shape. Have only updated hourly temps as mountain temps were
pretty far behind warm-up curve--I think mainly because the sun

dissipated. Will only send out updates to products that have 
hourly temperatures as Max Temp forecast looks good.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A weak surface trough and convergent boundary is resulting in a 
broken deck of low clouds tonight. This is leading to temperatures
being a little warmer than forecast tonight, but the air is dry 
enough that any clearing before sunrise could result in a quick 
drop in temperatures early this morning.

With troughing over the Eastern CONUS and continued NW flow aloft,
temperatures will remain below normal with occasional weak 
shortwaves providing for a few high clouds. The boundary layer 
remains very dry, so with limited clouds during the day on Friday,
temperatures are expected to recover and top out slightly higher 
than on Thursday (but still about 5-10 degrees below normal).

Ahead of the strong cold front this weekend, WAA and isentropic 
lift on Friday night will result in increasing cloud cover and 
keep minimum temperatures "warm" mainly in the mid to upper 20s. 
It really looks like the next 24-36 hours may be about the warmest
temperatures that we'll experience over the next week.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...
Will see little change in the overall weather pattern through the
extend with a very cold air mass remaining in place. Upper trough
over the eastern U.S. will continue to allow additional surges of
cold to advect into the region through the next 7 days. As a 
result...will see highs struggle to climb. Saturday will be the 
warmest day with highs in the mid 30s to mid 40s. From Sunday 
through the rest of the period...high temperatures should reach 
only in the 20s and occasionally into the low to mid 30s with lows
falling into the teens and single digits. For the most part...we 
will stay dry. Only concern of precip will be late Saturday into 
Saturday evening and again Wednesday night into Thursday where a 
few pockets of mainly light snow and flurries will be possible 
across far northern areas and over higher elevations of the East 
TN mountains. At this time...expect little to no accumulations.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
Cold air mass continues to spread across the area.  A short-lived 
and weak warming will start tonight, as return flow aloft slowly 
brings slightly warmer air as well as more moisture toward the area. 
Expecting a layer of stratocumulus to start to spread/develop this 
afternoon and accelerate development tonight and spread northeast 
across a good part of the area during the late evening.  Then late 
tonight as a low-level trough moves through the stratocu will be 
shoved off the east by about daybreak. The NAM 875 mb RH and Wind 
showed this scenario pretty well.

The clouds should limit radiational cooling, so min temps tonight 
should not be as cold, and then the slightly warmer air mass 
Saturday should help to get temps across the valley into the 40s for 
all but the most northern parts of the valley.  Temps today have 
generally been running a little warmer than original guidance 
values. 925 mb temps for tomorrow look a little warmer for most area-
-think this will be reflected at the surface.


LONG TERM (Friday night through Thursday)... Model runs continue 
to come into better agreement for much of the long term forecast, 
showing an extended period of very cold temperatures and dry 
conditions. 

Troughing will stay in place over the eastern CONUS through next 
week. This trough will help temperatures below normal. A few 
shortwaves will rotate through this longwave trough, bringing 
reinforcing shots of cold air. The first of these shortwaves will 
rotate through on Sunday. Model solutions continue to trend drier, 
and opted to remove slight chance snow showers from the forecast for 
Sunday/Monday. Following this shortwave, a strong surface high 
settles over the area and will keep temps will be around 20 degrees 
below normal on Monday. There's a good chance we may not see temps 
above freezing from Saturday night through Tuesday night, with 
windchills well into the single digits or lower during the overnight 
hours.

Another system will approach the area during the Wednesday/Thursday 
timeframe. The upper air pattern splits with the northern stream 
bringing a strengthening clipper system out of Canada. The southern 
stream brings a wave of Gulf moisture up the eastern seaboard. For 
now, the 12/28 12Z runs of both the GFS and ECMWF have the brunt of 
both systems missing us with just some light snow from the northern 
system grazing our area Wednesday night. However, there is still 
plenty of model differences and plenty of time -- we will have to 
closely monitor the development of these systems and how they 
interact over the coming days. Of additional note, this storm could 
pull even colder air into the region, with the Superblend showing 
Thursday night lows in the single digits across the entire area (and 
even sub zero in the mountains). Again -- we will have to continue 
to monitor this system through next week as there is still plenty of 
time for conditions to change.

Cold air mass in place now as 1040 mb High centered in Ohio and
its associated ridge settle into the area. Winds should continue
to subside this afternoon as the pressure gradient continued to
relax this afternoon. Temperatures warming a little ahead of
diurnal curve at a few places. Bumped up Max Temp a few places by
1-2 degrees, but I think a lot of this accelerated warming is
simply quick mixing of shallow inversion. Also dewpoints were
running a little too dry at many locations--looking upstream,
looks warranted to bump up dew points by a few degrees in general.
No other changes for now.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...The modified arctic airmass 
will remain in place today with temperatures possibly even a 
degree or two colder than Wednesday's maxes. The good news is 
there will be some sunshine even though a weak short wave will 
move across the Southern Appalachian region later in the day into 
the evening hours. Some clouds will accompany the wave with 
limited possibility of a flurry across some of the higher terrain 
in the northern part of the viewing area.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...The latest model runs have
come into better agreement for this period, particularly for this
weekend and into Monday. A broad longwave trough will continue to
keep temperatures below normal for Friday and Saturday. Precip 
chances on those days will stay to our north near the jet stream,
which will be over the OH Valley and central Appalachians. 

A shortwave trough within the broad cyclonic flow will push the jet 
southward and into KY/VA on Sunday. Moisture will be limited, but 
with such a cold air mass, there will be a slight chance of light 
snow for Sunday afternoon and Sunday night with the trough passage. 
There will also be a surge of arctic air that will bring 
temperatures that are around 20 degrees below normal on Monday. The 
strong surface high with origins in central Canada will settle over 
the Deep South through Tuesday, and we may not see temps above 
freezing for an 84 hour period from Saturday night through Tuesday 
night. Will lean temperatures a little below the Superblend numbers 
these days.

For Wednesday and Thursday, the models show a more amplified pattern 
with a shortwave trough deepening over the eastern Conus, and 
cyclogenesis near the Mid Atlantic coast. The 00Z ECMWF is more 
bullish with precip for us - a change from its drier previous run - 
but for now will stick with a dry forecast with continued below 
normal temps as shown by the GFS and GEFS mean.

333 PM EST Wed Dec 27 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...Surface high pressure 
currently to our NW will slide further east through this short-term 
period and continue to filter in dry and cold air across the 
forecast area. At the current hour, there is still some cloud cover 
hanging in across northern areas but expecting a mostly clear night 
as clouds will continue to erode. The biggest focus during the short-
term will be the overnight temps. Lows will range from the single 
digits to the mid and upper teens, which is around 10 to 15 degrees 
below normal. It wouldn't be a bad idea to leave a faucet dripping 
overnight to prevent any pipes from freezing. High temps for 
tomorrow remain relatively unchanged with highs in the mid 30s to 
near 40, which is around 10 degrees below normal. The day starts out 
clear but clouds will increase from out of the northwest as we get 
into the afternoon hours.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...The long term 
period will have continued troughing across the Eastern CONUS with
temperatures remaining well below normal. Models continue to show
a weak shortwave passing through KY and SW VA Thursday night and 
Friday morning, but the GFS has trended weaker with this system 
more in line with the ECMWF solution. For this reason, lowered 
PoPs on Thursday night and Friday morning and have just a mention 
of snow flurries across parts of NE TN and SW VA. For Saturday, 
another shortwave across the Great Lakes will rotate through and 
bring a surface low through the Ohio Valley with a trailing cold 
front. Once again, very little moisture is expected, but a few 
flurries may be possible across SW VA and NE TN on Saturday 
morning. Cold and dry air at the surface will continue to be 
reinforced across the region.

By Sunday, models are in better agreement, but continue to have 
issues with run to run consistency. The GFS and ECMWF are in much 
better agreement with a surface low across the Gulf Coast on Sunday. 
A 300mb jet streak is expected to be oriented across the Ohio Valley 
and central Appalachians which would place our region within the 
right-entrance region with upper-divergence and favored synoptic 
lift. A shortwave will also be rotating through the longwave trough 
across the Eastern CONUS and provide additional support for ascent 
and light precip on Sunday and Sunday night across the forecast 
area. Both operational and ensembles favor only light precipitation 
at this time on the order of about 0.1 inch across SE TN and SW NC 
with only a few hundredths near the KY border and in SW VA. Lack of 
run to run consistency still increases uncertainty with the 
precipitation forecast for Sunday into Monday. If precip does occur, 
the atmospheric profile does support all snow at this time. 

The biggest story will be the very cold air through the period, 
especially Sunday through the middle of next week. GEFS and ECMWF 
ensembles continue to show the likelihood of most of the forecast 
area not making it above freezing from Sunday evening through 
Wednesday midday with lows in the teens or potentially single
digits.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A chilly air mass remains in place 
today with dry advection in the lower levels of the atmosphere. Cold 
high pressure slips further east to cover much of the eastern half 
of the nation. Efficient radiation under the influence of the 
surface pressure system will lead to low temperatures a good ten to 
fifteen degrees below normal tonight.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...The period will be 
characterized by a broad longwave trough across the eastern Conus 
and western Atlantic. The fluctuation of the jet stream position 
and shortwaves passing through the broader trough will bring low 
chances of light precip and a surge of bitterly cold air over the 
weekend. The trend of the latest GFS has been toward a drier 
period, closer to the ECMWF, but there is still a significant 
difference in their depictions of the finer details of the jet 
position and shortwave timing that adds uncertainty. Will follow 
this drier trend in the forecast, with only slight chance PoPs 
over the weekend. 

A channeled vort max is shown by the GFS, SREF, and ECMWF to clip 
our northern sections on Thursday night, with the NAM being a dry 
outlier. Will have just a mention of flurries in northern sections 
that period. Friday will be dry but the models begin to diverge on 
Saturday, with the ECMWF showing a more amplified flow aloft due to 
a closed low over the Great Lakes that pushes an arctic air mass 
into the area. The GFS delays this until Monday due to its broader 
flow. Slight chances of snow and flurries will be mentioned Saturday 
night through Monday, but there does not appear to be a period where 
the models indicate significant snow accumulation. Extremely cold 
temperatures will build in over the weekend, but models differences 
make the timing uncertain. Will follow the temps from the 
Superblend, which has highs in the 20s Sunday and Monday, with lows 
in the single digits to low teens Monday night.

.DISCUSSION...
Temperatures over the forecast area are generally in the 20s and
30s where winds were light and variable. Abundant cloud cover this
evening has caused temperatures to only slowly fall. This may
continue to be the story overnight, however it will take only a
brief time of scattered conditions to get those temperatures to
drop to the current forecast low temperatures. Should clouds have
enough influence on the overnight temps and it stays
broken/overcast, we could see anywhere from three to seven 
degrees warmer by sunrise, rather than the colder, current 
forecast.


Just adjusted hourly temperatures, RH and apparent temp grids to 
account for current warmer temps through about 4 am before 
temperature trends fall back in line with forecast lows.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...(Tonight and Wednesday)...A
broad upper trough is positioned over the eastern U.S. with 
generally zonal flow over the Southern Appalachian Region. A weak 
short wave moving through the flow tonight will increase clouds 
tonight and may bring another weak shot of cooler air into the 
area for Wednesday. Highs on Wednesday should only reach into the 
30s and low 40s. The air mass remains quite dry and minimal 
moisture associated with the short wave so expect dry conditions 
throughout the short term.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Monday)...The long term 
continues to look unsettled with various shortwaves impacting the 
region. The main story appears to be the increasing confidence in 
very cold air to start the new year.

A shortwave late Wednesday will bring a cold front through the area 
with a very strong surface high to our north. With surface winds 
expected to lighten late Wednesday night, temperatures are expected 
to drop into the teens and low 20s with dew points primarily in the 
single digits.

For Thursday, a weak shortwave to the south should provide lift for 
some precip, but it appears that it will remain far to our south 
with dry air over our area. A stronger shortwave will move 
southeastward and pivot across the area on Thursday night with a 
trailing surface cold front, but moisture looks limited with this 
system as well. However, there may be enough moisture, lift, and 
orographic forcing from westerly/northwesterly flow that there will 
be slight chance and chance PoPs for some light snow showers across 
the higher elevations of northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia. 

On Saturday, another northern stream shortwave across the Great 
Lakes and Ohio Valley will bring a surface front through the region 
which will usher in another reinforcing shot of colder air. Moisture 
is once again limited but may have some slight chance PoPs for light 
snow showers or flurries across the higher elevations of northeast 
TN and southwest Virginia.

Model solutions greatly diverge past Saturday and uncertainty is 
very high late this weekend into early next week. The GFS continues 
to dry and develop an area of low pressure along the Gulf Coast with 
moisture over our region Sunday and Sunday night which is also 
supported by GEFS members. The ECMWF and CMC continue to be dry with 
the Gulf low suppressed far to the south with slight differences 
with respect to timing. Therefore, went no higher than chance PoPs 
for Sunday through Monday because of the very high uncertainty. 
Exactly how the Sunday through Monday forecast plays out will depend 
on a small, relatively weak shortwave and how it evolves from a 
closed low over the eastern Pacific. Models routinely have a 
difficult time with this type of setup and this seems to be no 
exception. Regardless, we'll have to continue to watch for at least 
the potential for winter weather Sunday through Monday.

The one variable that models do seem to have agreement on is that 
very cold air will impact the region to start the new year. 
Ensembles are also in overwhelming agreement with a colder than 
normal airmass for the early to middle part of next week with 
forecast temperatures to be 10-20 degrees below normal. In fact, 
GEFS members currently indicate an 80 percent or greater chance of 
temperatures remaining at or below freezing during the 48 hour 
period from Sunday night through Tuesday night. While the ECMWF 
ensembles are not quite as cold, a majority still indicate max 
temperatures near freezing for most of the area early next week.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Wednesday night)... 
A broad upper trough and jet stream will persist over TN this 
morning, and will continue to keep broken to overcast midlevel cloud 
cover during that time. Dry low level air will evaoprate any precip 
that falls from the midlevels, as seen on radar. In the afternoon, 
the moisture should retreat as the jet lifts northward, and with 
scattered clouds and near neutral advection in a light low level 
flow, highs will be a warmer than yesterday, in the uppper 30s to 
mid 40s. On Wednesday the surface high over the northern Plains 
today will build east into the OH Valley, while the 850 mb flow 
turns more NW behind a weak trough and brings stronger cold 
advection. The passage of the shortwave trough will increase 
midlevel clouds again, and there will be a strong push of drier and 
colder air. Highs on Wednesday will return to the 30s in most spots, 
with lows Wednesday night in the teens to lower 20s.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Monday)...
The unsettled pattern continues with POP guidance bouncing around
a bit. Latest Blend lowered POPs for Thursday and Thursday night 
and raised POPs slightly for Friday. SREF and MREF output seems 
more stable and used them to come up with final POPs. Also used 
these for Thursday and Thursday night QPF and snow grids (very 
light). Looking mostly dry for Friday through Saturday, then 
guidance still pointing at some threat for wintery precip centered
on Sunday. For Sunday going with POPs in the 40s, but that could 
increase if MREF guidance holds true-
-it shows an axis of precip oriented along the Appalachians rather 
than the guidance for several days of keeping the main moisture and 
precip in a W-E band well to our south. No end in sight for this 
cold spell--looks like we will ring in the New Year with bone-
chilling cold.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...Cold high pressure will
continue to build into the area tonight with overnight lows
falling into the upper teens and 20s. A weak short wave will track
through the zonal flow aloft late tonight into early tuesday
morning...staying north of the Southern Appalachian Region.
However...we will see bands of clouds move through associated with
the short wave and a few flurries will be possible...mainly over
northern locations and portions of the East TN mountains. By
Tuesday afternoon...expect conditions to improve and with a little
sunshine...temperatures should warm into the mid 30s to mid 40s.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Sunday)...The weather story for the 
extended time-frame will be a long-wave trough over the eastern two-
thirds of the nation with generally northwest to west flow aloft 
over the Tenessee Valley and southern Appalachians. The southern 
stream will remain south of the area. Due to the persistent 
northwest flow aloft, unseasonably cold air will be the rule. Models 
show an artic air-mass moving south into the region for next 
weekend. This air looks frigid and will highlight in the HWO.

The GFS/ECMWF show periods of light wintry precipitation, but 
amounts are light. One such time is Thursday across the south where 
a wintry mix of light snow, sleet, and possibly freezing rain. Agai, 
amounts will be light. Confidence is low for precipitation from 
Thursday and Friday.

Greatest confidence of precipitation will be the orographic snows 
behind arctic front Saturday. Snow accumulations are possible across 
the higher elevations, such as High Knob and Roane/Smoky Mountains.
Wind chills will be a concern with this artic blast.

The extended range models show dry and cold weather continuing into 
early next week.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)... 
Scattered snow showers across the northern portions of the area will 
have a diminishing trend as the upper trough axis moves east of the 
area over the next few hours. Low clouds will be decreasing as well 
with weakening 850 mb cold advection, however high clouds will be 
broken in the afternoon as the jet stream remains near the TN/KY 
border. Models show increasing midlevel moisture and weak lift 
tonight as a vort max passes to our north. Any precip is unlikely to 
reach the ground with the low levels remaining very dry with 
subsidence, so will maintain the dry forecast for tonight.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...
The first four periods of this part of the forecast, Tuesday 
through Wednesday night, look dry overall, but on the chilly side 
with temperatures about 6-10 degrees below normal. Then starting 
Thursday we continue to look at an unsettled pattern with models 
waffling on the placement and timing of moisture and lift. Still 
the same as the last couple of mornings when looking at this 
overall pattern of the main moisture connection to our south and a
number of clippers in the pipeline that zip through the area very
quickly. For Thursday night, there is a small clipper that will 
be humming along at about 45 kt to the ESE. GFS puts out about 1 
to 2.5" if snow across much of the valley with this clipper, but 
it seems to be going too fast to drop this much precip. Also, Euro
is not even showing anything with this clipper over our area. 
Will just go with 35-50% POPs for Thursday night and we'll see how
future models handle it.

GFS is also cranking out more snow on Sunday, but MREFs are a lot 
more conservative with QPF probabilities only 10-20% of 0.1" liquid 
equivalent (LE) for Sunday and 20-30% probs for 0.1 LE for Sunday 
night. So this still seems like a lot of clippers without a lot of 
organization.  I will say that there is a trend in the MREFs that 
the Sunday night into Monday timeframe that we could tap into the 
moisture plume south of us--long way off, but worth watching.

Minor tweaks made with this update to mesh with current

slick roadways in the HWO and SPS overnight with temperatures 
quickly dropping below freezing as the cold front crosses the

evaporate any lingering moisture from area roadways, but isolated
slick spots are possible, especially in sheltered areas where

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...
A shortwave trough will drop south tonight towards the region. A 
quickly moving surface low will race to the northeast across the 
central and northern Appalachians with a trailing cold front
across our area. This will provide sufficient lift for 
precipitation this evening and the early overnight hours. We will
start the night mild but temperatures quickly fall behind the 
front as colder air advects into the region and due to evaporational
cooling from light precipitation. However, moisture is limited 
with this system with PW values of around 0.4 inches this evening 
decreasing to 0.1 inch by sunrise Monday. Because of the low 
moisture, precip amounts expected to be light. SREF means continue
to indicate only a few hundredths of an inch of liquid precip for
most areas with some mountain locations in northeast TN and
southwest VA around 0.1 inch. As winds shift to the west- 
northwest tonight, a weak northwest flow snowfall event will setup
across the higher elevations. This will provide additional 
orographic lift across the higher elevations where slightly higher
precip amounts can be expected. Total snowfall accumulation 
should remain light due to the limited moisture and recent warm 
surface temperatures. We may see a dusting to a few tenths of an 
inch across the plateau, southwest VA, and northeast TN. 
Accumulations up to one inch will be possible generally at or 
above 4000 feet elevation along the TN/NC mountains from about 
Sevier County northeastward.

It will dry out quickly on Monday with subsidence in the wake of 
the shortwave and surface high pressure moving into the region. 
The cold airmass and continued northwesterly flow will keep
temperatures well below normal on Christmas with max temperatures
in the 30s which will be about 10-15 degrees below normal.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Saturday)...
On Tuesday...surface high pressure will be lifting out of the 
area with a weather disturbance riding along the zonal flow to our
north. At this time...this disturbance should only provide us 
with an increase in clouds and possibly a few flurries over 
northern locations and along higher elevations. Temperatures 
should be slightly below normal. Wednesday...we should be between 
systems with cooler air continuing to filter in for a cool...dry 
day. Thursday through the rest of the extended...model consistency
has been quite poor and confidence is low. The overall weather 
pattern will become rather active. A low pressure system will move
through around the Thursday/Friday time frame. Track and timing 
remain in question. With a cool air mass in place...overnight 
precip should fall as snow with a wintery mix of rain...snow and 
possibly brief freezing rain or sleet expected during the day 
Thursday and Friday. Another system is expected to move through 
during the weekend. Again...there continues to be significant 
uncertainty with the timing and exact track. Precipitation with 
this system should be primarily snow with a mix of rain and snow 
at times.

cover increase across the entire area with MVFR expected at all

and intensity appear too low to cause any visibility issues at
this time. Clouds begin to clear out behind the cold front late
tonight and early Monday morning. The gusty winds will be of

.DISCUSSION...
Made a few minor adjustments to forecast temperatures and dew
points based on current observations. Overall, forecast looks on
track with low clouds expected to persist for much of the day. Low
pressure across the Ohio Valley is expected to bring a chance of
rain and snow showers to the region this evening and tonight.
Moisture will be limited, but expect the potential for minor
accumulations across the higher elevations with between a dusting
and one-half inch across the plateau, mountains, and higher 
elevations of SW VA and NE TN with up to about one inch across 
the highest elevations. The northwest winds tonight will result in
this being mainly a northwest flow snowfall event with orographic
lift providing for most precipitation across the higher 
elevations. May see some flurries across the lower elevations but 
do not expect to see any accumulation more than possibly a dusting
tonight across the central and northern valley.

to shift to the southwest and increase to 10-15 kts with gusts to
20-25 kts late in the afternoon, and the mixing from these winds
may help cigs rise to VFR. A cold front will pass through in the
evening, shifting winds to a more W-NW direction with gusts in the
20-30 kt range. VFR cigs will hover at the MVFR/VFR margins but
should gradually become predominantly VFR after midnight.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
As a shortwave trough and the jetstream move into the OH Valley
region today, a surface low will take shape over OH late in the
day. This will strengthen the W-SW flow across our area in the
21-00Z time frame, bringing strong cold advection and steepening
lapse rates under the upper trough axis. Initially, scattered rain
showers will develop late this afternoon, with a quick change to
snow showers as temps aloft fall rapidly. Although moisture is 
shallow, model soundings show saturation extending up to the -15 C
level, adequate for dendrite growth across the northern half after
00Z. Thus, some light accumulations will be possible in SW VA and
NE TN, but mainly at elevations above 3000 ft where a 30 kt
upslope wind will enhance lift. Up to one inch is expected in the
NE TN mountains and High Knob in SW VA. 

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...
At the beginning of this period on Monday/Christmas morning, we will 
be under the influence of a large and dominating upper trough that 
covers most of the CONUS. At the surface strong high pressure will 
be continuing to settle into the area.  The whole forecast area will 
be frozen at the surface and up through the entire vertical profile. 
This dry pattern will continue through Wednesday night for most of 
the area.

Models continue to be unsettled with handling the scenario for 
Thursday through Saturday, with an west-east oriented moist plume 
across the SE US and about three clippers racing across the Ohio 
Valley. The 00z models generally are keeping the moist plume farther 
south--mainly south of our area, while the southern parts of the 
Ohio Valley clippers are trying to dip southward into our area. 
Going with POPs for Thursday through Saturday without too much 
gradient since the southern areas are closer to the plume and the 
northern areas are closer to the lift of the clippers. Trimmed back 
some of the higher POPs a bit (from their initial Blend values), 
since the elements don't look to be organizing very well.

For Temps, pretty much went with Blend values.  

As these days get closer, we will need to watch to see if the models 
start moving the southern plume farther north and any associated 
cold overrunning scenario looks to evolve, especially over the top 
of a frozen surface.  As it stands right now, the current scenario 
does not look too threatening.  Will briefly mention in HWO that we 
will continue to monitor Thursday through Saturday.

.SHORT TERM...(This Evening through Sunday Night)...Fronto-genetic
band is just about east of the area. Tight pressure gradient
around the strong short-wave and associated jet is also
diminishing with winds dropping nicely. Will allow wind advisory
and high wind warning to expire.

For Tonight, plenty of residual moisture which will allow for
patchy fog to develop. Already developing across the Plateau
counties. Plenty of low-level moisture will also keep the area
mostly cloudy as well.

For Sunday and Sunday night, another fast moving short-wave and
associated jet will moving across the Ohio Valley with southwest
winds returning ahead of this system. The southwest winds will
produce some isentropic lift, but main feature of interest is cold
air aloft with system late tomorrow. The cold air aloft and
relatively mild surface temperatures will steepen the lapse rates
over the area with low-level CAPES of 60-100 J/Kg. This will
produce scattered showers with the best coverage from mid-
afternoon to late evening Sunday. 

The vertical temperature profile cools off by late day Sunday and
especially in the evening allowing the rain showers to mix with or
change to snow showers or flurries. The forcing will be enhanced
some by orographic lift into the west/northwest facing slopes
producing light snowfall across the higher elevations, generally
at or above 3kft. Snowfall of 1 to possibly 2 inches across the
highest elevations.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...On Christmas Day...cool... 
dry air will be moving in with flow aloft becoming zonal.  The dry 
conditions will remain over the Southern Appalachian Region through 
Tuesday with temperatures slowly moderating.  Models begin to 
diverge through the rest of the extended and confidence is low. 
Wednesday...models indicate a weak wave moving through to our south 
and this could bring a few isolates showers into southern areas. 
Temperatures across the south should be warm enough for mainly rain. 
Wednesday night into Friday...models trend towards bringing in the 
next system. Consistency on timing and track of this feature has 
been quite poor and for now will just continued with chance pops 
through the period.  Currently...the temperature profile looks like 
mainly snow during the overnight hours...then transitioning to 
mostly rain during the daytime.  On Saturday...another system will 
be approaching the area...continuing the chance of precipitation.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)... 
Strong forcing along a cold front will bring a line of heavy rain 
showers to the area, with the possibility of low-end severe wind 
gusts from embedded bow segments within a convective line. Timing of 
this line is expected to be between 12-18Z. While instability is 
very weak, the latest RAP shows some weak CAPE in southern sections, 
so a slight chance of thunderstorms will be added in that area. 
Deeper convection may bring high winds aloft to the surface, with 
isolated damaging winds possible. Gradient winds ahead of the front 
will be gusty but below wind advisory criteria outside the 
mountains;  will continue the current advisory for the higher 
elevations, adding the SW NC counties, and continue the SPS for 
the rest of the area. Rain will be exiting this afternoon, with a 
shift of winds to the west behind the front, along with decreasing
gradient winds. While dry air aloft builds in through the 
afternoon, low level saturation remains in place tonight, and will
keep cloudy skies and drizzle through the night.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...
At the beginning of this period weak high pressure is building 
into the region with relatively mild temperatures Sunday morning. 
However, during the day on Sunday a re-enforcing shot of cold air 
will be hitting, then the strong high pressure from the Plains 
will begin to build into the region, with colder air. Going with 
the low POPs for Sunday with higher POPs north Sunday night as a 
shortwave trough swings through quickly. The Plateau, SW VA, NE TN
and the mountains could all get some snow on the ground Sunday 
night and wake up Christmas morning to a dusting or a little more,
depending on exact location. The higher mountains might get up to
an inch, while valley locations look to be less than a 1/2 inch 
in those previously mentioned locations. 

Conditions look to be dry Monday through Tuesday night, then a big 
question as to the rest of the week as models are in high 
disagreement on the axis of the moisture that may or may not be 
centered over the area for part of the time from Wednesday through 
Friday.  Chances for precip for Wednesday and Wednesday night look 
to be mainly across our southern counties, but for Thursday and 
Friday better chances of precip spread across the area.  There 
should be some chances of wintry precip during this time, but it's 
low confidence on how significant this weather system will be in 
the latter part of the week.

Vis and cigs vary widely across the TN Valley at the moment, and
conditions will continue to evolve through the night as a 
southerly downslope flow develops at TYS and TRI. This may result
in vis/cigs rising at those locations, possibly to VFR. Without
the downslope wind, CHA should remain in the IFR or MVFR range.
Rain is expected to spread across the area in the late
morning/early afternoon, lowering conditions to MVFR at all sites.

311 PM EST Fri Dec 22 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
Shortwave trough across the Southern Plains will move
northeastward tonight tapping into deep Pacific and GoM moisture.
A cold front is located across western TN and KY extending
northeastward into the Ohio River Valley. Most of the rainfall
tonight will be located along that surface boundary to our north
and west. However, before midnight tonight, 850-700mb
frontogenesis through Middle TN and along the TN/KY border will
result in enhanced rainfall across the Cumberland Plateau. This 
area of frontogenesis will shift northward during the night with 
lower PoPs after midnight.

The upper shortwave will pass through the forecast area on
Saturday with a surface cold front providing deep lift for rain. 
Some of the rain could be locally heavy at times with PWs near the
97th-99th percentile of climatology. With 6 hour FFG values of 
2”-3” and storm total rainfall to be primarily between 1” 
and 3” across the forecast area, do not expect to have much of a
widespread flash flood risk beyond localized flooding in the 
standard low lying poor drainage areas. The strong lift and deep 
moisture will not be located over our area for near as long as 
areas west of us which are seeing much higher rainfall totals.
Thunder does not appear to be much of a risk with very low
instability.

Strong winds will also be a concern on Saturday morning as an 
anomalously strong southwesterly 850mb low-level jet with winds 
of 60+ kt will impact the region. While the angle of winds and 
lack of strongly negative omega across the mountain foothills do 
not favor a mountain wave high wind event, believe that the very 
strong 850mb winds will still result in Wind Advisory criteria 
high winds across the higher elevations of the TN/NC mountains. 
May also have some gusty, sub-advisory winds along the plateau, 
southwest Virginia, and along ridgetops within the valley. These 
gusty winds, along with saturated soils, could lead to some downed
trees and localized power outages.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Thursday)...
A few showers may linger across the area Saturday evening...with 
coverage slowly decreasing through the night as a cold front 
continues to pull away from the region. Temperatures should remain
warm enough through much of the night for mainly rain...though a 
mix of rain and snow will be possible over higher elevations late 
in the night. An upper trough moving through Sunday into Sunday 
night will provide a reinforcing shot of light showers. Mainly 
scattered light rain Sunday with more isolated showers overnight. 
As cooler air continue to filter into the area...will see any 
linger rain showers Sunday night transition to light snow or 
flurries. Precip amount should be light and little to no 
accumulations are expected. On Christmas Day...flow aloft becomes 
zonal with a dry...cool air mass moving in. We should remain in 
this dry weather pattern through Tuesday with temperatures 
moderating slightly. A weak short wave to our south on Wednesday 
could pull a few showers into far southern areas on Wendesday 
afternoon. Then...the next system of concern will move in Thursday
and Friday and provide us with our next chance of widespread 
precipitation.

.DISCUSSION...
Closed low/upper shortwave near the Texas panhandle continues to
feed southwesterly flow and moisture into our region with cloud
cover increasing this morning and continuing through the day. A 
surface front is located across the Mississippi through the Ohio 
River Valleys and this will be the focus for most of the 
precipitation today. However, 850-700mb frontogenesis is expected 
to increase across Middle TN through SE KY this afternoon 
providing a focus for ascent along the Cumberland Plateau between 
roughly 20z-04z this evening. This will likely keep the heaviest 
and most likely precip this afternoon across portions of the 
northern Cumberland Plateau and the mountains of SW VA. Could have
some localized flooding with heavier downpours, but the primary 
flash flood threat will be to our west. 6-hour FFG is generally 
about 2-3 inches with storm total 24-36 hour precip expected to be
at most 2-3 inches across the northern plateau counties with 
totals tapering off to lesser amounts southeastward toward the 
TN/NC mountains, so this looks more like beneficial rainfall for 
our forecast area.

Made adjustments to reflect current observations and try to 
refine PoPs for this afternoon and tonight. Also, updated QPF and
storm total QPF with slightly higher QPF between 18z-00z this
afternoon corresponding to the additional focused lift across the
plateau.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Precip will begin to blossom across the TN Valley region through 
this morning as isentropic lift develops at the 295-300 K levels.
Of greater concern will be the development of a frontogenesis zone
that the models indicate will form across Middle TN and SE KY this
afternoon. The position of this zone may result in locally heavy
rain for a few of our Plateau counties, particularly between 21Z 
and 00Z. However, the frontal zone pushes northward through the 
evening, taking the heavy rain potential with it. With the 
expected short duration of heavy rain, the small area in our CWA 
that may be affected (parts of Morgan-Scott-Claiborne), and the 
modest amount of rainfall recently in that area, will continue
without a flood watch for now.

The approach of a cold front and the midlevel shortwave trough
will bring a second round of showers to the area on Saturday. We
will be firmly in the warm sector with a brisk SW flow aloft, so
with the strong warm advection, highs before the fropa may reach
the lower to mid 60s. It will be a breezy day, particularly in the
mountains, although the SW direction will not be ideal for
mountain waves. A Wind Advisory may be needed as we get closer to
that time period. Fropa occurs in the late afternoon hours, with
rain chances ending in the evening as dry air aloft moves in.
However, model soundings indicate low level saturation remaining
in place, with drizzle lingering through the night.

.LONG TERM (Saturday Night through Thursday)...
A fairly broad eastern U.S. H5 trough will bring isolated to 
scattered northwest flow-upslope type showers and snow showers 
Sunday and Sunday night, but not anticipating anything problematic
in part because of no direct connection to the Great Lakes. Then 
the troughing will flatten into a zonal flow during Monday, and 
dry weather will prevail Monday through Wednesday, before return 
flow spreads showers back into the region early Thursday. The 
returning moist airmass will modify temps, but maybe initially 
early Thursday there could be a brief window of wintry precip 
before changing over to rain.

Abundant low level moisture will make for variable conditions

likely at this time, although satellite shows partial clearing in
the area, and where this occurs, dense fog is developing. As a
result, confidence in the TAFs is low due to the transient nature
of the cloud cover. Precip is expected to move into the area this
afternoon, accompanied by MVFR vis and cigs that will continue

possible across the Plateau and Southern TN Valley through Friday 
morning ahead of this boundary. By the afternoon...the main axis 
of rain will remain to the west across middle TN...though 
scattered showers will move through the entire area through Friday
night. 

Saturday...the boundary is expected to push through the area in the 
afternoon. A jet strengthening in the mid levels...as well as an 
upper level jet...will help to move the boundary through fairly
quickly before the evening. PW values through Saturday are above 
the max percentile for this time of year. Because of the fast 
movement of the highest rainfall totals however...would expect 
accumulation to be lighter than in areas in middle TN. The Plateau
could see the highest amounts...of up to 3 inches possible by 
Saturday evening...whereas the rest of the area could see around 1
inch to 1.5 inches. For now will hold off on a watch or product 
of any kind...due to the prolonged dry period across the area the 
past several months. 

The mid level jet moving through Saturday afternoon and evening will 
bring gusty winds of around 30 mph throughout the valley...and up to 
60 mph through the highest elevations. Temperatures will remain 
near or a couple of degrees above normal for this time of year. 

.LONG TERM (Saturday Night through Thursday)...Scattered light 
showers will linger over the Southern Appalachian Region Saturday 
night as a cold front continues to pull away from the area.  Cooler 
air will be moving in behind the front and higher elevations may see 
a mix of rain and snow late in the night.  An upper trough will push 
through on Sunday into Sunday night.  Little moisture or lift will 
accompany this feature and should see isolated to scattered light 
rain...with best chances over northern locations. Current 
temperature profile should allow for mainly rain across lower 
elevations and a mix of rain and snow across high terrain.  Model 
consistency becomes quite poor through the rest of the extended and 
confidence is low.  On Christmas day...models trending towards a 
drier forecast as the upper trough moves out and flow aloft becomes 
zonal.  Tuesday and Wednesday we should be between systems for 
mainly dry conditions with the next system and chance of precip 
expected Wednesday night and Thursday.

MVFR conditions expected to continue at TYS and CHA for the next

through the day as surface heating increases. TRI will be near
MVFR this morning but is expected to be predominantly VFR through
the period with drier low-level air. Fog and low ceilings late in
the period are a big question mark at this time, but with a moist
boundary layer and light winds, can't rule out some MVFR fog near
the terminals between 08z- 12z Friday, especially near CHA where
greatest boundary layer moisture exists.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Shortwave trough moves to the east today with ridging and
subsidence aloft across the region. This should keep us dry on
Thursday, but low-level moisture beneath the inversion will keep
those pesky clouds around through the day, especially across
southern portions of the forecast area. We may finally see some
more breaks in the clouds by late in the day, so don't be 
surprised to see some sunshine by the afternoon as boundary layer
heating attempts to mix in some of the drier air aloft. With 
expected low-level cloud cover, max temperatures are forecast to 
be a couple of degrees below MAV MOS guidance but still be about 
10 degrees above normal.

Southwest winds will increase Thursday night ahead of an upper-
level trough to the west. An upper-level jet streak will begin to
setup over the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley with high clouds beginning
to arrive during the night. Mid-level subsidence, sufficient
boundary layer moisture, and light surface winds will mean the
potential for fog and low clouds on Thursday night and Friday
morning, but a big question will be if high clouds move in early
enough to prevent much radiation fog development. We should stay
dry overnight until Friday and Saturday as the low pressure system
moves closer to our region. With abundant low-level moisture and 
possible cloud cover, minimum temperatures are forecast to remain 
10-15 degrees above normal.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
Another day of warming temperatures between systems as we take a 
brief break from precipitation on Friday. Moist flow from the Gulf
of Mexico will increase as a front moves in from the west. This 
flow will run relatively parallel to the frontal boundary as it 
moves through allowing for an extended period of moderate 
precipitation over the weekend. Many locations (especially closer 
to Middle Tennessee) could see 1-2 inches of rain over the weekend
with locally higher amounts. Along this front the 850mb jet will 
get cranking with model forecasts indicating a potential jet max 
of around 50+ knots which could lead to gusty winds, especially in
the higher terrain closer to the jet on Saturday. Heaviest and 
most widespread precipitation will likely occur on Saturday during
the daytime hours as the actual front pushes through the forecast
area. 

Behind the front temperatures start to drop quickly as cold air
from the northwest replaces the warmer air. Models begin to 
diverge with how to handle the post frontal atmosphere with 
regards to additional precipitation. There is the possibility that
a trailing short wave could bring wintery precipitation to the 
area. With the highest chances being in the higher terrain of NE 
Tennessee and SW Virginia. However some models depict this same 
trailing shortwave as a much weaker system with less moisture to 
work with and keep all precipitation well to our north. So 
certainty with precipitation as we move into next week is 
relatively low for now.


All models do agree that any precipitation will be out of the are by 
Tuesday and much colder temperatures will remain over the region. 
Highs will be several degrees below normal on Monday before they 
slowly climb back up to around normal near the middle of the week. 
This portion of the forecast looks to remain dry and we should get 
to see a decent amount of sunshine after the cloudy weekend.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...Dry mid and upper level air
has been moving into the area through the day...with only 
scattered showers expected through the evening and early night. 
With the decrease in PW value...would expect additional 
accumulation of only a couple of tenths of an inch through the
night. Low level moisture will remain through the short
term...with overcast skies expected through Thursday afternoon.
Early Thursday morning...winds will weaken to near
calm...especially in areas north of I40...and with the recent
rain...would expect fog development across the area.
However...with skies expected to remain overcast...dense fog may
have trouble forming. Have included patchy fog in the
forecast...and will update as the night progresses. 

Thursday...zonal flow will set up over the area...with scattered
light showers possible through the late morning and early
afternoon. Temperatures will be a degree or two above normal for
this time of year. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday night)...Models 
nudged a little closer to agreement later in the forecast period, 
but remain quite close in depiction of the early part of the 
extended. The height gradient starts tightening as a healthy short
wave emerges out of the western states driving east through the 
Lower Mississippi Valley Saturday night into Sunday. An extended 
period of warm and moist advection off the Gulf of Mexico ensues 
ahead of a surface boundary as sub tropical high pressure holds 
position Friday into Saturday. Therefore, there will be a period 
of occasionally moderate rain building into the forecast area 
mainly on Saturday. However, the area that may see the greatest 
impact would be over the Cumberland Plateau with some decent 
rainfall developing here later in the day Friday into Friday 
night. The area of deep lift and moisture move away from the 
Southern Appalachian region Saturday night. The models continue to
show a trailing short wave on Sunday which could bring some 
sprinkles to the area. Much colder, Canadian area will be filling 
in behind a surface wave associated with this feature Sunday night
and there could be a few snow showers; mainly in the higher 
terrain, as this relatively moisture starved feature moves through
the region. Monday through Wednesday appears to be a dry but, 
very cold period as modified Arctic air filters further and 
further south through the Eastern U.S. Max and min temperatures 
will be a good ten degrees below normal with a wee bit of sunshine
helping to brighten spirits. It's a little too far out for much 
detail in the forecast, but amplification of the upper level 
pattern would bring some more precipitation to the area Wednesday 
night into Thursday. Depending on how entrenched that antecedent 
cold, dense air mass is by mid week, Wednesday night's 
precipitation could be in the form of a wintery mix.

.Short Term...(Today and Tonight)...A short-wave moving across the
OK/AR/TX area is producing a large area of divergence aloft over
the Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys. A jet over the Ohio Valley is
also placing the area under the favored right entrance region with
the direct circulation around the jet enhancing the fronto genetic
forcing along a frontal boundary near the TN/AL and GA state-
lines. Models show the southern half of the area being under the
strong fronto genetic forcing this morning. Given PWs between
1.4-1.5 inches pulling into this boundary, locally heavy rainfall
is anticipated. Will maintain current watch over the south.
Localized flooding is possible.

The dynamics starts to weaken this afternoon, but given weakening
upper trough will move across the region, will maintain high
chance/likely PoPs this afternoon. Rain ends by this evening.
Plenty of residual boundary layer moisture will keep most of the
area in low cloudiness, except over southwest Virginia where
enough drying will breakup the cloud cover.

Besides the rain, areas of fog will continue this morning, some
locally dense. Patchy fog will likely redevelop tonight.

.Long Term...(Thursday through Tuesday Night)...
Some slight ridging will take place to end the work week and we will 
get some more southerly flow increasing moisture over the area. This 
moist air will cause cloudy skies to stick around through the 
weekend. The next major system to affect the area will be a wide 
trough/cold front expected to sweep through the Eastern United 
States over the weekend. Models are still not in great agreement of 
the timing/strength of the front and when the precipitation will 
begin and end with this system. They do agree that widespread 
precipitation will affect the area sometime over the weekend and 
colder temperatures will be ushered in behind the front. 

Along the front a low level jet will form over the area and bring in 
very strong 850mb winds as it sweeps through. While models are not 
in exact agreement on the timing they are showing the 850mb jet with 
strong winds of 50+ knots. These winds will likely impact the higher 
elevations the most, but some of the gusts could be transported down 
to the surface in the Valley. The strongest winds look to move in 
early Saturday morning and exit to the East by Saturday night. 

In addition to the winds, widespread precipitation is expected along 
and behind the front as it moves through. QPF amounts are a bit 
difficult to pin down at this time, but many people could see an 
additional 1-3 inches of rainfall Friday through the end of the 
weekend.

There could be a few lingering showers with wrap around moisture in 
SW Virginia that could bring a few flurries to the higher 
elevations, but certainty at this point in the forecast is pretty 
low. Most locations should remain relatively dry after the weekend 
and into the upcoming week, Christmas included. Behind the front the 
cold temperatures will remain for several days, through the end of 
this 7-day forecast.

.DISCUSSION...
The forecast for tonight appears to be on track, so no changes are
planned. A low pressure system taking shape over east TX will
track east across southern AR to northern GA tonight and
Wednesday. Rain will be increasing overnight for the entire area 
as a coupled jet exit/entrance region moves overhead and creates
divergence aloft. Southern portions of the area have the 
potential for locally heavy rainfall as a surface boundary will be
located in that area. So far the axis of greatest precip has been
a little north of where the models depicted it to be, but it
should shift south again once the surface low crosses the MS River
and the E-W boundary along the southern TN border becomes better
defined. No changes are needed to the Flash Flood Watch. Widespread
rain amounts in the range of 2-3 inches are still expected in 
that area through Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Thursday)...The next 24 hours will
bring the primary weather maker of the next few days. Moist 
subtropical air mass from the Gulf is streaming northward as a 
warm front. Models are suggesting that the front will reach the 
vicinity of the GA/TN border by morning, and be a potential focus 
for training rainfall. Rain may be heavy at times roughly from 09Z
to 18Z Wednesday, and I have a touch of concern that QPF 
forecasts may not be sufficiently high enough along the boundary.
Thus, we have hoisted a Flash Flood Watch for the southern tier 
of counties, because its a good thing to be aware of in this
atmospheric scenario. The rain will taper off from west to east 
beginning Wed afternoon as the culprit H5 shortwave moves to our 
east late in the day. By sunrise Thursday, rain should be ended, 
but cloudcover is expected to persist all day Thursday with 
continued mild temps.

.Long Term (Thursday night through Tuesday)...Models start out in
decent agreement, but quickly descend into very poor agreement 
and consistency by the weekend. Forecast confidence is fairly 
average early, but poor the remainder of the forecast given model 
difficulties. Should start out dry Thu night, but then the next 
system will be approaching by Friday. While models agree that we 
will have a front move through during the weekend, timing is all 
over the place. We should see rain chances increasing Friday, and 
some significant rain is expected during the weekend although 
timing is uncertain. For now will go with highest PoPs Friday 
night and Saturday. Given expected rain during the short term 
period leaving ground rather wet, there may be enough 
precipitation for some flooding issues Friday night/Saturday and 
this will be mentioned in the HWO. Also will keep mention of 
possible strong winds in the HWO given the expected strength of 
the low level jet. Colder air will push in for Sunday through 
Tuesday, and while not much precipitation is expected at this time
there may be a few showers/snow showers Sunday night into Monday.
Looks dry but still cold for Tuesday right now.

Poor flight conditions through this morning with IFR/MVFR the rule

conditions have improved some due to some drier air at the

A low pressure system will move across the Tennessee Valley 
producing widespread rain (especially TYS and CHA) through this 
morning.

Flight conditions will continue to improve late this morning/early 
afternoon as the upper level system moves east of the area.  Rain 
will slowly diminish in intensity and coverage this afternoon.

Confidence is low in the forecast into the overnight hours. Models 
show some surface drying helping to limit fog/low-cloud development.
However, wet ground thinning cloud base and relatively light/calm 
winds will be favorable for radiational fog.

336 AM EST Tue Dec 19 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Wednesday night)...
Dense fog has set up over the area, with many places dropping 
down to a quarter mile or less visibilities. This fog will likely 
stick around the rest of the overnight hours and even into the 
late morning hours before the sun gets a chance to peek through in
the afternoon hours. Even with the morning fog in place, building
heights will help raise temperatures high enough to where some 
valley locations could flirt with 60 for a high temperature today.

Our next system, a low moving out of Texas, will begin to set up
leading to a widespread rain event for the forecast area. Ahead of
the low a strong 850mb jet will set up and pump in abundant
moisture to the region. PWAT values jump up to near or above 1" 
putting us above the 90th percentile for this time of year. The 
southerly 850mb strong jet will likely be forced upwards towards
the upper level jet, leading to rapidly rising air and effective 
precipitation. When all is said and done, many locations in SE 
Tennessee could see around 2 inches of rain with locally higher 
amounts, which could cause localized flooding. With how little 
precipitation we've seen the past month or so (about 2 inches 
below normal for this month in Chattanooga) hopefully the 
rivers/lakes/soil will be able to absorb the heavy rain and keep 
widespread flooding issues away. There will be enough lift and 
instability that we can't rule out a rumble of thunder on 
Wednesday as well. The main system and associated jet will 
eventually move off to the East by Thursday morning and rain 
chances will taper off during the day. Even with the increased
cloud coverage over the upcoming days the low level jet will help
bring in warmer air leading to relatively similar high
temperatures for the next couple of days.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Monday)...
The extended will start quiet on Thursday with upper ridging over
the area, but boundary layer flow will already becoming southerly
in advance of next very strong upper level system over the plain 
states. The southerly flow will pull low-level moisture back into
the southern Plateau/Valley.

The low-level southerly jet will strengthen late Thursday night into 
Friday as a strong upper level jet moving into Missouri/Ohio Valleys.
Showers/thunderstorms will likely break-out across the lower 
Mississippi Valley in response to upper dynamics and isentropic 
lift. Some of the convection will move into the southern 
Plateau/southeast Tennessee toward daybreak Friday.

The strong synoptic lift over the Tennessee Valley Friday and Friday 
night will continue to strengthen the low-level jet pulling 
unseasonably high amounts of moisture into the Region. The 850mb 
jet will increase to 60kts plus by Friday night. Widespread 
convection can be expected with training possible over the 
Plateau. Will need to watch for the potential of localized flash 
flooding there the latter half of Friday and Friday night.

Do want to emphasize that the GFS/ECMWF are depicting a abnormally 
strong upper jet across the mid-section of the nation with winds of 
150-155kts. Give this strength, the associated dynamics will be 
quite strong, so will need to pay attention for a heavy rainfall 
event. Also can not rule out strong convection as well over the 
Plateau and southeast Tennessee.

The strong low-level jet will also produce windy conditions across 
the Mountains. Currently low-level jet is more southwesterly which 
is not conducive to Mountain-wave winds, but will also need to watch 
for the potential of a Mountain-wave event.

System moves east of the area for Saturday. For Saturday night 
through Monday (Christmas Day), the medium range models have been 
very inconsistent and thus confidence is low. At this time, cold air 
will pull back into the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians 
with more or orographic lift and cold air advection light snow 
and rain showers/flurries possible.

.AVIATION...
Overall confidence is low on how the vis and cigs will play out 
overnight at the TAF sites. The greatest confidence is at TRI,
where cigs have remained at the MVFR/IFR margins, and will likely
remain near that level for a few more hours before lowering 
predominantly to IFR after midnight. With some wind expected
there, vis may go no lower than MVFR. Since TYS and CHA have
cleared out, fog potential may be higher at those sites, but how
low they will go is uncertain. Will have IFR vis with LIFR cigs at
both sites for now. Clearing should occur faster than it did
today, with a stronger SW wind developing in the morning. Rain may
begin to spread into CHA late in the TAF period.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Wednesday)...Fair weather tonight,
although low clouds and fog may redevelop overnight. A shortwave 
will eject out of the southern plains Tuesday and Tuesday night, 
spreading rain showers along a frontal boundary that will stretch 
eastward across TN. Rain chances will increase through the day 
Tuesday, becoming categorical Tuesday night, with locally heavy 
rain over the southern half of our forecast area Wednesday morning
before the system moves off to the east Wed afternoon and 
evening. Temperatures will be mild through the period.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday Night through Monday)...Rain chances will 
decrease overnight Wednesday into Thursday morning as a surface 
ridge of high pressure sets up over the Ohio Valley. Enough mid 
and upper level dry air will allow for mostly clear skies and dry 
weather...while zonal mid level flow will keep temperatures 
several degrees above normal. A surface low pressure 
system...developing ahead of a deep trough across the entire 
western CONUS...will cause SW flow to be channeled into the east 
TN Valley Thursday night through Saturday afternoon.

Models diverge on timing with the next line of showers moving 
through the area...with ECMWF slightly slower. Clouds will begin to 
increase overnight Thursday as moisture increases...and scattered 
rain will approach the southern Plateau and Southern Valley 
Friday morning and move to the NE through the day Friday and into 
Saturday. Low level convergence will allow for enough lift to keep
showers widespread through the overnight hours Friday. A low 
level jet will follow the rainfall through the valley...peaking in
the late afternoon and early evening. Winds could gust to around 
30 mph...with around 50 mph in the higher elevations. 

The GFS moves the rain east of the area by Saturday morning...but 
have trended towards the ECMWF with rain ending Saturday afternoon. 
PW values through Friday and Saturday are above 1...which is 
reaching the 90th percentile for this time of year. Rainfall totals 
of an inch or two could be expected if models remain consistent 
through the next few days. 

Saturday night...the low pressure system will move east...with high 
pressure and dry weather expected for most of Sunday. By Sunday 
night...the models are in rare agreement for day 7 of the 
forecast...and show the trough over the western US strengthening and 
slowly moving to the east. With the trough remaining to the west of 
the MS Valley...mid and upper level flow will be from the SW through 
the day Monday. Warm air and moisture will be advected in at least 
as low as the midlevels...and with an upper level jet causing plenty 
of lift...can expect scattered showers through the day. Models 
disagree on the low level winds...with cooler air possible at the 
surface. But with the forecast being on day 7...will hold off on 
mentioning any other precip type besides rainfall right now. Monday 
night...The axis of the trough approaches...with the flow possibly 
changing to out of the NW with cold air moving into the area. 
Uncertainty about timing of the cold air arrival and whether enough 
moisture will still be over the area...remain.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Some very light drizzle is getting squeezed out of the atmosphere
early this morning. But the biggest story is the widespread fog
over the area, with most locations seeing visibilities in 1/2 to 2
mile range. Low level clouds over us are helping to keep
temperatures a bit warmer, which should hopefully stave off dense
radiation fog from forming. This should last into the morning 
with the low clouds helping to block out some of the sun and 
keeping the fog around. Eventually the sun should be able to peak 
through in some locations and we will begin to warm into 50's in 
the Valley. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...
Active weather pattern will keep region wet through most of the 
extended period. Dry early Tuesday but surface low pressure moving
from East Texas then across Mississippi Valley to the Southern 
Tennessee Valley Tuesday afternoon brings with it a lot of 
rain...especially southern parts of the forecast area late Tuesday
night through Wednesday morning...some sections of southern 
Tennessee and southwest North Carolina could see over 2 inches of 
rainfall. This slow moving surface low and cold front will exit by
Wednesday night then skies clear as surface high builds in from 
the Ohio Valley. Fair weather will be short lived and only last 
through Thursday evening as another frontal system moves into the 
plains states Thursday and then heads for the southern Great Lakes
Friday. Clouds increase overnight Thursday and with good 
southerly flow ahead of the system Friday showers will become 
likely Friday and Friday night. A secondary front behind the first
front will allow for extended rain chances through Saturday and 
with the front becoming stationary just to the southeast a 
continued chance of showers through Sunday. Temperatures will stay
mild through Christmas Eve. Highs Tuesday should reach the 50s to
near 60. It will cool somewhat Wednesday with temperatures mid 
40s northeast to upper 50s to near 60. For the remainder of the 
forecast highs stay mostly in the 50s with lows in the 40s to 
lower 50s early Wednesday and then cool to the 30s to lower 40s 
Thursday and Friday and 40s for the weekend

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

Isentropic ascent to the north of a warm front is leading to 
widespread light rain across the area. Rainfall amounts have been 
light and do not expect to see anything over a tenth of an inch. 
Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate a 
mid-level shortwave trough moving to the east across the Ohio 
River valley and Great Lakes with a ridge across the Florida 
Peninsula. At the surface, a warm front stretches W-E across South
Alabama and Georgia. Current radar imagery indicates that the 
back edge of the precipitation is moving into the Plateau. Due to 
this, have decreased PoPs throughout the remainder of the 
afternoon and into the evening hours. The isentropic lift is 
forecast to move to the southeast during this timeframe. The lift 
will exit the region tonight but the low level moisture will 
remain with the boundary to the south. Due to this, expect fog and
drizzle to develop overnight. Not forecasting dense enough fog 
for an advisory at this point but conditions will need to be 
monitored throughout the evening and overnight hours. Have also 
increased low temperatures overnight with widespread cloud cover 
lows will generally be in the upper 30s to mid 40s. 

On Monday, the upper level ridge will expand slightly to the north 
with the front to the south nudging to the northeast. The clouds 
will slowly dissipate late tomorrow morning. With the higher heights 
aloft and partly sunny skies by the afternoon, highs will warm into 
the mid to upper 50s. The boundary will not be too far to the south 
but the lack of a lifting mechanism aloft and PW values in the 0.4-
0.5 inch range will keep the forecast dry.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Saturday)...

Fairly active pattern will bring three precip episodes into the 
forecast area during the extended period, first on Tues night/Wed,
second on Friday night/ Sat, and the third potentially on Sunday.
Model solutions for the late portions of the forecast, around 
Christmas Eve, continue to fluctuate wildly. The 12Z EMCWF just 
arrived, showing a fairly warm Christmas Eve and Christmas Day 
with the frontal boundary and rain field to our north over the 
Ohio Valley, while the GFS is cooler and wetter with the frontal 
boundary near us, but still not cold enough to produce wintry 
precip. We will have to wait and see what comes of this epic 
battle of model solutions. But as it stands presently, this week 
looks to be warmer than normal, continuing into the holiday 
weekend.

.DISCUSSION...

Starting to see a few reports of precipitation making it to the 
ground across the forecast area. Temperatures are below freezing 
in a few locations and there have been a few reports of sleet 
mixing in with the rain. With the strong warm air advection just 
above the surface, expect precipitation will quickly change to 
all rain and do not anticipate any impacts from the brief wintry 
mix at the onset. Speed up and increased PoPs some based on the 
latest radar and hi-res model trends. The 12z sounding from OHX 
indicates a significant dry layer below 750mb and any 
precipitation that makes it to the surface will be light. 
Overall,rainfall amounts will be under a tenth of an inch for most
locations. Temperatures will struggle today under cloudy skies 
with highs generally in the mid 40s.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Low will be moving towards the area today and will leave a
boundary to our south. North of this boundary will be a region of
isentropic lift causing precipitation over the forecast area.
Precipitation will move in from the south/southwest during the
morning hours. Temperatures in the southern areas should be just 
above freezing at this time, so am currently not expecting 
widespread frozen precipitation, but a few of the higher 
elevations could see a brief wintry mix before temperatures warm 
up. Am not expecting much in the way of QPF accumulations today, 
especially in NE Tennessee/SW Virginia, with most people seeing 
less than a tenth in the north and a quarter inch or so near 
Chattanooga. With the increased cloud coverage daytime high 
temperatures should remain a few degrees cooler than what we saw 
yesterday.

Best area of lift moves off to the east and the moisture along
with it as the day wears on. Precipitation should come to an end 
for most with the setting sun, but a few stray showers could 
linger into the nighttime hours. With somewhat southerly flow and 
continued cloud coverage overnight, temperatures are expected to 
remain a bit warmer, around 10 degrees warmer than this morning. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...
Upper ridging strengthens over the region Monday. A weak shortwave 
moves through westerly flow south of our area increasing clouds but 
no rainfall. Another stronger shortwave trough moves east across 
the Southern Mississippi Valley Tuesday with increased southwest 
flow and moisture moving into the Southern Appalachians. This will 
result in likely rain chances late Tuesday and Tuesday night south 
and chance north. The upper level trough axis then to move through 
the area Wednesday with the best lift and moisture across southeast 
TN and southwest NC. More ridging across the eastern states again 
Wednesday night through Thursday with mostly clear skies. Friday and 
into the weekend a deepening trough over the Rockies gets kicked 
east into the Southern Plains. A surface low over the southern 
plains on Thursday moves into the Great Lakes Friday. The trailing 
cold front will move across the Tennessee Valley Friday and into the 
Southern Appalachians by Saturday morning. A secondary front 
saturday will bring more rain and mild temperatures. Temperatures 
will stay mild with highs in the 50s to lower 60s all week and lows 
mostly mid 30s to mid 40s.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

The surface high pressure is shifting to the south and east of 
the area with weak southerly to southwesterly winds at the 
surface. Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis 
indicates a closed low spinning to the west near the Texas and New
Mexico line. A shortwave ridge ahead of this trough can be noted 
across the Northern Gulf of Mexico into the Central Plains. These 
higher heights aloft in combination with southerly flow and mostly 
sunny skies have allowed temperatures to rise up into the 40s this
afternoon. A few locations will top out in the 50s across the 
Central and Southern Valley. 

For tonight, the trough to the west will lift northeastward across 
the Southern Plains. At the same time, a warm front will begin to
lift slowly north across the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Isentropic 
lift ahead of this boundary will saturate the atmosphere from the 
top down. The atmosphere is rather dry currently with PW values in
the 0.2-0.3 inch range, therefore, it will take some time before 
precipitation begins to fall. Overnight lows will be a few 
degrees warmer tonight and range from the upper 20 to low 30s. 

Precipitation will begin near daybreak tomorrow across the 
Southern Valley and Plateau. With temperatures near freezing 
during this time there could be a brief period at the onset of 
light sleet or freezing rain but do not expect any impacts due to 
the light and brief nature. Just above the surface at the 850 mb 
level temperatures will be well above freezing with values in the 
6-8 degree Celsius range. A cool and rainy day is generally 
forecast for Sunday with the boundary remaining to the south. It 
looks like the best isentropic lift will be over the area late 
morning to mid afternoon. PW values during this timeframe will 
increase to around an inch. Model soundings indicate that this 
saturations will be below 500-600 mb and due to this expect 
rainfall amounts will be light and generally under a quarter of an
inch. With the persistent clouds and light rain, reduced highs on
Sunday with temperatures only making it up into the low to mid 
40s.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Friday)...

Models continue to come into better agreement through midweek with 
upper ridging resulting in above normal temperatures across the 
area. Minor shortwave traverses through westerly flow to the south 
of our area on Monday with slight chance PoPs across our southern 
sections. Stronger shortwave trough moves eastward across the 
Southern Plains on Tuesday with southwest flow and isentropic lift 
increasing across the Southern Appalachians. This will result in 
chance PoPs for most on Tuesday with likely PoPs possible across 
southern portions of the forecast area by late Tuesday and Tuesday 
night. The trough axis will move through the area on Wednesday with 
the strongest lift and moisture combination across southeast 
TN/southwest NC.

In the wake of this trough, models are in good agreement with 
ridging developing across the southeast CONUS leading to a moist 
southwest flow across the area ahead of a large scale trough and 
cold front late next week and into next weekend. It must be 
emphasized that there continues to be poor agreement on the exact 
track and strength of the system next weekend as well as the exact 
position of the surface cold front. There is impactful differences 
between model solutions with poor run to run model consistency. 
Highlighting the uncertainty, even the GEFS ensembles have fairly 
large spread with a standard deviation for surface temperatures next 
Saturday around 10 deg F. In short, there is still a lot of 
uncertainty with how things will setup next weekend, but there is 
growing certainty and agreement for a pattern favorable for 
precipitation. However, it would still be irresponsible to speculate 
with any certainty on specific precip type or coverage next weekend 
through Christmas based on current modeling and ensemble solutions.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Moisture continues to move out of the area and skies should be
sunnier today compared to yesterday. This will allow sun to shine
through and temperatures to warm up. Sun will combine with
increasing heights aloft and some southerly winds, and
temperatures will respond by jumping about 5-10 degrees warmer
than what we saw yesterday. Benign weather will continue into the

degrees warmer than this morning as ridging continues to build in
from the west.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...
Next weather system looks to move in later than previous runs
with temperatures now warm enough for all rain by the morning 
hours Sunday. Low level south flow and considerable cloud cover 
will allow temperatures to warm into the mid 40s to lower 50s. 
Weak ridging over the mid atlantic and southeast will shift east 
as moisture moves in from Texas. This moisture shifts south Sunday
night and Monday but surges back north Tuesday. A weak stationary
front will be near the southern border Tuesday and Wednesday with
chance of showers both days. Wednesday a surface low develops 
over the lower Mississippi and western Tennessee Valley. Models 
differ on where it tracks either along Gulf coast or across 
Tennessee Valley Wednesday and Wednesday night. As it moves east 
higher pressure behind it will bring dry weather Thursday and 
Thursday night. The next system Friday will again bring warm air 
and showers with a secondary cold front on its heels Saturday with
more rain and colder temperatures by Saturday night.

breaking up over Middle TN and could still see a warm up of a few
degrees this afternoon. At the surface, high pressure is building
in behind a departing cold front. In the upper levels, the axis of
the upper level trough is passing to the east with northwesterly
flow developing aloft. For tonight, expect the clouds will
continue to erode with mostly clear skies by daybreak. Light winds
moving in with the surface high will create radiational cooling
conditions. Overnight lows will generally be in the 20s.
Temperatures will begin to rebound on Saturday with light
southerly to southwesterly flow developing as the surface high
shifts eastward. Additionally, higher heights aloft will build in
as a shortwave ridge builds in behind the trough. High
temperatures on Saturday will range from upper 40s to low 50s
across most locations under mostly sunny skies.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Thursday)...

Models remain in very good agreement on the weather system for 
Sunday as shortwave energy rides NE out of Texas across a building 
middle level ridge over the Southeast US. Low level southerly flow 
ahead of this system on Saturday night into Sunday morning should 
greatly limit any frozen pcpn to the pre-dawn hours on Sunday with 
no accumulations expected before any mixed pcpn becomes all liquid 
by mid morning.

Continued low level southerly flow coupled with weak ridging aloft 
will help to keep temperatures about 5-10 degrees above normal from 
Sunday afternoon through Tuesday. Although bulk of moisture remains 
south of the area for the start of the work week, chance pops remain 
as the southern branch of the jet remains active with a series of 
shortwave troughs moving across the southern quarter of the area 
Monday and Tuesday. Given above normal temps and persistent WAA, no 
frozen pcpn is expected. Cold front finally pushes through very 
early Tuesday evening. Associated cold air lags well behind the 
front with temperatures Wednesday still expected to be slightly 
above normal for mid December. 

Solution to late week system is gaining confidence with the latest 
runs as GFS, Canadian, and ECMWF are all in fair agreement on 
position of surface cold front into Middle TN by the end of the 
forecast period.

.DISCUSSION...

A cold and cloudy day forecast across the Southern Appalachians.
Low level post-frontal clouds continue to persist across the 
area. The main adjustment for the update was to increase the cloud
cover across the region and lower the highs by a couple of 
degrees to account for the increased cloud cover. There could be 
some breaks in the clouds later in the day but visible satellite 
imagery indicates the back-edge of the clouds in West TN and KY. 
Highs today will be colder than average topping out in the mid 30s
to low 40s.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
With the front off to our southeast we are seeing colder air
funneled in from the northwest today. This will lead to a decrease
in temperatures on the order of 5-10 degrees when compared with
yesterday. Low level winds will be out of the southwest which
should help off-set a bit of the coldest temperatures. A little
bit of mid level moisture is still lingering behind the front
which means we should have a few clouds out there early this
morning, but the moisture will push off leading to clearing skies
during the daytime hours. Warmer air will begin to move in 
overnight, so the below average temperatures should only last for 
today before we warm up tomorrow.

An upper trough will move across the Southern Appalachian region
late tonight into Friday and there is an area of lower level
moisture banked up against the Cumberland rise northeast through
Eastern Kentucky this evening. As the 85h trough builds in toward
daybreak, a lower layer may become saturated over tri leading to 
the possibility of an mvfr ceiling forming here for a few hours

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...

The cold front is now to the south and east of the area with a
reinforcing shot of cold air arriving across the Southern
Appalachians. PW values remain low behind the front with values in
the 0.3-0.4 inch range. There is an area of low-level post frontal
clouds across NE TN and SW VA. Expect these will persist
throughout the afternoon and into the evening hours. The heart of
the cold air advection will arrive late tonight into Friday and 
overnight lows will generally be in the 20s as surface high
pressure builds in behind the departing front. This cold and dry 
airmass will continue into Friday with highs in the upper 30s to 
mid 40s.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Wednesday)...

Models continue to be in good agreement early in the long term 
period with diverging solutions late in the period. Surface ridging 
on Saturday will keep things dry with low boundary layer moisture 
resulting in large diurnal temperature variation through the day. As 
a shortwave trough moves eastward across the Southern Plains on 
Saturday night, southerly flow and moisture will increase ahead of 
it on Sunday. Model soundings indicate very dry air within the 
boundary layer on Sunday morning even though mid-levels are nearly 
saturated. This will likely limit precipitation on Sunday, 
especially during the early onset of precipitation. Cannot rule out 
a slight chance of brief light mixed precipitation early on Sunday 
morning with lingering cool air in the valleys and evaporational 
cooling. However, temperature profiles show warm air advection will 
keep any mixed precip brief and switch to all liquid rain by mid-
morning Sunday. We stay in a southwesterly flow on Monday and 
Tuesday with most moisture expected to remain to our south. A cold 
front sweeps through late Tuesday with lingering moisture across the 
higher elevations of the mountains and northeast TN on Tuesday 
night. Surface ridging expected to keep us dry on Wednesday and 
Thursday. Model solutions diverge late week with increased 
uncertainty regarding strength and position of trough and expected 
position of the surface cold front.

.DISCUSSION...

Went ahead and let the wind advisory expire at 15z. The cold front
is now to the south and east of the forecast area and winds have
been below advisory criteria throughout the morning. Cold air is
advecting in behind the boundary but the ample supply of sunshine
south of I-40 has pushed temperatures up into the low to mid 40s.
Clouds to the north will drift southward and the continuing cold 
air advection should cause temperatures to begin to plateau. 
Adjusted highs up slightly for the sunny areas into the upper 40s 
to low 50s. May have to make further adjustments upwards depending
on how far south the clouds make it.

very little moisture so should see nothing more than some clouds 
with this especially north. High pressure will build in for 
Saturday. Models show moisture returning Sunday in the southwest

this, so will just carry chance PoPs Sunday for some showers. Monday

System headed our way, with mid clouds racing past us now
associated with upper level disturbance that will keep moving on

the area that will bring some low level moisture will it, and will
offer the potential for MVFR ceilings, especially north of KTYS.
For now only have ceilings at KTRI, with only SCT low clouds at 
KTYS and briefly at KCHA. Looking at SREF ceilings, quite a few

lower than the OVC025 in this TAF, but checking upstream, not

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...

Northwesterly flow aloft currently across the area with a shortwave 
trough to the northwest across the Western Great Lakes. At the 
surface, high pressure has shifted to the east with southerly to 
southwesterly flow across the region. In addition, a cold front in 
association with the shortwave trough stretches from near Chicago to 
the southwest to near Kansas City. The atmosphere remains dry across 
the Southern Appalachians with dewpoints currently in the single 
digits to low teens. Winds are also increasing with the high to the 
east and low to the northwest. Due to the dry air and winds, have
a Fire Danger Statement throughout the remainder of the 
afternoon. Winds will continue to increase into the evening and 
overnight hours and have a winds advisory for the mountains along 
the Tennessee and North Carolina line and Washington County in SW 
Virginia. In these locations, winds will gust to over 40 mph at 
times. In the valley, winds will be below advisory criteria but 
could still see gusts into the 25-30 mph range. 

The cold front will rapidly move through the forecast area later 
tonight into Thursday morning. PW values are in the 0.2-0.4 inch 
range ahead of the boundary but models are showing some flurries 
across portions of SW VA and NE TN and have continued this in the 
forecast for late tonight into Thursday morning. Confidence is low 
and do not expect any impacts or accumulations. Winds should subside 
on Thursday as the front races quickly to the south and east and 
have the wind advisory ending at 15z. Skies will be mostly to partly 
sunny on Thursday but a fresh supply of cold air advection behind 
the departing boundary will keep highs generally in the upper 30s to 
mid 40s. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Tuesday)...

Models seem to have a good handle on the forecast through Sunday,
but consistency greatly deteriorates as we head into next week. 
Models continue to trend drier on Friday with a weak shortwave 
moving through, and have therefore continued the no-precip 
forecast. Weak high pressure builds in from the Gulf Coast for 
Saturday with another system approaching the area by Sunday. Front
will push through the area during the second half of the day on 
Sunday, and with highs in the 40s on Sunday, precip will fall as 
mainly rain with maybe just a few flakes mixed in over the higher 
terrain early Sunday morning or later Sunday evening. From here, 
model solutions digress. Wetter GFS keeps our area in moist SW 
flow behind the front, with continued precip chances through 
Tuesday evening when another shortwave rotates through. In 
contrast, ECMWF is drier with NW flow immediately moving in behind
the front and a faster, drier shortwave moving through Monday. 
For now, have chance PoPs Monday becoming slight chance and 
decreasing from west to east on Tuesday, but this forecast will 
likely change as models come into better forecast agreement. 
Regardless, both models appear to dry out by Wednesday. The model 
differences also impact temperatures for Monday/Tuesday and 
current confidence in forecast highs/lows is below average.

.DISCUSSION...

A cold start to the day this morning with most locations dropping
down into the upper teens and low 20s with surface high pressure
overhead. Temperatures will moderate some today with the surface 
high pressure shifting to the east and warm air advection 
returning with southwesterly to westerly flow in the low levels.
Dewpoints are currently in the single digits and teens but will
begin to creep up throughout the day. Regardless, minimum RH
values will drop into the upper 20s and low 30s and will issue a
Fire Weather Danger statement for this afternoon. A clipper 
system to the northwest will create a decent pressure gradient 
across the area with winds this afternoon in the 10-15 mph range 
with values high enough for a wind advisory across the mountains. 
This system will bring a dry cold front through the area again 
late tonight with another reinforcing shot of colder air.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...It is a very cold morning across
the Southern Appalachian Region and a Wind Chill Advisory will
remain in effect for the East TN Mountains through 12Z. Surface
high pressure building in over the area will allow for plenty of
sunshine this afternoon. This will help the cold air mass 
moderate slightly. A weather system tracking through to our north
late this afternoon and tonight will increase winds across the 
region today. Winds will become breezy and a bit gusty this
afternoon across the TN valley. Higher elevations of the East TN
mountains should see winds reach advisory criteria and a Wind 
Advisory will be in effect from 21Z today through 12Z Thursday. 
Also...a few flurries and even a stray pocket of light snow will 
be possible over portions of southwest VA and far northeastern TN
late tonight. The rest of the area should stay dry and a bit 
warmer.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...Models in decent agreement 
early on, but agreement deteriorates with time.  Forecast confidence 
starts out near or above average, but then becomes below average by 
the end of the period.  May be a lingering snow shower far 
north/northeast mountains early Thursday, but these should quickly 
end and clouds will decrease as slightly drier air works in.  Trend 
of the models has been much drier for Friday with the weak short 
wave energy that moves across, so will go precip free for Friday. 
High pressure will be over the region on Saturday, then the next 
frontal system is forecast to affect the area on Sunday. Atmosphere 
looks warm enough for this to be a mainly liquid precip event, and 
will carry high chance PoPs for Sunday for now.  Models in poor 
agreement for latter periods, but right now it appears there may be 
some lingering precip into Monday, then Tuesday is more likely to be 
dry.

Only a few minor tweaks to the forecast for this evening update.
Still expecting cold temperatures tonight, and winds should
continue to die off. But there will still be a minor overlap of
the two leading to very cold wind chills, specifically in the
higher terrain of the Southern Appalachian Mountains where a wind

.SHORT TERM...(This Evening through Wednesday)...Steep low-level
lapse rates continue to produce scattered snow showers across
southwest Virginia/northeast Tennessee. Limited returns across the
Smoky Mountains, but clouds remain, so would expect light
snow/flurries still possible over the higher elevations.

By early this evening, loss of daytime heating and cold air aloft
moving east will allow convection to dissipate. Will allow winter
weather advisory to end at 00Z Wednesday. Clouds will also slow
erode this evening through early morning (northeast) with sky
becoming clear.

For tonight, continued brisk winds and very cold temperatures will
produce dangerously cold wind chills across the higher elevations.
Will continue with wind chill advisory as well. Very cold wind
chills expected elsewhere. Will issue a SPS for the cold early
morning temperatures Wednesday. One of the main concerns will be
childern waiting for the bus in the morning.

For Wednesday, ridging and dry northwest flow will produce sunny
sky and milder afternoon temperatures. Another wave moving across
the Great Lakes/lower Ohio Valley will pull some mid-level clouds
across southwest Virginia/northeast Tennessee late in the day.

.Long term (Wednesday night through Monday)...A mid level jet will 
move through the area Wednesday night and early Thursday 
morning...with gusts of up to 35-40 kts across the area and 50 kts 
expected in the higher elevations of east TN. Light snow showers 
will remain through Thursday early afternoon as a surface low 
pressure system moves through the Appalachians. Any 
accumulations...which should remain light...will be in areas of NE 
TN...SW VA...and the higher elevations of east TN. 

Zonal flow will set up Thursday into Friday...with high pressure and 
clear skies expected. Temperatures will rise to near normal with 
somewhat warmer air advecting into the area. By Friday morning...a 
deep trough approaches from the west. Shallow moisture is expected 
through areas along and north of I40...with a chance for light snow 
showers through the day and into the evening. Best upper level 
forcing is on Friday evening into the overnight hours as an upper 
level jet streak moves across the southern Appalachians. Friday 
night into Saturday morning...the deep trough moves across the 
area...with strong NW flow setting up. Below normal temperatures 
will be across the area Friday through Saturday...when a ridge of 
high pressure sets up over the SE US...and low and mid level flow 
will then shift to out of the SW. 

By Sunday morning...widespread rain showers will approach the area. 
PW values are above the 90th percentile for this time of year...so 
expecting moderate rainfall accumulation totals for Sunday. A jet 
streak is expected to pull this rainfall east of the Appalahcians as 
a developing shortwave moves in from the southern Great Plains. Rain 
will end Sunday night with clouds expected to remain through Monday 
morning. Models diverge at this point in the forecast...but can 
expect at least a day or two of dry weather at the beginning of the 
work week.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Much colder air will push in 
today on gusty west and northwest winds behind the departing cold 
front. Enough low level instability and moisture for some snow 
showers/flurries today, especially in the better orographic lift 
areas of the mountains. Some of this light precip may be liquid in
valley areas early, but expect temperatures to be falling during 
the day. Will keep the winter weather advisory for the TN mountain
zones today. Winds will be quite gusty at times, but looks like 
wind speeds will generally remain below wind advisory levels. For 
tonight, any lingering snow showers/flurries will end in the 
higher terrain and remaining clouds will be clearing out. The 
combination of winds and low temperatures may bring wind chill 
values to below zero at times in the higher terrain of the E TN 
mountains, so will keep the wind chill advisory going in these 
areas. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...Overall...the extended will 
be rather active as a series of systems moves through the Southern 
Appalachian Region.  The period will begin on Wednesday with dry 
conditions and northwest flow aloft becoming zonal as the first 
system approaches the area.  A cool air mass will be in place with 
weak cool advection continuing across the area.  The main part of 
the system will track to our north Wednesday night into early 
Thursday morning.  Moisture is quite limited over the MRX CWA and 
associated precip should remain confined to northern locations. With 
the cool air over the region...expected mainly light snow or 
flurries with little to no accumulations.  Zonal flow aloft will put 
us briefly between systems for much of the day Thursday into 
Thursday evening.  The next system will move in late Thursday night 
into Friday.  The cool air mass will still be over the area for 
precip to begin as light snow or flurries Thursday night with light 
snow transitioning to light rain across most lower elevations during 
the day Friday.  Scattered showers will linger into Friday night 
across much of the northeastern half with rain switching back to 
light snow and flurries during the night.  A ridge of high pressure 
builds in for a brief period of dry conditions and moderating 
temperatures on Saturday.  Confidence is low by the end of the 
period but the trend is for another system to move into the area 
Sunday into Monday.  With warmer air in place...the current 
temperature profile indicates most valley locations should see rain 
with some snow possible over higher elevations.

.DISCUSSION...
Upper trough continues to deepen as a shortwave trough dives 
southeastward through Missouri this evening helping to push a 
strong cold front into our region by Tuesday morning. Moisture is 
limited with this front, but brisk northwest winds will help to 
provide orographic lift during the day along the higher terrain. 
This will result in some scattered snow showers and flurries on 
Tuesday with light accumulations generally at or above about 2000 
feet and 1"-2" possible across the highest terrain. Cold
temperatures and gusty NW winds will also lead to dangerously cold
wind chill values atop the TN/NC mountains with wind chill values
Tuesday night in the -5F to -10F range.

Made some adjustments to hourly temperatures and minimum
temperatures tonight by adjusting them upwards a few degrees.
Increased southwesterly winds ahead of the front and high clouds 
are keeping the boundary layer more mixed and keeping temperatures
higher in the 30s and 40s in all areas except for SW NC where 
lingering snow cover and sheltered valleys are allowing 
temperatures to drop into the 20s.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Tuesday night)...A fast moving
short-wave will dive southeast across the Ohio Valley tonight
pulling a frontal boundary through the region early Tuesday
morning. The orographic northwest flow will produce snow showers
across much of the higher elevations with the west to northwest
facing slopes of the far eastern Tennessee Mountains picking up up
to 2 inches. Have issued a winter weather advisory beginning early
Tuesday morning through the evening hours. 

The northern Plateau and higher elevations of southwest Virginia
will see up to 1 inch, especially High Knob, Virginia. Will issue
a SPS to reflect this concern. Periods of flurries/chance of
flurries elsewhere with little to no accumulations.

High Tuesday will be in the morning with strong cold air advection
and mostly cloudy sky bringing colder temperatures in the
afternoon.

For Tuesday night, breezy conditions and cold temperatures in the
high elevations will produce dangerous wind chills. Wind chills
will likely drop to 5 to 10 degrees below zero across the far
eastern Tennessee Mountains. Will issue a wind chill advisory
there.

.Long term (Wednesday morning through Tuesday)...Northwest flow 
will remain over the area through Wednesday as high pressure and 
mostly clear skies set in. Temperatures will remain several 
degrees below normal as cold air will advect in through Wednesday 
night. 

By Thursday...low and mid level flow will be near zonal as a trough 
deepens over the Great Plains states and moves eastward. A shortwave 
moving through that trough will cause enough lift for snow showers 
beginning overnight Thursday into the afternoon on Friday. The 
entire area could see flurries in the early morning...with areas 
along and south of I40 changing to rain by midmorning...and 
remaining as rain through the day. Areas along and north of I40...as 
well as the pleateau and higher elevations in east TN...will be at 
or below freezing...with mostly snow flurries expected. Could see 
mixed precipitation in the east TN Valley...with snow predominant 
type. The system will move east of the Appalachians by Friday 
evening...with northwest flow keeping a chance for snow showers in 
the higher elevations into Saturday morning. Strong northwest flow 
behind this system will drop temperatures again several degrees 
below normal for this time of year. 

By Saturday afternoon...low and mid level flow will transition to 
out of the west and southwest as a weak ridge builds over the area 
ahead of yet another trough developing over the Great Plains states. 
This SW flow will bring warm air and moisture to the area through 
the day and night. A shortwave moving through this ridge...as well 
as upper level divergence associated with a jet streak...will allow 
for enough energy to cause showers through the day and overnight 
Sunday. PW values are expected to be above the 90th percentile for 
this time of year...with moderate rainfall expected. 

Monday morning...brief northwest flow will be present with upslope 
allowing light snow showers through the morning hours...mainly at 
higher elevations in east TN and SW VA. This sytem will move to the 
east by Monday afternoon...with high pressure over the are through 
Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Surface high pressure will 
continue to extend into the area today, with plenty of sunshine and 
milder temperatures. Another mid/upper level short wave trough will 
dig in and a cold front will quickly push through the area late 
tonight. Clouds will increase ahead of this front, and a few 
showers/snow showers will be possible late tonight mainly Northern 
Plateau, Southwest Virginia and central/east TN mountains as colder 
air begins pushing in behind the front. Will carry slight chance 
PoPs these areas, with some flurries/sprinkles in the central/east 
valley areas.  

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...The atmosphere just doesn't 
want to give up the current upper level configuration which includes 
a western states ridge and an eastern states trough. The trough 
strengthens again into mid week as another robust short wave and 
associated surface cold front drive through the forecast area on 
Tuesday bringing another surge of polar air into the Eastern U.S. 
The feature doesn't have a lot of moisture available for lifting but 
there should be enough for some orographic snow showers in the major 
terrain areas; mainly across Southwest Virginia, Northeast Tennessee 
and the Smoky Mountains. An inch of snow in these higher terrain 
areas is not out of the question. Perhaps the main story with the 
early week system will be the unseasonably cold air expected both 
Tuesday and Wednesday with highs each day a good ten to fifteen 
degrees below normal and lows Tuesday night ranging from the teens 
north to the lower and middle 20s south. Dry cold advection is 
expected Wednesday with a decent amount of sunshine expected. The 
dry period could last through the day Thursday as a west to 
southwest flow boosts temperatures a little closer to normal. 
However, another clipper type short wave and cold front drops 
southeast through the forecast area later Thursday night into Friday 
knocking high temperatures back about ten degrees below normal again 
to end the work week. It looks like the same story with northwest 
flow producing light orographic snowfall in the higher terrain. The 
upper flow gradually shifts to a more zonal configuration over the 
weekend with the arrival of another frontal system associated with 
maritime polar air rather than the much colder continental stuff. 
The precipitation moves in Saturday night with the main event on 
Sunday and a gradual departure Sunday night. Most of the precip 
should be rain, but had to sprinkle a small chance of some snow in 
the terrain.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Wednesday)... Benign weather will 
continue through Monday as we will have a dry W-NW flow through 
the column. Sunny skies and slight warm advection will give warmer
temps tomorrow, in the lower 50s for most of the Valley. 

A low pressure system will track across the Ohio Valley region to
New England on Monday night and Tuesday. Forcing in our area will
be mainly driven by the upper jet streak which moves into position
on Tuesday morning. Scattered to isolated rain or snow showers are
expected through the day as the cold front and trough moves
through in the afternoon. Any snow accumulation should be only in
higher elevations (above 2000 ft), as temps in the Valley should 
be above freezing most of the day. Very cold air aloft moves in
Tuesday night, along with an upslope 30 kt wind. Total snow
amounts in the mountains are expected to be around one inch, and
with low temps in the teens, wind chills in the mountains could
drop below zero. Wednesday will be dry with decreasing clouds as
the midlevel thermal trough exits and warm advection develops.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Saturday)...
Wednesday night the forecast area should be in between systems and 
still dry but clouds will be increasing across the north as the next 
clipper system moves into the Ohio Valley. On Thursday farther west 
short wave energy moving into the plains states digs south and as 
moisture pools along and ahead of another cold front the 
precipitation type will be mostly rain showers ahead and along the 
front across central and northern sections. Temperatures warm 
Thursday so any snow showers will be early or at the highest 
elevations. Highs will be 40s to lower 50s lower elevations and 30s 
in the higher elevations. Thursday night and Friday a colder 
secondary trough will change the rain showers to snow showers with a 
couple inches possible in the higher eastern mountains and mainly 
trace amounts at lower elevations. Friday night and Saturday high 
pressure builds back in...another dry period with clearing skies. As 
high shifts east Saturday much warmer temperatures in the mid 40s to 
lower 50s. A final system to move into the Tennessee Valley Saturday 
night and Sunday. With southerly flow this system warms temperature 
even more into the 50s with just rain as the main precipitation
type.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Surface high pressure will build 
in today.  Any lingering low clouds northeast will quickly dissipate 
as the cold advection is ending.  Plenty of sunshine today, then a 
weak short wave will brush at least northern areas with a period of 
mainly high/mid clouds this evening, but these clouds should pull 
out fairly quickly as well.  MAV temps look reasonable for the most 
part, so just some minor tweaks.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...It looks like about three 
systems impact the region in the long term with the final system at 
the very end of the period, bringing rain Saturday night into 
Sunday. Monday starts out dry and pleasant with sunshine and high 
temperatures near normal in the upper 40s and lower 50s. However, 
more chilly polar air will be moving back into the region late 
Monday night into Tuesday as another system drops southeast out of 
the Central Canadian provinces. Computer modeling is still 
indicating the greatest impact with snow showers will be across the 
northern part of the forecast area and due to the northwest flow 
regime associated with these systems, snow accumulation is expected 
mainly in the higher terrain areas. The clipper doesn't have a great 
deal of moisture associated with it, so snowfall amounts in the 
terrain would be around an inch with trace amounts in the valleys 
across Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee. A trailing wave 
keeps the chance for a few snow showers going across the northeast 
part of the forecast through Tuesday night before ending early 
Wednesday morning. Wednesday should be dry but quite cold as the 
northerly low level flow continues. Temperatures moderate again on 
Thursday but clouds will be on the increase and there could be a 
sprinkle across the north as more short wave energy builds southeast 
through the Mid Mississippi and Ohio river valleys. The resident 
upper trough will become amplified again over the Eastern U.S. as 
this feature and another, even stronger short wave and surface cold 
front move through the Southern Appalachian region. Once again, 
there will be a chance for more orographic snowfall for the higher 
terrain with this system, with some light rain or snow flurries in 
the valleys Thursday night into Friday. The offending system departs 
the region Friday night in time for a decent start to the weekend 
with some sunshine and temperatures rebounding back to normal for 
mid December.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...
A deep trough to our west will be crossing the area this evening.
Radar shows light precip ahead of the trough is beginning to move
into the TN Valley, but some dry low level air seems to be
evaporating most of it before it reaches the ground. Moisture
depth will increase as the midlevel thermal trough moves over the
area, producing steep lapse rates that will generate scattered
snow showers and flurries. Accumulations will be mainly above 3000
ft as a 25-30 kt upslope flow locally enhances lift in the
mountains. 1-2 inches will be possible through midnight above 
that level, with a half inch or less in the lower elevations of SW
VA and NE TN and northern Plateau. Flurries may occur as far 
south as Dayton and Athens. Decreasing moisture depth and midlevel
warming will occur in the 03-06Z time frame as the trough pushes 
east. Some upslope flurries may persist into Sunday morning for 
the mountains. Wind chills in the mountains may drop below zero on
some peaks, with most spots in the teens to single digits. Sunday
will have decreasing clouds with highs in the upper 30s to lower
40s.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Friday)...
A mostly clear and cold night night sunday night will be followed by 
a much warmer and dry day Monday as brief ridging flattens out upper 
trough that has been over the eastern Tennessee Valley the last few 
days. The upper trough digs southward again late Monday night and 
Tuesday with a chance for more snow northern and eastern sections of 
the forecast area. Amounts look to be much smaller than the past 
days event. Areas in the northern valley may get a few tenths and 
mountains an inch or two of snow. Highs Monday will warm to the mid 
40s to lower 50s but drop 10 degrees to the mid 30s to lower 40s... 
Tuesday. Another cold night Tuesday night with mid teens to mid 20s 
and colder northeast with highs mid 20s to mid 30s and around 40 
south. The snow will move out with clearing skies. Thursday lower 
pressure moves into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valley associated 
with another cold front with winds switching to the south and 
southwest and warming temperatures back into the 40s to lower 50s. 
Because of the warmer temperatures Thursday most of the 
precipitation will fall as rain initially but change to snow 
Thursday night and early Friday. Friday precipitation moves out once 
again with higher pressure settling over the southeast warming 
temperatures back into the upper 40s to mid 50s the warmest of the 
week.

.AVIATION...
Satellite shows that IFR cigs at TRI will be clearing soon, before
or around 18Z, so the TAF will begin with VFR conditions at all 
sites. An upper level trough is approaching from the northwest,
and will bring midlevel clouds followed by low VFR clouds through
the late afternoon/evening. Cooling underneath the low may
generate some light snow at TRI, with MVFR cigs, but it should not
be heavy enough for lowered vis or accumulations on the ground.
Winds will pick up to 10-15 kts in the next few hours, mainly from
the west. Clearing skies will come to all sites by tomorrow
morning.

.DISCUSSION...
The current winter weather advisories/warnings will be allowed to
expire at 10 AM. The northeast TN mountains may pick up a little
more snow, but probably just a half inch or less. We will have a
period of clearing through the late morning and mid afternoon
before the upper trough over IL/IN/KY moves in, bringing cold 
temps aloft that will produce scattered snow showers. Radar shows
snow bands in southern KY that are projected to move into our area
in the 18-21Z time frame, a little faster than reflected in the
forecast. Will make some timing adjustments to PoPs and will
expand the mention of flurries farther south for the update. Still
expecting accumulations to be mainly in higher elevations of
around one inch or less, with little to no accumulation in the
Valley and Plateau.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Radar shows some light snow sill 
affecting eastern parts of the area.  This last batch of snow will 
be moving out this morning, but appears enough may linger past 
sunrise in the warning/advisory areas to warrant extending these to 
15Z.  Will see some brief clearing ahead of the next upper trough 
that will dig into the area late today/early tonight, along with a 
reinforcing shot of colder air.  Will see some snow showers/flurries 
moving in late today and continuing into tonight mainly north and 
mountains. The better low level instability and moisture will not 
linger long, so the snow showers should be ending by late tonight. 
Higher terrain areas of the north and in the TN mountains from the 
smokies north may pick up an inch or two of snow.  Will mention in 
HWO.  It will also be quite cold along with significant wind, so 
wind chill values in the higher terrain may dip below zero in some 
spots. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...A couple more episodes of 
active weather occupy part of the extended forecast. After a dry 
Sunday and Monday, another short wave descends out of Canada driving 
south through the Eastern U.S. More chilly polar air accompanies the 
feature on Tuesday with some light rain, as well as a few snow 
showers to the higher terrain areas. These mountain locales may pick 
up an inch or two of snow with the aid of orographic lift. The 
forecast area should enjoy another break in the action on Wednesday 
while awaiting more short wave energy diving through the back side 
of the prevailing eastern states upper trough. Late week modeling 
indicates another couple clipper systems build in for a mixture of 
more rain and snow Thursday into Friday. A bit too far out for much 
detail concerning this event, but it looks like more orographic snow 
in the terrain, with a mixture of rain and snow in the valley as 
another surge of polar air invades the Southeastern U.S.

.DISCUSSION...Difficult forecast this evening. Several Hi-Res
model runs over the past few hours have been indicating 
additional snow showers developing and moving into areas east of 
I-75 overnight. All models show the snow/no snow gradient being 
very tight with the best chances for snow occurring across our 
eastern mountains ranging all the way from SWNC up into SWVA. 
Current runs still show this same scenario but amounts don't look 
as impressive as earlier. Having said that, still bumped up snow 
totals slightly for most areas east of I-75. Feel like current 
advisory and warnings still handle the expected additional 
snowfall well so no updates there. Only real change would be that
the previous forecast called for lesser amounts overnight across 
southwest NC. Current warning for Cherokee and Clay states 
additional amounts of 1 to 3 inches overnight. Bases on model 
runs and current radar feel like that number could be closer to 2
to 3 inches. Also made some adjustment to POPs to try and capture
the gradient better, while upping chances more along the eastern
mountains through the night. Will send out new zones for POP
adjustments. All other elements look good for now.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Saturday night)... 
Radar has shown a decreasing trend to precip intensity in the last 
few hours. However we will continue to see at least light snow or 
flurries overnight until the midlevel frontogenetic forcing 
associated with the upper jet pushes to our east. Model cross 
sections indicate that this will persist until late tonight. The 
northeast mountains and northeast TN Valley and parts of SW VA will 
likely have the most accumulation due to the longer duration of 
lift/moisture there, perhaps another 1-2 inches. Central and 
southern Valley locations and SW NC should have less than an inch of 
additional snowfall. All current advisories/warnings will be 
continued through 7 AM Saturday morning.

Drier air aloft will build in behind the exiting jet and trough, but 
a second, more amplified trough axis will be approaching. Clouds 
will be decreasing through the morning and early afternoon before 
increasing again from the northwest. The thermal trough will create 
steep lapse rates in the late afternoon and evening across northern 
sections, generating scatterd snow showers, and a 30 kt upslope flow 
will enhance snowfall in the higher terrain. Fast movement of the 
trough and limited moisture depth should hold accumulations below 2 
inches in most of the mountains, with less than an inch in lower 
elevations of NE TN and SW VA. Wind chills Saturday night will be in 
the single digits to below zero. A Wind Chill Advisory may need to 
be considered as we get closer to that period.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Thursday)...
Mostly below normal temperatures through this part of the extended 
as a couple short waves rotate southeast around a nearly stationary 
upper level low across eastern Canada. From Sunday through Monday 
flat ridging allows for substantial warming from the upper 30s to 
lower 40s Sunday to about 10 degrees warmer Monday. A new deepening 
of the trough over the eastern states by Monday night into Tuesday 
and a clipper system will bring another round of snow and colder 
temperatures to the higher elevations and northern parts of the 
forecast area. These areas may get an inch or two with a dusting at 
lower elevations.  Temperatures will drop 10 degrees for highs 
Tuesday once again and fall to the teens to lower 20s as skies clear 
early Wednesday. Wednesday looks very cold with highs upper 20s to 
upper 30s. Then warming into the 40s Thursday and Friday. A fast 
moving clipper will brush northeast areas Wednesday night into early 
Thursday followed by a stronger but warmer system Thursday night and 
Friday.

.DISCUSSION...
The western extent of accumulating snowfall continues to be the
primary concern for today's forecast, as low level dry air
continues to feed into the area from the northwest. The westward
extent of precip on radar is farther than observed snow at the
ground. Where precip rates aloft are stronger, snow will be able 
to make it through the dry layer and reach the ground. The models
have been overdone with snow accumulations in the Valley than 
observed this morning. So far, snow reports have supported the 
ongoing warning/advisory areas, with amounts greater than one inch
reported in the mountains and SW NC, and over 3 inches in SW NC.
Will continue to monitor trends for potential expansion, but no
changes will be made at this time. The SPS will be continued and 
expanded westward.

The update will make downward adjustments to temperatures, which
have pretty much held steady through the morning. The Wx grids
will be adjusted accordingly, reducing the mention of a rain/snow
mix to primarily just snow. The foothills and locations east of
the I-75/I-40/I-81 corridor are still expected to see up to one
inch through the evening, with the mountains in the 1-4 inch
range, and SW NC between 4 and 7 inches.

.DISCUSSION...
Will issue an update to put Cherokee and Clay counties in a Winter
Storm warning. Reports are coming in of 2+ inches in that area.
Latest model cross sections show ageostrophic vertical
circulations and midlevel frontogenesis persisting in that area
into the evening, along with deep saturation. Accumulations will 
be pushed up to the 4-6 inch range for those counties.

The western extent of snow accumulation is still uncertain, but
observations across much of northern AL and NW GA indicate that
dry air below 700 mb seen in the 12Z OHX sounding is having an
effect, as much of what is show by radar in that area is not being
reported by surface obs. With a W-NW flow of dry air in that layer
continuing through the day, Valley accumulations are still
expected to be light, although the E-W gradient of accumulation
will be very tight. Will leave the advisory and SPS areas
untouched but continue to monitor trends.

425 AM EST Fri Dec 8 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Very challenging forecast for
the short term. Models in overall agreement that an approaching 
upper trough along with a developing surface low near the east 
coast will bring some precipitation to at least eastern parts of 
our area. While upper jet dynamics bring some lift to the area, 
models disagree on available moisture and how far west the 
significant precipitation will make it. GFS looks to be an outlier
in how aggressive it is for our area, so plan to lean more toward
the NAM/SREF/ECMWF solutions. It will be cold enough aloft for 
all snow in the higher terrain, and precip amounts are expected to
be enough for the winter weather advisory to be expanded to the 
northeast TN mountain zones. Will also spread PoPs further west 
into the valley, but precipitation amounts should be light and 
will keep PoPs fairly low. Rain may mix in with snow in some of 
the lower elevation areas as well since boundary layer temps 
expected to be borderline for snow. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...This period should be 
another chilly one with approximately three short waves or 
"clippers" rotating southeast around a seemingly permanent upper 
level low over Quebec. The first moves across the forecast area 
during the period Saturday afternoon through early Sunday morning 
generating some orographic snow showers in the higher terrain 
across Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee with a few 
flurries in the valleys in these areas. Due to limited moisture, 
snowfall amounts look to be around a half to one inch in these 
higher terrain areas into Sunday morning. Sunday afternoon through
the daytime period Monday will be a dry period while the region 
awaits the next clipper which impacts the area from about Monday 
night through Tuesday night. This system looks like it will 
produce a few more orographic snow showers in the higher terrain 
of Southwest Virginia, Northeast Tennessee and the Smoky Mountains
of Central East Tennessee with moisture limitations keeping 
amounts around an inch or less, along with a few flurries in the 
valleys, generally north of interstate 40. Wednesday should be 
another dry day with the final clipper building southeast across 
the forecast area later Wednesday night through Thursday night. 
This system is modeled to have a little more moisture associated 
with it, generating perhaps one to two inches of snow in the 
higher terrain. However, due to the fact that this feature is 
about a week away, forecast uncertainty is a bit higher. 
Concerning the temperature forecast, max and mins will be around 
ten to as many as fifteen degrees below normal for mid December, 
with slightly warmer maxes on Monday and again on Thursday, due to
winds shifting to a west to southwesterly direction ahead of each
short wave.

.DISCUSSION...

The latest 00z and Hi-Res models continue to suggest a slight
shift to the northwest of the edge of the snow on Friday as an
upper level trough digs southward into the Northern Gulf. Due to
this, have expanded the advisory further to the north and west to
include the Eastern Tennessee mountain zones south of Cocke
county. Accumulations in the mountains of up to 2 inches are
possible with a dusting to half an inch in the foothills. The
highest accumulations are forecast in Clay and Cherokee counties
with 1-3 inches of snowfall possible. 

A surface low will be located off the Georgia coast early Friday
morning with precipitation moving into Southwest North Carolina.
This low will deepen throughout the day as it moves up the
Carolina Coast with the upper level trough pivoting across the
Northern Gulf Coast. Precipitation will expand further to the
north and west. Models are coming in with slightly higher 
moisture values with PW in the 0.5-0.6 inch range in the advisory 
area. Model soundings indicate good saturation above the surface 
but for most locations the issue will be the drier air in the low 
levels. The higher surface moisture will be across Southwest North
Carolina and Southeast Tennessee and this is where the advisory 
is currently located. The forecast area is on the northwestern 
edge of the precipitation band and any further shift to the 
northwest could lead to expanding the advisory in further forecast
issuances.

.DISCUSSION...

The latest suite of model guidance continues to shift further to
the northwest with the precipitation shield on Friday. The 
previous forecast was already near advisory conditions for Clay 
and Cherokee counties in Southwest North Carolina, therefore, 
decided to go ahead with a Winter Weather Advisory for these two 
counties. If the latest model trends continue with the 00z run, 
will need to expand the advisory further to the north and west.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Friday night)... 
At the surface, a cold front marked by a wind shift and dewpoint 
gradient now over E KY and Middle TN will push across our area this 
evening. As a result, drier low level air in the TN Valley will be a 
factor in how far west precip will reach late tonight/Friday. Models 
have come into better agreement with the 12Z runs that the mountains 
and SW NC will see some snow. The NAM spreads precip farther west, 
along a line from CHA to TYS to TRI, while the GFS precip hugs the 
terrain more closely. The difference appears to be in their moisture 
profiles, with the GFS showing much drier air below 600 mb than the 
NAM. Will keep PoPs in the mountain zones and SW NC to account for 
the dry post-frontal air mass, more like the GFS, but will raise 
PoPs and QPF in those areas from the previous forecast. Both models 
indicate that forcing associated with the jet will be weak in our 
area, and remain to our SE. Thus, snow accumulations are expected to 
be light, with up to 1 inch expected in Clay Co. NC and the higher 
elevations of the Smokies. For timing, onset of snow is expected to 
be within a few hours of sunrise tomorrow, ending near midnight 
Friday night as the upper jet pushes moisture east of the area.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Wednesday)... 
Cold upper low over eastern Canada near Hudson's Bay and 
northeast Canada will keep the eastern two thirds of the country 
in a longwave upper trough and bring a series of cold fronts 
across the region from the Great Lakes. The first system will move
in late Saturday and Saturday night. Light snow flurries and 
showers possible across mainly southwest Virginia and northeast 
Tennessee higher elevations with one half to one inch accumulation
possible. Another impulse late Sunday night early Monday looks 
dry. Then Monday night and Tuesday a stronger impulse which 
deepens trough will reinforce the cold air and bring a better shot
of frozen precipitation late Tuesday into Wednesday morning. 
Orographic northwest snowfall will develop Tuesday with good cold 
air advection with even light snow or flurries possible at lower 
elevations. The deeper moisture and strong northwest flow brings a
better chance for more significant high elevation snowfall. This 
is followed by another quick moving weaker system Wednesday night 
into Thursday. 

Cold temperatures will prevail Saturday and Sunday but high 
temperatures warm into the mid 40s to lower 50s ahead of the next 
system. Lows will be several degrees below freezing Saturday through 
Sunday but closer to freezing early Monday and Tuesday. Temperatures 
become much colder again Tuesday with a slow warming by Thursday. 
Night time lows stay below freezing through the end of the forecast 
period.

Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED
National Weather Service Morristown TN
1131 AM EST Thu Dec 7 2017

.DISCUSSION...
No changes are needed to the forecast today. A mid/upper level SW
flow and jet stream seen in WV imagery will continue to supply 
mid/upper level moisture and scattered to broken cloud cover
today. Virga may occur over southern sections but precip at the
surface will stay well south across AL/GA/SC. A cold front is
loacted across central KY/Middle TN, identified by a wind shift
and dewpoint gradient, but it will have little impact on the
weather as it moves through later today. The mix of sun and 
clouds today will make for a tricky temperature forecast, but the 
current highs in the mid/upper 40s seem to be on track so far.

&&

.AVIATION...
Scattered to broken clouds will remain at VFR levels through the 
period, mainly in the 8-15 kft layer. Winds will shift from W-SW 
today to NW this evening with the passage of a cold front, but
wind spees will predominantly remain below 10 kts.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Really not a whole lot to 
talk about for today. Today's weather will be very similar to 
yesterday as we remain in the longwave trough. Expecting mid/high 
level clouds to be in place through the day once again especially 
since we see additional moisture work its way in from southwest to 
northeast later today. However, we look to remain dry again for this 
forecast period as the bulk of the moisture stays off to our 
southeast. Moisture further creeps northward overnight toward the 
southern part of our CWA but even Cherokee and Clay county soundings 
still show very dry air in place from around 5K up to 9K feet, which 
would likely prevent any precip from reaching the ground. 

Highs today will be a few degrees warmer with highs ranging from the 
low to upper 40s. Lows overnight will be colder as colder air 
continues to work its way down into the trough. Lows in the lower 
20s to upper 20s can be expected.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...Southern jetstream and 
associated sub-tropical moisture will be just south and east of the 
southern Appalachians with only a slight chance of precipitation 
across the far eastern Mountains and southwest North Carolina for 
Friday.

A digging long-wave upper trough over the eastern two-thirds of the 
nation will pull this moisture plume well east of the area by Friday 
night/Saturday. 

For most of the extended forecast, the Tennessee Valley and southern 
Appalachians will be under northwest flow with periods of orographic 
northwest flow events possible. First event orographic northwest 
flow will occur late Saturday into Saturday night. Light snow 
showers/flurries expected across mainly the higher elevations of 
southwest Virginia/northeast Tennessee down into the Smoky Mountains.
Snowfall will be less than one inch.

Surface ridging builds into the area for Sunday. Next storm system 
will move across the lower Great Lakes and Ohio Valley for Monday 
and Tuesday with frontal boundary passage early and Tuesday with 
Tuesday. Orographic northwest snowfall will develop Tuesday with 
good cold air advection producing even light snow/flurries in the 
Valley. Better moisture and strong northwest flow may produce a 
better chance of more significant high elevation snowfall.

Due to cold air advection, clouds, and light precipitation, decided 
to trend a couple degrees colder than Blended guidance.

For Wednesday, a great deal of uncertainty with possible another 
weak system.

Strong 120-130 kt upper level jet located just to the north and 
east of the forecast area will keep mid to high clouds in the 
forecast throughout most of the night. Another cold front is 
approaching the area from the northwest tonight but will pass the 
area without any precipitation during the day tomorrow. PW values
remain below the 25th percentile for early December ranging from 
the 0.3-0.4 inch range. Therefore, will continue with dry 
conditions overnight as well. Temperatures are on track and lows 
in the morning will start off in the upper 20s to mid 30s.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Few changes are expected to the general weather pattern over the
short term period, with a NW flow continuing through the lower
levels (below ~750 mb), and a W-SW flow at and above 700 mb that
will continue to keep broken to overcast midlevel clouds overhead.
A dry layer from the surface to 700 mb will evaporate any precip
from the midlevel cloud layer through the period. We will have a
cold front that is currently across northern IL/IN and MI that
will be moving into our area late tomorrow, but it will have very
little impact this period other than a shift of surface winds to 
N and perhaps an increase in low clouds late in the day. With
temperature advection ahead of the front being near neutral and 
mid/high clouds perhaps being a little thinner, Thursday's high 
temps should be warmer than today, mainly in the mid to upper 40s.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Tuesday)...
The troughing pattern will be the main theme through the extended
with cold air entrenched across the Eastern CONUS. Shortwaves 
will continue to rotate through the longwave trough bringing a 
parade of weak systems that will give us a low chances of light 
precipitation and continued cold weather.

On Friday, a surface front will be oriented SW-NE across AL/GA/SC/NC 
with widespread precipitation likely to our southeast. A 
strengthening jet streak will place our area within the right-front 
entrance region and favored area of upper-divergence and lift. As 
the 500mb shortwave approaches, lift will strengthen and provide for 
slight chance/chance PoPs across far eastern portions of the 
forecast area. Very dry air in the low-levels will likely limit 
precipitation and result in virga. Light snow accumulations would be 
possible Friday across the higher elevations of the far eastern 
mountains if this system makes a slight westward shift and additional 
moisture can overcome the dry air.

For Saturday, latest model guidance continues to show a shortwave 
diving southward into the Ohio Valley with the majority of moisture 
and lift remaining to our north. With northwest upslope winds and 
shallow moisture, may have some rain or snow showers on Saturday 
afternoon and into the early overnight hours. Light snow 
accumulation will be possible across the higher elevations of the 
TN/NC mountains and especially in SW VA in areas such as High Knob 
where more moisture will be available. A few flurries may be 
possible across the lower elevations.

For Sunday and Monday, dry NW flow aloft and surface ridging will 
produce dry weather and milder, but still slightly below normal, 
temperatures on Monday.

By Tuesday through the middle of next week, additional shortwaves 
are expected to dive southward providing more slight chance PoPs for 
light rain or snow showers. At this time, the GFS and ECMWF both 
show cyclogenesis occurring off of the East Coast as a stronger 
shortwave deepens the upper trough. This would result in more cold 
air spilling into our area and the bulk of precipitation remaining 
far to our east.

The winter chill has definitely arrived with temperatures forecast 
to be below normal through at least the forecast period.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Our warmer weather is gone and it 
looks like the cold is here to stay. Robust long wave trough 
barreling down across a large portion of the U.S. behind the 
departed, strong, cold front. With the front now to our east, 
surface high pressure begins to build in today across the area. 
Though low clouds and precip will be gone, mid/upper level clouds 
will hang in through the day and yield mostly cloudy skies. Highs 
will be a good 15 degrees colder today as cold air has ushered in 
behind the front. Highs will generally be in the low to mid 40s, 
which is around 8 degrees below normal. 

Overnight, some moisture moves NE out of the Gulf Coast states but 
will remain well off to our SE. The only affect to our weather will 
be some more clouds moving northward into our area. Because of 
additional clouds moving in overnight, lows will generally stay 
right around freezing to a few degrees blow freezing for most 
locations. The colder overnight lows come in the long term period. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...The theme for Thursday 
through Friday Night will be that the Tennessee Valley/southern 
Appalachians will be between the northern stream storm track (over 
the Great Lakes/upper Ohio Valley) and southern stream (from Texas 
across the southeast United States). Plenty of high level clouds 
will remain, but precipitation will be rather limited.

For Saturday, latest GFS and ECMWF agree with taking a fast moving 
short-wave farther north across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley and 
just brushing southwest virginia and northeast Tennessee with light 
precipitation. A mixture of snow and rain showers are expected. 
Limited snow accumulations are possible across the higher 
elevations, such as High Knob, especially Saturday night.

For Sunday and Monday, dry west to northwest flow aloft and 
surface ridging will produce dry conditions and milder 
temperatures for Monday.

For Monday night and Tuesday, another short-wave dives toward the 
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Precipitation in for the form of snow is 
possible, but the evolution of the system will likely change, so will
not get too specific.

this front will be edging off the Cumberland Plateau and through the 
Great Valley fairly quickly after the valid period of the public 
forecast begins this evening. Sufficiently dry northwest flow 
will be filling in behind this front by midnight which will leave
very little precipitation behind across the forecast area. There 
will just be a slight chance for a sprinkle or flurry in the 
higher terrain along the North Carolina border through the 
remainder of the overnight period, as cold air builds into the 
region. Wednesday will be a quieter; albeit much colder day with 
chilly northerly flow pulling high temperatures back a good 
fifteen degrees below today's highs. 

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...The main story in 
the long-term forecast will be the persistent arctic air 
intrusions into the area and the chance for snow showers and 
flurries over the weekend. 

To start the extended forecast period, a baroclinic boundary will 
stretch across the Gulf Coast eastward to the Carolina Coast. Cold 
air advection to the north of this boundary will produce lows on 
Thursday morning in the upper 20s to mid 30s for most valley 
locations. The upper level pattern throughout the extended forecast 
will take shape during this timeframe with a longwave trough across 
the Eastern CONUS and a longwave ridge across the Western CONUS. A 
cold front will approach the forecast area on Thursday as a 
shortwave trough digs into the Lower Mississippi River Valley. PW 
values ahead of this boundary will be near the 10th percentile in 
the 0.2-0.3 inch range and do not expect any precipitation with this 
frontal passage. The aforementioned trough will move across the 
Tennessee River Valley on Friday with cyclogenesis along the 
Carolina Coast with the baroclinic boundary. With this occurring 
well to the east, expect most area will remain dry but models depict 
the northwestern periphery of the precipitation will be near the 
Smoky Mountains and into SW North Carolina. Therefore, have 
continued with a small mention of snow showers for these areas on 
Friday. 

The main chance for widespread snow showers/flurries will come on 
Saturday as an upper level trough dives southward out of Canada into 
the Tennessee River Valley. Another arctic boundary associated with 
this trough will race across the region. Model soundings indicate a 
shallow layer of saturation from about 850-700 mb with some 
suggesting weak instability less than 100 J/Kg. Due to this have 
continued with slight chance to chance PoPs with best chances north 
of I-40. The recent GFS has backed off slightly with the QPF values 
and think any accumulation at this time would be less than an inch, 
again with best chances north of I-40. The main story will continue 
to be the cold weather. On Sunday morning, 850 mb temperatures will 
drop down into the -13 to -8 degrees Celsius range or around two 
standard deviations below normal. This will lead to morning lows in 
the upper teens to low 20s on Sunday. 

Temperatures will moderate some on Monday as the intrusion of arctic 
air takes a brief break. Regardless, the upper level pattern 
continues to be rather unchanged with another blast of cold air 
forecast to arrive on Tuesday with the chance for light snow 
showers and flurries once again.

.AVIATION...Wide band of showers will continue through the
afternoon ahead of slow moving frontal boundary. Tried to keep
terminals generally mvfr until further moistening and slightly
stronger lift right along the front later this afternoon into the
evening. Additionally, there is some weak downsloping apparent
around tys northeast through tri which could keep lower ceilings
from becoming predominant. The ifr period; mainly due to
visibility reduction in rain and fog, continues from cha through 
tri from around 20z through about 02z. Would expect visibility to
improve to some degree behind the frontal boundary with slightly
higher windspeed and cross terrain flow out of the north. However,
an mvfr ceiling may hang around for a few hours until drier air
eradicates the overcast layer. The terminals should be vfr on

.DISCUSSION...Upper trough progressing toward the Upper Ohio
and Mid Mississippi Valley with surface cold front heading into
Middle Tennessee at mid morning. The system is rather 
unimpressive with baggy surface pressure and temperature 
gradients. In this environment, with the upper level flow 
flattening out with time; as is usually the case with a weak 
system, the boundary should struggle a bit over the higher 
Cumberland Plateau terrain. The flow in the first few thousand 
feet above the surface isn't really that strong. Therefore, will 
remove the dramatic temperature drop wording in some of the 
western zones. Certainly, dense cloud cover and rain should slow 
warming today, and although temperatures may top out through mid 
day would expect the mercury to hold nearly steady or drop a 
degree here and there. The rain is making decent progress toward 
the Tri- Cities so will adjust pop up on the leading edge of the 
precipitation shield while tweaking the back edge a bit over the 
Cumberland Plateau where the rain will gradually diminish from 
about 2-5 pm.

.Short Term (Today and Tonight)...An active period with a strong 
frontal boundary moving through the region this afternoon. A 300 mb 
jet over the Ohio Valley will place the area under the favored right 
entrance region of the jet enhancing the frontal-genetic forcing.

Widespread showers will accompany the frontal-genetic band with 
model sounding showing some elevated instability (rather limited 
though) over the Plateau and southern half of the Tennessee Valley.
Due to the strong deep vertical ageo-strophic forcing along the 
front, will include a slight chance of thunder with the area of 
elevated instability.

Given PWs between 1.15 and 1.3 inches, plenty of moisture will be 
available with PWs ranging from the 90% and Daily Max PW 
climatology. Locally heavy rains are expected, but given the 
progressive nature, widespread flooding issue are not expected. 
Localized runoff or street flooding is possible.

Besides the rain, strong low-level jet will produce windy conditions 
across the higher elevations with breezy elsewhere. Will continue 
with wind advisory through early afternoon.

Due to the cold air advection behind front and frontal-timing in the 
early afternoon, highs today will likely be around noon/early 
afternoon with falling temperatures by mid to late afternoon.

For tonight, cold air advection, left over moisture and orographic 
lift from northwest flow will allow rain to change to light snow 
showers/flurries over the higher elevations. Little to no 
accumulation expected. Otherwise, dry air advection will dissipate 
the cloud cover from west to east.

.Long Term (Wednesday through Monday)...At the beginning of this 
period, the large polar upper trough will now have a firm grip on 
the area, and it should have this grip through the entire period. At 
the surface, the initial front will be past us, and cooler air will 
be pouring into the area.  

Question about Wednesday and Wednesday night, as drier air pushes 
into the area, but a wave of lift near our eastern areas may keep 
the threat of light POPs in our far east Wed and SE on Wed night. 
Will keep some light POPs from Smokies southward on Wed, and in SW 
NC counties Wed night.  Snow shower threat in SW NC on both Wedneday 
night and Thursday night, but very light.  Totals each night less 
than 1/4 inch in the higher terrain there.

There will be several short waves moving through the area--looks 
like one short wave that will bring some moisture with it and a 
reinforcing cold front will arrive on Saturday.  It should be cold 
enough on Saturday for snow showers, even in the valley.  In the 
mountains, after the front passes, we will see upslope snows 
lingering as the valley turns dry, but the moisture in the mountains 
looks like it will not last very long as drier air continues to push 
into the region.  

For temps, guidance looks good except for Saturday.  Will go about 3 
degrees below guidance T Max for Saturday, considering lift, clouds, 
and extremely cold thickness values surging into the area.  This 
colder air will make better chances of light showers in the valley 
being snow showers in addition to (or instead of) rain showers for 
Saturday.

Clouds are increasing and lowering tonight ahead of an upper 
trough and cold front still moving into the mid Mississippi Valley
this evening. South to southeast winds were increasing across the
forecast area so have increased winds across the foothills and 
higher elevations for the rest of tonight into Tuesday morning. 
May have to issue wind advisory later tonight as could increase 
more ahead of southwest low level jet that could reach 50 knots
across northern areas Tuesday ahead of the strong cold front. The
showers were now moving into the Ohio Valley and have reached central
KY. Adjusted rain chances downward in the southwest and hourly 
temperatures and dew points. Temperatures were a little below 
forecast already in the eastern sections where lower clouds had 
not reached and winds were still light. Expect clouds to lower 
with showers beginning in the west before morning and then 
spreading east during the morning. A mild night with lows in the 
40s to mid 50s. Update sent.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...The cold front associated with
the Mid America upper trough will be moving through the forecast
area on Tuesday spreading showers from west to east through the
day. The rain may not begin on the Cumberland Plateau until 
around four to five in the morning, and the character of the
rainfall should be rather light at onset. However, rainfall rate 
will increase just ahead of the boundary on the plateau around 9 
am, sweeping east across the remainder of the forecast area 
through late afternoon. Low temperatures will be rather mild for 
early December due to the southerly component ahead of the front, 
along with increasing cloud cover. Tuesday highs will be a few 
degrees cooler than the fine day we experienced today, however 
maxes will still be several degrees above normal. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Sunday)...A cold front will be 
exiting to the east to start the long-term period of the forecast 
Tuesday Night. Showers will come to an end from west to east. 
There is some question around will there be enough moisture 
leftover Tuesday night for a few snow shower/flurries in the 
mountain. For now, have continued with a slight chance of a 
rain/snow mix but latest models are rather progressive and depict 
the precipitation exiting by 06z Wednesday. 

The main story for the long term will be the persistent intrusion of 
arctic air into the area. The highly amplified pattern remains fixed 
throughout the long-term forecast period with a deep trough across 
the Eastern Conus and a ridge across the Western CONUS. The first 
shot of cold air will arrive Wednesday behind the initial front as 
the upper level pattern begins to amplify. Partly to mostly sunny 
skies are forecast in the dry airmass with PW values in the 0.2-0.3 
inch range. High temperatures will only top out in the 40s across 
most valley locations. 

Another shot of cold air will arrive with a dry frontal passage late 
Wednesday night into Thursday as a upper level trough dives south 
out of Canada into the Ohio River Valley. High temperatures once 
again on Thursday will top out in the upper 30s to 40s. Another 
shortwave trough will dig further southward on Friday into 
Tennessee River Valley with 850 mb temperatures crashing into the -
10 to -8 degrees Celsius range. These values are two standard 
deviations colder than normal. The airmass remains dry but there 
could be enough lift with the trough diving further southward for a 
few flurries or light snow showers on Friday. Temperatures will warm 
into the upper 30s and lower 40s so any light precip would 
transition to the liquid form for most locations Friday afternoon.

The best chance for precipitation during the cold blast will come on 
Saturday as yet again another shortwave trough rounds the base of 
the longwave trough. This clipper system will move into the area on 
Saturday with light snow shower/flurries possible. Moisture remains 
limited and do not expect any significant accumulations. Will not 
mention anything in the HWO at this time but will continue to 
monitor trends throughout the week. This system will bring in yet 
again another shot of cold air with 850 mb temperatures down into 
the -15 to -10 degrees Celsius range. The coldest days of the 
forecast period will be Friday and Saturday with highs only in the 
upper 30s to low 40s. The coldest morning will be Sunday with lows 
in the upper teen to low 20s. 

Temperatures will moderate some on Monday but remain a few degrees 
below normal. Models beyond the long-term period suggest that the 
cold arctic air intrusion will continue well into next week.

.AVIATION...Flight weather quite good today at the terminals. If
any spot becomes a problem it would be at cha due to lower 
ceilings lurking nearby to the west. Would not expect any ceiling 
that develops to last more than an hour or so here. The more 
likely scenario would be for a lower vfr ceiling forming around 
01z tonight as a strong storm system approaches through the
Mississippi Valley. Deterioration will occur toward daybreak due 
to the possibility of some light rain and mvfr category ceilings. 
Eventually, heavier rain and lower mvfr ceilings will build into 
cha during the last couple hours of the forecast. The weather 
regime at tys and tri will be much better with little chance for a
ceiling forming below ten thousand feet until about 10z at tys, 
and not until 16z at tri due to a warming and drying southerly flow
across the higher terrain east of the Great Valley.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Clear sky and calm winds will
allow patchy fog to develop early this morning, but mainly near
area lakes and streams. 

Surface and upper ridging is moving east of the southern 
Appalachians allowing return flow of south to southwesterly winds 
Today and Tonight. The southerly winds and plenty of sunshine 
(only high clouds) will allow temperatures to warm nicely today.

For tonight, increasing southwest winds ahead of a strong cold
front will pull moisture back into the Tennessee Valley and
southern Appalachians. Isentropic lift ahead of fronto-genetic
forcing will begin to increase the coverage of showers toward
daybreak Tuesday. Increasing southwest low-level jet will also
produce breezy conditions across the higher elevations early
Tuesday morning.

.Long Term (Tuesday through Sunday)...A cold front will cross the 
area on Tuesday, bringing rain followed by much colder temperatures 
for the rest of the week. Tuesday's cold front will bring periods of 
heavy rain to the area with most areas seeing 1-1.5" through Tuesday 
night. PWATS are near climatological maxes for this time of year, 
but with fairly dry antecedent conditions and the progressive nature 
of the front, no flooding issues are expected. The majority of the 
moisture associated with this system will push east of the area 
before colder air works in overnight Tuesday, but a few snowflakes 
may mix in at the highest elevations Tuesday night with little to no 
accumulation expected. As the trough over the eastern US continues 
to deepen through the rest of the week with a few shots of 
reinforcing short wave energy rotating out of Canada, our area will 
remain entrenched in cold air. Expect highs for the second half of 
the workweek in the 40s with overnight lows dropping well into the 
20s. While models are in good agreement that this deep trough will 
remain in place through the weekend, the finer details vary. 
However, both the ECMWF and the GFS show a clipper system diving out 
of Canada this weekend. This clipper will further reinforce the cold 
air overhead with highs this weekend staying in the 30s across the 
north and higher elevations and lows dipping into the teens. As is 
the case with clipper systems, there is limited moisture available 
and significant snow accumulations are not expected, but it should 
be enough to spark some flurries at lower elevations and some 
upslope snow showers across the higher terrain.

to the upper 30s to upper 40s at mid evening with dew points a 
degree or two lower. Increasing cirrus clouds may affect how dense
the fog becomes. Lowered current temperatures and dew points to
current readings but no significant changes. Updated forecast

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Monday)...
Now that the fog has finally broke temperatures are starting to
warm up quickly across the area this afternoon. Still expect 
daytime temperatures to be close to what we saw yesterday. 
Overnight lows will once again drop to near the dewpoint values 
resulting in possible fog. Sheltered locations have a good shot at
seeing fog overnight, but we could also see more patchy fog 
across the area. Then tomorrow we expect to see a similar story 
again with warm temperatures and mostly sunny skies.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
Some rain is on the way followed by the big chill. Rain will 
develop ahead of an amplifying long wave trough and cold front; 
beginning on the Cumberland Plateau later Monday night with 
continuation across the remainder of the forecast area on Tuesday.
Most areas will pick up around three quarters to as much as an 
inch of rain. The rain will be slowly edging east out of the 
region later Tuesday night. Much colder air will be building in 
behind the front and there could be a couple snow flurries in the 
higher terrain across Northeast Tennessee just as the 
precipitation is ending. Several pieces of short wave energy will 
shift south out of Canada on the back side of the long wave trough
which will serve to hold the feature in place. This means that 
we're looking at a very cold latter half of the week with high 
temperatures a good 15 to 20 degrees lower than the balmy near 60 
degree readings we will enjoy on Tuesday. Detailed timing and 
positioning of the clipper short waves not yet available but it 
appears there will be two main features. The first moves across 
the area later Friday into Friday night with the second moving 
across the area on Saturday. It doesn't look too impressive for a 
great deal of snow with mainly flurries in the lower elevations 
with some snow showers in the higher terrain aided by orographic 
lift. At this time, Sunday appears to be dry.

.DISCUSSION...
Fog has been very slow to leave the area this morning, but is
finally starting to break up. This will likely cause a bit of a
damper on high temperatures as it means less time for the sun to
reach the surface and heat it up. Otherwise once the fog burns off
it will be another pleasant day to end the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Clear sky, calm winds, and saturated air-mass has allowed patchy
fog to develop with some dense, especially near area lakes and
streams. At this time, coverage does not warrant an advisory.

Surface and upper ridging will keep conditions dry and
unseasonably warm today with highs in the upper 50s and 60s most
locations.

For tonight, clear sky and calm winds will once again allow
temperatures to drop quickly due to good radiational cooling.
Patchy fog is possible near area lakes and streams.

.Long Term (Monday through Saturday)...Active weather pattern for 
the long term with mild temps to start, then rain, followed by the 
coldest air of the season.

Through Monday night, ridging ahead of an approaching storm system 
will keep conditions mild and dry. Highs on Monday will climb into 
the low to mid 60s under warm, southerly flow. This will also keep 
lows well above average Monday night, ranging from the mid 40s to 
mid 50s.

By Tuesday morning, models are in fairly good agreement on placing 
the front over west TN. Shower chances will increase from west to 
east through the day on Tuesday with the highest chances for rain 
looking to come during the mid afternoon through evening. PW values 
will be near to slightly above the 90th percentile for this time of 
year based on soundings. With plenty of forcing in place, we could 
see some moderate to locally heavy rain as this system sweeps 
through. On average though, most places will see around 0.75-1.5 
inches of rainfall from Tuesday morning through Wednesday morning. 
Behind the front Tuesday night cold air rapidly surges in and some 
snow will mix in overnight at higher elevations. However, the front 
and most of the associated moisture will already be well to our east 
by this point and little to no accumulation expected at this point. 
Light snow showers/flurries could linger Wednesday morning across 
the favored eastern slopes as the now NW flow will help to squeeze 
out any remaining moisture.

From Wednesday through Saturday a deep longwave trough will be in 
place across the entire Eastern United States. This will allow for 
the colder air to be locked in through the remaining long term 
period. Highs will generally be in the low to mid 40s with lows in 
the 20s. Wednesday and Thursday will be dry, but by next weekend 
both the GFS and ECMWF show another low diving down into the already 
present long wave trough. This will bring in another reinforcing 
shot of cold air and perhaps some moisture which could result in 
light snow showers/flurries across much of the area. Confidence is 
fairly low in the weekend system at this point, so for now have 
capped PoPs in the slight chance category.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...
As expected, temperatures are warming up to well above normal for
this time of year under sunny skies. Dry air in the mid/upper
levels will continue to push the clouds out of the area, and
overnight this could help temps drop down to near the dewpoints
again. As with the last couple of nights any fog that does form
should be patchy, and widespread dense fog is not expected. A
similar story will unfold tomorrow with warm temperatures and
clear skies expected to continue.

.Long Term (Sunday night through Saturday)...Active weather pattern 
for the long term with mild temps to start, then rain, followed by 
the coldest air of the season.

Sunday night through Monday night we are under the influence of 
ridging as a storm system develops across the Northern Plains. 
Ridging will keep us mild and dry during this period. Lows on Sunday 
night will be in the upper 30s to lower 40s. Highs on Monday will be 
in the low to mid 60s. By Monday night southerly flow begins to ramp 
up out ahead of the approaching system and associated cold front. 
Lows Monday night will be in the mid 40s to low 50s, around 15 
degrees above normal. By Tuesday morning models in decent agreement 
on frontal placement showing the front back across West TN. Showers 
chances will increase from west to east through the day on Tuesday 
with the highest chances for rain looking to come between mid 
afternoon and early evening. PW values will be near the 90 
percentile for this time of year based on soundings. With plenty of 
forcing in place, we could see some moderate to locally heavy rain 
as this system sweeps through. On average though, most places will 
see around three quarters of an inch to one inch of rainfall from 
Tuesday morning through Wednesday morning. Behind the front Tuesday 
night cold air rapidly surges in and the higher elevations will 
switch to snow overnight but most of the moisture will already be to 
our east. Little to no accumulation expected at this point. Light 
snow showers/flurries could linger Wednesday morning across the 
favored eastern slopes as the now NW flow will help to squeeze out any 
remaining moisture.

From Wednesday through Saturday a deep longwave trough will be in 
place across the entire Eastern United States. This will allow for 
the colder air to be locked in through the remaining long term 
period. Highs will generally be in the low to mid 40s with lows 
ranging from the lower 20s to upper 20s. Wednesday through Friday 
looks mostly dry but will have in slight chance pop here and there 
due to model inconsistency. Next weekend both the GFS and ECMWF show 
another low diving down into the already present long wave trough. 
This will bring in another reinforcing shot of cold air and perhaps 
some moisture which could result in light snow showers/flurries 
across much of the area.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A weak shortwave will cross the area today, bringing morning
clouds to the region. As the wave moves east this afternoon, skies
will clear. With very little moisture available, no precipitation
is anticipated today. Upper level flow becomes more amplified by 
tonight, with ridging building out of the central US. This will
maintain dry and pleasant conditions areawide.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...
Amplified pattern results in ridging on Sunday and Monday keeping
us dry, mostly clear, and warm. In fact, we'll have very warm 
temperatures on Sunday and Monday with highs about 10 to 15 
degrees above normal. High and midlevel clouds will be on the 
increase during the day on Monday ahead of a longwave trough and 
surface cold front. As a jet streak across the Upper Mississippi 
River Valley and the Great Lakes strengthens on Monday, upper- 
level divergence across the Ohio River Valley will lead to a 
strengthening low-level jet across the Tennessee River Valley. 
PoPs will increase on Monday night as isentropic lift increases. 
The cold front will move through the region on Tuesday with likely
to categorical PoPs along and just ahead of the cold front 
primarily midday Tuesday through early Tuesday night. There is not
much instability ahead of the cold front, so do not expect 
thunderstorms at this time. Could also have some locally heavy 
rainfall on Tuesday with PW values and integrated water vapor 
transport around the 90th-95th percentile. There is much better 
consistency in guidance and ensembles with the timing of the cold 
front and heaviest precipitation, so forecast confidence is 
increasing and is higher than yesterday with this upcoming system 
on Tuesday.

We'll have to pay for the amplified pattern and warm temperatures 
early in the week with very cold air late week. Behind the cold 
front, temperatures take a nosedive as troughing sets up over the 
Eastern CONUS and cold, surface high pressure from Canada slides 
southeastward into our region. Shortwave energy will continue to 
rotate through the longwave troughing pattern keeping the late week 
forecast cold and uncertain, and it will bring the potential for 
some light rain or snow showers/flurries with these quick moving 
systems. At this time, the best chance for precipitation may be on 
Friday as models show a strong shortwave and quick moving surface 
low with limited moisture moving through the Ohio River Valley, but 
forecast confidence this far out is very low. Overall, the best 
chance for precipitation late week will be across the higher 
elevations where low-level winds will enhance orographic lift in 
northwest flow and make the most efficient use of the limited 
moisture. Just remember that the main weather story through late 
next week is the very cold air. This will likely be the first real 
shot of very cold air this winter season for our area with 
temperatures potentially 10 or more degrees below normal on Thursday 
and Friday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
Sun has been able to shine today and that has lead to temperatures
a few degrees above normal across the area. Expect a quiet day for
the rest of the afternoon into tonight. While we haven't really received
any rainfall during the daytime today the dew point depressions
are a few degrees closer compared to last night. So we could see
another round of fog overnight tonight. A very weak ripple of
energy will move across tomorrow and could bring a slight chance
of rain to the North Carolina counties in our forecast area.
Chances are very low, but enough to mention in the forecast with a
20% chance of rain.

.Long Term (Saturday Night through Friday)...
The upper level flow becomes amplified in the long term and this 
is good news on the front end of the extended forecast with a nice
ridge building into the region and strengthening southerly flow. 
This will allow for some most pleasant sunshine and above normal 
temperatures. The warmth will continue right into Tuesday however,
the advertised deep trough and cold front will be on the move 
toward the Appalachians. A very high likelihood of showers will 
accompany the front on Tuesday. Some rather high pops were broad 
brushed on Tuesday night due to uncertainly in frontal timing, 
with some differences developing between the ecmwf and gfs that 
become even more significant in the latter part of the extended. 
Much colder air will be streaming south across the Southern 
Appalachian region Wednesday through Friday with highs struggling 
to rise into the lower 40s both Thursday and Friday. Model 
differences are apparent in this cold period, but it looks like 
about three shorter wavelength features build southeast through 
the established long wave pattern. Difficult to determine the 
strength and timing of the features at this time, but there will 
be periods of slightly deeper moisture along with some rather 
decent orographic lift. Therefore, applied some slight chance pops
for a few snow showers in the major terrain areas; mainly across 
the northern part of the forecast area.

Some mid level clouds will stick around this afternoon but
conditions should remain mostly in VFR. Overnight we could see
another round of fog. No rain expected today, but dew point
depressions are closer together than at this time yesterday... So
have put fog in the TAFs but the exact density of it is still
uncertain at this time. Conditions will return to VFR with the
rising sun tomorrow.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Saturday)...
Cold front has pushed east of the area and showers have ended.
The back edge of the clouds associated with the front will move
through during the next few hours, but low level moisture trapped
along the mountains will keep low cloud cover and fog across the
area through the morning hours today. Surface high pressure and
zonal upper level flow builds in for the afternoon hours through
Saturday, bringing increasing sunshine and mild temperatures with
highs in the upper 50s and lower 60s.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Thursday night)...
Ridging is expected on Sunday and Monday keeping us dry, mostly 
clear, and warm. Very warm temperatures will be expected across 
the forecast area on Sunday and Monday with highs about 10 degrees
above normal. High and midlevel clouds will be on the increase 
during the day on Monday ahead of the longwave trough and surface 
cold front across the Great Plains. A strong 150+ kt jet streak 
across the Great Lakes will enhance upper-level divergence across 
the Ohio River Valley, and in response, lead to a strengthening 
low- level jet across the Tennessee River Valley. PoPs will 
increase on Monday night and Tuesday morning as isentropic lift 
increases in response to the strengthening southwesterly flow with
likely PoPs along and just ahead of the cold front primarily 
Tuesday afternoon and night. There is not much instability ahead 
of the cold front, so the chance of thunderstorms is very low and 
have only included a slight chance for thunder in the forecast. 
Could also have some locally heavy rainfall on Tuesday with PW 
values and integrated water vapor transport around the 90th 
percentile. PoPs have been broadbrushed to a degree because of the
uncertainty with timing of frontal passage. The ECMWF is much 
quicker bringing the cold front through around Noon on Tuesday and
the GFS is slower with frontal passage occurring closer to 
sunrise on Wednesday. This is about an 18 hour difference between 
the two models, and is the reason that higher PoPs are spread out 
from Tuesday through Wednesday at this time. Behind the cold 
front, temperatures take a nosedive as troughing sets up over the 
Eastern CONUS and cold, surface high pressure from Canada slides 
southeastward towards our region. Shortwave energy will continue 
to rotate through the longwave troughing pattern keeping the late 
week forecast cold, uncertain, mostly cloudy, and bringing the 
potential for some light rain or snow showers/flurries with these 
quick moving systems. This is especially true across the higher 
elevations where low-level winds will enhance orographic lift in 
northwest flow. The big story through late next week appears to be
the very cold air. This could be the first real shot of very cold
air this winter season for our area with temperatures potentially
10 or more degrees below normal by late next week.

should be out of our area around 06Z, and the forecast will be
updated to speed up the decrease of PoPs accordingly. The back
edge of clouds seen in satellite across Middle TN is expected to
move through between 07Z and 13Z, although low level moisture
trapped behind the mountains may keep low cloud cover or fog in

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
Light showers continue to move eastward ahead of the frontal 
boundary moving through the region. Rainfall amounts with this
cluster of showers has been pretty light as it's moved through and
I expect that to continue through this afternoon/evening. 

Skies should begin to clear out behind the front and the colder
temperatures could lead to fog early tomorrow morning. With how
little precipitation is occurring right now it doesn't look like
widespread dense fog is likely, but the typical sheltered
locations could see reduced visibilites tomorrow morning.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
Saturday through Monday Zonal flow builds in behind the departing
upper trough while lower level ridging strengthens over the 
Southeastern U.S. This will be a very pleasant period with 
increasing sunshine and a nice warming trend with high 
temperatures ending up several degrees above normal again by 
Monday. Pops may be a bit broad brushed in terms of time scale, 
with slight and low chance probabilities back in the forecast 
Monday night ahead of a deepening upper trough and associated 
surface frontal system. The chance for showers increases during 
the day Tuesday with the best chance at seeing a lengthy period of
rain on Tuesday night in the vicinity of the cold front. 
Additional short wave energy drops southeast into the back side of
the deepening trough over the eastern half of the nation at mid 
week. This will keep quite a bit of cloud cover around on 
Wednesday with decreasing clouds and pops moving into Thursday. 
Much colder air will be spilling south into the Southern 
Appalachians in association with this deep trough, and 
temperatures should be cold enough for some snow showers later 
Wednesday night into Thursday morning. A few orographic snow 
showers could continue in the higher terrain along the North 
Carolina border later Thursday into Thursday night.

.DISCUSSION...
Quick morning update with some minor tweaks to precipitation
chance grids and temperature grids as this cold front approaches
our area. Coverage of the showers is still pretty meager at this
time, so have slightly decreased precipitation chances in some
locations. A few isolated stronger cells within this line could
lead to some places picking up a quick tenth of an inch of rain,
but overall still think that most places will get less than 0.10
inches of rain by the time the showers have passed through.

.Short Term (Today through Friday)...
Weak frontal passage will bring light rain to the area especially
this afternoon and evening. POPS of 60% seemingly dominate the
forecast, but QPF amounts are going to be skimpy...the POPS look
worse than the nature of the event. But the front and precip will
end by Friday, allowing Friday to be a pretty nice and mild day
with weak ridging.

.Long Term (Friday Night through Wednesday)...
Dry air and high pressure will be in place to start the extended 
forecast with PW values in the 0.4-0.6 inch range. These values 
are around the median value for late November. A weak mid-level 
trough will move through the Southern Appalachians late Friday 
into early Saturday. Moisture as mentioned will be somewhat 
limited and models only depict the possibility for a few light 
showers across the higher elevations along the Tennessee and North
Carolina line. Therefore, did continue with s slight chance for 
precipitation across the higher elevations late Friday into early 
saturday. 

The majority of the weekend will be dominated by high pressure and 
northwesterly flow aloft. Cloud cover in association with the mid-
level trough on Saturday will keep temperatures in the mid 50s to 
low 60s. Higher heights aloft, southerly low level flow and an ample 
supply of sunshine will push highs up into the upper 50s to mid 60s 
on Sunday and Monday. 

A robust upper level trough will move into the Central CONUS on 
Monday with a strong cold front stretching across the Great Plains. 
A 25-35 kt low level jet will advect in moisture Monday and Tuesday 
with PW values up into the 1.2-1.4 inch range by Tuesday afternoon. 
Looking at model soundings, it appears that any instability will be 
limited and less than 250 J?Kg. Due to this, have not mentioned 
thunderstorms in the forecast at this time. Models are fairly 
consistent with the onset of precipitation late Monday into early 
Tuesday. Models diverge some with the strength of the southern 
shortwave trough early in the week. The ECMWF is more progressive 
with the trough and pushes the front through the forecast area by 
Wednesday morning. The GFS is a bit weaker with the southern 
shortwave trough and about 12 hours slower with a more NE-SW 
oriented front. Due to this, have elevated PoPs Monday night through 
Wednesday.

The main story in the extended will be the influx of arctic air 
across the eastern half of the CONUS as a longwave trough digs in 
across the region. A few shortwave troughs will rotate around the 
base of the longwave trough and models do indicate the possibility 
of some light snow showers near the end of the long-term period.

.DISCUSSION...
A band of midlevel clouds ahead of a vort max is poised to move 
into our area from the west, and radar shows some light precip 
falling from it. However, it is not reaching the ground according
to surface obs and based off dry low level air seen in the OHX
sounding. As a result, model depictions of precip in the southern
parts of the area seem a bit overdone, and the forecast will
remain dry for tonight, with the chance of rain holding off until
morning when deeper isentropic lift arrives. Temperatures have
fallen more quickly than forecast, below forecast lows at some
spots, so adjustments will be needed to hourly and min temp 
grids for the update.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Clear skies will allow for a generally persistence forecast 
through the remainder of today/tonight. Clouds will begin to 
increase from west to east overnight into tomorrow which should 
keep overnight temperatures a few degrees warmer than last night, 
especially in the southern valley. 

Drier atmosphere today will gradually get replaced with increasing
clouds and more moist air into tomorrow. A shortwave/cold front
combination is expected to swing through tomorrow bringing a quick
round of precipitation. Precipitation should begin along the
Cumberland Plateau tomorrow morning/afternoon and should come to 
an end in the Southern Appalachian Mountains by Friday morning. 
Moisture won't have much time to return to the region before the 
front moves through, so QPF amounts are expected to be light. 
Locations that do see rainfall will likely get less than a quarter
inch before Friday morning. Depending on the exact timing of the
arrival of the front some places (especially in along the
Cumberland Plateau) should be a few degrees cooler on Thursday
compared to today.

.LONG TERM...(Friday morning through Wednesday)...
High pressure will be the dominant feature through the long 
term...with temperatures at or several degrees above normal for 
this time of year. Low and midlevel flow will be weak and out of 
the north Friday and Saturday. By Sunday...flow will be out of the
west to southwest...with weak moisture and warm air advection 
possible. Monday...a trough and associated frontal boundary will 
approach the area. Clouds will increase through the 
afternoon..with a line of showers and thunderstorms possible by 
Tuesday morning...lasting through the afternoon. Models are trying
to show enough lift and instability for the first decent chance 
for thunderstorms...but with recent model inconsistency and this 
time of year...will say confidence is low on timing and intensity 
of storms Tuesday. After the front moves east of the Appalachians 
Tuesday night...the low pressure will strengthen...bringing cold 
air advection to the area beginning Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Ridge of high pressure across the eastern states gradually shifts
east today as a weak cold front moves into the Ohio Valley. This
front will weaken by tonight just to the north of the region. A
closed upper level low over Oklahoma early this morning will move
into the Mississippi Valley late today and open up as it
approaches the Tennessee Valley. Most of the moisture associated 
with the system will be confined to west of the forecast area
through early Thursday morning but clouds will increase overnight.
Removed rain chances through sunrise Thursday.

Tonight skies are mostly clear. Wide range of temperatures from 
readings in the 20s in colder sheltered valleys northeast but 
warmer 40s to lower 50s where mixing is occurring. Because the air
mass is still very dry temperatures will warm quickly into the 
lower to mid 60s once again this afternoon. Tonight skies will 
initially be mostly clear then increasing clouds overnight with 
lows from the lower 40s to lower 50s except some 30s northeast 
where clouds move in late.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...
A mid-level shortwave trough will approach the area on Thursday 
with southwesterly flow in the low levels advecting in moisture 
into the Southern Appalachians. PW values will increase into the 
90th percentile for late November on Thursday. Model soundings 
indicate that the saturation will generally be below 600-700 mb 
and only forecast a tenth to two tenths of an inch of precip. at 
the most. A cold front associated with the mid-level trough will 
pass through the area late Thursday into early Friday. High 
pressure will build in behind the departing front on Friday. 
Cooler and drier air will advect in on Friday with PW values in 
the 0.2-0.4 inch range with precipitation coming to en end early 
Friday. The cold air advection behind the boundary is not overly 
impressive and with mostly sunny skies on Friday, highs will top 
out in the mid 50s to low 60s for most locations. 

The surface high will shift to the east late Friday into early 
Saturday with light southerly flow returning by Saturday afternoon. 
There is a weak upper level trough that moves through during this 
time period but the atmosphere will be too dry except for a few 
light showers across the higher elevations. Ridging from the 
surface to the upper level will build in on Sunday with high 
temperatures rising up into the upper 50s to low 60s. 

The GFS and ECMWF both indicate a more robust upper level trough 
moving across the Northern Plains to start the work week. Southerly 
flow ahead of this system will continue to keep temperatures above 
seasonal averages. There are some timing differences in the models 
but both indicate increasing PoPs late Monday into Tuesday. 

Just beyond the long-term forecast both models indicate strong cold 
air advection behind the boundary with temperatures well below 
normal by the middle of next week.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...
With surface ridging to the east, weak WSW flow aloft, and very
dry air remaining through the air column with a clear sky, expect
efficient radiational cooling with coldest temperatures in 
protected valleys. Once again, there could be some patchy fog in
protected river valleys but don't expect it to be widespread. 
Temperatures are forecast to be in the 30s.

Closed low across the Southern Plains will become an open wave 
trough and progress eastward tomorrow, but 850-700 mb winds 
remain out of the WSW/W ahead of the disturbance with continued 
dry air evident through the mid to upper levels in forecast 
soundings. May have some scattered clouds, especially across the 
southern portions of the forecast area, but don't anticipate any 
precipitation on Wednesday. With surface ridging to our east and 
similar 850 mb temperatures, expect surface temperatures to 
remain above average and be within a degree or two of Tuesday
afternoon observations.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Monday)...
A closed upper low over the OK Panhandle region today will track 
east across the Ozarks tonight, and across our area Wednesday 
night. It will weaken as it approaches, and low level moisture 
will remain quite limited, according to model forecast sounding 
profiles. The main impact will be increasing clouds, but a slight 
chance PoP seems warranted for southern sections late Wednesday
night as shown by the NAM and SREF, both of which produce light 
QPF. 

Greater lift and moisture will arrive on Thursday ahead of a 850-700 
mb shortwave trough. Advection of warm/moist air with a SW 20-25 kt 
LLJ will bring rising rain chances through the day. Model agreement 
with this timing is much better than previous runs, so PoPs on 
Thursday will be raised into the likely range. The surface cold 
front lags behind and does not cross the area until late Thursday 
night, so likely to high chance PoPs will be continued for that 
period. For Friday, high pressure will settle into the OH Valley 
region, with a dry W-NW flow aloft.

Both the GFS and ECMWF show a weak shortwave trough crossing the 
area on Saturday, which spread some moisture into the Southern 
Appalachians. The are some differences with the position of this 
moisture, with the ECMWF keeping it to our east. Will have a slight 
chance PoP for now along the mountains. 

A more amplified pattern develops for next week, with a large ridge 
over the Southeast through Monday. The ridge gets suppressed as a 
trough moves into the Great Lakes, which may result in rain chances 
returning on Tuesday.

.DISCUSSION...
Overall forecast looks on track and made minor adjustments to
account for current observations. Surface ridge to the east in
leading to a weak southerly flow across the area with increasing
low-level moisture especially evident across the southern
Tennessee Valley. However, with mixing through the afternoon and
very dry air aloft, expect dew points to fluctuate or drop. Expect 
lowest dewpoints across the higher elevations of the TN/NC 
mountains and northeast TN/southwest VA where afternoon minimum RH
could be in the 20-30 percent range with isolated lower values 
across the higher elevations. Otherwise, it will be a pleasant
day with mostly sunny conditions and above average max temperatures
in the upper 50s to mid 60s across the forecast area.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

The surface ridge has shifted just to the east with calm winds and 
cold temperatures early this morning. Ideal radiational cooling 
conditions continue with clear skies and light winds with 
temperatures in the upper 20s to mid 30s across most locations to 
start the day. PW values remains near th 10th percentile for late 
November with values in the 0.2-0.3 inch range. Will start to see 
some light southeasterly to southerly flow later today as the 
surface high shifts further to the east. Warm air advection and 
higher heights aloft will lead to highs a couple of degrees warmer 
than yesterday with temperatures ranging from the upper 50s to mid
60s for most locations. The warming trend will continue tonight
with overnight lows in the mid 30s to low 40s.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...

Weak trough will continue to make it's way towards our area and 
ahead of it we should get some increasing moisture due to southerly 
winds. Weak trough will also bring through a weak front late 
Thursday into early Friday morning. We should see precipitation 
along the front, but QPF amounts should be pretty light through this 
event. Highest precipitation chances begin Thursday afternoon and 
continue through early Friday morning until the front passes 
through. Front doesn't pack to much of a punch and winds will 
quickly return to a westerly/southerly flow behind it so 
temperatures won't take too much of a hit as it passes through. 

Relatively zonal flow sets up behind the front and we continue with 
similar weather to what we have seen for the past few days leading 
up to today. Some of the long term models hint that we see a weak 
secondary short wave zip across over the weekend, but there is still 
disagreement with how to handle this system. Even if it does come to 
pass that a shortwave moves across it looks to be relatively quick 
and only brings a chance of rain on Saturday afternoon. After
these two systems move through we begin to see ridging build in 
and temperatures warm up into the upper 50's/60's across much of 
the area as we move into next week.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
Surface ridge begins to shift eastward overnight bring a return of
a weak southerly flow. With weak flow, clear sky, and dry air,
believe that a strong nocturnal inversion should keep winds calm
across the lower elevations with light southerly winds across 
higher terrain after midnight as 925-850mb southerly winds 
increase to 10-15 knots. This should keep the higher terrain more 
mixed out for most of the night with coldest temperatures in 
protected valleys and lower elevations by sunrise.

The increased southerly flow and upper ridging will continue to
keep the area under a mostly clear sky and abundant sunshine on
Tuesday with temperatures expected to be about 4-5 degrees warmer
than on Monday. The southerly flow will allow some moisture return
on Tuesday, but it remains dry with max dew points in the 30s and
low RH.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Sunday)...
High pressure near the NC/SC coastline plus a low pressure system
moving across the Great Lakes will equal a strengthening 
southerly low level flow across the region to start the period. A 
warm front and associated isentropic lift will begin to spread 
clouds over our area starting Wednesday, with warm advection 
bringing temps into the lower 60s. 

A mid/upper level closed low is expected to cross the 
area Wednesday night, which will increase lift and the chance of 
rain. Moisture still appears shallow at this time, so will only have 
low to slight PoPs with this feature. Better rain chances arrive on 
Thursday afternoon as forcing with the cold front and upper jet 
moves through, but model agreement with the timing of this is not 
good, the NAM being a slower outlier. Thus, will carry chance PoPs 
into Thursday night. 

Behind the front, slightly cooler temperatures can be expected, but 
highs will still be a little above normal for the weekend. The flow 
through the weekend will be nearly zonal aloft, with surface high 
pressure over the TN/OH Valley regions. On Monday, the surface ridge 
will be east of the Appalachians, while the mid/upper pattern will 
become increasingly amplified with a large ridge over the Southeast. 
The next chance of rain appears to come after the end of this 
forecast package, with the models currently in poor agreement on 
the progression of the ridge.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

A cold start this morning with ideal radiational cooling conditions 
in place with the surface high overhead with light winds and clear 
skies. Temperatures this morning will start off in the mid 20s to 
low 30s for most locations. The low level ridging will continue to 
be the main focus throughout the short-term forecast. PW values will 
be around the 10th percentile for late November with values in the 
0.2-0.3 inch range. The center of the surface high will shift to the 
east late in the short-term period with weak southerly flow 
returning by late tonight. An ample supply of sunshine and higher 
heights aloft will push high temperatures up into the upper 50s to 
low 60s for most locations. Radiational cooling conditions will 
continue tonight with light winds and clear skies. Weak southerly 
flow should make for slightly warmer overnight lows with 
temperatures generally in the 30s.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...
High pressure in control Tuesday and into Wednesday will produce 
sunny...warm and dry conditions. Will then transition into an 
unsettle pattern for mid week. Models in poor agreement with 
details but are generally on board with bringing a minor short 
wave in from the southwest Wednesday night and a weakening frontal
boundary in around the Thursday time frame. With the initial 
round Wednesday night...the air mass aloft remains rather dry and 
precip amounts to be fairly light and with a seasonally warm air 
mass in place...precip should remain rain. Southerly flow will 
continue to moisten the air mass ahead of the approaching frontal 
boundary...and expect a band of light to moderate rainfall to push
across the area on Thursday into Thursday night. Models are a bit
faster that previous runs and while a few showers may linger 
across portions of the area into Friday...by Friday night...high 
pressure will begin to build in and will dominate area weather 
through the rest of the extended period.

this morning. Where there is some weak mixing, temperatures are in
the 40s with sheltered valley locations in the low to mid 30s. 
When these winds eventually subside, expect temperatures will drop
quickly with most locations in the 30s by daybreak. 

Mostly sunny skies are forecast today with the dry airmass in place. 
The forecast area is in the right exit region of a strong upper 
jet to the north with subsidence aloft. Cold air advection is 
forecast to continue behind the front today. The cold air 
advection is not overly impressive and think the ample supply of 
insolation will be enough to favor the higher side of guidance 
with most locations topping out in the 50s. 

Ideal radiational cooling conditions are forecast tonight as the 
surface high to the west builds across the Southeastern U.S. Light 
winds and clear skies will allow for temperatures to drop down into 
the upper 20s to low 30s with the coldest temperatures forecast for 
those favored sheltered valleys.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...

Surface high pressure will dominate the area with a ridge 
building in aloft Monday into Tuesday. As a result...the extended 
will begin in a quiet weather pattern with dry and clear 
conditions. Southerly flow developing over the region combined 
with plenty of sunshine will produce good daytime heating. This 
will allow temperatures to warm to near or slightly above seasonal
norms. The area will then transition into a more active pattern. 
Models diverge through the rest of the extended and confidence 
becomes quite low. First...models somewhat on track with a 
weakening frontal boundary coming in from the northwest combined 
with a minor short wave pushing up from the south on Wednesday 
into Thursday. The southerly flow ahead of the system will bring 
in low level moisture but dynamics is minimal and overall should 
see an initial round of showers move in over southern locations on
Wednesday...then a band of light to moderate rainfall moving 
through Wendesday night and Thursday. Temperature profile current 
looks to be warm enough for all rain. Then...models show 
significant differences with the ECMWF slower to exit the system 
while the GFS quickly pushes the system out and quickly brings a 
secondary front into the area Thursday night into Friday. For now 
...will keep isolated to scattered showers in the forecast for 
this period. Cooler temperatures will move in by this time and 
could see a mix of rain and snow over northern areas and along 
higher elevations late Friday night. Dry conditions should return 
for Saturday.

.Short term (This Afternoon through Sunday)...Dry frontal boundary 
has moved southeast of the area with weak northwest flow. Surface 
riding will rebuild into the southern Appalachians overnight and 
Sunday. Dry airmass will remain with PWs near 0.25 inch.

The dry air, clear sky, and light winds overnight will allow 
temperatures to drop nicely. Patchy fog is possible near area lakes 
and streams, but advection of drier air will limit develop. Coverage 
of fog will be limited so will no include at this time.

Dry air and plenty of sunshine Sunday will allow for temperatures to 
warm nicely Sunday afternoon with return of unseasonably mild highs 
once again. Dry afternoon relative humidity is expected.

.Long term (Sunday night through Saturday)...High pressure will 
remain over the area through Tuesday...with mostly clear skies and 
dry weather expected. Northwest flow that set up over the weekend 
will quickly transition to out of the SW bringing warmer and moist 
air advecting into the area. Temperatures will be several degrees 
below normal Sunday night...quickly warming to near or a degree or 
two above normal for Monday through Wednesday. 

By Thursday...a weak shortwave will move ahead of a frontal boundary 
associated with a deep trough...providing a source of lift to the 
area Thursday morning. Scattered showers are possible by late morning
...increasing in coverage through the day Thursday into Friday 
morning as the frontal boundary moves through the area. PW values 
are around 75th percentile for this time of year...but little to no 
instabilities are present. With winds also chaotic in the low 
levels...would expect light showers...with an isolated shower 
producting several tenths of an inch of rain at once. 

The front is expected to move east of the Appalachians by Friday 
night. Nowrthwest flow could keep light showers over the higher 
elevations in SW VA and eastern TN. Cold air is expected to move in 
behind this system.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Upper-level trough pivots southward today allowing a surface cold
front to move quickly through the area. A surface ridge to our 
south will limit moisture return across the area as we remain in a
westerly flow ahead of the system. Because of the limited 
moisture and limited lift along the front, expect very low PoPs 
with just a slight chance of a light rain shower or sprinkles. 
The cold front should be southeast of the area by 00z Sunday 
bringing drier air and subsidence behind the front. Should begin 
to clear out on Saturday night with some lingering clouds
possible in the upslope flow right along the mountains and in SW 
Virginia early in the night before drier air advects into the 
region. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...
The extended will begin quite benign with surface high pressure 
in control and weak ridging developing aloft. This will allow for 
a quiet weather pattern with dry and mostly clear conditions. 
Daytime heating will slowly moderate the initial cool air mass and
temperatures should reach near normal levels early in the work 
week. The only system of concern this extended period will be a 
combination of a weakening frontal boundary from the northwest and
a minor short wave coming in from the south. This weather pattern
will bring a chance of showers to the area...mainly affecting 
Wednesday night into Thursday. There remains some model 
differences but overall expect to see a mix of isolated to 
scattered showers move through the region. At this point...the 
temperatures profile looks warm enough for an all rain event with 
amounts expected to be fairly light. A few showers may linger into
Friday as high pressure begins to build back in.

.Short Term (This Afternoon through Saturday)...Surface ridging will 
remain across the area overnight producing calm winds with only high 
level cloudiness anticipated. Good radiational cooling tonight will 
allow patchy fog to develop once again at/near area lakes and 
streams. Some of the fog may be locally dense.

For Saturday, a frontal boundary will move across the area during 
the afternoon. Due to persistent ridging into the Gulf coast states, 
limited moisture is expected with frontal passage. Will keep chances 
of rain low with only slight chance of measurable rain at best. 
Mainly include sprinkles. Plenty of mid-level cloud cover 
anticipated.

.Long Term (Saturday night through Thursday)...High pressure and 
northwest flow will settle over the area through Monday...with 
cooler and drier air advecting into the area. Temperatures are 
expected to be a couple of degrees below normal Saturday night and 
Sunday. The high pressure system and upper level ridge will move 
east through Monday...with low and mid level flow shifting to out of 
the SW. This will bring warmer and more moist air to the area 
through the middle of the work week...with temperatures nearing 
normal by Monday night into Tuesday. A shortwave moving through a 
trough Wednesday afternoon through Thursday morning will bring lift 
to the area and a chance of scattered showers. Large amounts of mid 
level dry air will keep showers light...with instability limited. 
Models have diverged from yesterday...so confidnece is low on timing 
and impacts with this system. Behind the shortwave on 
Thursday...flow will then shift to out of the northwest 
again.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
To sum it up, Friday looks like a perfect day for late November
with temperatures about 5 degrees above normal. Upper-trough axis
shifts to the east today with heights and thickness values rising
across the area. With subsidence and dry air aloft, expect a 
clear sky and abundant sunshine. Surface high pressure will also 
shift to the southeast today with light winds turning to the W/SW 
during the afternoon. Max temperatures are expected to be 4-5 
degrees warmer than Thursday with increasing thickness, 850mb 
temperatures, and lots of sunshine.

An upper-level trough will approach late Friday night with a
trailing surface cold front. Cloud cover will increase from west
to east during the night keeping minimum temperatures on the
warmer side. Moisture will be limited with this system as ridging
across the Gulf Coast prevents much moisture return from our south
and keeps 850mb-700mb winds from the west ahead of the front.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...
Overall...it should be a rather quiet extended. However...the 
period will being with a weakening frontal boundary moving across 
the region. On Saturday... a cold front will push through. This 
system is showing little moisture or lift and expect mainly an 
increase in clouds as it move through. However...across northern 
areas and in the higher elevations where orographics adds to the 
lift...there may be sufficient energy for isolated showers. 
Surface high pressure builds in behind the front....bringing in 
cooler and drier air. This high will remain on control of area 
weather Sunday through Tuesday. With abundant daytime 
sunshine...the cool air mass will quickly begin to moderate and 
should see highs reaching near normal levels Monday and Tuesday. 
By Wednesday and Thursday...models begin to diverge and confidence
lowers. However...models do want to bring another weak frontal 
boundary through during this time frame. Timing and the amount of 
moisture are in question and for now will continue with current 
forecast of 20 to 30 pops for this system.

Dew points are a little higher tonight than last night, but with
dry soil and very dry air aloft, do not believe temperatures fall
enough for fog to become much of a problem. Should continue to 
have a clear sky through the period with light winds beginning to 
shift to the S/SW on Friday afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...Surface high pressure will 
continue to be over the region and the atmosphere will be on the 
dry side through the short term period. Expect a clear to mostly 
clear sky and generally seasonable temperatures through the 
period. Will undercut MAV temps again a bit for lows tonight, but 
not much argument with highs tomorrow.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Wednesday)...A ridge of high 
pressure shifts to the east while a trough and associated frontal 
boundary swing through the area Saturday. Low and mid level winds 
remain chaotic...with little mositure advection present ahead of 
this trough. Enough instability and lift will be present to initiate 
a few showers...but with limited moisture...only expect a couple of 
tenths of an inch accumulation at most in areas of NE TN and SW VA. 
Saturday night...the boundary is expected to be east of the 
Appalachians with NW flow setting up through the beginning of the 
work week. Temperatures will drop to around 4-8 degrees below normal 
through Monday. A ridge of high pressure quickly moves through the 
area Monday and Tuesday...with low level flow transition to out of 
the SW. Mositure and warm air advection will be possible and 
temperatures will slowly warm to near normal by Tuesday. Wednesday 
into Thursday...another trough and associated frontal boundary are 
expected to move through the TN Valley...though models in 
disagreeemnt right now on amount of moisture and timing.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...A weak short wave will shift 
northeast out of the Gulf of Mexico with little impact other than 
a few clouds across Southwest North Carolina. Another weak wave 
will press east across the northeast quarter of the nation; again 
with little impact due to the fact that deep moisture will not be 
available for lifting. Therefore, there will be an abundance of 
sunshine today with a clear sky tonight. Max and min temperatures 
will be just a tad below normal with highs in the 50s and lows in 
the lower and middle 30s. 

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday night)...We should stay 
mainly dry through the extended period with limited moisture in 
place. A shortwave trough will dive southward on Friday night and 
Saturday rotating through the longwave troughing pattern across 
the Eastern CONUS. A cold front will move southward with this 
system on Saturday providing 10-20 PoPs across the area. There is 
very little moisture with this system with surface ridging to our 
south inhibiting moisture transport into the area. Mid-level flow 
from 850-700mb is also dry from the WNW ahead of the front. Any 
precipitation that does occur on Saturday will be light with the 
best chance for light rain across the mountains and southwest 
Virginia.

In the wake of this cold front, high pressure takes control on 
Sunday and Monday with clear conditions and cool, dry air in place. 
On Tuesday, high pressure is expected to shift to the east resulting 
in a more southerly/southwesterly flow which should allow more 
moisture ahead of the next system which is expected to affect us 
around Wednesday. However, there is high uncertainty with the exact 
timing, strength, and available moisture with this potential midweek 
system because of large differences in how the GFS and ECMWF handle 
the upper-level pattern as well as large spread in the GEFS members. 
Because of the uncertainty, kept PoPs in the slight chance/chance 
range toward the end of the period.

weather day is in store as surface high pressure will extend into 
our area through tomorrow. Will see a clear to mostly clear sky 
for the most part, although models hint of a weak inverted surface

be a just a few degrees below seasonal normals. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday Night through Wednesday)...Fairly tranquil 
pattern will hold pretty much through the period, although a frontal 
passage on the new Day 7 may bring scattered showers into the area. 
Day-to-day temperatures will bounce around a little bit, but expect 
temps to be about 5 to 7 degrees above normal for Fri-Sat, then 
thanks to a late Saturday (dry) frontal passage temps will hover 
closer to normal Sun-Mon, then return to above normal Tues ahead of 
that shower-producing front for Wed.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Latest water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate
trough axis associated with Hudson Bay low extends south across
the area this morning. As the trough shift east today and surface
high pressure begins to build in, expect clearing skies and
afternoon sunshine to help push the temperatures into the upper
40's to middle 50's across much of the area. Meanwhile higher
terrain will see temperatures only reach into the lower 40's by
late afternoon. Mostly clear skies overnight tonight will lead to
lows in the upper 20's to lower 30's across most of the area, or
about 6-9 degrees below normal, by Thanksgiving morning.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...
It should be a relatively calm weather pattern through the long 
term period. Surface ridging should keep us dry and clear late 
this week. An upper-level shortwave trough will dig southward on 
Saturday bringing a cold front through the region. However, we 
should stay mostly dry on Saturday because of surface riding to 
our south inhibiting moisture return ahead of the front. High 
pressure builds in behind the cold front for Sunday and Monday 
with max temperatures 5-10 degrees below normal on Sunday. Monday 
morning will likely be the coldest morning with dry air in place, 
a clear sky, and high pressure centered over our area. By Tuesday,
the surface ridge shifts to the east resulting in a warmer 
southerly flow and moisture return to the region ahead of the next
front.

A cold front is currently moving into the forecast area with an
upper level trough moving across the Great Lakes. PW values ahead
of the boundary are in the 0.6-0.8 inch range,which are slightly
above normal for mid to late November. Model soundings indicate
that the moisture ahead of the boundary is shallow and only 2-3
kft deep. Latest Hi-Res guidance suggests a few sprinkles or light
showers across the higher elevations through midnight or so. For
now, have continued with 20-30 PoPs for the higher elevations.
Cooler and drier air will advect in behind the front ending these
low PoPs late tonight into early Wednesday. Overnight lows will
range from the mid to upper 30s.

Upper level trough continues to swing across the area today with
an approaching weak frontal boundary. With limited moisture,
expecting a mainly dry fropa with just a slight chance for some
drizzle/light showers across the higher terrain through the
overnight hours. Surface high pressure will build in behind the
front, with a dry west-northwest flow aloft. Slightly colder
temperatures are expected for tomorrow with highs topping out from

the day Wednesday, with sunshine expect areawide by the afternoon.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Monday)...Quiet weather 
will be in store for us the rest of the week and through the 
upcoming weekend. Dry air behind the front will lead to clearer 
skies and a slow warm up in temperatures the second half of this 
work week. Secondary front will push through over the weekend and 
bring in another round of colder temperatures. Right now most 
models depict that the front will move through dry, but there is a
chance for a quick shower as it passes through if we get enough 
moisture return ahead of the system. After this system passes 
through we will begin to try and warm up again as we head into 
next week.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Thursday night)...
A low level ridge off the NC/SC coast will produce a southerly
flow that will advect higher theta-e air across GA and into the
Appalachians today, while a cold front will advance toward our
area from the NW. Satellite and obs show low clouds spreading N
across GA, nearly to our SW NC counties. Model moisture profiles 
show that it is confined below 850 mb with very dry air above, but
with some isentropic lift from a 30-40 kt wind at 290-295 K, 
drizzle or light rain will be a possibility today, mainly in the 
mountains. NAM QPF amounts over a tenth in SW NC seem rather high 
given the lack of moisture depth, and just a few hundredths of an 
inch seems more realistic. The cold front sweeps through our area
late tonight, which will be a dry fropa for most of the area with
the low level moisture/isentropic lift having pushed east of the 
mountains by that time.

Surface high pressure will build over the region for the rest of 
the short term period, with a dry W to NW flow aloft. A shortwave
trough that crosses the area on Thursday will have too little
moisture with it to affect the sensible weather, other than
perhaps an increase in high/mid clouds. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Monday)... 
Some rather decent weather is in store for the last few days of 
November even though another upper trough and cold front will be 
building across the region over the weekend. The front moves 
through on Saturday but there is no low level inflow of moist air 
off the Gulf due to the presence of a large surface ridge over the
Southeast states. Another amplified ridge pattern fills in behind
the early weekend system for a gradual return to sunshine. The 
sunshine won't be too effective in warming the lower atmosphere 
Sunday and Monday with highs rising only to the 40s both days.

.AVIATION...Moisture advancing north in association with a short
wave trough emerging out of the Northern Gulf of Mexico will move
across the Great Valley today through tonight leaving a low vfr
layer in place. Will have to watch this layer as it may drop into

.DISCUSSION...Another quick update tonight. Clouds and southerly
flow still haven't made a ton of progress into the area. CHA just
now reporting southerly winds within the last hour but clouds
still well off to our south. This has allowed temps to fall even
further. Update is to lower temps once again. Will send out new
zones for temp update.

.DISCUSSION...Clouds and southerly flow are slower to move in than
previously forecast, thus allowing temperatures to drop more
quickly. Have adjusted overnight lows to better reflect current
situation. Most places were only dropped 1 or 2 degrees but a few
spots more. Once southerly flow moves in clouds should follow and
will help to slow cooling. No other updates planned. Will send out
new zones for temp adjustment.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...Surface high pressure will
shift east of the area tonight but will remain the main weather
feature providing scattered high clouds and dry conditions. Winds
will become southerly tonight with circulation around the high and
this will bring some increase in low level moisture. The
increasing dew points should offset somewhat the good radiational
cooling and allow temperatures to be a few degrees warmer tonight
with lows generally expected in the 30s across most valley
locations. On Tuesday...the southerly flow will bring a weak
disturbance into GA and then the Carolinas. The main affect for
the MRX CWA will be a few bands of clouds moving through...mainly
over southern and eastern areas. A stray showers will be possible
across extreme southwestern NC with the rest of the area expected
to stay dry. The sunshine and southerly flow will also help
moderate temperatures and afternoon highs on Tuesday should reach
into the mid to upper 50s across lower elevations.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday Night through Monday)...Storm path stays well to 
our north, and our humidity seems low enough that the tail end of 
systems won't be able to generate enough precip to mention through 
the extended period, with the lone exception of Tuesday night in the 
mountains, where 20 percents will be placed. Temperatures won't 
stray too far from normal through the period.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Surface high pressure over West/Middle TN this morning will shift
east to the NC Piedmont through the period, while the flow aloft
will shift from a NW flow this morning to a W-SW flow tonight.
Clear and dry conditions will prevail in the NW flow today. Wtih
full sun, highs will be 6-8 degrees above yesterday, generally in
the 50s. Shallow low level moisture may start to increase late 
tonight as the 850 mb flow turns to the SW and warm advection 
picks up, with lows in the 30s expected.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...
The extended will be characterized by generally dry west to 
northwest flow aloft and persistent surface ridging.

The GFS and ECMWF keep the main storm tracks well north along the 
Canadian/United States border and far southeast United States with 
little to no synoptic forcing over the Tennessee Valley.

For Tuesday, a storm system moving across the Great Lakes will pull 
a frontal boundary souht across the area Tuesday night. Boundary 
layer moisture does get pulled north ahead of this front Tuesday 
producing mostly cloudy sky for TYS/CHA, but limited moisture, so
generally dry frontal passage.

For Wednesday through Friday night, surface ridging and dry 
northwest flow aloft will produce dry conditions and seasonal 
temperatures.

For Saturday, another dry frontal boundary moves across the southern 
Appalachians/Tennessee Valley as Gulf moisture remains well south 
and east of the area. The frontal passage brings chilly and dry 
conditions for Sunday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...
Northwest flow remains in place across the area today. This will
continue to shuttle dry, cool air into the area. Cloud cover is
gradually starting to clear across the south and this trend will
continue through this evening into the overnight hours. 

The combination of colder, drier air and clear skies will result
in cold temperatures overnight with lows dropping into the 20s
areawide. Wind chills will dip into the teens in the mountains
overnight. 

Surface high pressure will be in place tomorrow and upper level 
flow becomes more zonal, allowing temperatures to rebound a bit, 
climbing to near 50 across the north and the mid 50s across the 
south. With high pressure in control, clear skies and light winds
are expected.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
Surface high pressure over the region Monday night and Tuesday 
will allow for continue dry and cool conditions. A weak frontal 
boundary will push through the area late Tuesday into Tuesday 
night. With little moisture in place and minimal moisture or lift 
associated with the system...mainly expect an increase in cloud 
cover. So for now...will keep the forecast dry. High pressure 
builds back in for Wednesday through Friday for continued dry and 
cool conditions. Another weak system moves through during the 
weekend. Confidence quite low in details but models again show 
little moisture or lift attached to the system. At best...expect a
few isolated showers across northern areas and over higher 
terrain. A few flurries may mix in Saturday night.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Behind the exiting cold front, a NW flow pattern will be in place
across the area today. Observations across the area this morning
show winds falling below advisory criteria, so the Wind Advisory
will be allowed to expire. Scattered to isolated showers will 
continue for northern sections this morning, with the higher 
elevations seeing some light snow accumulations. With 850 mb cold 
advection and a second 500 mb vort max crossing the area this 
afternoon, cloud cover will be slow to clear today, and will have
high temps a little below MOS guidance. With clearing tonight and
the surface high building into Middle TN, lows will fall into the
20s area wide tonight.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...
Seasonably cool and dry conditions will dominanate the forecast 
through the extended. Main storm track will be mainly north and 
south of the area with surface ridging from the southern 
Appalachians in the Gulf Coast states.

This surface ridging will not allow deep Gulf moisture to return 
northward into the area through the extended. Even though a frontal 
boundary will move through the region late Tuesday/Tuesday night, 
only effect will be shallow boundary layer moisture producing cloudy 
sky for Tuesday.

Models do show a Gulf of Mexico system pulling northeast across the 
far southeast United States for the latter half of the week, but 
synoptic lift and moisture will stay well south and east of the 
southern Appalachians. 

For next Saturday, another frontal boundary will move across the 
region, but again little to no moisture and dynamics, so dry 
conditions anticipated with frontal passage. However, have included 
a chance of orographic lift producing showers across the mainly the 
higher terrain.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...
Gusty winds out of the south will continue into this evening
before a cold front crosses the area. Rain will overspread the 
area as the front moves through and could be heavy at times.
Precipitation will quickly move out of most of the area after 
midnight as the front continues to march east. The line of storms 
currently moving into west Tennessee looks healthy, but there's 
less instability to work with over our forecast area and the line 
should weaken as it moves through our forecast area this evening. A
few isolated thunderstorms will remain possible, but the main 
threat for our area will be the shifting but continued gusty winds
through the overnight hours. Winds should diminish after sunrise 
Sunday as the cold front moves east of our forecast area. Cooler 
air working in behind the front combined with lingering moisture 
over the eastern mountains will produce some snow showers 
overnight across the higher terrain, but accumulations should top 
out around 1-2 inches. With the strong cold air advection behind
the front, it will be much colder tomorrow, with highs staying in
the 40s across much of the forecast area.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Friday)...
Cool...dry air will continue to push in behind an exiting cold 
front with surface high pressure building in. This will allow for 
a quiet beginning of the extended with dry conditions and slowly 
moderating temperatures Sunday night through Tuesday. Model 
consistency begins to degrade by mid week with a weakening frontal
boundary moving through around the Tuesday night time frame. The 
amount of moisture available and timing remain in question but 
overall trend should allow for a slight chance of showers mainly 
over northern areas and across higher terrain. Will be between 
systems Wednesday through Saturday for a dry and quiet end to the 
extended...however there is a system approaching around the 
Saturday time frame but for now this looks to hold off until later
in the weekend.

.AVIATION...
The main aviation concern today will be gusty winds associated
with a cold front that will cross the forecast area tonight.
Ahead of the front this afternoon, SW winds will gust up to 35 kts
with MVFR cigs. Rain will move in during the 00-06Z timeframe as
the frontal passage pushes through and lower visibilities to MVFR
levels. Along and behind the frontal passage, winds will shift to
the W-NW but stay gusty, with gusts up to 30 kts through daybreak
Sunday. Lower cigs will persist behind the front into early Sunday
with gradual clearing across the south during the morning and
slower clearing farther north.

305 AM EST Sat Nov 18 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Clouds will be increasing through the day as isentropic lift
strengthens ahead of the approaching low pressure system, which is
now near the KS/MO border. As it tracks into the Ohio Valley
region this afternoon, S-SW winds at 850 mb will increase to
around 50 kts, creating gusty conditions area-wide. Moisture
remains confined below an inversion around 750 mb today, and only
increases in depth after 00Z in forecast soundings. Once the
inversion erodes, we develop some weak instability that should 
allow for some isolated thunderstorms in the evening. 
Frontogenetic forcing moves through in the 02-07Z time frame, with
strong advection of colder/drier air occurring through the rest 
of the night. A change of precip to snow in higher elevations may 
also occur, enhanced slightly by a 30-35 kt NW flow, but any 
accumulations will be less than one inch through 12Z.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...
Upper trough will move quickly east of the area Saturday 
night/Sunday morning with northwest flow aloft. Boundary layer 
moist and cold enough in the morning Sunday to produce a chance of
snow showers/flurries across the west/northwest facing slopes. 

Drier air will advect into the region with snow showers ending and 
clouds dissipating in the afternoon Sunday. A much cooler day is in 
tap for Sunday.

Upper flow pattern quickly de-amplifies flattens for Sunday night 
and Monday with strong surface riding producing mosty sunny 
conditions.

For Tuesday and Wednesday, another strong upper trough moves across 
the Great Lakes with trailing front moving across the Tennessee 
Valley. This frontal boundary will be moisture starved given the 
Gulf moisture will remain south and east due to continued surface 
ridging over the Gulf Coast states.

There is a potential of seeing some orographic showers/snow showers 
over southwest Virginia/northwest Tennessee early Wednesday, but 
confidence too low to mention. Will keep Frontal passage mainly dry 
for now.

For the latter half of the week, models differ in the evolution of a 
Gulf coast system that moves into the southeast United States. At 
this time, plan on following the dry northwest flow aloft ECMWF 
pattern along with surface ridging. Will keep Thanksgiving 
Day and Friday dry.

257 PM EST Fri Nov 17 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
Clouds move in tonight and tomorrow morning ahead of an 
approaching cold front. This will keep overnight lows mild, only
dipping into the 40s across the majority of the area. For
Saturday, south-southwest winds ahead of the cold front will
increase throughout the day, producing breezy conditions across
much of the area by the afternoon hours. This fast southerly flow
will also help temperatures warm into the mid 60s Saturday
afternoon before the overnight cold frontal passage. Rainfall
chances will gradually increase across the Plateau Saturday
afternoon/evening, but the majority of the rainfall should hold
off until after nightfall as we transition to the long term period.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)... 
Focus of the long term will be from Saturday night through Sunday
as this is where all the action is, then pretty quiet for the 
rest of the period. 

Cold front is quickly approaching to begin the period with models 
showing the front across middle TN. There will be a well defined 
line of showers moving through the area with perhaps a few embedded 
thunderstorms but soundings still show weak instability. The
biggest threat with this line will be strong and gusty winds due 
to a strong 850 jet screaming through the area. Any heavier 
showers moving through could transport stronger wind gust down to 
the surface but the main source of the winds will be from the 
tight pressure gradient. A wind advisory starts in the short term 
period and carries into the long term period ending 08Z Sunday. It
looks like the highest winds will occur across the higher 
elevations. Models still show the front to our east by midnight 
with much colder air pouring in behind the front. Lingering 
moisture will transition over to snow showers across the highest 
elevations where up to half an inch of snow is still possible. A 
few flurries may be possible across the lower elevations of 
extreme NETN and up into SWVA. Precip generally ends Sunday 
morning as much drier air moves in. Highest elevations could hold 
onto light precip into early Sunday afternoon as upslope flow 
wrings out any remaining moisture. Highs on Sunday will be in the 
lower to upper 40s with calmer winds than Saturday but still 
breezy. With overcast skies through much of the day, cold temps, 
and breezy conditions, wind chill values will range from the upper
30s to low 40s during the afternoon hours with values down into 
the upper teens across the highest peaks, above 5000 feet.

High pressure slowly builds back in on Monday and Tuesday with 
gradual warming temps but another trough and weak front move through 
on Wednesday. Still keeping Wednesday precip free as little moisture 
is present with this system. Thanksgiving and Friday continue to 
look nice as of now with highs in the lower to mid 50s.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Surface high pressure will drift from the Ohio Valley this morning 
to the NC coast by tonight, while a 850-700 mb ridge will also be 
crossing our area today. Cloud cover along our northern broder 
should retreat as this ridge progresses east and the flow in that 
layer turns to a SW direction with warm advection in the afternoon. 
Cirrus in advance of the jet stream will be over the area today, 
with highs in the lower to mid 60s expected. Tonight, a 
strengthening SW flow as low pressure tracks into the Great Lakes 
region and its resulting positive theta-e advection/isentropic lift 
should bring increasing cloud cover, but moisture depth and lift 
will not be adequate for precip yet. Higher elevations could be 
breezy tonight as the LLJ increases to around 40 kts, but the 
SW direction of flow does not favor a mountain wave event.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...

At the beginning of this period, we will be in a fast WSW flow 
aloft, that will be in the process of backing, as an upper trough 
and frontal system approach the area.  At the surface, as mentioned 
a front will be to our west, ridging in the Carolinas, and a return 
flow intensifying over us.  The front is expected to move quickly 
through our area generally Saturday evening.  

The weather from Saturday through Saturday night will be quite 
active with increasing winds Saturday and into Saturday evening 
ahead and behind the front.  The angle of the winds is not set up 
for a classic mountain wave pattern, but the winds are favorable for 
stronger winds up the valley, even flirting with advisory criteria 
for parts of the valley.

Showers and possible embedded storms will bring even faster winds 
from aloft, down to the surface, as the precip moves in from the 
west late Saturday afternoon and into the evening. Late Saturday 
night as the colder air moves in the rain showers will be changing 
over to snow showers in the higher mountains, and lingering into 
Sunday morning.  

Sunday will be much colder, and with an inversion above the cold 
air, moisture will likely be trapped making for stubborn 
stratocumulus clouds for a good part of the day, especially in upper 
east TN and SW VA.  This will help prevent the temps from rising 
much on Sunday as well, so went a few degrees below guidance at most 
locations.  

For the rest of the forecast, it turns very quiet overall, with 
temperatures rebounding as we get into the work week.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
Ridging and surface high pressure building in from the north will
maintain fair skies and dry conditions across the area through
Friday. Winds will be a little gusty in the mountains this 
evening, but should stay well below advisory criteria. Under clear
skies, lows tonight will dip to near freezing areawide. With 
sunny skies Friday, temperatures will warm into the lower 60s.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Wednesday)...
The start of the long term will be quite active but after our 
system passes through there is not much to talk about. The main 
focus of the forecast will be from Friday night through Sunday.

Southerly flow rapidly increasing across the area on Friday night 
out ahead of a strong cold front located back across the Great 
Plains. On Saturday the 850 jet is quite strong across the area with 
values from 50 to 55 knots. Southerly flow will allow some moisture 
to be transported north into our area by moreso the warmer air. 
Highs on Saturday will be in the mid to upper 60s. The strong 850 
jet will allow for gusty winds areawide. The higher elevations will 
likely need a wind advisory as we get closer to the event. Rain 
chances increase from west to east as we go through the day as the 
front draws closer. By late afternoon chances really begin to ramp 
up as a strong 300 mb jet core spreads across the region just out 
ahead of the front. Models in decent agreement on timing but there 
is still some minor disagreement. The earliest that the line would 
arrive would be around 6 PM and the latest it would arrive would be 
around 9 PM. So somewhere between 6 and 9 is when we expect the 
heaviest showers to move into the area. This line will be moving 
pretty quickly so the heaviest showers should only last for 3 or 4 
hours. The actual front should be to our east by midnight. Soundings 
show very little instability but enough present that there could be 
a few embedded thunderstorms within the line but mainly expecting a 
rain event. Looks like most places will see around half an inch of 
rainfall. 

Cold air quickly ushers in behind the front and temps will drop 
fast. The higher elevations could see a few snow showers as moisture 
lingers just behind the front. The highest peaks could see up to 
half an inch of snow, above 4000 to 5000 feet. Light snow showers 
linger across the higher elevations into early Sunday morning as NW 
flow helps to squeeze out any remaining moisture. Highs on Sunday 
will be around 20 degrees colder compared to Saturday, with highs 
only in the mid to upper 40s. Sunday night will be quite cold with 
lows in the mid to upper 20s. High pressure gradually builds back in 
on Monday and Tuesday with temps slowly moderating. Then another 
trough moves through mid-week but it looks moisture starved so no 
POPs in place for now. The trough brings another round of cold air 
just in time for Thanksgiving.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Weak cold front sliding through area this morning.  Water Vapor loop 
shows strong, deep subsidence over the area.  The combination of 
drier air in the lower layers and subsidence from above are expected 
to erode stratocumulus layer by mid morning.  Temperatures won't be 
cooling much behind this cold front--some locations will be warmer 
today than yesterday.  Winds will be a little gusty in the 
mountains, this afternoon and evening, but should stay well below 
advisory criteria.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
With temperatures continuing to warm behind the front we should see 
highs right around normal for this time of year on Friday, and then 
a few degrees warmer on Saturday. A cold front will then sweep in 
from the west Saturday night into Sunday morning. With the front 
moving through pretty quickly we won't see much in the way of 
moisture return ahead of the front, so most of the precipitation 
over our area will come as the front is moving through in the 
overnight hours. Most places should see rain as the front passes 
through, but since it moves through pretty quickly models are 
indicating that most places see less than an inch of rainfall. As 
the front is exiting there could be enough moisture lingering around 
early Sunday morning for some of the rain to briefly switch over to 
snow in the higher elevations, but widespread accumulations are not 
anticipated at this time.

Temperatures will only be able to warm up into the 40's for most 
locations on Sunday and overnight lows will drop down into the 20's. 
Ridging begins to build in as we start the new work week and we 
experience a warming trend for a couple of days. At this point long 
range models begin to diverge with how to handle the next system 
that's supposed to roll through the east half of the United States. 
All models show a trough of some sort moving through, but there 
could be a stronger low moving across the Gulf Coast states or a 
stronger low staying well to our north near the Great Lakes keeping 
the moisture out of our area. And to throw another wrench into 
things the Canadian model is showing a low moving right over us and 
brining in widespread precipitation during the middle of next week. 
Will go ahead and keep out precipitation chances for now since the 
more consistent models keep our area dry, but early next week will 
be a time to keep an eye on the weather as models may likely change 
their tune over the next few runs.

.AVIATION...
Blanket of stratocu covers the region right now. The showers have
moved away to the east and now radar only shows a few patches of
light rain as well as the fine-line of the front heading through
Ern KY and Mid TN. The front should wash through the area in the
next few hours, and then slowly the stratocu should erode, almost
in place, as post-frontal subsidence takes effect. By mid morning
most of the ceilings should be gone, and continue with little/any low-
cloud layer for the remainder of the period. Winds will be
veering with frontal passage, but should not get that strong as
the main pressure gradient stay north of us.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Weak cold front will sweep across the forecast area tonight. There 
won't be a ton of moisture left with this boundary, but ceilings 
will be low and overcast. Areas across the Cumberland Plateau and 
far NE TN/SW VA have the best chance of seeing some scattered 
showers the evening into early tonight. A shower can't be ruled out 
farther south, but they will be much more hit or miss. Overcast 
skies will help keep lows fairly mild -- bottoming out in the 40s at 
most locations. Front will be clear of the area by dawn Thursday, 
and drier air from the northwest will funnel in behind it. This will 
help skies clear fairly quickly after sunrise and plentiful sunshine 
through the afternoon hours will allow temperatures to warm into the 
50s and even the lower 60s in southern portions of the Tennessee 
Valley.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...A dry Friday 
gives way to a return to more active weather on Saturday as a 
relatively strong upper trough shifts east from the Plains States 
to the Eastern Seaboard by Sunday. A strong cold front will move 
through the forecast area Saturday night bringing a pattern of 
scattered showers mainly during the afternoon hours Saturday with 
a better likelihood of rain area wide by evening. The system moves
quickly east with temperatures turning sharply colder behind the 
front. There may even be a snow flurry in the fading back edge of 
the precipitation shield across higher terrain areas across the 
northern half of the viewing area after midnight. Typically, 
clouds may end up being slow to clear on Sunday and it will feel a
little more like Winter with highs mainly in the 40s. The large 
cold surface high left in the wake of the early weekend system, 
will shift slowly east into the beginning of the work week as the 
upper flow becomes more zonal in configuration. The resulting 
sunshine in the fair weather pattern should help max temperatures 
rebound back into the 50s by Tuesday. The gfs and ecmwf not 
entirely on the same page at the end of the long term period, but 
it appears that a northern stream trough drives east across the 
Great Lakes and Northeastern U.S. Tuesday into Wednesday. Degree 
of forecast uncertainty quite high for this late period. Will 
await better model resolution in future runs to more accurately 
determine how this will play out.

Cigs will lower through the rest of today as an weak cold front
approaches. This will bring periods of MVFR cigs and possibly a
few rain showers to the area through tonight. Rain should be
fizzling out as the front moves across TN, so at this point only
have confidence to mention VCSH at KTRI. Models are trying to make
fog across the area tonight, but with overcast skies and a light
breeze, not enough confidence to include it at any TAF sites at 
this time. Conditions improve tomorrow with clearing skies and a
light breeze.

Stratocu ceiling should move in from the west this afternoon and

levels though. Guidance shows some light fog as well late 
tonight, but I'm leaving it out--with overcast conditions, and 
light west breeze, think fog is less likely. Weak cold front 
should be washing through during these hours as well, but slow

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Surface ridge will be sliding east, allowing return flow to start 
up, increasing the low level moisture.  A cold front currently over 
the Plains will be making its way toward the area. Showers will be 
developing ahead of the front and are expected to move into the 
western areas this afternoon and continue tracking across the rest 
of the area tonight, but probably not extending all the way to the
southern tier. The front will be moving through after midnight, 
however most of the showers will be moving through prior to 
midnight as they propagate along with the lift ahead of an upper 
short wave. Much of the area should get good amounts of sunshine 
today, although clouds will be increasing from the west during the
afternoon as the lift moves into the area. Temperatures tonight 
should be milder, with a little breeze keeping the lower levels 
mixed, warm- air advection ahead of the front, as well as a layer 
of stratocumulus for much of the night that limits radiational 
cooling.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...
Front will be east of the area shortly after sunrise on Thursday,
and colder air form the northwest will funnel in behind it. While
colder air will be moving in the skies will also be clearing out 
and allowing the sun to shine through and we should actually warm 
up into the 60's across most of the Tennessee Valley on Thursday. 
Clear skies will continue Thursday night and temperatures will 
drop into the 30's across the area with many places north of 
Interstate 40 (and those in the higher elevations) expected to get
below freezing. Ridging begins to build in at the end of the week
and temperatures will continue to warm ahead of an approaching 
cold front slated to move through Saturday into early Sunday. 

GFS is still slightly faster with the frontal passage than the 
ECMWF, but the latest run of the ECMWF has speed up a bit as well. 
Will continue to bump up precipitation chances as all models depict 
this front bringing rain, but just haven't decided on the exact 
timings of when it will begin/end. All models have the front and 
precipitation out of the area by late Sunday morning. Depending on 
the exact timing of the front we could see a brief switch over to 
some light snow flurries in the higher elevations early Sunday 
morning, but widespread snowfall is not expected and the few 
isolated places that do see snow most likely will not see any 
significant accumulations. Temperatures behind the front will be 
about 10-15 degrees colder to end the weekend, and pretty much every 
location in the forecast area should see sub freezing temperatures 
overnight Sunday. Slight ridging will build in behind the front and 
a warming trend will begin to end this 7-day forecast.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...Another fairly quiet short 
term ahead. Clouds finally eroded earlier this afternoon and this 
should allow for a clear and cold night. Temperatures are expected 
to range from the lower 30s to mid 30s for most areas. With the calm 
and clear conditions it looks like patchy fog is more likely tonight 
compared to last night. Will once again have patchy freezing fog in 
for areas that dip down to freezing. Clear conditions to start the 
day tomorrow but upper level clouds moving in through the day out 
ahead of an advancing cold front. Most areas will stay dry through 
the day tomorrow but do have in low-end chance PoP across the 
northern Cumberland Plateau by the afternoon hours and slight 
chance POP across areas generally west of I-75. Best chances for 
rain occur beyond this short term period though. Highs tomorrow 
should be in the mid to upper 50s with again increasing clouds by 
afternoon.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Monday)...Models continue to 
be in decent agreement early on but significant timing differences 
still show up by the weekend. Forecast confidence is about average 
for this time of year. A weakening and moisture starved cold front 
will move through and out of the area Wed night. Will carry low PoPs 
for some showers with this system.  A more significant front will 
push through over the weekend, but models differ in timing as well 
as the extent of the cold air behind the front, with the GFS 
stronger/faster than ECMWF and the Canadian a compromise but closer 
to the GFS.  Will smooth things out a bit given timing uncertainties 
but will carry highest PoPs Saturday into early Saturday night. May 
be a few snow showers/flurries mainly higher terrain late Saturday 
night as the colder air pushes in but right now does not look

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Some mid/low level clouds are still hanging around the NE
Tennessee/SW Virgina border early this morning. Satellite trends
are showing that these clouds are slowly eroding, but it has kept
temperatures in our northern counties a few degrees warmer than 
previously forecasted. Cloud cover should continue to erode today
leading to mostly sunny skies by the afternoon. This will allow 
temperatures to warm up to temperatures similar to what we saw 
yesterday, and maybe even a few degrees warmer in SW Virginia. 

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)... 
At the beginning of this period, the U.S. is in an almost zonal flow 
with only a subtle couple of waves embedded in this fast flow.  At 
the surface, the ridge is now east of us and a return flow has just 
begun.  Also a cold front is located from a Low over Lake Superior, 
southwest across OK, and continuing into SW TX.  This front will be 
moving quickly eastward, and should push through the area Wednesday 
night.  There will be very little instability as the front moves 
through, so will only go with "showers" for the precip associated 
with the front for Wednesday afternoon and Wednesday night.

High pressure will settle into the area Thursday, the next return 
flow on Friday, and the next cold front on Saturday.  This front is 
followed by stronger high pressure that takes a couple of days to 
settle into the area.  Similarly, as with the system for Wednesday 
night, the precip with this front will be mostly stable, so just 
going with showers. Also, looking at the timing of the cold air and 
precip, it looks like the moisture will be exiting the area pretty 
quickly, so only including flurries in and near the mountains for 
late Saturday night, then just dry on Sunday and into Monday.

MVFR cigs have persisted at TYS and TRI due to low level moisture
trapped below an inversion and against the mountains to the east.
Overnight, these conditions are expected to continue as the flow

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...Fairly quiet short term 
ahead. To begin the period, upper trough off to our northeast and 
northwest flow still in place. Some clouds will remain across 
extreme NETN and up across SWVA tonight due to pooled up low-level 
moisture but most other areas should see clearer skies. Because of 
the clearing skies and colder air behind the front, lows tonight 
will range from the low to upper 30s which is around 5 degrees below 
normal. Also, there could be a few areas of patchy fog develop 
overnight as well as patchy freezing fog in areas that dip down to 
freezing. Northwest flow continues tomorrow but with much more 
sunshine across the area. Highs will be a few degrees warmer with
values ranging from the lower to upper 50s.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...Models in decent 
agreement early on but timing differences start worsening by the 
weekend. Forecast confidence is about average for this time of 
year. A weakening and moisture starved cold front will approach by
late Wed and will move through and out of the area Wed night. 
Will carry low PoPs for some showers with this system. A more 
significant front will push through over the weekend, but models 
differ in timing as well as the extent of the cold air behind the 
front, with the GFS stronger/faster than ECMWF and the Canadian a 
compromise but closer to the GFS. Given the uncertainty of timing,
will carry PoPs Fri night into Sat night with the highest PoPs on
Saturday. Colder air will push in for Sunday and Monday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Some light reflectivities are moving across NE Tennessee and
SW Virginia overnight associated with the trough moving across our
north. Precipitation will be pretty light with these showers, and
most of the rain should be out of the forecast area shortly after
sunrise. Northerly flow behind the front moving through will
funnel in colder air behind it... But with the dry air after this
front the skies should be able to clear out today and allow for
the sun to shine. This should help offset the colder air moving 
in and result in temperatures pretty similar to what we saw 
yesterday under overcast conditions. However the clear skies and 
colder air will allow temperatures overnight tonight to drop about
10 degrees colder than this morning with many places expected to 
see lows in the 30's.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...
Predominate zonal flow aloft through Friday before a digging trough 
moves across the area over the weekend. 

On Tuesday, a shortwave trough pushes across the northern third of 
the area bringing only a slight increase in cloudiness over that 
area for the early part of the day. As that shortwave shifts east by 
Tuesday night, weak ridging persists through Wednesday before 
flattening out as next shortwave pushes east across the Great Lakes 
late Wednesday and Wednesday night. With it, expect chance POPs over 
the northern half of the area, mainly during the overnight hours.

To this point in the forecast, confidence is good with model 
agreement on timing associated with this first boundary on Wednesday 
night. Unfortunately, confidence decreases from this point forward 
as models diverge greatly with the next system for the early part of 
the weekend.

GFS being most progressive, pushes the front through by Saturday 
afternoon while the ECMWF is slowest with frontal boundary not 
moving through until Saturday evening. Without a strong consensus, 
have opted to maintain chance POPs through Saturday at this time. 
However, regardless of frontal timing, expect a strong low-level jet 
out ahead of the front to create windy conditions across much of the 
area on Saturday, with higher elevations being especially 
susceptible Saturday afternoon. Although tstms are possible with 
this front, uncertainty of timing and resulting available 
instability remain convincing enough to carry only showers in the 
fcst for Saturday.

Temperatures should remain near climatological norms through 
Saturday before seeing a significant cool down on Sunday as the 
upper level trough shifts east and the cold, dry air funnels SE into 
the area bringing daytime high temperatures about 10 degrees below 
normal by the end of the period.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate a 
shortwave trough across the Western Great Lakes moving into the Ohio 
River Valley. At the surface, a cold front stretches from Southern 
Indiana back to the southwest into Eastern Texas. The area of low 
level isentropic ascent is now to the south and east of the area 
with scattered showers across Georgia and South Carolina. Therefore, 
have decreased PoPs down in the near-term forecast. 

PW values will increase ahead of the cold front into the 0.8-0.9 
inch range later tonight, which are around the 75th percentile for 
mid-November. Model soundings indicate that the saturated layer is 
shallow from around 950-750 mb at best. Due to this, expect any 
precipitation that does occur will be light with only a few 
hundredths of an inch at most. The deepest saturation will be across 
SW Virginia and NE Tennesse and this is where the highest PoPs are 
featured. With this low level saturation, there could also be 
some patchy fog late tonight into early Monday morning. Overnight 
lows will range from the upper 30s to mid 40s. 

Much drier air will push in behind the boundary on Monday with PW 
values down into the 0.2-0.3 inch range, which are around the 10th 
percentile for mid-November. Despite the mostly sunny skies, 
northerly winds will advect in cooler air and high temperatures will 
generally be in the 50s for most valley locations.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Saturday)...

A zonal flow pattern with surface ridging into the southern 
Appalachians for Monday night through mid-week. Only caveat will 
be a weak frontal boundary with little upper forcing moving south 
into the region for Wednesday night. This boundary will producing 
a chance of showers for mid- week.

A very strong upper level storm system will be moving into the 
Pacific Northwest for mid-week. The associated strong upper level 
jet will move out into the Plain States by Thursday. Strong surface 
cyclo-genesis will develop over the Plain States for Friday. There 
are significant timing differences with this system as the GFS is 
faster/a little weaker, while the ECMWF is slower and stronger 
with the associated cyclo-genesis. 

As the cyclogenesis strengthens for the latter half of the week, the 
developing low level jet will increase the isentropic lift across 
the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys by Thursday night and Friday. Strong 
southerly boundary layer jet will pull moist and unstable air 
northward into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. 

As the frontal boundary moves across the area either late Friday 
night or Saturday, widespread showers are anticipated with elevated 
thunderstorms possible..per model soundings. Due to the uncertainty 
of how much instability and timing of frontal passage, will only 
include showers, but need to monitor the potential of storms.

Beside the convection, the strong low-level jet will likely produce 
windy conditions, especially across the higher elevations as the 
storm nears.

Front moves east of the area Saturday with drier and cooler weather 
returning.

Some weak isentropic lift is occurring to our south and east, and
we are seeing mid to low level clouds over our area from it.
Radars are not showing any reflectivities, but it's possible a few
places get spit on for a brief bit of time overnight into early
tomorrow morning, so will keep low end precipitation chances in
the forecast. Upper level trough will move north of the area
tonight into Monday morning bringing another chance for some light
precipitation. Most of the deeper moisture stays to our north, but
enough exists in out area to keep decent precipitation chances in
the forecast with the highest chances being north of Interstate
40. Current runs of high resolution models are hinting that the
widespread rain chances begin to evaporate as they hit the
Cumberland Plateau later tonight, leaving most people in the CWA
pretty dry with overcast conditions. Behind this system we begin
to dry out and precipitation chances/cloud coverage decreases from
west to east on Monday.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Saturday)... 
High pressure will return Monday night through Tuesday night with 
mostly clear conditions. Beginning Wednesday and continuing through 
Thursday a short wave and cold front moves across the Tennessee 
Valley. Best chance of showers will come Wednesday night and 
continue through Thursday. After the front moves through Thursday 
there will be a brief dry period Thursday night. Friday the front 
moves back through as a warm front and a much stronger system 
develops over the northern Plains and moves into the Great Lakes. 
This system will increase showers again Friday night into Saturday. 
The ECMWF is slower than the GFS which keeps rain chances through 
the day Saturday. Lows will be in the 30s Tuesday and Wednesday 
morning but warm into the 40s the rest of the extended with cloudy 
skies. Highs will be near normal Tuesday through Thursday in the mid 
50s to lower 60s...then slightly warmer Friday but cool back down to 
the 50s on Saturday behind stronger cold front.

.DISCUSSION...
The northward progression of low level clouds has been a little
faster than reflected in the forecast, so some updates will be
needed. The shallow nature of the moisture, as shown by the 00Z
FFC sounding, should mean very little if any chance of 
measureable precip overnight. The 00Z NAM is showing a more 
eastward trend to its precip, keeping it mainly in NC overnight, 
and it may still be overdone with its QPF. Will keep a slight
chance PoP just in SW NC tonight, removing it from the southern
Valley. The advance of cloud cover and the latest MOS guidance
suggest warmer temperatures than forecast, so lows will be bumped
up slightly.

MVFR cigs are spreading northward from GA into SE TN, and will
reach CHA in the next few hours, followed by TYS and TRI later
tonight. Moisture will be confined to the low levels, but there
may be just enough to produce some drizzle. The MVFR cigs are
expected to linger through tomorrow. A brief period of IFR cigs
could happen at any of the TAF sites, but confidence that they
will be predominant is low.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

A rather quiet pattern across the entire CONUS with mostly zonal 
flow aloft with a couple of low amplitude shortwave troughs to the 
north and west. At the surface, high pressure is currently located 
across the Northeastern U.S. Closer to home, skies are mostly to 
partly sunny this afternoon with a few passing high clouds. 

For this evening and overnight, the surface high will continue to 
shift further to the east with low level southeasterly flow slowly 
returning to the region. An area of low level isentropic ascent will 
lift northward across the area tonight with increasing cloud cover. 
Can already see this area of lift and cloud cover showing up on 
visible satellite imagery with widespread cloud cover across South 
and Central Georgia. This area of cloud cover is building to the 
north and will see overcast skies moving into the southern tier of 
counties near to shortly after sunset. With this increased cloud 
cover, expect overnight lows will be warmer than the last couple of 
nights with lows ranging from the low 30s across SW Virginia and NE 
Tennessee to low 40s across the Southern Valley. Light showers and 
sprinkles will be possible as the area of isentropic ascent lifts 
northward across the area. The NAM is the most aggressive with 
precipitation but it does appear most models have increased the 
amount of moisture slightly. Due to this, increased PoPs overnight 
tonight into Sunday morning with best chances across SW North 
Carolina and SE Tennessee. With widespread cloud cover and light 
precipitation throughout the first half off the day, went with 
cooler daytime temperatures with highs in the mid 40s to low 50s. 

The area of isentropic lift will push off to the east later in the 
day on Sunday as an upper level trough and weak cold front approach 
from the northwest. PW values will max out ahead of this boundary 
around 0.6-0.8 inches, these values are slightly above normal for 
mid-November. Model soundings during this time period feature rather 
shallow saturation from around 950-750 mb with the deepest moisture 
to the north. For now, have gone with 20-50 PoP for Sunday night 
into Monday morning with best chances north of Interstate 40. With 
the widespread cloud cover and scattered precipitation went with 
warmer lows with temperatures generally in the 40s Sunday night. 
Northerly winds behind the frontal boundary on Monday will advect in 
drier air into the region. Precipitation chances will come to an end 
with mostly sunny skies by the afternoon. High temperatures will 
range from the low 50s to the low 60s. Any precipitation during the 
short-term period will be light and do not anticipate any more than 
a few hundredths at the most.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Friday)... 

The upper flow pattern will be dominated by fast zonal flow, 
except for the latter half of the week into Saturday.

For Monday night through Tuesday...surface ridging and zonal flow 
will produce dry conditions and generally slightly above normal 
temperatures.

For Wednesday and Wednesday night...fast moving jet/short-wave 
across the Ohio Valley will enhance the isentropic lift across the 
region with chance/likely rain showers. For Thursday...associated 
frontal boundary will becoming near stationary across the Tennessee 
valley with a low chance of showers.

For Thursday night through Friday night...a stronger upper jet will 
move into the Plain states to the Great Lakes/Ohio and northern 
Tennessee valleys. This stronger system will pull a frontal boundary 
through the area for late Friday and Friday night. Likely chances of 
showers are expected. At this time, instability is lacking so will 
keep thunder out of the forecast. Dry and cooler conditions return 
for Saturday.

Surface high pressure across the Northeastern U.S with zonal flow
aloft across the forecast area. The surface high will shift
further to the east today with winds taking on more a of a
southeasterly direction. Isentropic ascent associated with this
weak return flow will increase cloud cover later this evening and

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Surface high pressure centered 
to our north will slide east, and an upper trough will be moving 
into the mississippi valley by the end of the short term period. 
Will see some mainly high clouds around today.  Moisture will be 
increasing tonight as southerly flow brings some shallow moisture 
and weak isentropic lift develops. NAM much more aggressive than the 
GFS/ECMWF with possible very light rain/drizzle and may be overdone, 
so will go with more of a compromise and bring slight chance PoPs 
into southern areas and mention possibility of patchy drizzle into 
central areas by the end of the night.  MAV temps look reasonable 
overall so will not stray far.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...There will be two features of 
interest Sunday into Sunday night.  First will be a weak area of 
isentropic lift moving northward into southeastern TN/southwestern 
NC and then the approach of a weakening frontal boundary coming in 
from the northwest.  With both of these features...moisture is 
limited and energy minimal.  Overall...expect isolated to scattered 
showers to develop and move across the MRX CWA but precip amount 
should remain light.  A few showers should linger into Monday but 
this activity will slowly exit during the day.  High pressure builds 
in behind the front and expect dry and warmer conditions for 
Tuesday.  Models begin to show some differences by the end of the 
extended.  Overall...models indicate another frontal boundary moving 
in Wednesday into Thursday.  The GFS is quick to move the front 
through and brings the next system in around Friday while the ECMWF 
stalls the front to our south then lifts it north back into our area 
for Friday.  So...while confidence is quite low on details... 
isolated to scattered showers should be possible Wednesday...Thursday 
and Friday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...
A sunny day today with clear skies and temperatures in the mid 40s
to upper 50s. Cold high pressure at the surface was centered over
the Great Lakes with almost zonal flow across the country. This 
will keep the eastern Tennessee Valley Cool and dry through 
Sunday. The biggest effect from this system is cold temperatures 
tonight across the forecast area with lows in the 20s for the 
northeast half of the region. The coldest night there so far this 
season. The warmest area will be the southwest third of the region
where temperatures will be closer to freezing or just above. 
Saturday will be similar today with abundant sunshine and highs 
mostly in the 50s. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Thursday)...
Low level isentropic lift will increase from the southeast to 
northeast late Saturday night into Sunday morning. Model soundings
indicate a shallow saturated layer from around 950 mb to 800 mb. 
For most locations, just forecasting overcast cloud cover but 
there could be a few light showers/sprinkles in portions of SW 
North Carolina and SE Tennessee. Warm air advection will keep all 
of this precipitation in the liquid form with overnight lows 
generally in the 30s. 

The area of isentropic lift will weaken and push off to the 
northeast during the day Sunday but expect mostly cloud skies will 
persist. A weak cold front in association with an upper level trough 
will approach the area late in the day on Sunday. Moisture will 
remain limited with PW values peaking around 0.6-0.8 inches, which 
are slightly above normal for mid-November. Model soundings are once 
again not overly impressive with a shallow moist layer. Have 
continued with 20-30 PoPs across the area late Sunday into early 
Monday with best chances across NE Tennessee and SW Virginia. 
Precipitation amounts will be light and should be just a couple of 
hundredths. 

Monday and Tuesday will be dry with the upper level trough departing 
to the east and higher pressure building in across the region aloft 
and at the surface. Forecast highs will be near to slightly below 
average for this time of the year with highs in the mid 50 to low 
60s and lows in the mid 30s to low 40s. 

The global models begin to diverge moving into the middle part of 
next week. The GFS indicates a progressive pattern with the next 
frontal passage late Wednesday into early Thursday. The ECMWF has a 
weaker upper level trough associated with this cold front and stalls 
the boundary to the north. Regardless of model solution, 
precipitation chances will increase during the middle and later 
parts of next week. In addition, any instability with both of these 
solutions will stay well to the south and not forecasting any 
thunderstorms at this point.

winds of 10 to 15 mph will bring in more cold air and hold high
temperatures down a few more degrees. Adjusted highs down a few 
degrees most locations. As winds become light tonight lows will

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Surface high pressure centered

our area for the period.  Drier/cooler air will continue to filter 
into our area today. After any patches of early morning fog/low 
clouds dissipate, should see plenty of sunshine today followed by a 
mostly clear night tonight with just some high clouds around.  Will 
only make minor tweaks to MAV temps.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...We will be in a quiet 
weather pattern on Saturday with surface high pressure pulling 
away from the region and zonal flow aloft. Southerly flow over the
area on Sunday will allow low level moisture to increase slightly
and weak lift to develop over areas to our south. Could see a few
pockets of showers move into far southeastern locations as a 
result. A short wave trough is then progged to approach the area 
from the northwest Sunday night into early Monday. Moistures is 
limited and lift is weak but should be sufficient to allow 
isolated to scattered showers to move in...the best chance will be
over northern areas. We will then be between systems from Monday 
afternoon through Tuesday night. Model confidence is lower by the 
end of the period but models continue to trend towards bringing a 
weakening cold front across the area around the Wednesday/Thursday
time frame.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
Mostly cloudy skies this morning have finally scattered out across
the northwest half of the forecast area at mid afternoon and will
continue to be eroded the rest of this afternoon into early
evening. Weak low pressure over NW North Carolina will shift
farther east and drier air mass filters in. A dry cold front over
the Ohio Valley this afternoon will pass through overnight. Skies
should become mostly clear. Lows tonight will be mostly in the 30s
but with widespread frost. On Friday with some cold air advection
from surface high pressure system moving in from the western Great
Lakes highs will be mostly 40s to mid 50s even with full sunshine.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Wednesday)...
Friday night will have the coldest temps so far this season in 
many spots, with northern portions of the area dropping into the 
20s. We will have a nearly zonal flow across our area Saturday as 
an E-W elongated midlevel ridge will be near the Gulf Coast. That
ridge will move off the NC/SC coast on Sunday, and the resulting 
southerly flow will bring higher 850 mb theta-e air into GA and 
the Appalachians on Sunday/Sunday night. Latest model trend has 
been to keep precip with isentropic lift to our S and E, but will 
include a slight chance PoP for SW NC. Meanwhile, a shortwave 
trough approaches from the northwest, and grazes our northern half
Sunday night. Moisture appears limited but weak QG forcing near 
the jet streak could bring light rain, so will keep a chance PoP 
north for Sunday night.

A ridge will build over the area on Monday, and a NW flow will keep 
a dry forecast going into Tuesday. A fast-moving trough and cold 
front are shown by the GFS and ECMWF to bring a chance of rain on 
Wednesday, and stall just to our south before returning northward 
again on Thursday. Low to slight chance PoPs appear warranted 
during this period.

.DISCUSSION...
Early this morning a weak surface trough was located over the
eastern and northeast parts of the forecast area. Patchy light 
rain...drizzle and fog has continued across the eastern parts of 
the area this morning with reduced visibilities and low clouds. As
this trough finally shifts east and higher pressure builds in from
the west the clouds will finally start to break from west to east
through mid afternoon. Temperatures have been nearly steady in the
mid 40s to lower 50s but should warm at least 5 degrees as skies
clear. It will still feel cool with north to northwest winds
blowing at around 10 miles per hour. After sunset temperatures
will drop quickly.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Any remaining pockets of light
rain will exit the area this morning from west to east. A few
areas of light rain may linger over the eastern mountain into the
early afternoon but by mid day...expect dry conditions with
clearing skies. Also...some sunshine this afternoon will help
moderate the cool air mass that has settle over the area and highs
today should climb a few degrees warmer that Wendesday.
However...with the clearing skies and good radiational
cooling...expect lows tonight to drop into the 30s across many
locations.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...Extended period starts out 
dry with weak upper level ridging building into the area for Friday 
and Saturday. Model solutions for Sunday continue to bounce back and 
forth with regards to an approaching mid latitude cyclone. Tonight's 
00Z model runs have backed off a lot on precipitation and indicate a 
much drier frontal passage on Sunday night/Monday, but with this 
system still a few days out and considerable model uncertainty, have 
maintained chance PoPs for the Sunday-Monday timeframe. Drier air 
builds back into the area behind the system for Tuesday. Another 
system will approach the area for midweek, but with models still out 
of sync, have capped PoPs in the lower end of the chance category 
for Wednesday. Highs will generally be in the 50s throughout the 
extended forecast period with lows in the upper 30s to lower 40s. 
The exception will be on Friday and Friday night when clear skies 
and cooler, drier air overhead will cap daytime temps in the upper 
40s to lower 50s and overnight lows will drop into the mid 20s 
across the north and near to slightly below freezing elsewhere.

Only a few minor tweaks to the forecast grids for this evening
update. Went ahead and added mention of patchy fog to parts of
forecast area as some observations sites are starting to report
lower visibilities already tonight. Light showers still present
near the TN/GA border so will keep mention of precip in the
forecast and quickly bring it to an end by early tomorrow morning.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Friday night)... 
The low level moisture trapped in the Valley today has been 
confined to 850 mb and below. This evening, the vort max over 
north Texas will track east, and will bring a more southerly wind 
component in the 850-700 mb layer. The result will be increasing 
isentropic lift in that layer that will bring precip to our 
southern half overnight. The forecast will have categorical PoPs 
along the southern-most tier of counties with decreasing chances 
to the north. QPF amounts should be pretty light, from a tenth to 
a quarter inch, due to relatively weak forcing. 

The trough passage on Thursday morning will bring drier air through 
the column, with clearing skies through the day. cold advection 
remains fairly weak, and will full sun in the afternoon, highs will 
reach to between 55 and 60 in most spots. A stronger surge of cold 
air arrives Friday as Canadian high pressure drops SE into the Great 
Lakes region. This will bring highs on Friday down to the upper 40s 
to upper 50s, and lows Friday night in the mid 20s to mid 30s.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Tuesday)... 
Extended period starts out dry with some pleasant ridging and dry
air in place on Saturday. More rain is in store on Sunday with 
the arrival of another mid latitude cyclone. Because we're still a
few days away from this event system timing is somewhat 
uncertain, but at this time it appears precipitation will be 
developing later in the day with the main period of rainfall 
occurring Sunday night. Kept some small and slight chance pops for
system departure on Monday. Dry advection and short wave ridging 
may allow for a return to some sunshine on Tuesday. The ecmwf and 
gfs are a bit out of sync on the final day of the extended 
forecast, but the blended concept follows the wetter look of the 
gfs which brings another upper trough and associated cold front 
into the Southern Appalachian region. With this feature in mind, 
added some chance pops for showers in the new day seven forecast. 
High temperatures will be several degrees below normal to start 
the period but some moderation will be seen next week. Lows will 
be near normal throughout.

.AVIATION...Milder, moist west to southwest flow will continue to
override a cooler resident airmass trapped in the Great Valley on
down valley surface flow. So, the mvfr category weather will
likely deteriorate tonight into Thursday morning to an ifr or 
even lifr situation, mainly due to ceiling with perhaps a lesser
impact due to visibility in light rain and fog. The rain would be
produced by the arrival of another upper trough. The trough will
gradually slip east across the Appalachian rise later in the day
Thursday allowing for improvement in flight condition to mvfr
category.

.DISCUSSION...
Radar shows that light rain and drizzle has exited our area to 
the east. However, 12Z soundings around the region show a very
moist air mass, and a surface analysis shows an inverted trough
across the Appalachians. Thus, some light precip may still be
possible across the area through the day, so the low/slight chance
PoPs this afternoon will be maintained. Precip chances rise this
evening as the vort mas over N TX tracks east and increases the
southerly 850 mb flow, mainly over our southern sections. The
latest guidance maintains overcast cloud cover today, and current
obs and satellite show no reason to discount this. The update will
lower max temps by a few degrees, into the upper 40s/mid 50s.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A weak disturbance moving across
the Southern Appalachian Region this morning is generating a few
light showers across the area. Coverage is rather isolated and
amounts generally less than a 10th of an inch an hour. This
activity will lessen throughout the day but may continue to see a
few light showers linger over eastern areas through much of the
afternoon. Also...cooler air continues to move in behind Tuesday's
cold front and highs will only reach into the 50s across most
valley locations. Late today and into the overnight hours...the 
frontal boundary that is to our south will slowly lift north a 
bit. This will allow associated showers to move back into the 
area...generally south near CHA and along the eastern mountains. 

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)... A shortwave moving south 
of the forecast area on Thursday will bring a slight chance for 
showers across the TN/GA border and Southern Appalachians. Drier and 
cooler air moves in for the beginning of the weekend under north - 
northwest flow. Friday looks to be the coldest day this week with 
highs staying in the 40s across the north and the mid 50s across the 
south. Weak ridging will build into the region for Saturday and 
Sunday, resulting in a very slight warmup before a quick moving 
frontal passage moves through later Sunday/Monday. ECMWF continues 
to bring in more Gulf moisture ahead of the front, while the GFS 
continues to mainly keep precipitation along the frontal boundary. 
For now, have maintained chance PoPs Sunday into Monday. We should 
be able to narrow the precipitation window as the weekend nears. 
This system moves will off to our east by Monday night, bringing a 
return of drier air under northwest flow.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...A moist and cool pattern 
fills in behind a cold front later tonight into Wednesday as 
another short wave rotates southeast out of the Midwest in a 
seemingly never ending series of waves transiting the Eastern U.S.
A saturated low level airmass remains in place through the short 
term and there could be a couple sprinkles later tonight into 
Wednesday morning as the upper trough moves over the Southern 
Appalachian region. There will be another rather small diurnal 
range in temperatures with lows tonight in the mid 40s to lower 
50s and highs warming only to the 50s over most of the forecast 
area.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...Shortwave will be 
zipping across south of the area on Wednesday night/Thursday. Most
of the moisture and lift will remain to our south, but locations 
along the TN/GA border and the Southern Appalachian mountains 
could see precipitation on the fringes of this system. We will dry
out after is passes through and are set up with northerly winds 
bringing in drier and cooler air. Friday will be one of the colder
days of this forecast before we begin a very slight warm up this 
weekend with a weak ridge building in from the west ahead of our 
next system.

Long range models are in decent agreement that there will be a quick 
moving front pass through sometime Sunday afternoon into early 
Monday. GFS wants to keep precipitation along the front, while the 
ECMWF wants to bring in southerly winds and Gulf moisture ahead of 
the front leading to a longer period of precipitation. Will keep low 
end precipitation chances for a couple of days around this frontal 
passage, but as we get closer we will likely be able to trim down 
the PoP chances. Models agree that by Monday night the system should 
be off to our east and temperatures will rebound back into the upper 
50's/60's by the middle of next week.

.AVIATION...Most of the precipitation associated with the frontal
wave has moved out of the Great Valley this afternoon. There are a
couple showers occurring on the Cumberland Plateau but would
expect a fair amount of this action to dissipate coming off the 
higher terrain. The downslope flow behind the cold front is
allowing for a break in the lower overcast at the terminals. This
vfr break may last for several more hours in terms of any ceilings
forming around three thousand feet or lower. The deterioration
into mvfr category ceilings would have a better chance of
developing around 00-03z as the low level flow becomes more
northerly. Placed some mvfr ceilings and visibility reduction in
fog with a vicinity shower around 08-14z as weak lift forms with 
the approach of another short wave trough.

.DISCUSSION...Rain shield continues to shift steadily south and
east across the forecast area this morning. The heaviest rain is
occurring in updrafts along the surface frontal boundary moving
through Southeast Tennessee. Mesoscale models don't show much 
precipitation developing behind this area so used a tighter 
gradient in pop for the afternoon period and reduced tonight's 
probability of precipitation into the chance realm awaiting lift 
from the trailing Upper Midwest short wave later tonight into 
Wednesday. There will not be much rise in temperatures today and 
readings could drop or hold steady in the cold air advection on 
the north side of the boundary.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Will be in a rather active
weather pattern through the short term. This morning...will see a
few showers linger over the area as the initial round of
convection exits the region. Then...an additional band of showers
and possibly a few thunderstorms will develop this afternoon and
evening as a weakening cold front pushes through. Upper support is
weak and instability limited with the best chance of thunder over
southern locations. Then...late tonight expect another round of
showers to move through as a short wave tracks quickly through the
zonal flow. As for temperatures...will continue to see above
normal reading today with highs expected to climb into the 60s and
low 70s across much of the area.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Sunday)...Tuesday's system will 
continue to move east on Wednesday with rain chances confined to 
eastern forecast zones Wednesday morning and only the chance for 
some light lingering showers across the mountains by the 
afternoon. Weak shortwave will cycle through the area during the 
second half of the week. Model solutions differ with the GFS/NAM 
keeping our area dry and the ECMWF bringing moisture and rain 
chances into at least the southern half of the forecast area on 
Thursday. Friday and Saturday will be dry and cool. A cold front 
approaches the area for Sunday/Monday, bringing another period of 
rain. It should be warm enough by the time precip moves in for it 
to fall as all rain, but a few flurries mixing in during the 
overnight hours can't be ruled out at the highest elevations. 
Temperatures throughout the extended forecast period will feature 
highs in the 50s and lows in the 30s to lower 40s.

from the west as a weak wave moves along the nearly stationary
front across the region. Appears there will be enough instability
to mention thunder overnight, so will add slight chance thunder 
all areas. Will also extend likely PoPs all the way to our eastern

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...Seasonal fast flow in place 
across the nation today and another impulse will be ripping east 
into the Southern Appalachian region tonight. A fair amount of 
moisture remains across the Ohio and Tennessee valley region and the 
frontal wave will lift a broad pattern of showers across the 
forecast area later tonight through Tuesday. There will be just 
enough instability available to the system for the mention of a 
slight chance of convection. Temperatures will remain well above 
normal for early November with lows dropping only to the middle and 
upper 50s north to the lower and middle 60s south tonight. Despite 
clouds and rain in the area on Tuesday, highs should warm to the 
middle and upper 60s north to the lower 70s across the southern 
reaches of the viewing area. Chilly air will be filling in behind 
the system cold front Tuesday night.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Sunday)...Our first system of 
this forecast will still be exiting the region come Tuesday 
evening. Some lingering showers could get held up on the mountains
and there could be enough moisture over us to squeeze out some 
light precipitation on Wednesday. But overall the heaviest of the 
precipitation will come to an end by Tuesday night/Wednesday 
morning. Behind this system a weak shortwave will begin to move 
through during the second half of the week, but moisture will be 
so limited over us that we most likely won't see any precipitation
from it. Dry and cool conditions are expected for several days 
the end of this week and into the weekend. Slight ridging begins 
to build in ahead of the weekend with temperatures slowly 
beginning to warm up but will still remain well below normal. A 
quick moving line of showers will move through towards the end of 
the weekend, but temperatures will remain warm enough that 
precipitation should remain all liquid. After this quick moving 
system a dry atmosphere is set up and ridging will allow for 
another slow build of temperatures across the region.

.AVIATION...Some mvfr ceilings hanging around the Great Valley
this afternoon, but with the loss of the higher alto cu deck 
associated with the morning short wave impulse, there are some 
breaks in the overcast. This may allow for a little higher ceiling
which would bring some vfr conditions back to cha and tys. Stayed
with a ceiling in the mvfr category at tri where some fog is 
still in place. Flight conditions may gradually descend later 
tonight as the low levels become saturated again. However, the 
main action will come in the form of additional showers as the 
next frontal wave emerges through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys. 
Flight weather will deteriorate to mvfr and possibly ifr 
conditions with the possibility of a clap or thunder around cha 
and tys after daybreak.

.DISCUSSION...Scattered showers are still making progress east
across the Great Valley. The precipitation is largely east of
interstates 81 and 75 and appears to be associated with weak vort
axis pressing toward the spine of the Appalachians. The overnight
forecast release was quite good and has captured the current
perspective across the forecast area well. Went ahead and lowered
pops across the western half of the Great Valley in the area of
downward motion behind the upper level feature. More rain will be
on the way, tonight as the next frontal wave builds east across
the Mid South. Will leave temperature forecast in place. Not a lot
of room between current readings and maximums this afternoon.
There should be quite a bit of cloud cover through the afternoon
hours so diurnal warming may be limited.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...A fairly active next 36-48
hours with a series of jets/short-waves moving across the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys focusing lift along/near a frontal
boundary. Front is currently moving into northern middle Tennessee
with a band of showers and isolated thunder. This activity will
move into the region early this morning with the greatest coverage
of convection between 12-16Z. The forcing associated with the
first jet and divergence aloft will move east of the southern
Appalachians by noon. 

Plenty of low-clouds will remain across the Tennessee
Valley/southern Appalachians this afternoon and overnight with
boundary layer becoming saturated for fog development tonight.

Another jet streak will move the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys late
tonight enhancing fronto-genetic lift across the boundary. Models
show enough instability (mostly elevated) to produce a chance of
thunderstorms with widespread showers. PWs increase to the 90
percentile or higher overnight with some training possible along
the frontal boundary to produce locally heavy rainfall. Will
include this potential within the HWO.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...
At the beginning of this period we will still be in a zonal flow 
aloft, while at the surface we will likely have a stalled front in 
our area, generally oriented west to east. During the day a weak 
surface low pressure center is expected to track along the front to 
the northeast and will be close to or in our area.  At first glance 
pattern recognition might suggest some severe weather threat with 
this setup, however, it looks like instability will be very limited 
(<500J/kg) , so unless something changes, it looks like mostly 
showers, with just a few embedded storms with only moderate outflow 
winds. For Thunder chances will forecast a NW to SE gradient--will 
not include thunder for on the northern Plateau and parts of SW VA, 
will have a slight chance of thunder for the central plateau to near 
Abingdon, VA, and a chance of thunder generally along and SE a 
Chattanooga to Knoxville to Bristol line. For heavy rain chances, 
the precipitable water values will still be high, but storms will be 
zipping eastward very quickly.  The only chances for problems with 
flooding would be where training occurs.  Short-range convective 
models suggest some broad clusters that show a hint of training 
Tuesday morning, but these move quickly out of the area by Tuesday 
afternoon. So, two things to watch for that would elevate a threat 
for Tuesday--#1 a little more instability (500-1000 J/kg CAPE) that 
could tap the existing shear to produce more organized convection, 
and #2 more defined and organized W-E band of training cells that 
could offer significant rains Tuesday morning. Neither of these is 
being forecast right now.

Tuesday evening the bulk of the precip should exit the area to the 
east, however, chances for light precip will linger as the front and 
moisture linger in the area waiting on an upper level clipper that 
moves into the area around Wednesday night or Thursday. Then by 
Friday things dry out. Finally, around Sunday another clipper along 
with a cold front will sweep through, likely with a line of showers 
that sweeps through as well. Timing is still iffy, so there are POPs 
from Sat night through Sun night. 

The precip on Wed and Thu will be in a cool airmass, but right now 
it looks like even the mountains will not be cold enough for wintery 
precip.

Indiana to northwest Arkansas. Clouds were gradually thickening
across the forecast area with temperatures slowly dropping into
the mid to upper 60s a mild night for early November. Strong and 
a few severe thunderstorms continue along the Ohio River and were 
moving southeast ahead of the front. Adjusted timing of showers 
and a few storms entering the forecast area and hourly 
temperatures and dew points but overall forecast unchanged. Expect
showers to overspread the entire forecast area by morning with 
the front about to enter east Tennessee by sunrise Monday.
Instability was decreasing and should continue with night time
cooling so only a few thunderstorms possible late tonight.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

A cold front currently stretches from near Chicago to the south to
near St. Louis and further to the southwest to near Oklahoma City.
Upper level flow is mostly zonal but there a is a shortwave trough
currently moving across the Central Plains with a strong 100-120
kt 300mb jet associated with this trough. Due to this, strong to
severe storms are forecast today across the Ohio River and Mid-
Mississippi River Valley. Closer to home, temperatures and
dewpoints are elevated for early November with southwesterly flow
in the low levels continuing the supply of warm/moist advection
ahead of the approaching cold front. With this trough passing well
to the north, not forecasting any precipitation this afternoon or
evening. The cold front will advance to the southeast throughout
the short-term forecast period. The front will take on more of a
southwest to northeast orientation as the trough to the north
advances quicker with the support of the upper levels. A weakening
line of showers and storms will move into the Plateau after
midnight. Instabilty across the forecast area will be limited with
the more aggressive models only indicating values of SBCAPE around
250-500 J/Kg. Due to this, did mention thunderstorms in the
forecast but do not expect any strong or severe storms. The cold
front will continue to advance across the forecast area on Monday.
PW values will increase into the 1.3-1.6 inch range ahead of the
front, which are near the maximum values observed for early
November. Due to this, increase PoPs for late tonight into Monday
into the 60-90 percent range. Temperatures overnight will be mild
again with lows in the upper 50 to mid 60s and went closer to the
raw model guidance. The front will sweep across the forecast area
tomorrow and could see precip. chances decrease from the northwest
to southeast late tomorrow with highs in the upper 60s to mid 70s
for most locations.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Saturday)...
Near zonal flow aloft at the start of the forecast period. At the
surface a frontal boundary will stall and perhaps lift north of 
the forecast area. As it weakens early Monday night...shower 
activity will wane before midnight and pick back up a few hours 
after midnight, especially over the southern Tennessee Valley. In 
fact, showers and thunderstorms will become more frequent by early
morning. 

The front will slowly ooze southward on Tuesday with showers and 
thunderstorms likely through much of the day. With the front south 
of the forecast area Tuesday night it appears that most locations 
with the exception of the mountains will be mostly dry or have 
mainly light rain. Light rain chances persist into Wednesday. The 
total QPF for this system from Monday through Wednesday looks like 
it will range anywhere from near one inch to one and three quarter 
inches. 

Wednesday night the surface front is south of the area however the 
850 front will still be over the southern portions of the CWA. An 
approaching shortwave trough combined with moisture advection along 
the boundary will bring more showers across the region early 
Wednesday night. Rain chances come to an end by Thursday afternoon 
in the wake of the shortwave trough. Dry conditions persist through 
Saturday before another clipper system dives southward out of 
Minnesota. More rain showers will be possible Sunday afternoon and 
Sunday night.

continuing to supply warm and moist air to the region. In the
upper levels, seeing mostly zonal flow aloft. There is an area of
weak isentropic lift that is producing a few showers across NE
Tennessee and SW Virginia. Due to this, increased PoPs in the

.AVIATION...This morning scattered showers will be close to TRI and

southwest flow aloft. Scattered showers anticipated, but can not 
rule out some thunder.

Another concern is potential of IFR/MVR fog development, especially 
at TYS where dewpoint depressions are least with some breaks in the 
cloud cover. Otherwise, after 13-14Z VFR conditions are expected as 
upper ridge suppresses convection development today through this 
evening.  Winds will be southwesterly between 8 and 12kts and 
gusty at TYS during the afternoon.

For tonight, frontal band will approach the area early Monday

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...High resolution models suggest
scattered convection developing across the Plateau into southwest
Virginia this morning. Satellite does show some clouds developing
there which is due to isentropic lift. Included low chance PoP
there for this potential.

Besides the showers, patchy fog has once again developed over the
area early this morning, but not as widespread and dense as last
night

Otherwise, models show mid-level warming through the day as upper
ridge strengthens over the Tennessee Valley. Increasing mid-level
temperatures will suppress convection for this afternoon and
evening. Sky cover will break allowing for an unseasonably warm
day across the Region.

For Tonight, dry until next frontal-genetic band approaches the
area early Monday morning, mainly after 12Z. Will include chance
of showers over mainly the Plateu and far western southwest
Virginia late in the period.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...At the beginning of this 
period the upper flow will be zonal across almost the whole U.S. at 
our latitude. At the surface our warm air mass will still be in 
place, but a cold front will be closing in on our area from the 
northwest.  During the day Monday the front is expected to settle 
into the area and stall.  By Tuesday a surface Low will be moving up 
the front from the southwest and depending on the path and strength 
of the low, the front may surge northward again.  Then by Tuesday 
evening, once the Low gets far enough north and east, the cyclonic 
flow will send the frontal boundary surging southward again, this 
time moving southward, quickly into Georgia.  The busy pattern 
continues as the zonal flow ends as an upper level clipper system 
comes sweeping through the area Wednesday night, spreading light 
precip northward across the area.  The surface cool airmass will 
still be in place, but it looks like this airmass will not be cold 
enough for wintry precip.  After this clipper passes, by Friday and 
into Saturday, the pattern flattens out again into a zonal flow, 
with maybe some slight ridging over the area.  

Focusing back on the storm threats for Monday through Tuesday--the 
northern plateau may have some storms early Monday as the left-over 
storms from the Midwest roll in.  Then during the day Monday, the 
cold front will be moving through and there should be some storms 
develop along the front, however, it doesn't look like there will be 
much instability ahead of the front on Monday. On Tuesday as the 
front surges northward, it still looks like instability will be very 
limited, resulting in storms with little to no hail and localized 
storms with gusts to maybe 40 mph.  Over the two-day period, some 
locations will likely get over an inch of rain, but it should be 
spread out enough to limit the flooding potential.  As we keep an 
eye on this, the heaviest rains will likely be between midnight 
Monday night through the day on Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...

Southwesterly low level flow with a warm front moving to the north 
of the area has lead to a warm and moist atmosphere for early 
November. PW values are around the 90th percentile across the area. 
In the upper levels, there is not much in the way of support for 
precipitation but there have been a few isolated showers this 
afternoon with the overly moist atmosphere in place. Another mild 
night is forecast tonight with lows in the mid 50s to low 60s. 
Rainfall has not been as widespread as yesterday and expect there 
will be fog but not as widespread and dense as last night. The warm 
front will continue to advance further to the north on Sunday. With 
the lack of lift across the area, expect mostly dry conditions will 
continue on Sunday. Forecast highs will be warm for early November 
with temperatures in the low to mid 70s.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Friday)...

Front will be nearing the area early next week, and temperatures 
will remain relatively warm with highs expected to be in the 70's on 
Monday. When the front does actually arrive on Monday 
evening/Tuesday morning, but will likely not be able to push all the 
way through the forecast area. Front will stall out and lead to a 
prolonged period of shower and thunderstorm chances along and south 
of the front. Exact location of the front is a little difficult to 
pin down at this time but looks like it should be near the KY/TN 
border. South of the front temperatures will maybe be able to reach 
into the 70's while locations to the north might be stuck in the 
50's/60's.

Front will eventually get shoved southward and a low will quickly 
zip along to our south at the end of the work week. With the front 
moving south and the low pressure moving through temperatures will 
remain cool (about 10 degrees below normal for this time of year). 
Drier air behind the front will remain in place leading to minimal 
rain chances through the end of the week and weekend.

.DISCUSSION...

Warm and moist air currently in place for early November with a
warm front to the north. Fog has been slow to lift across the area
and have continued with some fog over the next hour or so. A 
shortwave trough will pass to the north across the Great Lakes 
region today but should have limited influence across the Southern
Appalachians. PW values are in the 1.0-1.2 inch range, which is 
near the 90th percentile. The main deterrent for precipitation 
today is the lack of lift across the area. A shortwave trough is 
currently exiting to the east. For the update, decreased PoPs 
slightly today but have continued with a slight chance for 
precip. across the area but expect most locations will remain dry.
Temperatures will be warm again with highs in the upper 60s to 
mid 70s for most locations.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Radar and experimental GOES 16 low-level water vapor loops showing
weak disturbance over NE Tennessee that is still contributing to
increased lift and shower activity in our NE forecast area.
Short-range models show this feature moving east of the area
before noon, so will go with higher POPs in that area for the
morning, but for the afternoon will back off to only "Chance"
POPs. Will continue slight chance POPs for tonight. For this
afternoon, will have slight chance of thunder for plateau and
southern areas where instability will be a little higher. 

Dense fog reported around the area, but check of traffic cams 
confirms it is localized-- will go with "patchy" in the forecast 
for this morning and again late tonight. Temps still running very 
mild for this time of year
--went close to guidance for these two periods.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...Fairly flat upper ridge 
across the southern Appalachians Sunday with mid-level inversion 
helping to limit instability. Southerly flow over the area will keep 
unseasonably warm temperatures across the region.

For late Sunday night and Monday, another fairly quick moving upper 
jet and associated short-wave will move across the Ohio Valley 
with trailing frontal boundary pulling south into the Tennessee 
Valley. Even though upper support moves mainly north and east of 
the Region, enough moisture/instabilty to produce 
scattered/numerous showers and isolated thunder for Monday.

For Monday night and Tuesday, another fast moving jet/short-wave 
will move across the lower Ohio/Tennessee Valleys with quasi-
stationary front across the area producing likely chances of showers 
with a chance of thunderstorms. Model soundings show airmass will be 
a little more unstable for Tuesday afternoon so expect greater 
coverage of storms. Instability and wind field does not support 
severe storms at this time.

For Tuesday night and Wednesday, frontal boundary moving south as
upper flow becomes a little more amplified. Another quick moving 
wave will increase coverage of rain showers once again by early 
Wednesday morning, but move south in the afternoon.

For Thursday and Friday, frontal boundary continues to pull south 
through the Gulf Coast States with more amplified upper flow pulling 
drier and cooler air into the Tennessee Valley.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...

A cold front is currently moving into the Plateau and stretches back 
to the southwest into Northern Mississippi. Scattered showers 
continue ahead of this boundary with a moist atmosphere in place. PW 
values are currently in the 1.3-1.5 inch range, which is well above 
the 90th percentile for early November and approaching maximum 
observed values. In the upper level flow is generally zonal with a 
few weak shortwave troughs across the Southern U.S. For this 
evening, continued with 30-50 PoPs with scattered showers and 
storms. SBCAPE values are in the 250-750 J/Kg range and could still 
have a few rumbles of thunder but do not expect widespread 
thunderstorms this afternoon and evening. The cold front will 
continue to slowly move into northwestern portions of the area and 
will likely stall across the area later this evening. Due to this, 
have continued at least some mention of PoPs in the forecast 
throughout the overnight hours. The temperature difference across 
the boundary is not very significant and overnight temperatures will 
continue to be mild with lows in the mid 50s to low 60s. 

The front will begin to push northward as a warm front on Saturday 
as an upper level trough passes to the north across the Great Lakes. 
Expect scattered showers and storms will be possible again in the 
warm sector with highs warming into the low to mid 70s for most 
locations. SBCAPE values will range from around 250-750 J/Kg and 
have continued with a small chance for thunder in the forecast but 
do not expect any widespread thunderstorms. 


.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Thursday)...

Mostly zonal flow and a few weak frontal boundaries are the major 
weather players expected for the rest of the 7-day forecast. Front 
will try and push through on Monday, but with weak forcing behind 
it, it will stall out for a couple of days. Along this front we 
should see some shower and thunderstorm development. Front will 
meander around the area until it finally pushes through late 
Tuesday/early Wednesday. Behind the front colder air will begin to 
funnel in and drop our temperatures. Rain chances will slowly taper 
off through the middle of the week and eventually the skies will 
begin to clear out. Temperatures will start in the 70's and by the 
end of the week we can expect daytime high temperatures to drop down 
into the 50's across the Valley.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Pattern continues to shift to the east, putting us closer and closer 
to deeper moisture and lift. Convection currently over the Ohio 
Valley is expected to head this way, but without as complete of 
coverage. 850 mb winds feeding the Ohio Valley convection now will 
be weakening and veering as the convection approaches, so feed of 
moisture will be less here.  However, regardless of this lack of 
organization, there will be some surface based instability this 
afternoon as well as some outflow boundaries moving in that will 
favor localized new convection. Best instability (CAPE) will be 
west 500-1000 J/kg, while most of the northern valley will be <500
J/kg--really struggling for more than showers. Also, the best 
chances of outflow boundaries surviving will be in the western 
areas, as the convection first moves into the area later today. 
Temperatures this afternoon will likely be muted/slightly cooler 
due to increased cloud cover.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...Fast zonal flow will 
dominate the pattern across much of the nation with a series of 
weak short-waves moving across the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys through 
early/mid week next week.

Upper troughs will move across southern Canada/northern United 
States bringing a frontal boundary into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. 
Given the west to east upper flow this boundary will not pull 
quickly south across the Tennessee Valley, but instead meander 
across the lower Ohio and Tennessee Valley Saturday through 
Tuesday. 

Airmass over the region will be moisture and marginally unstable 
allowing frontal boundary to produce periods of scattered showers 
and thunderstorms. Greatest coverage will be Saturday and late 
Monday through Wednesday. Least chance will be Sunday and Monday as 
warmer mid-level temperatures will limit instability.

For mid-week next week, a more amplified pattern will pull frontal 
boundary south of the area with cooler temperatures.

northern valley will be <500 J/kg--really struggling for more than
showers.

950 PM EDT Thu Nov 2 2017

.DISCUSSION...Forecast mostly on track this evening. Did decide 
to slow onset of precip just a little as showers are just now 
beginning to develop back to our west. However, do expect this 
activity to continue to slowly increase in coverage and move east 
into our area as we move through the night and into tomorrow 
morning. Thicker cloud cover has also been slow to move in. 
Therefore, temps across NETN and SWVA were running several degrees
cooler than forecast for the current hour due to the clearer 
skies still in place. Don't anticipate this to change our 
overnight lows though as increasing cloud cover and sw flow should
help keep them from dropping too much more. There could be some
light patchy fog up across NETN and SWVA because of the slower
clouds but not confident enough to put in forecast at this time. 
Will send out new zones for the POP adjustment.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...

The forecast area is now well into the warm sector with temperatures 
in the upper 60s to mid 70s across the area. Upper level flow is 
mostly zonal with a ridge to the south and a trough to the north. 
Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a 
weak trough in the zonal flow across the Lower Mississippi River 
Valley and another shortwave troughs across the Southern Plains. 
Looking at the radar, there are a few showers across Northern 
Mississippi and West Tennessee. This shortwave trough is forecast 
to move into the area tonight with light showers becoming more 
widespread. Low level southwesterly winds will continue to advect 
in moisture with PW values climbing up into the 1.2-1.3 inch 
range. These values are near the 90th percentile for early 
November and have increased PoPs for late tonight into the day on 
Friday. Models soundings also indicate around 500-1000 J/Kg of 
SBCAPE on Friday afternoon and expect there could be a few rumbles
of thunder as the second shortwave trough moves through. The 
shortwave trough is not overly impressive with weak flow aloft and
do not expect any strong or severe storms. Temperatures will be 
above normal thanks to the low level warm advection with overnight
lows in the mid 50s to low 60s and highs on Friday in the upper 
60s to mid 70s. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Wednesday)...
A fast zonal flow will dominate the weather pattern through early
next week, bringing unseasonably mild temperatures.

Friday's frontal boundary will push northeast on Saturday, with weak 
ridging building in for Sunday, bringing drier conditions and highs 
in the mid 70s.

From here, the weather pattern remains unsettled with a series of 
weaker disturbances affecting the area. Another frontal boundary 
approaches the area on Monday, bringing more rain chances to the 
northern half of the forecast area. There appears to be enough 
instability ahead of this boundary for scattered thunderstorms to 
develop. This boundary stalls out just north of Tennessee Monday 
night before slowly pushing through the area in the 
Tuesday/Wednesday timeframe. Another shortwave will follow for late 
in the workweek.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Low level return flow is now 
well established across the area, with a WSW mid-level flow aloft. 
The much of this period offers very little lift and limited precip 
chances, but late tonight models agree on a mid-level shortwave and 
associated lift coming in that should get some light precip to 
spread into the area from west to east.  The frontal boundary that 
is now stretching NE-SW from the Great Lakes to the Central Plains 
will be sliding southward toward the area, but by Friday morning 
will have advanced only to the Ohio Valley, so we will continue in
this warm moist air mass. Will keep precip as showers right now; 
forecasting that storms will stay to our west through this period.
Temperatures will continue above seasonal normals and dew points 
significantly higher than normal for early November.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...Main weather feature will 
remain the fast zonal flow across much of the nation through early 
next week. The fast westerly flow will produce unseasonably mild 
conditions, especially during the night-time hours. High 
temperatures in the upper 60s to middle 70s and lows in the middle 
50s and lower 60s will be common.

The fast zonal flow will allow a series of weak short-waves to move 
across the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys helping to organize convection 
along a frontal boundary. The front will move into the area Friday, 
and then become stationary Friday night, pulling north for Saturday.
Airmass will become moisture and marginally unstable producing 
scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms for Friday through 
Saturday.

For Sunday, upper ridge builds into the area with a mid-level 
inversion limiting any convection development.

for Monday, another frontal boundary sags into the Tennessee Valley 
with enough moisture/instability for at least scattered convection 
of showers and thunderstorms. This boundary becoming quasi-
stationary across the southern Ohio/Tennessee Valleys for Tuesday.

For Tuesday night and Wednesday, upper flow becomes a little more 
amplified allowing frontal boundary to pull south across the 
southern Appalachians.

Moist fetch has settled into the area, with multiple layers of

a westerly component higher up and with the lift being weak, that
it looks like we will continue with layers of clouds and some
showers rather than deep, organized lift and moisture. This setup

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...

Seeing the light showers from earlier this morning beginning to push 
off to the north and east as a warm front lifts to the north. PW 
values today have been just under and inch and model soundings 
indicate that the low levels are relatively dry. So far, have not
seen any observations of more than a trace amount of 
precipitation across the forecast area. 

For tonight, a weak shortwave trough will move through the Tennessee 
River Valley with PW values creeping up into the 1.1-1.3 inch range. 
Model soundings depict rather shallow moisture and have continued 
with low end PoPs. Any precipitation that does fall will be light 
with only a couple of hundredths of precip. at the most. 
Temperatures and dewpoints will increase during the day on Thursday 
with low level southerly to southwesterly flow. The shortwave trough 
will pass to the east and expect mostly dry conditions during the 
afternoon as the mid and low level moisture erodes. Cloud cover 
could hang around a good portion of the day but is dependent on how 
deep the saturated layer will be tonight. Highs on Thursday will be 
warmer with values in the upper 60s to low 70s across most
locations.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Tuesday)...

Flow at 500 MB will be generally zonal over the long term 
forecast period. Surface high pressure over the coastal Southeast 
will keep our area under a regime of unseasonably warm and humid 
air from the Gulf, interrupted only briefly and sporadically by a 
weak frontal boundary meandering into the area. Scattered showers 
will generally be the rule, as nothing really organized is 
apparent at this time until next Wednesday, when a shortwave 
trough will intensify CAA out of the northern plains and shove a 
fairly vigorous front through the southeast, vigorous enough to 
interact with the warmth and moisture ahead of it to induce 
another notable rain event.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...A warm frontal boundary was 
draped from eastern KY to northeast MS. A shortwave trough was 
translating along a similar path as the surface front. Very light 
precipitation was noted mostly west of this boundary. Forecast 
soundings show very dry air under approximately 725mb for most of 
area today and tonight. This should limit precipitation chances and 
rainfall amounts across the forecast area. Best chances for 
measurable rainfall will occur over the plateau today albeit only 
about a 30 percent chance. Daytime temperatures will be near normal 
and tonight's low temperatures will be slightly above normal.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...Zonal upper flow and 
surface ridging across the southeast United States will be the main 
features Thursday. Flow around the surface ridging will be southerly 
across the Mississippi and western Tennessee Valleys producing 
isentropic lift and scattered showers mainly west of the area.

A frontal boundary will approach the area from the north Friday as 
southwest boundary layer flow increases the moisture and instability 
over the region. A greater coverage of showers and possibly thunder 
for Friday. Models disagree on how far south this boundary will 
stall for Friday night and Saturday, but southwesterly flow and 
building upper ridge over the Gulf Coast States helps pull this 
boundary northward Saturday. Boundary near the area and continue 
moisture and instability will produce scattered showers and isolated 
thunderstorms Saturday, especially during the afternoon.

For Sunday and Monday, upper ridge builds back into the Tennessee 
Valley and southern Appalachians with mid-level inversion limited 
convection development. For Tuesday, another frontal boundary moves 
south into the region increasing the chances of showers and 
thunderstorms.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...The nearly stationary front 
to our south will move back north as a warm front during the period, 
as some weak short wave energy moves across as it shears out. 
Moisture will increase, but best moisture and lift will stay to our 
west and north. Best chance for any showers looks to be plateau and 
southwest VA counties, so will carry low PoPs there late tonight

some minor adjustments to MAV temps, mainly to go a bit lower for 
some Min temps tonight. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...High pressure over 
the SE coast will slowly move to the east through the work week. Low 
level flow will shift to out of the southeast...increasing moisture 
and warm air advection to the area. Thursday and 
Friday...temperatures will be near or a degree or two above 
normal...while several shortwaves are expected to bring scattered 
showers and thunderstorms to the area both days. PW values increase 
to around 1 by Friday afternoon...though little instability is 
present either day. Wind shear is weak...with less than 30 kts 
expected through the low and mid levels. Any showers will be slow 
moving...with only a small threat to localized ponding on roadways 
possible in areas that recieve several showers through the day.

The high pressure shifts east...allowing the remaining showers to 
move east by Saturday morning. By Saturday afternoon...diurnal 
showers and thunderstorms are possible with around 1300 to 1800 J/kg

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Skies are clear across the forecast area early this morning.
Temperatures are in the lower 30s in the protected valleys but
mostly in the upper 30s and lower 40s...several degrees warmer
than Mondays cold start. A weak cold front was moving through the
eastern sections but clouds were absent and winds were light.
Higher pressure will build southeast from the Plains into the Ohio
and Tennessee Valleys today. Highs will be similar to Monday in
the upper 50s to lower 60s. Tonight clouds increase as front moves
back north as a warm front. A few showers may move into plateau 
area before morning otherwise another seasonally cool night a few
degrees warmer than this morning.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...
Zonal flow aloft and surface ridging into the southeast United 
States will be the main story through the extended. The zonal flow
will allow temperatures to moderate to above normal by mid to 
late week, and pull a good deal of mainly mid and high level 
clouds into the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians.

Persistent surface ridging across the far southeast United States 
will keep moisture limited. The deepest moisture seems to be 
Saturday with PWs increasing to 1.25 inch. Best southwest flow 
moisture fetch and isentropic lift will be across the lower 
Mississippi and western Tennessee Valley regions. Will call for low 
chances PoPs through Saturday (best over the Plateau). Enough 
instability Saturday to include slight thunder chances along and 
south of interstate 40.

Upper ridging strengthening over the southern Appalachians Sunday 
and Monday with a mid-level inversion developing. This inversion 
will suppress convection development producing unseasonably warm and 
dry conditions.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...A weakening and moisture 
starved cold front will swing through the area and will exit after 
midnight.  Will see some clouds move across, mainly in northern 
areas.  Should see plenty of sunshine again Tuesday as surface high 
pressure builds back in.  Temperatures tonight expected to dip into 
the mid to upper 30s in some areas, but the frost/freeze program has 
ended for this fall due to the widespread freeze last night, so no 
frost will be included in the forecast. Just some minor tweaks to 
MAV temps for the short term period.  

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...The weak frontal 
boundary that slips into the region will be gradually shifting back 
to the north as a warm front through mid week. The boundary and a 
couple of weak ripples of short wave energy require the use of some 
slight and small chance pops for a shower in a couple spots 
Wednesday into Thursday. The chance for a shower may be slightly 
higher Friday into Saturday with a little more well developed upper 
trough and associated deeper moist column compliments of a healthier 
southerly flow. If all goes well, the weekend may not have much 
probability of precip included as upper ridging strengthens over the 
Eastern U.S. ahead of an early work week storm system. The 
advertised warming trend is still in play with high temperatures 
rising from around 60 degrees at the start of the extended period to 
the lower and possibly middle 70s at the end on Monday of next week.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Northwest flow affects across the forecast area are ending early
this morning. Low clouds across the northeast area is eroding
quickly with mostly clear skies now across all but southwest
Virginia and extreme northeast Tennessee. Deep surface low over
New York and associated upper low over Pennsylvania with wrap
around low clouds was finally shifting northeast. Temperatures
have dropped into the mid 20s plateau and higher elevations to
lower to mid 30s elsewhere. Weak high pressure builds in today
with much warmer temperatures and winds shifting to the south and
southwest. A rapid warmup from below freezing to the 50s to lower
60s. A weak front will move quickly southeast into the Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys today and through the eastern Tennessee Valley
tonight. Some increase in clouds will occur tonight but air mass
will be too dry for any precipitation. Temperatures tonight will
not be as cold mid 30s to lower 40s.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...
No breaking news here, extended period still looks unchanged 
which will disappoint many due to the dreary forecast in store for
much of the week. The good news is that we will see a warming 
trend with 70s right around the corner!

On Tuesday the weak frontal boundary is just to our south. Cold air 
behind this front isn't strong so temps on Tuesday remain unchanged 
to those we see Monday. Tuesday night lows will be in the upper 30s 
to low 40s. On Wednesday we start to see clouds and precip chances 
increase as high pressure to our east and a shortwave back to our 
west work together like two cogs to pump in moisture from the 
southwest. Moisture moving in, an active jet, old frontal 
boundary/new warm front, lift back north and allow for the 
aforementioned rain chances. Warm front rapidly moves north 
Wednesday night into Thursday as southerly flow picks up steam. 
Thursday through Friday we are entrenched within the warm sector 
with lingering moisture. This setup doesn't scream high POPS due to 
lack of forcing but will have slight chance and chance POPs in place 
nonetheless due to weak isentropic lift pattern in place. Any precip 
that occurs will be very light. Temps on Thursday and Friday will be 
in the upper 60s and to near 70. 

On Saturday we see a weak shortwave zip across the area from out 
west. This feature will generate additional lift and provide a 
better chance for showers and possible a few storms compared to the 
previous setup. Chances for precip will carry over into Sunday as 
the system exits but with much lower chances than Saturday. Highs on 
over the weekend will be right around 70 with lows ranging from the 
lower 50s to upper 50s.

Northwest flow persists this evening producing isolated snow
showers over southwest Virginia and parts of northeast Tennessee.
Cloud cover has moved out of the southern Tennessee
Valley and continues its slow erode to the north. Feel that clouds
will clear at Knoxville around midnight...a little unsure that
clouds will clear at Tri Cities before sunrise. If the clouds do
not move out then overnight temperatures will be a few degrees
warmer than current forecast, however confidence is low. Therefore
no changes will be made to the ongoing forecast. Freezing
temperatures will likely impact the entire forecast area tonight.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...
Lingering low level moisture and upslope NW flow is producing
scattered drizzle, freezing drizzle, and light snow showers mainly
across the higher elevations of the mountains above 2500 feet. Not
getting perfect dendrite growth with the shallow moisture, but it
is deep enough to result in some light snow. Moisture will
decrease this evening and tonight with a clearing sky. This will
allow temperatures to decrease into the upper 20s to lower 30s
areawide with a widespread freeze likely late tonight and Monday
morning.

Temperatures begin to rebound on Monday as the longwave trough 
exits to the northeast and zonal flow sets up. Surface winds will
shift to the southwest ahead of another front that drops south
through the Ohio Valley and toward our region on Monday. However, moisture
is limited so do not anticipate more than potentially some 
increasing clouds late Monday.


.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Saturday)...
The extended scenario hasn't changed too much in the last twenty 
four hours. A frontal boundary will still drop south into the 
region and hang around for a couple days at mid week with an 
initial short wave building into the area for Wednesday into 
Thursday time frame. Chance probabilities for some rain showers 
should cover this part of the forecast. Another wave and cold 
frontal boundary will slip south toward the Southern Appalachian 
region Friday into Saturday bringing another chance for a few 
showers to the forecast area. However, probabilities may be on the
decrease Saturday night into Sunday as a more amplified upper 
trough and surface frontal system build into the Central U.S. The 
strengthening southerly component to the low level flow will push 
the mid week frontal boundary well to the north of the region 
allowing for the decreasing chance for rain. The most pleasant 
warming trend is still in the works during the extended. The first
couple days of the forecast period on Tuesday and Wednesday will 
be around 60 degrees for high temperatures but with the return to 
a southerly wind direction for the latter part of the forecast, 
highs may rebound to the upper 60s and lower 70s.

.DISCUSSION...
Surface observations, spotter and media reports, and radar data 
continue to indicate some lingering moisture across the area this 
morning with most across the eastern mountains along the TN/NC 
border where upslope orographic lift is strongest. Moisture is 
very shallow with the saturated layer only making it to around -8C
to -10C limiting the amount of efficient dendrite growth. For 
this reason, will continue to see a mix of drizzle, freezing 
drizzle, and snow flakes with light accumulations possible mainly 
above 3000 feet where temperatures should stay near or below 
freezing all day. This may lead to some icy spots on roads across 
the higher elevations. For lower elevations below around 3000 
feet, will likely still see some snow flakes mixing in with areas 
of drizzle this morning, but will not see any accumulation beyond 
a brief dusting. Temperatures will likely rise into the upper 30s 
and lower 40s this afternoon across lower elevations which will 
allow for mainly drizzle later today before moisture begins to 
decrease later this afternoon and tonight.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Steady precipitation has ended across the region tonight but bands
of light rain were still moving across the extreme northeast
sections. Areas of light drizzle continue over the remainder of
the eastern Tennessee Valley as moisture is still being squeezed
out of the lower part of the atmosphere. Temperatures are in the
lower 30s to near 40 across the area but below freezing above
about 3000 feet where patchy freezing drizzle or very light
freezing rain is possible mainly this morning. Only very light
icing is expected but it could make some high elevation roads
slick. As deep upper trough approaches the next few hours strong
NW flow aloft will squeeze out enough moisture below 800 mb to
produce areas of very light rain or drizzle lower elevations and 
light snow and freezing rain or freezing drizzle mountains. 
Accumulations of snow of a few tenths to over one inch possible in
the higher mountains during the day. Low clouds will linger for 
the day with clearing by afternoon in the south. Highs will be 
more like winter time...in the 40s but upper 30s higher elevations
of southwest Virginia and eastern Tennessee mountains. The 
highest elevations will stay below freezing. Northwest winds will 
be gusty in the higher elevations especially this afternoon and 
evening. Gusts as high as 35 mph extreme northeast mountains. This
will make it feel even colder. Tonight a freeze warning has been 
issued as low level moisture moves out skies will clear from 
southwest to northeast. Temperatures will drop into the upper 20s 
to lower 30s area wide. The only places that may not freeze will 
be around the urban cities of Chattanooga and Knoxville. Winds 
should decrease after midnight with widespread frost formation.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...
We begin the period with zonal flow returning to the forecast 
area. Models continue to show a weak frontal boundary dropping 
down out of the Ohio River Valley and approaching our area late 
Monday. We begin to see an increase in cloud cover through the day
from northwest to southeast. Highs will range from the mid 50s to
low 60s. Weak boundary with little moisture moves into the CWA 
Monday night into Tuesday and then stalls across the area. Lows 
Monday night will be warmer and range from the mid 30s to near 40.
A few degrees warmer Tuesday with a few clouds around due to the 
boundary and lows in the upper 30s to low 40s overnight. By 
Wednesday a shortwave moves in from the west and brings increasing
moisture to the region. This is when chances for showers return 
to the forecast as the shortwave interacts with the stalled, weak,
boundary that resides in the area. Showers remain on Thursday but
then the shortwave begins to lift off to the NE. Chances for 
showers remain on Friday though as southerly flow and an active 
jet remain across our area ahead of an approaching shortwave for 
Saturday. Shortwave rolls in on Saturday, allowing for more 
showers across the area. Wednesday through Saturday temps slowly 
climb as southerly flow returns. By Thursday we hit the low 70s 
and this continues into Saturday. Lows will be in the mid 50s.

So overall, no real big/organized system comes through but unsettled 
weather in store due to the active jet, stalled boundary, and 
multiple shortwaves that roll through.

.DISCUSSION...
Post frontal rain continues across the central and eastern
portions of the forecast area. The precipitation has had a very
slow eastward progression over the past several hours however
individual showers were moving quickly northward. In the past
three hours, KTRI has received just over one quarter inch of rain.
It appears that similar rainfall rates will persist through at
least 11 pm EDT before tapering off. Back to the west it was much
drier. The visibilities and cloud ceilings have risen and will
likely remain dry the remainder of the night. Have adjusted PoPs
closer to latest radar trends and gradually taper rain showers off
later tonight across southwest VA and northeast TN. Overall, other
weather elements looks reasonable. The updated ZFP will be out
shortly.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...
Cold front continues to move east of the area tonight with rain
slowly shifting east and colder air moving in from the west. 
Trough axis will pivot east tonight, and winds will increase from 
the northwest late tonight and Sunday morning. The combination of 
upslope orographic lift and remaining moisture may allow for some 
precipitation across the higher terrain. While temperatures will 
be cold enough for a wintry mix of light precipitation late 
tonight and Sunday across the higher elevations above 3000 feet, 
think that most will be drizzle/freezing drizzle/ice riming due to
the fact that there is very little moisture through the DGZ and 
efficient snow growth appears unlikely. Regardless, this wintry 
mix will lead to some icy spots across the higher elevations. 
Highs on Sunday will be very cold with temperatures about 20 
degrees below normal.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)...
The period starts out with an exiting upper trough Sunday night 
followed by a drier regime on Monday. Another wave of low pressure
will be slipping east from the Great Lakes through the 
Northeastern U.S. corridor Monday into Tuesday and the northerly 
flow extending through the deamplifying base of this trough will 
drive a weak frontal boundary into the forecast area during the 
day Tuesday. The good news is there doesn't seem to be enough 
moisture for much more than a few clouds during the day. However, 
another short wave will be on the move at mid week and this 
feature should be able to activate the frontal boundary generating
a few showers across the Southern Appalachian region Wednesday 
into Thursday. The active fall pattern continues into the end of 
the extended forecast with another short wave and increasing moist
southerly flow Friday into Saturday. This will require the use of
chance pops right through the end of the long term period. While 
there will be clouds and some light showers at times, the return 
to a southerly low level flow regime will allow for a pleasant 
warming trend ending up with high temperatures back around 70 
degrees by the end of the week.

.DISCUSSION...
A strong cold front is moving through the area this morning. 
Surface observations show the front located NE to SW across the 
valley with temperatures dropping quickly into the upper 30s to 
mid 40s in the wake of the cold front. Ahead of the front, 
temperatures are much warmer in the mid 50s to lower 60s across NE
TN and parts of SW VA. Could see some heavier downpours ahead of 
the front this afternoon in NE TN and SW VA where moisture is 
highest and PWs are near the 90th percentile of climatology. 
Upper-divergence is assisting with synoptic lift across the region
as we're located within both the right-front entrance region of a
jet streak across the Ohio Valley and the left-exit region of a 
jet streak to our south. With the front slowly moving east across 
the region and favorable synoptic lift, this setup should be 
favorable for wet weather the remainder of the day.

Cold air will continue to move in tonight with winds out of the
northwest providing some orographic lift. However, model soundings
still indicate moisture will be very shallow with the DGZ being dry
and unfavorable for efficient snow production. Setup seems to 
favor drizzle/freezing drizzle and ice riming rather than light 
snow across the higher terrain late tonight and Sunday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Sunday)...
Rain is spreading into east Tennessee this morning just ahead of a
cold front now moving onto the Cumberland Plateau counties. A big
temperature drop will impact the region behind the front with
temperatures tumbling from the upper 50s to mid 60s now to the 40s
later this morning and afternoon. The front may not reach the
eastern and northeast areas until this afternoon. Instability is
very low and so not expecting any thunderstorms. Rainfall amounts
may reach over one inch in the eastern mountains and 1.5 inches
extreme northeast. The heaviest rainfall will move from the
plateau early this morning to the valley and southeast mountains
later into early afternoon and then northeast half this afternoon
and evening.

The system will linger over the extreme northeast into this 
evening. Gusty south to southwest winds over 30 mph have occurred 
in the valley and higher elevations. Gusty winds will continue 
until rain begins with the front so continued advisory until 14Z. 
Tonight and Sunday morning longwave trough moves through the 
region and with very cold air aloft and lingering moisture. 
Northwest winds and low moisture aloft will produce some very 
light freezing rain or drizzle late tonight and early 
Sunday...mostly at elevations above 3000 feet in the eastern 
mountains. Any accumulations will be very light. Temperatures will
drop to near to below freezing only in the higher elevations. 
Elsewhere lows mostly in the upper 30s. Due to cloud cover and 
light precipitation and northwest winds frost formation unlikely. 
Sunday cold temperatures continue and more light freezing drizzle 
or drizzle possible. With extensive clouds northeast half and cold
air advection highs will stay in the upper 30s northeast...even 
below freezing higher elevations to possibly only mid 40s central 
valley. Places in the southern valley may not reach 50 even with 
some sunshine.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Friday)...
Negatively tilted trough axis just off to our east to start the 
period along with associated area of low pressure. Majority of the
precip is over for us at this point but redevelopment and 
intensification of the system occurs as a new area of low pressure
develops off the coast of Virginia. As this new development takes
place we begin to see some weak wrap around moisture into NETN 
and SWVA. Because of this, slight chance POPs in place Sunday 
night and then drop them after midnight as the low pulls further 
up the coast. Shallow moisture depth will lend to freezing drizzle
instead of snow showers as the moisture column only goes up to 
-8/-9 deg C. Any precip that occurs should be light but with icing
it doesn't take much to cause trouble spots. Any slick spots that
develop will likely occur across the higher elevations as 
temperatures don't reach freezing across valley locations until 
precip is exiting. Lows Sunday night will be in the upper 20s to 
lower 30s, 10 to 15 degrees below normal. A freeze watch will 
likely be needed during the next forecast package.

On Monday a weak cold front drops down out of the Ohio River valley 
associated with an area of low pressure up across the Great Lakes. 
No POP chances though as moisture is very limited. We will see a 
slight increase in cloud cover across northern areas bu that's about 
it. Highs will be in the mid to upper 50s, around 8 to 10 degrees 
below normal. Lows Monday night will be warmer, in the mid to upper 
30s. On Tuesday the front is draped across the area which will 
bring slightly more cloud cover. Highs will be in the upper 50s to 
low 60s. Warmer again Tuesday night with lows in the upper 30s to 
low 40s. Wednesday through Friday looks unsettled as we see return 
flow across the area as well as an active upper level jet. During 
this time chances for rain return along with warming temperatures.

.DISCUSSION...Will be transitioning into a more active weather 
pattern tonight as a cold front approaches the Southern Appalachian 
Region.  Ahead of this frontal boundary...will see cloud cover 
increase and lower throughout the night. The eastward movement of 
the front is slow and associated precip is expected to push across 
the area through the night and into Saturday. Also accompanying the 
front will be increased winds...especially at higher elevations 
where winds could gust to up to 50 mph.  A wind advisory is in 
effect for these areas. Current forecast in good shape...will update 
to remove evening wording.

.AVIATION...Will be transitioning into a more active weather 
pattern through the next 24 hours as a cold front moves into the 
Southern Appalachian Region.  The approach of this frontal boundary 
will bring mid to low level clouds into the area overnight. The 
eastward movement of the front has slowed and associated precip is 
not expected to push into the area until late tonight into early 
Saturday morning.  Accompanying the showers will be bands of 
lowering clouds and reduce VIS.  This will generate occasional MVFR 
conditions late tonight into the day Saturday. Also associated with 
the front will be increased winds aloft which may generate LLWS 
generally between 06Z to up to 22Z.  As long as the system does not 
slow down further...expected to see some improvement by the end of 
the TAF period over CHA and possibly TYS.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Saturday)...Everything still on track 
for things going downhill tonight as system moves our way.  System 
expected to move slowly, with measurable rains possibly not 
getting to NE corner of CWA until after sunrise Saturday. With 
clouds and rain associated with the cooler air, expecting non-
diurnal temperature trend as colder air pushes in from the west--
the western sections will likely have their max temp early in the 
morning. Rain totals look to generally be around an inch, so not 
too heavy overall and PW values for this event are notably lower 
than our soupy airmass on Monday. By the end of this period, the 
temps will not be cold enough to change any of the precip to any 
frozen precip. 

Will continue the Wind Advisory for late tonight into Saturday 
morning.  Moderate downsloping mountain wave event looks to set up 
ahead of front.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...
The longwave trough axis will pivot through the region late Saturday 
night and Sunday morning bringing with it very cold air aloft. 
Temperatures at 850mb will be around -5C to -8C. Lingering low-level 
moisture combined with northwesterly winds through the boundary 
layer behind the cold front will produce orographic lift and result 
in some light precipitation across the higher elevations. With very 
dry air aloft and very little moisture through the DGZ, believe that 
most orographically forced precipitation late Saturday night and 
Sunday will be drizzle with freezing drizzle possible above 3500 
feet elevation where temperatures are expected to remain near or 
below freezing on Sunday. With some moisture around -8C to -10C 
across the highest peaks, might could see some light snow flurries 
across the highest elevations, but overall, the setup looks more 
favorable to freezing drizzle/riming across the higher elevations of 
the mountains.

Temperatures will drop near or below freezing Saturday night and 
Sunday morning across many locations, especially higher elevations, 
so a frost advisory or freeze warning may be warranted on later 
shifts. However, remaining moisture on plants and latent heat 
release may act to offer some limited protection for vegetation 
Sunday morning as temperatures approach the freezing mark.

Expect unseasonably cold temperatures across the area on Sunday 
behind the departed front. Highs will range from the lower 40s to 
near 50, which is around 20 degrees below normal. Much of the higher 
elevations above 3500 feet will stay near or below freezing through 
the day. It looks like most of our forecast area will see a 
widespread freeze Sunday night as temperatures will range from the 
upper 20s to low 30s, which is 10 to 15 degrees below normal.

A shortwave passing to our north on Tuesday will help to shift a 
cold front southward toward our region. Lack of moisture with the 
front means we should stay dry with only a few additional clouds. 
Zonal flow will be the setup through the week with highs back near 
normal in the low to mid 60s. In response to a shortwave across the 
Southern Plains, southwesterly flow begins to return across the 
Tennessee Valley on Wednesday and Thursday bringing in additional 
moisture and isentropic lift. The main result looks to be increased 
cloudiness late week with just slight chance/chance PoPs across the 
area. Highest rain chances are expected to remain west of our 
forecast area where moisture and lift are best co-located. 
Uncertainty is high late next week because of model difficulties 
resolving exact timing, strength, and location of shortwaves moving 
through the zonal flow.

.DISCUSSION...
Forecast looks on track overall. Went ahead and issued the Wind 
Advisory that previous shift said might be needed. Looks like good
example of a moderate mountain wave event, and mainly in the
overnight hours. Winds should subside as the winds veer and 
weaken immediately ahead of the front Saturday morning.

Tweaked hourly temps as some locations were warming up a little 
slowly. Still looks like precip should hold until after this first
period, so keeping it dry, even on the plateau.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Skies are clear across the forecast area early this morning.
Temperatures are in the upper 30s to lower 40s across most of the
valley areas of the north and eastern sections and mid to upper
40s elsewhere. Higher elevations of the Cumberland Plateau and
some locations of the eastern mountains are still in the 50s as
south to southwest winds aloft is keeping air mixed. Some patchy
fog is forming where winds are calm but areas affected by fog will
be limited. Surface high pressure has shifted to the eastern
Carolinas and upper ridge of high pressure was not over the
Appalachians as a cold front moves into the Ohio and mid-
Mississippi Valleys today. Another sunny and warmer day today 
with highs uniformly in the upper 60s to lower 70s. South to 
southwest winds will gradually increase during the day which will 
help with the warming. Late this afternoon and tonight clouds 
increase ahead of the cold front and winds will continue to 
increase. Wind speeds in the eastern mountains will be 15 to 25 
mph with gusts to around 40 mph from about 03Z to 12Z Saturday so 
a wind advisory may need to be issued there. Instability looks 
very low so removed slight chance of thunder. Rain showers should 
move into western sections during the evening and reach the 
northeast area by Saturday morning. Highest rainfall amounts 
should be about 0.50 to 0.75 inches across the plateau counties by
Saturday morning. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...

Showers ongoing to start the period out ahead of a strong cold
front moving in from Western/Middle TN. At this point, it sill
looks to be only showers as there is no instability with this
system. Locally heavy rainfall possible as PWs will be elevated 
due to stout southerly flow ahead of the front. PW values average
around 1 inch which is near the 75th percentile for this time of 
year. Cold front rapidly pushes east through the day and much 
colder and drier air begins to push in by late afternoon. 
Lingering moisture in place across the eastern mountains, NETN, 
SWVA Saturday night into Sunday morning will result in possible 
light snow showers. A few light snow flurries may linger into 
early Sunday afternoon as upslope flow squeezes out any remaining 
moisture across the highest peaks of the eastern mountains.

Very cold temperatures across the area on Sunday behind the
departed front. Highs will range from the lower 40s to near 50,
which is around 20 degrees below normal. It looks like a good
portion of out forecast area will see a freeze Sunday night as
temperatures will range from the upper 20s to lower 30s, which is
10 to 15 degrees below normal. A more zonal flow returns for
Monday through Wednesday with highs and lows slowly climbing each
day. By Wednesday highs will be back into the lower to mid 60s.
Wednesday, POP chances begin to slowly increase through the day as
we begin to get some moisture return back out of the SW with high
pressure to our east. Chance POPs in place by Wednesday night for
most areas and this continues into Thursday.

.DISCUSSION...

No forecast changes planned for this evening's update as high 
pressure has taken a firm grip over the area. Changes are in store
tomorrow night, though as a cold front is set to push through the
state. Instability and shear will be at a bare minimum, so no 
thunder is expected, but look for soaking rains (1-1.5 inches 
total) to push across the East TN starting shortly after sunset 
Friday in the west and exiting the east side of the state by the 
same time Saturday evening. Drier air will follow, but so will the
cold. Look for freezing temperatures in elevated areas Saturday 
night and everywhere Sunday night.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Saturday)... Fair weather tonight
with a little patchy frost over the northeast, followed by a nice
warmup on Friday ahead of an approaching cold front. This system 
will, similar to the previous one, tap some tropical moisture and 
have the potential to produce locally heavy rainfall over 
favorable terrain on Saturday. Expect mostly showers with only 
isolated thunderstorms during Saturday's weather event.

.LONG TERM (Saturday Night through Thursday)... Lingering 
precipitation from the departing cold front will continue Saturday
night as the boundary pushes east. Upper level trough becomes 
more negatively tilted on Sunday as it lifts northeast, putting 
our area under strong northwest flow. This will help usher colder 
and drier air into the area, and some snowflakes may mix in at 
higher elevations early Sunday before the moisture exits the area.
With colder air firmly entrenched by Sunday night, it will be 
quite cold with temperatures dropping to near freezing or below by
early Monday morning and quite a bit of frost expected. 

Weak ridging will build over the area to start the workweek, and 
moisture will gradually work back into the region as flow turns more 
southeasterly. The next system approaches by midweek, bringing 
another chance for showers. Still quite a bit of model differences, 
so have limited the PoPs to the chance category with this system.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Much quieter period in store as 
our longwave trough pushes further east and out of the area. High 
pressure will build in behind this trough and will return us to more 
seasonable conditions. Clouds around early this morning but 
decreasing quickly and giving way to full on sunshine by late 
morning. Highs today will rebound into the low to mid 60s, which 
only puts us 3 to 5 degrees below normal. Warmer tonight as well as 
temps will range from near 40 to the mid 40s. Because of the warmer 
overnight temps frost shouldn't be an issue. 

Overall, once the clouds exit this morning it's smooth sailing with 
calm and clear conditions with near seasonable temperatures. 
However, colder temps return soon. Soon.


.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...The upper level ridge 
will be departing to the east on Friday as a closed low dives out 
of the Northern Plains into the Western Great Lakes. In the low 
levels, southwesterly flow will develop ahead of a fast moving 
cold front. These winds will advect in warmer temperatures and 
moisture. Friday will be the warmest day throughout the forecast 
period with highs in the low 70s across most of the valley. PW 
values will remain low on Friday in the 0.4-0.7 inch range and 
expect conditions will remain dry throughout the day. 

Models are all in fairly good agreement with the front moving 
through the area late Friday night into early Saturday. Widespread 
showers will develop along the boundary as the cold front races 
across the region. PW values on Saturday morning will climb up into 
the 1.0-1.2 inch range, which is in the 75th-90th percentile. The 
timeperiod of southerly flow ahead of the boundary will be limited 
and do not expect any instability will move into the area and have 
just mentioned showers in the forecast for now. Post-frontal 
precipitation will continue late in the day Saturday into early 
Sunday as a strong 120-130 kt 300 mb jet races across the 
Southeastern U.S. This will put the forecast area in the favored 
left exit region for continued synoptic lift behind the surface 
boundary. Colder and drier air will advect in behind the boundary 
and rain could change to snow across the higher elevations early 
Sunday morning but no impacts are expected. Neither the GFS or ECMWF 
are impressive with wrap around precipitation on Sunday and have cut 
back PoPs some. The GFS now indicates that the cyclogenesis will 
occur further to the north and east and any wrap around showers/snow 
showers will be limited to southwest Virginia and northeast 
Tennessee and confidence is low for these locations as well. 

Zonal flow aloft is forecast to start the work week with 
temperatures beginning to moderate some. Models differ on the timing 
of the next system but both main models do indicate PoPs increasing 
once again by mid-week.

Radar shows very light and spotty precip across our northern
sections as an upper trough and vort max with cold temps aloft
swings across our area. With the 00Z RNK sounding showing a
freezing level around 4400 ft, some of the mountain peaks of NE 
TN are probably seeing some snowfall, but probably little to no 
accumulation based on its short duration and warm ground. The
current slight chance PoP forecast for that area should cover it. 

The back edge of clouds moving SE across KY is expected to cross
our area between 04Z and 06Z. This should leave plenty of time for
radiational cooling, and temps still appear on track for
frost/freeze in the expected areas. Fog may also form in river
valleys in the clear/calm conditions. Overall, no significant 
changes are needed to the forecast.

.AVIATION...
An upper level trough is currently crossing the area, producing
broken to overcast midlevel cloud cover. This should persist until
around 06Z to 09Z, when clouds should decrease as the trough exits
the area. If the clouds clear out, then fog will be a possibility
at TRI. There is some question about how quickly the clouds clear
out to allow for fog development, so will mention MVFR vis in a
TEMPO for TRI. Lower observed dewpoints at TYS and CHA suggest a
lower potential for fog. Tomorrow will be clear with SW winds 
less than 10 kts.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
We'll start off the night with some clouds and maybe a patchy 
shower/flurry across SW Virginia or far NE Tennessee. As the base 
of the deep upper level trough parked overhead continues to shift 
east of the area this evening, northwest flow will prevail across 
the area. Expect below normal temperatures again tonight with as 
the northwest flow continues to usher cold air into the area. 
Additionally, moisture exits the area after midnight, allowing 
skies to clear and temperatures to drop further. Lows tonight will
range from freezing to the upper 30s; 5-10 degrees below normal 
for this time of year. A freeze warning is in effect again tonight
for the eastern mountain zones with a frost advisory for NE 
Tennessee, SW Virginia, the far northern Tennessee Valley, and the
northern Cumberland Plateau.

The upper trough will continue to race northeast on Thursday, 
with a shortwave ridge building in by the afternoon hours. This 
will result in ample sunshine across the area. Combined with 
higher heights aloft, temperatures will be slightly warmer 
tomorrow; topping out in the lower 60s across the valley and the 
mid to upper 50s elsewhere.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)... 
Thursday night into Friday...an upper ridge will quickly build in
and then shift east of the area with temperatures slowly 
moderating. With dry air in place and warming 
temperatures...Friday should be mostly sunny with highs mid 60s to
mid 70s. Models in good agreement with the main system of the 
extended moving in for the end of the week. A cold front will 
track across the region quickly Friday night into Saturday with a 
band of showers spreading in from west to east. The air mass is 
stable and do not anticipate thunderstorm development. Cooler air 
moving in behind the front will drop temperatures enough that 
higher elevations may see a transition of rain to light snow or 
flurries. Behind the fast moving cold front...a deep upper trough 
will drop in and this will bring in limited low level moisture and
weak lift. As a result...may see showers linger over the 
northeastern half of the area Sunday and Sunday night. With the 
cooler air in place...expect a mix of rain and snow Sunday night. 
However..with the limit moisture...should see little to no 
accumulations. Will be between systems Monday and Tuesday. Model 
consistency degrades by the end of the period and confidence 
becomes quite poor...but models trending towards bringing the next
system in around the Wednesday time frame.

343 AM EDT Wed Oct 25 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Below normal temps again for 
today and tonight as we remain well entrenched in the longwave 
trough. Highs today will range from the upper 40s to the mid to 
upper 50s. These highs are 15 degrees below normal. Clouds around 
this morning with perhaps a peek of sunshine this afternoon before 
another shortwave drops down into the longwave trough. Because of 
this, clouds move back in and will have slight chance POPs in for 
NETN, SWVA, and our eastern mountain zones. Any showers that do 
develop will be very light. 

These POPs carry over into the first half of the tonight period as a 
strong 300 mb jet moves into the area. Additionally, northwest flow 
will help promote further lift across the high terrain and squeeze 
out a few light showers. Moisture quickly exits after midnight and a 
dry forecast for the rest of the night. Before exiting, there could 
be a flurry or two across areas that dip below freezing. The 
shortwave rolling through will help to maintain the cold airmass in 
place. With clearing clouds late tonight expect another cold one 
across the forecast area with lows ranging from freezing to the mid 
to upper 30s. These lows are around 8 degrees below normal. Have 
issued a freeze warning for the eastern mountain zones for tonight 
and a frost advisory for NETN, SWVA, as well as the northern plateau 
and extreme northern TN valley.


.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...Thursday morning will start off cold with temperatures in the 30s as 
a negatively tilted trough moves across the Mid-Atlantic. This 
trough will race quickly to the northeast as a shortwave ridge 
builds in later in the day on Thursday. Higher heights aloft and an 
ample supply of sunshine will warm temperatures into 60s across most 
valley locations on Thursday. The ridge will pass quickly to the east 
late Thursday into early Friday morning as a closed low dives out of 
the Northern Plains into the Mid-MIssissippi River Valley. Southerly 
flow will develop ahead of the system early Friday with PW values 
beginning to creep up. A cold front will quickly race into the 
Tennesse Valley by Saturday morning with widespread showers forecast 
throughout the day. With the limited time for return flow, do not 
expect there will be any thunderstorms with little to no instability 
present. The models are all in fairly good agreement with the 
frontal passage occurring on Saturday, so have increase PoPs into 
the 80-90 range for this timeframe. 

Drier air will begin to move in late Saturday night and into Sunday 
as the front races to the east. The main upper level trough will 
swing across the area on Sunday. The models differ some on the 
amount of wrap around precipitation across the area as the main 
trough swings through. The GFS is a bit more aggressive with strong 
cyclogenesis along the Carolina coast. The ECMWF is a bit weaker but 
still shows a decent low developing along the Carolina coast. Due to 
this, have continued with chances for wrap around precipitation on 
Sunday with best chances across southwest Virginia into northeast 
Tennessee. With this lingering moisture, the question is will there 
be enough moisture left for snow as the cold air moves in. For now, 
have mentioned some snow showers late Sunday into early Monday as 
the moisture begins to depart to the east. 

Dry conditions are forecast to start the work week as the system 
departs to the east and zonal flow aloft develops across the 
Southeastern U.S. Temperatures should be near seasonal average to 
start the new work week.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...A few patches of light rain
or sprinkles will be possible tonight as weak lift and minimal low
level moisture rotate in around as an upper trough over the
region. This pattern will continue the cool advection and allow
temperatures tonight to fall into the 30s to around 40. A few
higher elevations of the east TN mountains should see temperatures
fall to around the freezing mark and a Freezing Warning will be in
effect for these areas. Where temperatures fall into the low
30s...a few flurries will be possible. The potential for frost is
limited due to expected cloud cover and light winds.  However... 
some areas of frost are expected and a Frost Advisory will also 
be in effect. The cool air will continue to advect in on Wednesday
and temperatures will only be able to climb into the 50s across 
most valley locations and only into the 40s at some higher 
elevations. A weak disturbance riding through the upper flow will 
track through the Southern Appalachian Region late Wednesday. 
This may generate a few areas of light rain or sprinkles across 
northern areas and eastern mountains during the late afternoon. 
Amounts should be very light...generally a trace to a hundredth or
two.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...Models are in 
better acquirement today that a midlevel temperature minimum and 
vort max will be crossing our area Wednesday evening. SREF 
probabilities are low and available moisture looks limited, but 
there should be enough for a slight chance of measurable QPF. 
Cold advection at the time of best moisture depth suggests a 
change to snow showers above 3000 ft before dry air aloft ends 
precip chances around 06Z. Clearing skies and slackening winds 
late in the night will drop lows into the 30s, with a hard freeze 
possible in the mountains and widespread frost in the Valley. 
Rather than issuing a watch this far out, it will be mentioned in
the NPW product for tonight's frost/freeze threat.

Thursday and Friday will be clear with a warming trend as a ridge 
builds in behind the departing longwave trough. It will be short-
lived however, as a deep closed low drops into the upper Midwest and 
Great Lakes region over the weekend. Timing of the associated cold 
front and precip with it is shown by the models to affect our area 
between midnight Friday night and Saturday afternoon. We could 
see similar impacts to the last frontal passage yesterday, with 
locally heavy rain and strong winds in the higher elevations 
during that time. The upper trough passage occurs Sunday afternoon
and night, and with very cold temps aloft, it could bring a 
potential for snow showers to the northern half of the area. 

A more zonal flow develops across the eastern Conus for Tuesday and 
Wednesday, with a high pressure system near the Gulf Coast. This 
should provide dry conditions and temps closer to normal both days.

bands of low to mid level clouds through the area this TAF period. 
Moisture is limited...so while a stray sprinkle is possible...this 
activity should be very limited and not expected to affect TAF 
sites. With the cloud cover and some light winds overnight...expect 
fog development to be limited and will not mention in TAFs at this 
time. As for winds...they will remain breezy and gusty through the 
rest of the afternoon...then becoming light after sunset and should 
generally be less than 10 KTs Wednesday morning through 18Z.

.DISCUSSION...An upper low to our north will continue to pull in 
cooler air and bands of low and mid level clouds.  Cloud cover will 
be generally SCT south near CHA with occasional mostly cloudy 
conditions north of TYS.  Moisture is limited...so while a stray 
light shower or patch of sprinkles is possible...this activity 
should be very limited and mainly confined to northwest VA and the 
eastern mountains.  With the cool advection...temperatures will 
struggle to climb and should only reach into the lower 60s across 
most valley locations.  Winds will be breezy and gusty through the 
afternoon...and slowly decrease towards sunset.  Will update the 
current forecast package for minor tweaks to precip and to remove 
some morning/afternoon wording.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Time to break out the winter 
coats and hats as a reinforcing shot of cold air moves into our area 
via a secondary cold front. This front is associated with a closed 
upper low and strong vortmax divign down into the existing longwave 
trough and will help to amplify it even greater. There will be 
minimal moisture with this front so only slight chance POPs for 
showers up across NETN and SWVA for the first half of the day. After 
that, will have in slight chance POPs across the eastern mountains 
for the afternoon and overnight hours. Any precip that occurs will 
be very light, only expecting trace amounts up to a hundredth of an 
inch or two. 

Greater cloud coverage across northern areas compared to the 
southern valley for today. Winds will be gusty this afternoon due to 
the tight pressure gradient, winds will gust up to 25mph at times. 
Temps will only reach into the lower 60s, which is around 5 to 8 
degrees below normal. Temps fall into the mid to upper 30s for most 
areas tonight. Clouds and light winds should keep temps above 
freezing but it is possible a few isolated locations, especially 
across the high terrain, could reach freezing. Due to winds and 
clouds am skeptical that any frost develops but isolated patchy 
frost possible in sheltered valley locations that see calmer winds. 
Lows will 5 to 8 degrees below normal. With the falling temps late 
tonight the highest peaks across the eastern mountains may see a 
flurry or two if enough moisture can be squeezed out. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...The longwave trough axis 
will be to the east of the Appalachians to start the long-term 
forecast. Northwesterly flow aloft and in the low levels will 
continue to advect in colder air into the region. Wednesday will 
see highs only topping out in the 50s across the valley and 40s in
the mountains. Late Wednesday night into early Thursday morning a
shortwave trough will rotate around the western periphery of the 
departing longwave trough. This shortwave will five across the 
Western Great Lakes into the OHio River Valley and Central 
Appalachians. PW values will be in the 0.4-0.6 inch range around 
the 10th-25th percentile for late October. However, models do 
indicate enough lift for a few sprinkles mixed with some light 
snow across southwest Virginia and the higher elevations along the
Tennessee and North Carolina line. Due to the limited moisture, 
not expecting any impacts. The main impact Wednesday night into 
Thursday morning will be the widespread frost with light winds and
temperatures dropping down into the 30s. Based on current 
guidance, a freeze will be possible as well across portions of 
southwest Virginia and northeast Tennessee. 

A shortwave ridge will move across the area on Thursday. 
Temperatures will moderate some with higher heights across the 
region. Forecast highs for Thursday are in the upper 50s to upper 
60s. 

The pattern will become amplified on Friday as a trough dives 
southeast out of the Northern Plains into the Mid-Mississippi River 
Valley as a second shortwave to the south dives across the Mountain 
West into the Southern Plains. Even though it is still several days 
away, the GFS and ECMWF are both in fairly good agreement with the 
overall pattern and timing for the weekend. At the surface, a cold 
front will race across the Plains into the Mid and Lower Mississippi 
River Valley on Friday. Southwesterly flow will develop across the 
Gulf Coast into the Ohio River Valley with moisture advecting in 
ahead of the approaching system. The cold front will move across the 
area on Saturday with widespread showers along the boundary. Models 
are not forecasting much in the way on instability and have not 
included any thunderstorms at this time. Post-frontal precipitation 
will continue Saturday night into Sunday as a strong jet develops 
across the Southern U.S. The 120-140 kt jet will put the forecast 
area in the left exit region with continued synoptic support for 
lift and precipitation. With this lift persisting behind the front 
and cold air advecting in, the question becomes will there be any 
wintry precipitation. For now, have included a mix of rain and snow 
in the forecast for northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia 
Sunday night into Monday. This is still several days away and do not 
expect any impacts.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...The widespread rainfall over
the northeastern third of the area will slowly diminish during the
rest of the afternoon and evening. Overnight...a few showers will
linger as a cold front moves through. Winds have decreased this
afternoon and the Wind advisory has been allowed to expire... 
however higher elevations may continue to see a few gusts to 30 
mph into the early evening. The winds will continue to weaken 
through the night. The front should exit the area tonight with dry
and cooler air moving in. Lows are expected to fall into the 40s 
across most locations. An upper low will then rotate in clouds and
a few isolated showers...mainly over northern locations...on 
Tuesday...however...most of the area will be dry and partly 
cloudy with highs in the low to mid 60s across lower elevations 
and 50s in higher terrain. Winds may become a bit breezy in the 
afternoon but should stay below advisory criteria.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Moday)...A longwave trough will
be over the Eastern Conus to start the period, supplying much 
cooler conditions to the area than we have seen in some time. Some
mountains locations could see temps close to freezing Tuesday 
night, but there will likely be cloud cover and winds under the 
upper trough to help prevent a widespread freeze. With the upper 
trough axis to our east on Wednesday, highs will only reach the 
50s in the Valley. 

Decreasing clouds and diminishing winds should result in a greater 
frost/freeze potential for Wednesday night, and the need for a 
freeze watch will need to be monitored by later shifts. For now will 
continue to mention just frost with lows in the mid to upper 30s in 
most spots, and lower 30s in the mountains. Another noteworthy item 
Wednesday night is the NAM's depiction of a secondary vort max that 
drops SE on the back of the larger trough, which squeezes some low 
QPF out in SW VA in the form of snow. However, no other model 
supports this right now, with SREF snow probabilities around 5% or 
less, so will maintain a dry Wednesday night.

A surface-to-midlevel ridge builds across the region for Thursday, 
providing dry weather and a slight warming trend through Friday, but 
another deep trough drops into the Plains and Midwest over the 
weekend. Precip ahead of a cold front may enter our area as early as 
Friday night, with the GFS and ECMWF pointing toward Saturday for 
the timing of highest rain chances and frontal passage. With the 
models depicting a deep, longwave trough over the region, another 
surge of below normal temperatures will follow for Sunday and 
Monday, with a widespread freeze potential Sunday night.

.AVIATION...A surface low will pull a cold front across the Great
Valley today producing a broad area of light to occasionally 
moderate rain. Ceilings may not hang around too long in an mvfr or
ifr category around cha, but visibility would likely be limited to
mvfr flight weather in rain and fog at each terminal. Of course,
it will take a few hours for the worst conditions to impact tri
while cha will suffer the impacts this morning with improving
weather behind the cold front toward mid day into the afternoon.
The front is closing in on the Cumberland Plateau at the beginning
of the forecast period and should be clear of tri by 22-24z. Not
sure how much of a strato cu ceiling will hang around late in the
day into the overnight period. Went with a slightly drier low
level setup for the overnight hours, but this may change. Perhaps
tri would see some light to possibly high range mvfr reduction in
visibility in fog around 07z and later.

415 AM EDT Mon Oct 23 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A deepening upper level low will
swing rapidly northeast from the Mid Mississippi and Ohio Valley
region today on its way through the Eastern Great Lakes by the end
of the short term period. A strong southerly flow ahead of the low
is pulling a broad swath of moist air out of the Gulf of Mexico
and this moisture is being lifted ahead of the upper trough and
surface cold front. Therefore, categorical pops were used for
showers today and there may be just enough instability for a
thunderstorm across the southern third of the forecast area.
Slightly drier air will flow into the region behind the cold front
from west to east through the day allowing the more persistent
rain to become a little lighter and more scattered in nature. The
chance for showers will continue tonight ahead of a reinforcing
cold front building southeast through the strong cyclonic flow 
present within the Eastern U.S. mean trough. Much drier air behind
this front should bring an end to the light precipitation across
most of the forecast area by daybreak Tuesday. High temperatures
will be tricky today due to the fact that the lowest readings
around sunrise are elevated in the strong southerly flow regime
but cold air advection will be filling in behind the initial front
relatively quickly today. Tonight's lows will drop into the middle
and upper 40s. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...The cold front and lead 
shortwave trough will be to the east of the area to start the 
long-term forecast. A highly amplified pattern will being to take 
shape on Tuesday as another trough dives out of the Mid-
Mississippi River Valley into the Tennessee River Valley. The 
atmosphere will be dry behind the front with PW values ranging 
from around 0.4-0.6 inches, which is around the 10th-25th 
percentile for late October. Overall, there is sufficient lift for
precipitation but the lack of moisture will really limit any 
showers to the higher elevations with dry conditions elsewhere. 
Cold air advection will drop high temperatures into the upper 50s 
to mid 60s across most valley locations on Tuesday. Cold air 
advection Tuesday night into Wednesday morning will drop overnight
lows into the mid 30s to low 40s. Expect the pressure gradient 
will remain elevated enough for some light winds overnight Tuesday
night and should prevent any widespread frost from forming. 
However, there could be some patchy frost in the sheltered valley 
areas Wednesday morning, especially for Northeast Tennessee and 
Southwest Virginia. 

The trough axis will shift to the east on Wednesday with 
northwesterly flow aloft. Wednesday will be the coldest day of the 
forecast period with highs only making it into the 50s across most 
valley locations. By Wednesday night, surface high pressure builds 
into the region. Ideal radiational cooling conditions will setup 
Wednesday night into Thursday morning with lows in the 30s. Due to 
this, expect a widespread frost on Thursday morning. For now, will 
mention this in the HWO. A shortwave ridge moves in on Thursday with 
dry conditions and moderating temperatures. 

The GFS and ECMWF are both in good agreement with a highly amplified 
pattern again over the weekend with a deep trough across the Eastern 
CONUS. The models differ slightly on the timing of the system but 
both suggest that the weekend will be cool and wet. For now, have 30-
50 PoPs throughout much of the weekend with below normal 
temperatures.

.DISCUSSION...Strong upper storm system will continue move toward
the Tennessee valley and southern Appalachians late tonight and 
Monday. Strong upper level jet of 90+ kts will move north across 
the Tennessee/Ohio valleys placing the southern Appalachians under
the favored right entrance region of the jet. 

Latest satellite and radar already showing convection expanding
and strengthening over west Tennessee and northwest Alabama. Meso
analysis shows pressure falls across much of Tennessee due to the
synoptic lift with this system.

The direct circulation around this jet will strengthen the 
fronto-genetic band that moves through Monday morning/early 
afternoon. The dynamic forcing is quite strong. Even though 
instability will be limited, enough forcing to produce widespread 
showers and chance of storms, south of interstate 40.

The strength of the direct circulation around this jet will also
produce a strong low-level jet with 850mb winds increasing to
60-65kts. Even though instability is lacking, concerned that some
convection may produce strong gusty winds.

Also, the strong boundary jet and favorable thermal profile for
damaging mountain wave high winds over the higher terrain and
adjacent foothills. Will maintain High Wind Warning.

.AVIATION...Flight conditions will deteriorate through Monday 
morning as a strong upper storm system moves across the Tennessee 
valley. Widespread showers (thunderstorms possible at CHA/TYS) moves 
into the area mainly between 09-16Z. MVFR flight conditions are 
expected at CHA/TYS and possible at TRI with brief periods of IFR 
with heaver showers and storms.

Besides the convection, strong gusty winds are possible with the 
stronger showers/storms with the potential of LLWS at all sites.

Improving flight conditions are expected after system moves east 
Monday afternoon.

.DISCUSSION...Strong upper storm system will move across the
Tennessee valley and southern Appalachians late tonight and
Monday. A 300mb jet of 90+ kts will move north across the
Tennessee/Ohio valleys placing the southern Appalachians under the
favored right entrance region of the jet. The direct circulation
around this jet will strengthen the fronto-genetic band that moves
through Monday morning/early afternoon. The dynamic forcing is
quite strong. Even though instability will be limited, enough
forcing to produce widespread showers and chance of storms.

The strength of the direct circulation around this jet will also
produce a strong low-level jet with 850mb winds increasing to
60-65kts. Even though instability is lacking, concerned that some
convection may produce strong gusty winds.

Also, the strong boundary jet and favorable thermal profile for
damaging mountain wave high winds over the higher terrain and
adjacent foothills. Have issued a high wind warning over much of
the far eastern Tennessee mountains.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...An upper/mid level trough will 
dig into the plains and cut off over the Mississippi Valley before 
lifting northeast.  A wave of surface low pressure will ride north 
northeast along an approaching cold front, with the cold front 
pushing into our area very late tonight and should exit Monday early 
afternoon. Convective energy looks very limited at best, so no 
thunder in the forecast for now.  However, should see rain all areas 
with this system. Southeasterly low level jet will strengthen 
overnight, and while conditions do not look ideal there is at least 
some potential for mountain wave enhancement of the winds in the 
usual higher elevation/foothills areas of the East TN mountains. 
Will issue a wind advisory for the TN higher elevation zones from 
Monroe north for tonight/Monday morning.  Rain should be diminishing 
from southwest to northeast Monday late morning/afternoon. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...The shortwave trough at 
the start of this period will generally be east of the forecast 
area. Have allowed for some variance/slower motion to the precip 
field that follows in the wake of the front/trough. A deeper trough 
will dig in quickly behind the exiting shortwave by Tuesday morning. 
This will bring another reinforcing shot of cool air across the area 
through Wednesday. Wednesday will be the coolest day this week with 
daytime temperatures in the 40s and 50s! Models diverge on how much 
moisture remains particularly over southwest VA and northeast TN 
Tuesday into Wednesday. Slight chance of PoPs is reasonable for 
these areas and timeframe. 

By Friday night another deep trough and associated cold front will 
edge closer to the forecast area. Southerly flow will bring 
increasing moisture and warm temperatures back to the region. As a 
result, rain chances will begin increasing Friday night through the 
weekend and temperatures will drop to below normal.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate 
an upper level ridge stretching N-S along the eastern seaboard 
with a trough across the Central and Southern Plains. Not seeing 
as much fog early this morning with cloud cover increasing ahead 
of the system back to the west. PW values are still fairly low 
across the area with values ranging from around 0.4-0.6 inches, 
which is around the 10th-25th percentile for late October. Today 
will be a transition day across the region as moisture advection 
increases with low to midlevel southerly flow as the shortwave 
trough moves into the Mississippi River Valley. Temperatures will
be above normal again today as warm air advects into the region 
with highs ranging from the mid to upper 70s across most valley 
locations. Model soundings indicate that the atmosphere will 
saturate from the top-down tonight with best chances for showers 
coming after midnight. PW values will eventually increase into the
1.4-1.6 inch range by early Monday morning. Therefore, expect 
widespread showers early Monday morning. Not seeing much in the 
way of instability overnight with lapse rates near moist adiabatic
and have not included any thunder chances in the forecast for 
now. Overnight lows will be above normal with temperatures ranging
from the upper 50s to mid 60s. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...

A healthy short wave trough will swing northeast out of the Deep 
South, lifting a broad pattern of showers and even a thunderstorm 
or two across southern parts of the forecast area on Monday. The 
precipitation will taper off from southwest to northeast later 
Monday into Monday night however, an amplifying long wave trough 
will be dropping southeast out of the Western Great Lakes across 
the Southern Appalachians bringing more unsettled weather to the 
region. Deep moisture wrapped up in the circulation of the trough 
will be lifted in association with a short wave rotating through 
the base of the main upper level feature. Therefore, chance 
probabilities for a few light showers will remain in the forecast 
on Tuesday. Yet another, weak upper wave will trail behind 
Tuesday's system bringing a slight chance for a couple more 
showers across northern sections of the forecast area on 
Wednesday. The unsettled regime finally ends on Thursday as higher
pressure fills in behind the departing amplified Eastern U.S. 
trough. We may be able to squeeze out a dry period of weather 
which lasts all the way through Friday night while awaiting the 
arrival of the next mid latitude cyclone and associated pattern of
showers and possible thunderstorms on Saturday. Temperatures will
be much closer to normal for late October during the work week 
with the coolest day being Wednesday with highs only reaching the 
lower to middle 50s. A gradual warming trend will occur Thursday 
into the weekend as winds become southerly ahead of the weekend 
frontal system.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)..The high pressure at the 
surface and aloft over the region will be shifting east during the 
period, with moisture starting to increase ahead of the next system. 
Still mainly just varying amounts of high clouds except later in the 
period when some more significant clouds will start moving into 
south/southwest areas.  Will include some patchy fog again late 
tonight mainly near bodies of water as has been the case these past 
few nights.  Will make minor tweaks to MAV temps, mainly to lower 
most min temps for tonight.  .

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...At the start of the 
period the deep trough axis will be located generally over Missouri 
and Arkansas with the associated cold front approaching Middle 
Tennessee. The motion of the front will be slowly eastward as will 
the precipitation along the boundary. The southeasterly flow off the 
Appalachians will likely produce a rain shadow across much of 
northeast TN Sunday night whereas the southern TN Valley will have 
the best chance of measurable precipitation before sunrise Monday 
morning. However, shortly after sunrise expect showers to overspread 
the entire forecast area Monday. 

Model solutions today seem rather progressive in moving the 
precipitation out of the region fairly quickly (by late Monday 
night). The kicker system replaces this shortwave by Tuesday 
afternoon and will bring some much cooler air into the forecast 
area. If you thought it was warm for this time of year, you may miss 
those warmer days by Wednesday where the high temperatures will only 
be in the 40s and 50s! Any precipitation associated with this 
stronger trough could produce some snowflakes in the highest 
elevations while most lower elevations will experience liquid 
droplets Tuesday night and Wednesday night. 

Dry conditions prevail with gradual warming through the remainder of 
the week as the next storm system ramps up back to the west. Another 
frontal boundary will produce increasing chances for rain as early 
as Friday night through Sunday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Seeing high clouds stream into the area with the ridge axis now to 
the east of the area. There is some patchy fog currently across the 
area and any ongoing fog should quickly dissipate after sunrise. The 
higher heights aloft associated with the ridge will keep 
temperatures well above normal today. Expect highs will be similar 
to yesterday with values ranging from the mid to upper 70s across 
most valley locations. PW values throughout the short-term period 
will range from 0.2-0.4 inches, which is near the minimal values 
observed for mid to late October. A milder night is forecast for 
tonight as southwesterly winds throughout the atmosphere finally 
begins to advect in warmer temperatures and higher dewpoints into 
the region. Overnight lows will range from the mid 40s to mid 50s.


.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...

The period starts out dry with a fair amount of sunshine to 
complete a fine weekend, but conditions deteriorate Sunday night 
into Monday as a rather strong short wave and associated surface 
cyclone press east across the Southeastern quarter of the nation.
The healthy low pressure center should be able to pull a deep 
layer of Gulf moisture ahead of the trough for the production of 
widespread showers and even a couple thunderstorms Monday into 
Monday night. Another, upper trough will be amplifying into the 
Eastern U.S. Monday night into Tuesday with more showers being 
lifted in advance of a significant cold front which will be 
moving so fast that it will be east of the Southern Appalachians 
early on Tuesday. However, the deep trough will have several 
shorter wavelength enhancers dropping south through its base all 
the way into Wednesday night. Therefore, kept a chance for some 
showers going through mid week. The coldest air of the season will
be spilling south into the Southern Appalachians during the 
period and some of the precipitation that falls in the highest 
elevations across Southwest Virginia and along the North Carolina 
and Tennessee border may fall in the form of light snow showers. 
Finally drier air and higher pressure brings an end to the precip 
on Thursday and the dry period should last through Friday. 
Although another upper trough and cold front will be on the 
approach. This system will be arrive in the region early in the 
weekend.

upper ridge moves off the southeast U.S. coast. Meanwhile, a deep 
long wave trough and associated cold front will move across the 
Midwest. So, expect dry conditions across the forecast area with 
prefrontal warming bringing temperatures on Sunday 5 to 10 degrees 
above normal.  

The high amplitude trough will slow forward/eastward progress of the 
entire system. Showers and thunderstorms will remain over West 
Tennessee for much of Sunday and early Sunday night. Eventually, a 
closed upper low forms over northern Mississippi early Monday 
morning. This is where the forecast gets difficult due to location 
and evolution of this closed low. Current model progs are having a 
tough time not just with timing but also location. Should the low 
dive into central Alabama the highest QPF will occur over the 
southern TN Valley. Downsloping winds from the east/southeasterly 
wind component would limit heavy rainfall over northeast TN...say 
from Knoxville east along and north of I-40 and the I-81 corridor. 

This upper low is kicked out rather quickly with another following 
in its wake by Monday night. This will bring significantly colder 
air to the region on Wednesday into Thursday. In fact, some higher 
elevations could see snow, perhaps mixed with rain, across northern 
parts of Tennessee, mountains of southwest Virginia and the 
Appalachians. Precipitation chances diminish by Wednesday night. The 
remainder of the week will be below normal with another trough 
expected to produce more precipitation by early next weekend.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Clear skies, light winds and surface high pressure have lead to some 
patchy fog across the area this morning. Expect any ongoing fog will 
quickly dissipate after sunrise with mostly sunny skies forecast for 
today. Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis 
indicate a ridge extending from the Gulf Coast into the Northern 
Plains with drier along this axis. Upper level heights will continue 
to increase today as the ridge axis moves overhead. Temperatures 
will range from around 5-10 degrees above normal with 500 dm heights 
in the 588-590 dm range. High temperatures are forecast to be in the 
mid to upper 70s across most valley locations. The ridge axis will 
pass to the east tonight with overnight temperatures around 5-10 
degrees warmer than last night with forecast lows in the mid 40s to 
low 50s. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...

Protective ridging holds on through most of the weekend keeping 
skies mostly sunny with little chance for rain. However, a 
relatively strong short wave trough will drive northeast out of 
the Lower Mississippi Valley across the Mid South generating 
showers and some thunderstorms over the Southern Appalachian 
Region later Sunday night into Monday night. There won't be much 
of a break behind this feature as more short wave energy dives 
southeast out of the Northern Plains and Western Great Lakes for 
arrival in the forecast area on Tuesday, generating a decent 
chance for more showers through Tuesday night. Additionally, there
will be a final, weaker upper level feature moving through the 
base of a deep long wave trough over the eastern states that will 
have just enough moisture for the possibility of some light rain 
on Wednesday. Drier air on the back side of this departing trough 
may allow for a dry Thursday at the tail end of the extended. The 
weekend will be pleasant with above normal warmth but temperatures
will be gradually dropping back to normal early in the work week 
under a shield of rain producing clouds. And by Wednesday and 
Thursday readings will be several degrees below normal as chilly 
Canadian air spills southward into the Eastern U.S.

Upper and surface ridging remains over the area with clear sky and
calm winds tonight. Decreasing dewpoint depressions and steam from
area lakes and streams will produce local fog near waterways. Some
of the fog will be locally dense.

The calm winds have allowed temperatures to drop quickly this

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...A mostly persistence 
forecast as surface high pressure will remain over the region 
along with a building upper/midlevel ridge. The atmosphere will 
remain quite dry. Temperatures running slightly higher today than 
yesterday, so the gradual warming trend is continuing. Some patchy
fog can be expected late tonight especially near bodies of water.
Tomorrow will feature plenty of sunshine and temperatures a bit 
higher than today. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...We begin the period 
with ridging in place and surface high pressure centered just off to 
our southeast. This area of high pressure begins to move farther 
east on Saturday in response to a long wave trough digging down 
across the Central Plains. With the high moving east, we will see a 
return flow from the Gulf, which will help to slowly raise dewpoints 
during the day. Saturday night into Sunday southerly flow continues 
to strengthen as the trough draws closer. Models have slowed a bit 
with the onset of precip out ahead of the cold front so it looks 
like Sunday just be dry for a good portion of the day. By Sunday 
night/Monday POPs really begin to ramp up as an area of low pressure 
has become cutoff from the northern jet stream. On Monday the models 
still show the closed low off to our southwest, pumping in quite a 
bit of moisture out of the Gulf and into our area. Because of this, 
we will see chances for thunderstorms along with our rain chances on 
Monday due to the climbing dewpoints and instability. Dewpoints in 
the afternoon hours will have climbed into the lower 60s with 
soundings showing PW values around 1.5 inches, which will be 
approaching max values for this time of year. Will taper off thunder 
after midnight to just showers.

Monday night into Tuesday a secondary and more robust trough dives 
down into our area from out of Canada. This stronger trough and 
associated front will pick up the closed low to our south a quickly 
usher it off to the northeast by Tuesday afternoon. This second 
front moves into the area late Tuesday afternoon/Tuesday night and 
brings much colder air into the area. This will be the coldest air 
of the season thus far. Highs on Wednesday will be in the mid to 
upper 50s, which is around 10 to 15 degrees below normal. Lows on 
Wednesday night will range from the lower to mid 30s across NETN and 
SWVA and from the mid to upper 30s across the central and southern 
valley, which is around 10 degrees below normal.  The models hint at 
some moisture and lift with this system as it comes through--have 
minimal precip chances late in the forecast for a few area north and 
in the mountains. The air may be cold enough in these areas to see a 
few snow flakes--will see how cold things look as it approaches.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Saturday night)...
Tranquil weather will continue across the area for this period as
a large high pressure ridge will maintain its position over the
Southern Appalachian region. Some cirrus with a shortwave trough
will cross the area today, but it should have little impact on the
sensible weather. The warming trend of the past few days will 
continue today and tomorrow, with highs today in the mid 70s, then
upper 70s on Friday and Saturday. Clouds will be increasing on
Saturday and Saturday night as the ridge axis shifts toward the
Atlantic coast and a trough deepens across the Plains. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Wednesday)... 
Model forecasts for this period have some timing, positioning, 
and strength issues but it appears that we squeeze out one final 
day of basically dry weather on Sunday as an upper trough deepens 
into an upper low over the Lower Mississippi Valley later Sunday 
into Monday. Showers and some thunderstorms will start to build 
into the Southern Appalachian region during this period, and will 
become likely Monday into Monday night. The showers will taper off
a bit behind the a cold front associated with the upper trough. 
However, more jet stream energy will be diving south out of Canada
allowing for the amplification of a deepening long wave trough 
over the Eastern states. Therefore, a medium to high chance for 
showers will continue Tuesday into Wednesday as sufficient 
moisture and lift accompanies this slow moving trough. Very chilly
air will build south into the forecast area at mid week. 
Temperatures will be about five to ten degrees below normal on 
Wednesday and there may even be a few snow flurries in the highest
elevations along the North Carolina border Wednesday night.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...Surface high pressure will 
remain over the region as an upper ridge builds in during the short 
term period.  The atmosphere will remain quite dry.  Dewpoints/temps 
running higher today than yesterday, so should be slightly warmer 
tonight with less chance for any patchy frost.  Some patchy fog can 
be expected late tonight especially near bodies of water.  Tomorrow 
will feature plenty of sunshine and temperatures a bit higher than 
today. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...A quiet start to the 
long term, but hold on to your hats because there's some cold air 
headed back our way toward the end of the period. Riding is in place 
from Thursday night through Saturday night. During this period, 
expect clear to mostly clear skies along with calm conditions. Temps 
on Thursday night still a few degrees below normal as the airmass 
continues to modify. Temps will be in the low to mid 40s. On Friday 
we see temps continuing to slowly climb with highs in the mid to 
upper 70s. Friday night near normal temps in the mid to upper 40s. 
Saturday temps remain in the mid to upper 70s. 

On Saturday the ridge begins to amplify in response to an upper level 
trough digging down across the Central Plains. The low pressure 
center associated with this trough is well into Canada but the cold 
front sweeps down all the way into Texas! As of now though, Saturday 
looks to remain dry with pleasant conditions. Saturday night 
southerly flow begins to ramp up as the front draws closer. The 
actual precip doesn't move in until later on Sunday and perhaps even 
holding off until Sunday night. Will have POPs slowly increasing 
through the day on Sunday from west to east. The best chance for 
POPs come on Monday. By this time, a closed off low has developed 
just to our west-southwest as the northern jet has separated itself 
from this system. The closed-off low rotates just to our south 
Monday night into Tuesday, which will therefore continue higher POP 
chances. We could also hear a few rumbles of thunder as we may have 
a storm or two across the area. On Tuesday we see another surge of 
cold air coming down out of Canada and into the Plains. This 
secondary trough will quickly catch up to the closed low and help 
move it along and out of our area by Tuesday afternoon. With this 
trough though comes the coldest air of the fall season. High 
temperatures on Wednesday, after the secondary frontal passage, will 
only be in the mid to upper 50s. These values are 10 to 15 degrees 
below normal. The lows Wednesday night will range from the mid to 
upper 30s with some areas dipping below the freezing mark. With the 
secondary trough and front moisture looks limited for our area and 
mainly stays north. However, wouldn't be surprised to see a few 
snowflakes squeezed out across the higher elevations at some point 
as we see a NW flow pattern set up.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Friday night)...
So far this morning, dewpoints have been holding in the upper 30s
to mid 40s across the area, making it unlikely that widespread
frost will form before sunrise. Therefore, the SPS for frost will
not be continued. Some cirrus is spreading across the area
associated with an upper level shortwave trough, but it will have
little impact on today's weather, with sunny skies and high temps
in the lower 70s. An increasingly amplified ridge will build over
the Southeast through the rest of the period, providing a warming
trend each day and clear skies. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Monday)... 
Amplification of the upper pattern keeps a nice, warm reminder of
the great Summer season around this weekend with an increasing 
southerly flow between a protective Eastern U.S. upper trough and 
a slowly advancing Western states trough and cold front. A short 
wave feature shifts, in negative tilt fashion, northeast toward 
Hudson Bay in Canada Saturday into Sunday while the southern part 
of the trough slows in response to a developing closed low over 
the Southern Plains. Moistening in the southerly flow regime and 
convergence ahead of the slow moving cold front will lead to the 
development of showers and thunderstorms mainly Sunday night into 
Monday. Another, more amplified upper trough and an associated 
reinforcing shot of colder air will drop southeast out of Central 
Canada later Monday into Tuesday bringing a continued chance of 
showers to the Southern Appalachians. After a mild weekend, high 
temperatures will drop back near normal for mid October in the 
middle and upper 60s.

Sunny and warmer today as high pressure covers most of the
eastern states. Winds are much lighter today and temperatures are
in the mid to upper 60s with dew points in the mid 30s to lower 
40s. Another cold night tonight similar to Monday with the higher 
valleys of northeast Tennessee...southwest North Carolina and 
southwest Virginia again in the mid to upper 30s with frost. Have 
issued another Special Weather Statement for frost. Wednesday 
looks like another similar day to today but more warming with 
highs reaching the upper 60s to lower 70s.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Monday)...
High pressure and clear skies will be present through the work 
week and into the weekend. Low and mid level flow will transition 
from the northwest to out of the south...with temperatures slowly 
warming each day to normal by Saturday. By Sunday...a deep upper 
level ridge will move across the eastern US with a frontal 
boundary moving through this trough. As the front moves through 
the eastern Appalachians...low and mid level flow will be parallel
to the front...allowing for slower movement and a longer time 
period of convection over the area. Models have been slowing down 
the timing of arrival of the showers...with scattered showers and 
thunderstorms expected Sunday late afternoon into the early 
evening...with only showers expected as instability weakens with 
the sunset. Scattered showers are then expected through the day 
Monday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Thursday night)...
Surface high pressure will remain firmly in control across the
region through the period. A mid/upper level shortwave trough
moves across the area Wednesday/Wednesday night, but it should
have little impact other than bringing some thin cirrus. The main
weather story will be chilly overnight temperatures each night,
which may allow for some patchy frost to form in the sheltered 
valleys of SW VA, SW NC, and the TN mountains. Temperatures 
tonight look marginal for any frost, and what does form seems
likely to be patchy and isolated at this time, so no advisory 
will be issued. Like this morning, a SPS may be enough to cover
it, but will let the day shift decide.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Monday)... 
The upper level pattern becomes amplified with an Eastern U.S. 
ridge gradually shifting east followed by a deep upper trough 
which presses through the Mississippi Valley toward the 
Appalachian Spine late in the weekend. The ECMWF and GFS not too 
far apart with the depiction of this next trough, although the GFS
is a bit faster. Also, the models slow the associated cold front 
down somewhat with each model indicating the development of a 
closed low in the base of the trough early on Monday. Stayed with 
the Superblend suggestion of medium chance pops for some showers 
Sunday night into Monday night with the relatively slow moving 
trough. Temperatures in the mild prevailing southwesterly flow 
regime will be a few degrees above normal with highs in the 70s 
and lows rising from the 40s early in the extended period into the
50s through the weekend.

mid 30s to low 40s by daybreak. Currently, winds vary from calm to
around 9 kts at Chattanooga. Places where the winds go calm for

advisory at this point but will continue to monitor temperatures
trends throughout the overnight hours. The current forecast looks
to be in good shape and only made some minor updates to the

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
Higher pressure is building in across the region behind last
nights cold front this afternoon with skies mostly sunny 
southwest and partly cloudy northeast. Temperatures were slow to 
warm into the 50s and 60s from lows in the 40s and 50s this 
morning. Strong north to northeast winds have also added to the 
fall chill in the air this afternoon. Gusts from 20 to 30 miles 
per hour occurred over the southern Tennessee valley earlier 
today. Tonight skies will be mostly clear with winds subsiding
this evening but will stay up enough that temperatures will fall
slowly to the upper 30s to lower 40s. The highest elevations of
the mountains in east Tennessee and southwest Virginia lows will
drop to around freezing and in higher valleys of northeast
Tennessee...southwest Virginia and southwest North Carolina where
winds become light...patchy frost will likely form. The areal
coverage however will not be big enough to issue an advisory.
Tuesday temperatures will be a few degrees warmer as the surface
high shifts east and winds become light northeast. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Sunday)...
High pressure will dominate area weather through much of the 
extended. This will allow for continued dry conditions with mostly
clear skies. Cool air filtering into the area will allow lows 
Tuesday night to fall into the mid 30s to mid 40s range. Locations
where temperatures drop into the mid 30s may see patch frost 
develop early Wednesday morning. By Wednesday afternoon...will see
a warming trend begin with temperatures warming each day. By the 
weekend...expect both highs and lows to average around 5 degrees 
above normal. The next weather system...a weakening cold 
front...will be approaching the area around the Monday time frame.
Confidence low on timing and strength...but will introduce a 
chance of showers.

The surface cold front has moved east of the area, although some
precip will linger behind it until the midlevel trough axis moves
through around 12Z. Morning cloud cover is expected to mix out 
through the day, with clear skies likely by the late afternoon.
Cold advection through the day will hold high temps to more fall-
like levels, in the 60s for the Valley. High pressure will settle
across KY/WV tonight, allowing winds to go calm across the 
northern half. Temps in that area will drop into the upper 30s, 
with some mid 30s in the higher elevations of SW VA and TN 
mountains. Patchy frost will be possible, and the forecast will 
continue to mention that as well as the HWO. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...
Quiet weather will continue through the rest of the 7-day 
forecast with only a few minor talking points worth mentioning. 
Temperatures through the week will gradually warm as the weak 
trough moves out and high pressure builds in behind it. 
Temperatures will begin about 5 degrees below normal and by the 
end of the weekend daytime highs should be about 5-10 degrees 
above normal. Mostly sunny skies and light winds will be what the 
majority of people experience this upcoming week... But the tops 
of the mountains could see some frost the first half of the week 
as temperatures drop into the mid 30's overnight. Widespread 
freezes are not expected at this time and any freezing 
temperatures should be brief and isolated to the tops of the 
mountains. Our next weather system that will eventually overtake 
the sunny skies and pleasant weather will be a cold front/trough 
expected to move through just beyond the end of this forecast.

moisture were mid to upper 60s. A line of showers ahead of the 
front was moving quickly towards the plateau counties. Instability
is lacking so still expecting only a few rumbles of thunder. The
rain should continue through the evening and decrease late
tonight. Behind the front northwest winds will help to bring 
temperatures down into the upper 40s to lower 50s. Strong cold air
advection Monday will keep temperatures down. Will go on cold 
side of guidance with highs in the upper 50s to upper 
60s...actually about 5 degrees below normal for this time of year.


.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Saturday)...
Will be in a quiet weather pattern throughout the extend with 
high pressure building in. This will result in mostly clear skies 
and dry conditions. Cooler air will move in on Monday behind an 
exiting cold front. By Monday night...the cool air in place will 
put overnight lows into the 30s across some higher elevation 
locations and patchy frost will be possible. The rest of the area 
should see lows in the 40s. High temperatures on Tuesday will only
reach into the 60s. The air mass will begin to slowly warm and by
Tuesday night patchy frost should be limited to just a few 
locations. The air mass will continue to moderate through the week
and by the weekend...expect temperatures to be near to slightly 
above normal.

Skies are mostly cloudy late this morning ahead of cold front now
moving into the lower Mississippi Valley and Ohio Valley. Temperatures
are in the upper 60s to lower 70s at this time. Instability still
looks weak so thunderstorm activity should be limited. A few 
sprinkles...light showers were starting to develop across extreme 
southern sections and this activity will increase this afternoon 
ahead of the front. Adjusted highs down slightly in the north as 
clouds have already moved in. Also adjusted dew point
temperatures. Temperatures should warm another 5 to 10 degrees

Ceiling heights across the TN Valley are highly variable, ranging
from LIFR at TRI to VFR at TYS. While uncertainty is high in such
a situation, the general trend through the morning should be
toward rising cigs, into the VFR range at all sites in the late
morning to early afternoon hours. A cold front will be approaching
today, and showers ahead of it will move into the TAF sites
between 23Z and 01Z, with MVFR vis/cigs likely. Low cigs will

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The passage of a cold front will be the highlight of the period,
the first significant frontal passage we have seen in a while. Low
level moisture across the pre-frontal environment will mean fog
and mostly cloudy skies through much of the day, with perhaps a
few scattered to isolated showers into the mid-afternoon. The main
band of showers associated with the front, with possibly a few 
embedded thunderstorms, will enter our Plateau counties in the 
21-23Z time frame. The 850-700 mb trough lags the front slightly,
so showers will continue overnight but diminish after midnight
from west to east as dry air aloft works its way in behind the
midlevel trough axis.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...
After the front moves through we move into a period of quiet and 
pleasant weather across the forecast area. Temperatures at the 
start of the week will max out in the 60's with mostly sunny skies
and light winds. Quasi-zonal flow in the upper levels will 
eventually transition into a ridge of high pressure. This will 
help keep the skies clear and allow temperatures to warm up 
throughout the week. By next weekend high temperatures will reach 
back up into the mid 70's cross most of the area. No chances for 
precipitation are expected through the long term portion of the 
forecast.

Skies have cleared across most of the area, suggesting that fog
will be a possiblity overnight. The uncertainty lies with how much
wind there will be to keep vis from dropping below MVFR. The TAFs
will have MVFR vis at all sites, but lower conditions cannot be
ruled out. A cold front will be approaching from the west today,
and broken clouds will precede the front this afternoon, with rain
likely moving in around 23-02Z. MVFR vis and cigs will accompany

Cloud cover was slow to clear across the region this afternoon.
Highs across the southern sections only reached the mid 70s by mid
afternoon but were near 80 to lower 80s elsewhere. Overnight skies
becoming partly cloudy south to mostly clear north and with high
moisture content some patchy fog to form late. Sunday will start
out partly to mostly cloudy ahead of cold front with showers and a

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The day will begin with quite a bit of cloud cover across the
southern half of the area as high pressure east of the
Appalachians has spread low level moisture into the TN Valley. The
shallow nature of the moisture should mean that it will mix out
during the day, and clouds are expected to become more scattered
in coverage this afternoon. Morning clouds may keep temps a bit
below yesterday's highs, in the lower 80s for most spots. Boundary
layer cooling in the moist air mass may bring a return of low 
clouds and fog again tonight.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...
Sunday will usher in a change in weather patterns as a frontal 
boundary begins to push through the area. Precipitation along this
front will begin to move into the Cumberland Plateau early Sunday
afternoon and should exit the Smoky Mountains sometime early 
Monday morning. Front will move through late enough in the day 
that daytime high temperatures on Sunday should still be able to 
reach around 80 in most of the Valley locations. Forecast model 
soundings show there will be limited instability to work with, but
there should be enough to where some places experience some stray
thunderstorms. 

Behind the front we move into a more tranquil weather pattern with 
cooler temperatures and mostly sunny skies. High temperatures on 
Monday will be in the 60's across much of the area (about 5-10 
degrees below normal for this time of year). High pressure will 
begin to build in behind the front and temperatures will slowly warm 
up through the upcoming work week. Temperatures by the end of the 
work week are expected at or just above normal. But not much to talk 
about weather wise next week, as it should be very pleasant across 
the forecast area.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...High pressure will maintain
its grip one more day, making for a very pleasant start to the 
weekend. Lows Saturday generally hovering around 60 and highs 
around 80. A cold front passing through Sunday will first draw up
increased low level Gulf moisture tonight and Saturday, so the
higher humidity will make it feel even a little bit warmer.

.LONG TERM (Saturday Night through Friday)...High pressure will 
slowly move to the east into the Atlantic as a deep trough and 
associated frontal boundary approach from the MS River Valley. Low
and mid level flow will shift to out of the south and southeast 
around the high pressure moving east...bringing moisture and warm 
air advection to the area. The frontal boundary is expected to 
move through the area late Sunday through Monday morning. The 
timing of models has been slightly slower than previous 
runs...with rain expected to reach the plateau between 2 and 5 
pm...increasing in coverage as the front moves eastward. 
Instabilities are around 1000 to 1500 J/kg through Monday 
evening...and wind shear is weak. PW values are around the 90th 
percentile for climatology for this time of year. With the timing 
of the system during the overnight hours as well...would expect 
scattered thunderstorms possible in the afternoon and early 
evening. Instability will be limited after sunset...with only 
scattered showers expected through the morning. 

The frontal boundary is expected to move east of the Appalachians by 
mid morning Monday...with any light showers in eastern TN 
dissipating by mid day. Flow behind the front will be from the 
northwest...bringing cooler and drier air to the area. Temperatures 
will drop to a few degrees below normal through the beginning of the 
work week. High pressure will set up over the eastern US...with 
mostly clear skies each day. A gradual warming trend will take place 
through the extended...with temperatures near normal by the end of

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The large large mid-to-upper level ridge centered over MS will
remain nearly stationary through the short term, which will
provide a dry northerly flow at and above 700 mb. In the low
levels, the surface to 850 mb ridge located east of the mountains
will provide a southerly flow of moisture off the Atlantic into
GA, with some moisture creeping up into the southern TN Valley
today. Already, satellite shows low clouds spreading into N GA. An
isolated shower may be possible in SW NC and the mountains today
where winds can flow upslope. Otherwise the moisture should only
be realized in the form of cloud cover where lift is lacking. Mild
temps in the lower 80s will continue today.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
We star the weekend with the ridge of high pressure continuing to
dominate the weather pattern. Daytime high temperatures through 
the should remain about 10 degrees above normal with mostly sunny 
skies, light winds, and no chances for rain, but things begin to 
take a turn towards the end of the weekend.. A low pressure system
north of the Great Lakes will drag a cold front across the 
eastern half of the United States bringing with it chances for 
rain and cooler temperatures. Models are begging to narrow down 
the time frame for the frontal passage in our area with the most 
likely time being Sunday afternoon through Monday morning. Front 
will push through relatively quickly and precipitation will be 
tied closely with the actual front so our rain chances stay around
for only about 24 hours. Forecast model soundings are in some 
disagreement with how much instability will be present along this 
front, but it looks like most places will just see rain with maybe
an occasional rumble of thunder. 

The front will be totally east of the area by Monday afternoon and 
pretty dry air will set in behind it. In addition temperatures will 
make a dramatic drop with temperatures on Monday forecasted to be 
about 15 degrees colder than on Sunday. Ridging builds in behind the 
front and traps the drier and cooler air leading to temperatures at 
or just a bit below normal through the end of this 7-day forecast.

Skies are clear and TYS and TRI have already reached near 100 
percent RH, but fog developement is not a certainty tonight due to
winds staying above calm. Will include a mention of MVFR fog at
both locations. Some model guidance shows lower vis developing but
confidence is low in that happening. Broken to scattered VFR
clouds may linger through the day as a southerly flow of moist air
continued in the low levels.

.DISCUSSION...A quiet night in store across the area but a few
updates. Removed slight chance POPs for the rest of the night 
across the eastern mountains as showers look to stay on the 
leeward side of the mountains. Also, did go ahead and introduce 
patchy/areas of fog to the forecast. Elevated dewpoints along 
with calm and clear skies should allow for fog formation later 
tonight. Will send out new zones for POP drop and fog wording.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Saturday)...Elongated H5 ridge 
stretching from the NW Gulf Coast to the NC coast will keep 
generally fair weather in place over the area through the day 
Saturday. With lingering low level moisture, we may see isolated 
showers over the mountains, but little chance of such elsewhere. 
Temperatures will continue to run 10-15 degrees above normal to 
close out the week.

.LONG TERM (Saturday Night through Thursday)... The main focus in
the long-term forecast will be the front expected to move through
the area on Sunday. Models continue to struggle with the timing 
of the front. The GFS is the fastest of all of the models with the
front coming through during the day on Sunday with the Canadian 
and ECMWF being later in the afternoon Sunday into the overnight 
hours. Regardless, not expecting much in the way of precipitation 
along the boundary with weak low level ridging ahead of the 
boundary. PW values ahead of the boundary will increase into the 
1.4-1.5 inch range, which are near the 90th percentile for mid- 
October. Model soundings indicate some weak instability with 
SBCAPE values in the 250-750 J/KG on Sunday afternoon and have 
continued with a slight chance of thunder. Rainfall amounts with 
the boundary will be light with values ranging from a tenth to a 
quarter of an inch on average across the forecast area. 

Noticeably cooler air will advect into the SOuthern Appalachians to 
start the work week with temperatures on Monday around 10-15 
degrees cooler than on Sunday. Highs on Monday will be cooler than 
climatological averages with highs in the 60s across most of the 
valley. Dry conditions are forecast throughout the work week with 
moderating temperatures as an upper level ridge builds in behind the 
departing trough. Highs will climb back up into the low to mid 70s 
by the middle of the week.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Low level clouds have started to creep into the valley early this
morning. Some patchy fog is developing in places that haven't seen
the low level clouds help with insulation overnight. Expect these
clouds to hopefully burn off as the morning moves forward leading
to sunnier skies... But temperatures should be a few degrees
cooler compared to yesterday with slightly cooler air being
funneled in and the early morning sheltering from the low level
clouds.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...Models continue to be in 
decent agreement with the overall pattern with fair run to run 
consistency, and forecast confidence is a bit above average for this 
time of year. We will start the period under the influence of an 
upper level ridge. Low level east/southeasterly flow may bring 
enough moisture into the eastern mountains for some isolated showers 
Friday, but otherwise expect dry conditions for both Friday and 
Saturday.  By Sunday the ridge will be breaking down and a cold 
front will approach.  Model trend has been to speed this front up a 
bit, and right now it looks like it should move through Sunday 
night. Expect some showers and perhaps thunderstorms near and ahead 
of the front. Drier and cooler air will push in behind the front as 
surface high pressure builds in.  This high pressure will control 
our weather Tuesday and Wednesday.

without too much fanfare other than a few cumulus clouds. The
moist low level conditions in the cooling air behind the boundary
should lead to the development of low clouds and some fog late
tonight. Flight weather may deteriorate to ifr and even lower

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...

The cold front is now along the Cumberland Plateau with westerly 
winds being reported in Crossville. Still not seeing much in the 
way of any precipitation along the frontal boundary this afternoon
and evening and expect most locations will remain dry. Current 
water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a 
shortwave trough passing to the north across the Great Lakes 
Region with a ridge along the Northern Gulf Coast. The low level 
dewpoints and PW values are elevated for early October but the 
forcing is lacking. However, could still see a few isolated 
showers with best chances across the higher elevations. Post 
frontal cloud cover has been persistent today behind the boundary 
across Middle and Western TN. Due to this, increased cloud cover 
this evening and during the overnight hours. There could also be 
some patchy fog near sunrise. Overnight lows will still be 
slightly above normal but several degrees cooler than the last 
couple of nights in the 50s generally areawide.

Much drier air will advect into the forecast area on Thursday with 
PW values dropping down into the 0.5-0.7 inch range. These values 
are near the 10th percentile and expect dry and mostly sunny 
conditions during the day on Thursday. Highs will still run a few 
degrees above average with the lack of any substantial cold air 
advection behind the front and the ample supply of insolation. 
Forecast highs on Thursday will generally be in the mid to upper 70s.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Tuesday)...

Upper level ridge in place to start the period along with drier 
air and more seasonable temperatures. Lows will be in the mid to 
upper 50s, but still a few degrees above normal. Broad longwave 
trough begins to push into the Ohio River Valley on Friday but 
high pressure centered to our SW remains in control of our 
weather. Expecting another dry day with temps in the upper 70s to 
low 80s, 5 to 8 degrees above normal. Lows overnight will be in 
the upper 50s to low 60s. Same story on Saturday with high 
pressure still in control, though the ridge beginning to become 
more suppressed as a wave of energy moves across the Rockies and 
into the Central Plains. We do see a little more moisture enter 
into our area from the east on Saturday as high pressure off the 
east coast brings in moisture from the Atlantic. We could have a 
few spotty showers across the eastern high terrain but the valley 
will stay dry. Highs in the upper 70s to lower 80s. 

By Saturday night an area of low pressure has developed with the 
aforementioned wave of energy. Center of the low is across the 
Northern Plains with a trailing cold front. On Sunday the front 
begins to approach our area and will draw closer by Sunday night. 
With the front still well to our west Sunday we should see another 
dry day with highs around 80. A line of showers and storms sweep 
through sometime Sunday night with the actual front not passing 
thorugh until sometime Monday, depending on what model you go with. 
The latest GFS is a little quicker with the front than the ECMWF. 
Behind this front we will see much cooler and drier air move in. 
Sunday night lows will be in the upper 50s. Highs on Monday will be 
in the upper 60s with lows that night in mid 40s!. Two gorgeous days 
follow behind the front with Tuesday and Wednesday looking more like 
fall. Highs will be in the upper 60s to near 70 with lows in the mid 
to upper 40s with clear skies.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Still some lingering isolated showers out there early this
morning, but most of the area has stayed dry through the overnight
hours. Some patchy fog is present as well and that could last
through the morning hours before it is able to clear out. Biggest
weather maker today will be a front that is expected to move
through today. Front could bring another round of precipitation
along it, but high resolution models are not overly excited about
this prospect. Behind the front skies should begin to clear out as
we get drier air from the west to move in. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...Models continue to be in 
decent agreement overall with pretty good run to run consistency, 
and forecast confidence is above average for this time of year. The 
upper level ridge will reestablish itself over the region Thursday 
and will continue into the weekend.  Somewhat drier air will be in 
place, but southeast flow may bring enough moisture to the eastern 
mountains for some isolated showers Friday and Saturday.  A cold 
front will be approaching Sunday and should sweep through Sunday 
night or at latest early Monday.  Expect some showers and perhaps 
thunderstorms near and ahead of the front.  Drier and cooler air

The update will adjust PoPs downward overnight. However, there is
a line of convection in West TN ahead of the cold front that is

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...At the current hour, 
the warm front is draped across the Northern TN valley, NETN and 
SWVA. Current radar activity across these areas is in response to 
the front lifting through. These scattered showers and a few isolated 
thunderstorms will continue late this afternoon and into the evening 
hours as we remain in a warm and humid airmass. Highest POPs are 
early then decrease as we go later into the night. Very mild again 
tonight with lows in the mid to upper 60s, which is around 20 
degrees above normal. Our lows tonight will only be a few degrees 
colder than what our normal daytime highs should be, amazing! We 
could potentially see more daily high minimum records broken 
tonight. However, it all depends on if the cold front pushes through 
before or after midnight tomorrow because daily lows might occur 
near midnight tomorrow rather than tomorrow morning.

Chances for showers and a storm or two continue tomorrow but chances 
decrease through the day as the front beings to move into our
area, bringing cooler and drier air. We should see some sunshine 
by tomorrow afternoon as the drier air moves in. Highs will be in
the lower 80s once again. The actually front looks to be located 
around the Cumberland Plateau by tomorrow afternoon.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...Some lingering 
showers possible across the mountains Wednesday night as the weak 
cold front exits our area. Behind this, the upper level ridge will 
reestablish itself and drier air will work into the region. Should 
be mainly dry and warm across the area through Saturday with highs 
around 80. However, easterly flow off the Atlantic may bring enough 
moisture to produce some isolated weak convection across the eastern 
mountains. A stronger cold front approaches the area on Sunday, with 
one more day of warm temperatures for Sunday and increasing clouds 
ahead of the front. The cold front will push through the area Sunday 
night/Monday bringing showers and thunderstorms and much cooler 
temps in its wake -- with highs Monday and Tuesday in the upper 60s 
to lower 70s and lows dipping back into the 40s overnight.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast on track. Weak warm front lifting through 
the area out ahead of advancing cold front producing some light, 
isolated-to-scattered, showers around the area but most areas are
staying dry. Still expecting a slight uptick in coverage through 
the day but nothing too widespread. Current forecast reflects 
that so no big changes. Only change was to slightly bump up POPs 
across the Cumberland Plateau from 60 to 70 in anticipation of 
precip currently over Middle TN and Northern Alabama moving into 
our Plateau counties. Also made slight hourly adjustments to temps
and dewpoints to match latest observations. Will send out new 
zones to get rid of morning wording.

.AVIATION...
Isolated showers are moving NE across the area early this morning.
Coverage is much less widespread than any previous model
runs/forecasts. With that in mind I'm not seeing much in the way
that would cause a dramatic increase in precipitation coverage so
have only gone with VCSH in the TAFs. If an airport gets decent
rain today we could see some fog overnight, but the cloudy skies
could keep it at bay if only limited rain falls today.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Some isolated weak showers present across the forecast area early
this morning, but coverage should increase as the day continues.
Moisture from the Gulf coast is getting squeezed northward between
an approaching low pressure system across the plains states and a
high pressure system across the southeast. These systems are
condensing the atmospheric moisture into a narrow area across
parts of the southeast. This also leads to very high PWAT values
over our area (approaching and maybe exceeding 2 inches). However,
models indicate that there is really no major source of strong
lift over us that would cause this water to dump out in the form
of rain. We could definitely see some thunderstorms that produce
heavy rain, but as of right now the models are not overly excited
about the prospect of widespread heavy rain. 

Rain will stick around the area through most of the day and into 
the overnight hours, and will begin to decrease from south to 
north as we move into tomorrow. Temperatures today are expected to
remain warm (10+ degrees above normal) as this warm air from the 
south remains over us.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...For the extended period, 
models remain in reasonable agreement overall, with some 
discrepancies when it comes to specific details. Forecast confidence 
is about average for this time of year.  A very weak cold front will 
push through the area Wednesday, along with a chance for some 
showers/thunderstorms.  Drier air will move in Thursday and the upper 
level ridge will reestablish itself over the region and will remain 
over us into the weekend.  May be some mainly isolated weak 
convection mainly along the eastern mountains for Thursday through 
Saturday as easterly flow pushes some moisture up the eastern 
slopes. By Sunday a cold front will be approaching, and it should 
swing through sometime in the Sunday night/Monday time frame. Expect 
some showers and perhaps thunderstorms with this feature.

954 PM EDT Mon Oct 9 2017

.DISCUSSION...
Upstream soundings at BMX and FFC show deep moisture that will be
spreading northward tonight. While moisture will be plentiful,
lift will be lacking tonight. Lift will be mainly due to
isentropic lift, but it will be weak as winds are less than 20 
kts through the low and mid levels. So while PoPs will be high -
in the likely range for southern sections - will lower QPF amounts
significantly, following the 00Z NAM. Otherwise the forecast looks
on track.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...Our brief break from the 
precipitation quickly comes to an end tonight and tomorrow as 
another wave of moisture moves northward out of the Gulf of 
Mexico. This wave of moisture is in response to an area of low 
pressure moving through the Central Plains and an area of high 
pressure situated just off the East Coast. The cyclonic and anti- 
cyclonic circulations working in unison will help draw this 
moisture north into our area. POP chances begin to slowly increase
after sunset and continue to do through the night, though the 
better moisture doesn't move in until early tomorrow morning. 
Increasing clouds tonight with very mild lows, in the mid to upper
60s. These temps will be around 15 degrees above normal. With 
elevated dewpoints and temperatures we will see some patchy fog 
around after midnight.

PW values range from 1.75 to around 2 inches when the better surge 
of moisture moves in tomorrow morning so we could see a few heavier 
showers pass through as these values will be near record levels for 
this time of year.. High PW values and good upper level support 
yield likely and categorical POPs for tomorrow for most areas. Due 
to the warm and humid airmass we could see a few thunderstorms as 
well. Highs tomorrow will be in the low to mid 80s with mostly 
cloudy skies. These temps will be around 8 to 10 degrees above 
normal.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...For the extended 
period, models remain in reasonable agreement, with some 
discrepancies when it comes to specific details. An upper low will 
be crossing the upper Midwest/Great Lakes region to start the 
period, with an associated weak surface cold front pushing through 
our forecast area on Wednesday. This will bring some showers and 
maybe some weak convection. Upper level ridging/surface high 
pressure reestablishes itself over the area on Thursday and will 
continue through Saturday with above average high temperatures and 
only a slight chance of showers across the mountains as light flow 
off the Atlantic brings some moisture to the area. Ridge slides east 
by late Saturday/early Sunday, with another frontal boundary and 
better rain chances approaching for the Sunday/Monday timeframe.

.DISCUSSION...Biggest change to the forecast was to drop the flood warnings for
the French Broad and Pigeon River. Latest model runs from the
river forecast center indicate both rivers are expected to crest 
below flood stage and therefore the warning was cancelled.

Rest of the forecast on track this morning as the remnants of 
Nate pull further away from the forecast area. Only minor tweaks 
were made which include hourly temp and dewpoint adjustments as 
well as slightly decreasing cloud cover for today. We will still 
see plenty of clouds but may see a peak of sunshine or two later 
this afternoon, but still mostly cloudy. 

Will send out new zones to get rid of morning wording.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...As the remnants of Nate pulls
away from the Southern Appalachian Region...will continue to see
winds decrease over the area and rain slowly coming to an end.
Winds have already diminish somewhat and will...therefore allow 
the current High Wind Warning and Wind Advisory to expire. A few 
showers may linger over the area through the morning but most 
locations should be dry. However...with deep low level moisture 
remaining in place across the region and warm daytime temperatures
in the 70s and 80s...may see isolated to scattered convection 
develop during the afternoon...mainly over higher terrain and 
across southern locations. With the recent rainfall...a few area 
rivers may rise and the French Broad River near Newport and the 
Pigeon River at Newport are expected to rise above flood stage and
a Flood Warning remains in effect for these areas.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...Models are in reasonable 
agreement overall although some differences in the details, and run 
to run consistency is decent. Forecast confidence is about average 
for this time of year. Upper trough/low will lift across the plains 
into the great lakes region early in the period, with a weak surface 
low tracking northeast well to our west.  Moisture out ahead of this 
system will be over our area early, along with some convection for 
the Tuesday/Wednesday time frame. Drier air will spread in behind a 
very weak frontal boundary by Thursday.  The upper ridge/surface 
high pressure pattern will re-establish itself across the region 
Thursday through at least Saturday.  The next cold front may be 
approaching by the end of the period, bringing the possibility of 
some convection on Sunday.

.DISCUSSION...
A quick update to remove the wind advisory for lower elevations.
Continue the high wind warning for the mountains as well as the
wind advisory for the northeast TN mountains through 4 am. 

Nate is moving across Middle Tennessee this evening. Wind gusts 
have really decreased this evening with the highest gusts
currently at Chattanooga around 17 knots. Also had to tweak PoPs
to better represent the precip shield being a little farther north
and east. Lighter rain expected across the southern TN valley
through about midnight. Some downslope affect may affect
precipitation amounts for NE TN and SW VA. Will continue to
monitor. Appears that most lower elevations will be dry by sunrise
with only the higher elevations still getting some light rain.
Will look at updating tomorrow's PoPs before the next shift,
however, will not issue another ZFP. Rather we will publish
changes to the official database which should update the web
forecast pages.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...
The remnants of Tropical system Nate continue to speed north
toward middle Tennessee with locally heavy rainfall along the 
eastern side across southern and central sections of the forecast
area at mid afternoon. The heaviest rainfall is starting to shift
east of the forecast area into eastern Georgia and the Carolinas.
Still could see a few more hours of heavy rain in the south before
it shifts to the northern areas later tonight. Winds are just
starting to increase across the southern parts of the area as the
pressure gradient tightens and have not changed wind advisory or
high wind warning areas...although not sure winds will be strong
enough in the warning area. This will have to be monitored in the
evening hours. Temperatures were mostly lower 70s and will change
little overnight. Tonight and early Monday as the remnant low 
moves northeast into the mid Atlantic and northeast states there
will be a break in the rain from southwest to northeast. Air mass
will be moist and with heating Monday expecting scattered showers
and thunderstorms will be possible. Rainfall amounts look to be 
light. Kept highs a few degrees below guidance.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Saturday)...
A large mass of moisture carried north out of the Gulf of Mexico 
in the wake of Nate will continue to advance north through the 
Deep South into the Southern Appalachian region Monday night 
through Tuesday night. The moisture will be lifted in warm frontal
fashion into a pattern of showers and thunderstorms through this 
period as a closed upper level low lumbers slowly northeast out of
the Plains into the Great Lakes. A cold front associated with the
deep low will generate a continued chance for convection on 
Wednesday with decreasing pops expected later Wednesday night into
Thursday behind the departing system. Following this unsettled 
period, the sub-tropical high will strengthen again over the 
Southeastern U.S. leading to a dry end of the week. Typical late 
period timing issues are present with an advancing upper level 
trough through the middle of the nation due later in the weekend. 
Superblend populates some chance category pops for convection with
the associated front on Sunday; especially by Sunday night. Due 
to uncertainty so many days into the future, yanked pops back to 
slight chance through the 24 hour period at the end of the 
extended for this system.

.DISCUSSION...
Now Tropical Depression Nate is located over central Alabama at
this hour with the majority of the rain bands to the north and
east of the center. The tropical system is moving north northeast
at about 25 mph and has weakened rapidly over the last 12 hours 
but bands of rainfall have been moving north across the southern 
and western sections of the forecast area since late saturday 
evening. Currently the most intense rainfall bands were setting up
over Bradley and Hamilton counties northeast to Bledsoe county
Tennessee.

The highest rainfall amounts so far have been across the southern
plateau and valley in Marion and Hamilton counties with totals of
1.5 to 2.5 inches there. Elsewhere amounts were mostly from a few
hundredths northeast to over an inch in the south. Adjusted total
rainfall amounts through tonight to 1.5 inches northeast to 
around 3 to 4 inches west and south...locally higher amounts to
around 6 inches where the bands form. Winds have not increased 
much but still expecting them to increase later today. With the 
decrease in intensity of Nate may have to adjust advisory this 
afternoon. Temperatures will rise little with the clouds and rain 
and adjusted highs down a few degrees most locations.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Remnants of hurricane Nate 
will be tracking into the region today, before exiting late 
tonight. Winds will pick up and become gusty this afternoon and 
into tonight, and some wind gusts to 40 mph or higher will be 
possible across much of the area. While model soundings do not 
look ideal for mountain waves, there is still some risk and also 
given stronger winds at 3000+ feet will go ahead and upgrade the 
high wind watch to a warning. Will tweak the times for both it and
the wind advisory to narrow the window of higher winds. While it 
looks like total precip through tonight will generally be in the 
2-4 inch range with locally higher amounts, very dry soils should 
help to lessen flooding potential. Flash flood guidance values are
very high, so while localized flooding issues will be possible no
flood watch will be issued at this time.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...The widespread showers and a 
few thunderstorms over the area will slowly decrease in coverage and 
intense on Monday as the remnants of Nate exit the region.  Also... 
as the system pulls away...winds will continue to lessen. 
However...as Nate moves out...an area of weak low pressure will move 
in from the south and a weakening frontal boundary will come in from 
the northwest.  This will bring another round of showers and 
thunderstorms into the area for Monday night and Tuesday.  Scattered 
convection will continue into Wednesday as the front slowly pulls 
away from the area.  A few isolated showers and possibly a stray 
storm may linger into Thursday but at this point we should be 
trending drier as high pressure begins to build in.  The high should 
dominate area weather for the rest of the extended for dry and warm 
conditions Friday and Saturday.

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
405 PM EDT Sat Oct 7 2017

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Sunday night)...
Moisture will continue to increase tonight as the remnants of Nate
move northeastward towards our area. As lift increases late
tonight, rain will become likely from south to north. Temperatures
will be above normal with extensive cloud cover and anomalously
high low-level moisture.

A frontal boundary to our west will accelerate Nate northeastward
on Sunday with increasing winds through the afternoon.
Additionally, low-level moisture is very high with PW values near
climatological maxima across southeast Tennessee and southwest
North Carolina. Could have some localized flooding with upslope
flow producing enhanced rainfall amounts along the southern
plateau and higher elevations of southwest North Carolina.
However, flooding issues seem minimized for most areas due to the
quick movement of Nate and high FFG values due to recent dry
weather. The foothills of the TN/NC mountains may see more limited
precipitation (less than 2.0 inches) due to strong downsloping 
late Sunday and Sunday night. The current representation of
precipitation amounts from high-res model seems reasonable.

With 850mb winds of greater than 50 kt, expect the potential for
gusty winds, and therefore, a wind advisory has been issued. The
potential for up to 60 mph wind will exist across the highest 
elevations of the TN/NC mountains. The combination of strong flow
at 850 mb and the potential for some mountain wave enhanced winds
will lead to the potential for strong winds, and because of this,
a High Wind Watch has been issued. Between 00z-06z Monday,
mountain waves seem at least possible as southeast winds will be about
50-60 kt at 850mb combined with a tightening pressure gradient 
across the mountains and a neutral to slightly stable layer near
the mountain tops.

Late Sunday night, winds should begin to decrease as the remnants
of Nate move away from our area. Rain will also decrease as
slightly drier air moves in from the west.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Friday)...
Nate will be well northeast of the forecast area at the beginning
of the period. In fact, Nate will be moving north across the 
region so fast, it will leave a vapor trail in place, so to speak.
A corridor of deeper moisture will be streaming northeast in the 
gradient between a Western U.S. upper trough and the expansive 
sub-tropical high holding its position over the Western Atlantic 
and Southeastern U.S. Following the departure of the tropical 
system, this axis of moisture will be lifted in the presence of a 
couple shorter wavelength features. The trailing, more amplified 
upper feature will be associated with a frontal wave at mid week 
keeping the chance for showers and thunderstorms going through 
Thursday. Drier air filling in behind the wave and a re-emergence 
of the sub- tropical across the Eastern U.S. should allow for a 
dry end to the week on Friday and Saturday.

of the tropical system over the Northern Gulf of Mexico. The
greatest impact for flight operations would be seen at cha where

Sunday and continue almost through the end of the forecast period.
There may even be some periods of ifr weather due to showers, fog,

forecast with a downsloping flow keeping ceilings a little higher
along with better visibility in lighter rain showers. At this

.DISCUSSION...
Low-level winds will increase today in response to an approaching
shortwave trough and upper low across the upper Mississippi River
Valley. This will lead to an increase in moisture and humid
conditions across the region. Clouds will also increase during the
afternoon ahead of the approaching trough and tropical system.
Instability and lift will be sufficient for a few rain showers or thunderstorms
this afternoon, especially across western and southern portions of
the forecast area. Otherwise, forecast looks on track, and made
minor adjustments to reflect dew points increasing quicker this 
morning.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Surface high pressure that has 
been extending into our area will shift east.  An approaching cold 
front will stall to our west, while moisture from the tropical 
system in the gulf will begin to be pulled up into our area as it 
approaches the gulf coast and then makes landfall tonight.  We will 
see an increase in clouds across the area, and showers may move in 
later today mainly south and west zones before spreading across the 
entire area tonight.  Instability looks limited, but may be enough 
to warrant a slight chance of thunder mention so will include for 
the entire area.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...Main concern through the 
extended will be the impact of Nate as it's remnants track through 
the Southern Appalachian Region.  As the extended period 
begins...remnants of Nate will be pushing into the area with 
widespread showers and even a few thunderstorms moving through. The 
large band of convection will continue to affect area weather 
through Monday.  Rainfall may be heavy at times and overall totals 
of 1 to 3 inches north and 2 to 4 inches south can be expected. 
Higher amount will be possible...especially over the higher 
elevations of the eastern mountains.  Also of concern will be 
increasing winds as the low pushes through Sunday night.  Sustained 
winds of 15 to 25 MPH with higher gusts are expected over lower 
elevations...higher elevations may see 20 to 30 MPH with higher 
gusts.  The tropical system will pull out of the area on 
Monday...however another weak area of low pressure is expected to 
move in around the Tuesday/Wednesday time frame.  This will continue 
to provide the area with a chance of convection through mid week. 
Should see conditions slowly improve Thursday into Friday as the 
second low moves out...though may continue to see a few lingering 
showers over the area.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...
Tonight should be slightly warmer than the past several nights as
southerly winds, low-level moisture, and mid-level clouds begin to
increase late tonight. Depending upon cloud cover, may have some 
patchy fog near area lakes and rivers once again, but any fog 
should remain localized.

A potent shortwave trough across the upper Mississippi River
Valley combined with an upper jet producing strong upper-
divergence across the Great Lakes region will act to strengthen 
low-level southerly flow across the Southeast CONUS on Saturday. 
This increasing low-level flow will act to increase moisture 
substantially with dew points rising to the upper 60s to lower 70s
by Saturday evening. PW values will also increase to near 2.0 –
2.2 inches by 0Z Sunday which is very high — around the 99th 
percentile of climatology for this time of year. With the 
increasing moisture, we may begin to see some rain or isolated 
thunderstorms on Saturday afternoon, especially across southeast 
Tennessee and southwest North Carolina where best lift and
instability will be colocated. 

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...
Some relief from the dry conditions are on the way as a cold 
front builds toward the Southern Appalachians. Moisture will be 
advancing north out of the Gulf of Mexico ahead of the tropical 
system called Nate. Still a fair amount of uncertainty in the 
track of Nate with a swath of model run forecasts that take the 
center of circulation west of the Appalachians and a few that take
the feature just east of the spine of the Appalachians, which is 
basically what the official NHC forecast depicts at this writing. 
Would expect some changes in track, intensity, and forward speed 
of this circulation which will mean some shifts in amounts of rain
and wind strength during the next couple days of forecasts. At 
this time, went with increasing chances for showers and some 
thunderstorms Saturday night into Sunday with the tropical 
circulation (likely a depression) passing along its closest path 
to the forecast area Sunday night. At this time, the strongest 
wind would be in the higher terrain over Southwest North Carolina 
and in the higher terrain along the Tennessee border with North 
Carolina. Wind speeds are currently forecast to be in the 25-35 
mph range for a brief time Sunday evening in the higher terrain 
with 15-25 mph winds in the adjacent lower elevation areas. As 
stated earlier, rainfall will be contingent on the actual track of
the tropical low and its depth; but at this time our forecast has
the highest amounts in Southwest North Carolina and in the higher
terrain over Southeast Tennessee where 48 hour amounts may be 
around 4-5 inches with some locally higher totals in a few spots. 
Would expect quite a bit of "rain shadowing" keeping totals 
significantly lower across much of the remainder of the forecast 
area with a system path just east of the spine of the 
Appalachians. A trailing wave of low pressure behind the departing
tropical system will keep the chance for rain alive in showers 
and some thunderstorms Monday night into Wednesday as the moist 
southerly component keeps the Gulf of Mexico open for business. 
There is quite a bit of uncertainty in the remaining two days of 
the extended period with the ECMWF more active than the GFS, 
despite what looks like another building upper ridge. The drier 
GFS looks a little better at this point with that beautiful ridge;
thus kept pops way down in the slight chance category for 
Thursday into Friday.

Good flying weather continues this afternoon and tonight with VFR
conditions expected at all sites. Can't rule out some MVFR fog at
TRI late tonight, but don't think it will be much of a factor with
increasing high clouds and dry low-levels inhibiting fog
development. Late tonight and Saturday morning, winds begin to 
increase from the south with ceilings beginning to lower from
south to north. This will result in expected MVFR ceilings at CHA
by 15z Saturday with the potential for a few rain showers through
the end of the period. TYS and TRI should keep ceilings at VFR 
through the end of the TAF period.

.DISCUSSION...
High pressure remains in control of our weather today with a
mostly clear sky. Very dry air between 850-500mb should once again
limit any low to mid-level clouds today. Southerly winds begin to
increase tonight as a shortwave trough and cold front approach 
from the west increasing moisture later tonight and Saturday. For 
today, temperatures should be a degree or two warmer than max 
temperatures yesterday, and the forecast appears on track so far. 
Only made a few minor adjustments to dew points to reflect current
observations.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Surfaced high pressure over the 
region will shift east during the period, allowing a more southerly 
flow to develop.  The atmosphere will remain on the dry side for 
much of the period, but we will start to see some increase in 
moisture especially late.  Expect plenty of sunshine today, and a 
mostly clear start to the night, although clouds will begin to 
increase later in the night especially south.  High temperatures 
will be near to slightly above yesterday's highs. Will generally 
lean toward a MAV/MET blend for min temps tonight.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...Will transition into a wet 
and active weather pattern early in the extended.  On Saturday...the 
strong ridge of high pressure that has dominated recent weather will 
shift to the east and allow for southerly flow to develop and bring 
deep low level moisture into the region.  Main weather feature of 
concern through the extended will be the remnants of Nate as it 
moves in from the gulf.  Models are beginning to come more in line 
but confidence remains low on track.  Current model runs are 
trending toward bringing remnants of Nate into the MRX CWA.  Could 
see some isolated convection move in late Saturday out ahead of the 
approaching system.  The main band should begin to affect the area 
late Saturday night with the main push Sunday into Monday.  With the 
increase in tropical moisture into the area...could see 1 to 3 
inches of rainfall through a 48 hour period. Locally heavier amounts 
will be possible.  Also of concern will be increased winds 
associated with the system with sustains winds of 15 to 25 MPH 
possible...higher gusts can be expected.  The system should move 
through fairly quickly and we should begin to see some improvement 
across the area by Tuesday and Wednesday. However...scattered 
convection will linger across the region for this time period. High 
pressure should build in late in the extended with dry conditions 
expected for Thursday.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...
High pressure remains in control with continued dry weather
tonight. May have a few passing high clouds during the night, but
otherwise, it should be mostly clear with minimum temperatures 
expected to be a degree or two warmer than last night.

Friday should be another warm day with mostly clear conditions.
Surface high pressure shifts slightly to the east and winds will
become more southerly in response to an approaching shortwave
across the Great Plains. We should see 850mb temperatures increase
by a degree or two resulting in surface max temperatures expected
to be about a degree or two warmer than Thursday afternoon. Max
temperatures will continue to be about 10-13 degrees above normal. 

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Wednesday)...
We get to experience the sunny and warm weather for just a bit 
longer Friday into Saturday, but after that things begin to cooler
and wetter. The biggest weather to watch will be Tropical Storm 
Nate as it moves north out of the Gulf of Mexico and how it 
interacts with an advancing front from the west. 

Ahead of the storm making landfall on Sunday we will see 
precipitation chances increase as low level flow begins to turn 
southerly bringing in more moist air. Precipitation ahead of the 
tropical storm looks like it could start as early as Saturday 
morning, but we will have much better chances Saturday evening. 
Precipitation should continue as the tropical storm moves up the 
southeast towards our area. Latest National Hurricane Center 
forecast has the storm passing over our area Monday morning with it 
possibly still being a tropical depression. The latest ECMWF has 
shifted the path of the storm further west towards Louisiana to be 
more in line with the GFS. So over the weekend I have trended a bit 
more towards the GFS and it's QPF amounts since it has been pretty 
consistent in it's path of this system for several runs now. 

The main path of this storm and the location of the frontal boundary 
will likely be where we see the highest precipitation amounts over 
the weekend and into next week. Most models are keeping the main 
band of the heaviest rain off to our west...But we can't rule out 
some heavy rain here if the track of the storm shifts or the front 
makes further eastward progress than we anticipated. Currently think 
we could see widespread precipitation amounts of 1-3 inches in our 
area, but it's possible some places could see up to 4 or 5 inches. 
This rain will fall over several days and with our recently (very) 
dry conditions we've experienced the rivers and lakes should be able 
to handle a good amount of water. Wind speeds are tough with a 
system like this since they can really lose steam once they move 
inland into rougher terrain, but we could see winds of 20+ mph with 
higher gusts Sunday and Monday, especially in the higher terrain. 
Once this system finally exits the area we could see some lingering 
showers into the middle of the week, but dry conditions should 
return by Thursday as a high pressure system slides south of the 
area.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
The strong upper level ridge that has been anchored over the 
eastern CONUS for the last week or so does begin to break down 
today with a weak frontal boundary over the Ohio Valley and a 
tropical system in the Caribbean Sea. But, high pressure will 
remain in control of the weather pattern across our area again 
today and tonight. This will result in another day of above normal
daytime temperatures and sunny skies. Dewpoints may be a degree or
two higher than yesterday as a bit of moisture slowly begins to 
work back into the area. This slight increase in moisture will
help hold lows tonight in the 50s across the region, despite
continued mainly clear skies.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
High pressure will provide one more day of dry and seasonally 
warm weather on Friday. The high should shift east and out of the 
area on Saturday. This should allow southerly flow to develop 
across the region and bring an increase in low level moisture. 
This change in the weather pattern will transition us into wet and
unsettle conditions. Models continue to struggle with consistency
and confidence remains rather low for the bulk of the extended. 
The main concern through the period will be the track of the 
remnants of tropical depression 16 progged to push through the 
area this weekend into early next week. Also of concern will be 
the approach of a weakening frontal boundary and its interact with
the depression. The GFS is a bit faster and farther west with the
track of the system...while the ECMWF is slower and farther east.
The frontal boundary should move in around the Saturday night or 
Sunday time frame. While details remain in question...the overall 
scenario of increased chance of showers and thunderstorms can be 
expected Saturday through Monday...with the best chance generally 
around the late Sunday into Monday time frame. Improving 
conditions are expected Tuesday into Wednesday with some lingering
showers continuing across the area through this period.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Sunny skies and only a few cumulus clouds are seen on visible
satellite this afternoon as high pressure stays centered over the
southern Appalachians and mid Atlantic states at mid afternoon.
Upper ridge over local area begins to break down over the next 24
hours with weak front over Ohio Valley that moves little and 
tropical system continues moving north through the Caribbean Sea.
Temperatures are about 10 degrees above normal in the upper 70s 
to lower 80s with still low afternoon relative humidities...mostly
in the 30 to 40 percent range. Pattern changes little overnight 
and Thursday with some patchy fog in the valleys and near bodies 
of water and lows once again in the mid 40s to mid 50s...near 
normal for this time of year. Thursday again warming to upper 70s 
to possibly as warm as mid 80s a degree or 2 warmer than today. 
Dew points might be slightly higher but no significant changes in 
relative humidities.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Tuesday)...
High pressure and dry weather will continue through the work week
with temperatures slowly creeping into the mid/low 80's by 
Saturday across the Tennessee Valley. Weather pattern remains 
relatively stagnant until the weekend when precipitation chances 
increase. High will shift far enough east that we get moist flow 
from the Gulf leading to increased clouds and (finally) some 
decent shower/thunderstorm chances. 

The second half of the weekend will see two systems battle against 
each other near our area. One system is a frontal boundary moving in 
from the northwest and the other will be the remnants of Tropical 
Depression 16. Long term models are still not in great agreement 
with how to handle this system at this time. ECMWF keeps the system 
in the Gulf longer and allows it to strengthen quite a bit before it 
makes landfall in the central Florida Panhandle. The GFS, on the 
other hand, wants to quickly bring the system into the Louisiana 
coast before zipping up towards us. Both models do show the remnants 
of this storm bringing precipitation to our area over the weekend 
and into next week. Will increase precipitation chances during this 
time frame, but QPF output from the models looks reasonable this far 
out. Models are hinting we could see 1-4 inches of rain over the 
weekend into next week, which our area should likely be able to 
handle with how dry we have been this past month.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Upper level flow will become slightly more zonal north of our 
forecast area today as a frontal boundary moves through the 
midwest. However, high pressure will remain firmly entrenched 
across the Tennessee Valley, bringing another day of clear skies, 
light winds, and above normal high temperatures. Under clear 
skies, lows tonight will again dip into the upper 40s to lower 
50s. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...
Strong high pressure will remain the dominant feature across the 
area for Thursday and Friday. This will continue the trend of a 
quiet weather pattern with dry conditions and highs beginning to 
warm 5 to 10 degree above normal. Will then...see a pattern change
for the weekend into early next week. Models continue to be in 
poor agreement...but the overall tend is to transition into a 
wetter...unsettled pattern. The GFS is more aggressive with 
setting up southerly flow and bringing low level moisture into the
area. Also...the GFS wants to pull in an area of low pressure up 
from the gulf with the ECMWF showing the track a bit farther to 
the east. Also...both models do bring a weakening frontal boundary
into the area around Saturday/Saturday night and another around 
the Monday/Tuesday time frame....though timing and strength vary. 
As a result of all of this...confidence is rather low on details 
but overall...expect to move into a more active pattern with a 
chance of convection each period from Saturday through the end of 
the extended.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...
There will be very little change to the pattern we have had over
the past few days, so the forecast will generally follow
persistence through tomorrow. High pressure will remain firmly
entreched over the region, with perhaps a slight westward drift
from its current position near DelMarVa. Clear skies, light winds,
and above-normal daytime temps will continue. SLightly warmer low
temps and some valley fog may be possible tonight as dewpoints 
are a little higher today compared to yesterday.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Monday)...
Quiet weather will continue through the second half of the work 
week and into the weekend. The center of the high pressure system 
will be around Texas in the middle of the week before it slowly 
starts to move eastward. Temperatures will begin to warm a few 
degrees at the end of the work week with afternoon high 
temperatures expected to be about 5-10 degrees above normals 
Friday and Saturday. After this extended period of drier weather 
we could see a bit of a change over the weekend and into next 
week.

Over the weekend, low level winds will turn more southerly and 
moisture will increase in response. Long term models are in 
disagreement with the extent and coverage of this moisture from the 
Gulf. Will increase precipitation chances Saturday into Sunday, but 
won't go crazy and will wait for other long term models to come into 
better agreement over the weekend. Another system to watch will be a 
tropical low pressure expected to move north out of the Gulf and 
towards our forecast area. GFS is very bullish with this system and 
brings in quite a bit of precipitation as the low passes right over 
us. The ECMWF shows this system as well, but the 00z run is a bit 
weaker with this system and keeps it further away from our area. But 
we will need to keep an eye on this weekend and into next week as 
all models show a wetter/cloudier period than we have seen these 
past weeks.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Ridging over the eastern CONUS will continue to control the
weather pattern today and tonight. This should keep the area dry 
and mainly cloud free. With abundant sunshine, above normal 
temperatures will persist, with highs today reaching the upper 70s
to lower 80s. Clear skies and calm winds overnight will allow for
another large temperature swing with lows bottoming out in the 
upper 40s to lower 50s. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...
The extended will begin with high pressure in control for a quiet
weather period Wednesday through Friday. This will result in dry 
conditions with mostly clear skies and near to slight above normal
temperatures. Model consistency becomes quite poor Saturday 
through the rest of the extended and confidence rather low. The 
GFS brings in southerly flow and an increase in low level 
moisture. It then brings a couple of short waves and an 
approaching frontal boundary into the area with a second front 
approaching late in the period. The ECMWF keeps the ridge in place
longer with the first front making little progress into the 
region and the weakening second front not reaching into the area 
by the end of the period and the short waves trending to track a 
bit farther to the east...limiting the impact over the MRX CWA. 
Will compromise between these two models but trend towards a bit 
wetter forecast with generally chance category POPs in place for 
the end of the extended.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...
Clouds across the southern portions of the area have shown a
decreasing trend in satellite imagery in the past couple of hours,
so most of the area should have clear skies around sunset.
Considering how low temps dropped around the area last night, and
current observed dewpoints, MOS guidance seems on the warm side 
for lows. Perhaps there will be a bit more wind tonight than last
night, but will lean on the cooler side of guidance. High pressure
through the lower and midlevels will continue to extend across the
region tomorrow, so mostly clear skies and above normal
temperatures are expected to persist.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Monday)...
Not much has changed with the long-term forecast. This weeks 
looks warm and dry with big model differences for the weekend.

Tuesday night through Friday look dry with high pressure in control 
early then becoming suppressed by Friday as our first system of 
interest draws closer. Highs during this time will be in the low to 
mid 80s with lows gradually becoming warmer each night. Starting out 
in the lower 50s Tuesday night and warming into the upper 50s by 
Friday night. As with yesterday's discussion, still watching an 
upper-level trough and associated frontal boundary for Friday. 
Latest run of the GFS has this front further to our north, which is 
more in line with what the ECMWF has been showing. This result keeps 
us dry on Friday with the boundary well to our north. 

Over the weekend the models really begin to disagree. On Saturday 
The GFS has another shortwave rotating through the Great Lakes with 
a trailing cold front through the Ohio River Valley and down across 
the Central Plains. Meanwhile an area of low pressure is moving 
northward out of the Gulf and into the Gulf Coast States. This area 
of low pressure advances northward Saturday night into Sunday and 
transports a considerable amount of moisture northward into our 
area. If this model solution is correct, we could be looking at a 
very rainy Saturday night through Monday. 

The ECWMF on the other hand is quite different. The shortwave on 
Saturday is more amplified and digs further south into the Ohio 
River Valley. This prevents the low in the Gulf from migrating 
northward and pushes it more NE toward the Coastal Carolinas. This 
path would keep us mostly precip free from the Saturday through 
Monday time-period. So for now, relied heavily on Superblend POPs 
for that stretch which yielded chance POPs across the board.

The position of the 850 mb high over DelMarVa has produced a SE
fetch off the Atlantic that has spread extensive cloud cover
across the southern TN Valley. The forecast will need to be
updated to expand the area of clouds, and make slight downward
adjustments to high temps in that area. With daytime mixing and a
westward bulge of the high, we should se decreasing clouds in that
area in the late afternoon/evening. The central and northern
sections should have a light downslope flow that will maintain

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
High pressure will continue to dominate the weather pattern today
with ridging anchored in place over the eastern US. Surface high
pressure will be centered over the northeast today, opening up 
our area to easterly flow at the surface. This will help usher
some Atlantic moisture and resultant cloud cover into the 
southern half of the Tennessee Valley today, but it will remain 
dry. The rest of the area will see mainly clear skies with 
downsloping winds off the mountains helping to suppress cloud 
cover. 

A bit more moisture overhead will help keep lows tonight a few
degrees warmer than the past nights, with most locations staying
in the lower 50s under mainly clear skies.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...
The main story over the week ahead will be dry and unseasonably warm 
weather as a ridge remains anchored across the Southeast CONUS. This 
ridge will be strongest on Tuesday and Wednesday with 500mb heights 
of around 594-595 dm. Surface high pressure across the Mid-Atlantic 
region will place our area under an easterly/southeasterly flow with 
downsloping across the western foothills of the Southern 
Appalachians resulting in dry conditions for our area. A quick 
shortwave moving across the Great Lakes begins to flatten the ridge 
by Wednesday night and Thursday. 

Model disagreement increases beyond Thursday with handling of 
another shortwave expected to pass across the Great Lakes region on 
Friday with a surface cold front digging southward across the Ohio 
River Valley. The 00Z GFS brings this front near our area by Friday 
and Saturday while the 00Z ECMWF keeps things dry with the front 
remaining to our north. Believe that with the current pattern we are 
in with such a strong ridge, it will be difficult for the front to 
make it this far south without a very strong shortwave and trough 
progressing further south toward our region. Will still keep slight 
chance PoPs across the the very northern fringes of the forecast 
area because of the low chance of a passing light rain shower with 
this front.

Model agreement next Saturday/Sunday is even worse. The 00Z GFS and 
ECMWF are both on completely different wavelengths with the upper-
level pattern. Both models show the potential for some rain showers 
across the region on Sunday, but for very different reasons. The GFS 
has the remnant surface front across the region with longwave 
troughing developing across the Eastern CONUS. The ECMWF has a 
lifting shortwave across the Upper Mississippi River Valley with 
limited moisture to our west and a tropical low to our southeast. 
Because of the potential for some weather systems to impact us next 
weekend with at least light precipitation, have slight chance PoPs 
for Sunday, but did lower PoPs substantially from guidance because 
of the high forecast uncertainty. With such varying solutions, 
forecast uncertainty for next weekend is higher than usual. 

As for temperatures, lower dewpoints and clear conditions will 
result in relatively large diurnal temperature swings with near 
normal lows and high temperatures about 5-10 degrees above normal 
through the work week. This weekend, increasing moisture and rising 
850mb temperatures results in both min and max temperatures about 5-
10 degrees above normal.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Monday)...
A midlevel ridge will continue to extend across the southern
Appalachian region through the period, with the center of high
pressure at the surface shifting slightly southward across the Mid
Atlantic region. Satellite shows an easterly fetch of moisture off
the Atlantic creating some cloud cover in southern GA, and as the
surface high drifts south, that cloud cover should spread north
and west. The NAM brings more clouds into our area than the GFS,
but both keep precip well to the SW. The forecast will bring some
clouds into southern sections late tonight and tomorrow morning. 
The rest of the area will have a downslope wind component that

mid 50s. The positioning of the high will provide us with an 
easterly flow and dry air, so plenty of sunshine to come. 

Wednesday night into Thursday the high flattens and breaks down in 
response to an upper level trough swinging down across the Northern 
Plains and Great Lakes. We stay dry and sunny on Thursday but with 
the trough and weak front drawing closer. Highs again in the lower 
80s and lows in the mid to upper 50s Thursday night. Models differ 
on how they handle the trough and front. The GFS brings the front 
further south and closer to our area while the ECMWF keeps it well 
to our north. Even if the GFS is correct moisture associated with 
the front really weakens as it enters our area on Friday and most 
areas look to stay dry. Currently, only a slight chance POP in for 
portions of SWVA. 

Both models show another shortwave moving through in the 
Saturday/Sunday timeframe but positioning of this feature is vastly 
different between the two models. At this point, it's safe to say 
the high breaking down earlier in the week will allow for an 
increasing chance for POPs over the weekend but details remain 
unclear on what the weekend system will look like. For now, only 
have a slight chance POP in for SWVA on Saturday and slight chance 
across some of the high terrain on Sunday due to uncertainty. Temps 
will remain in the lower 80s on both days with lows in the upper 
50s to near 60. A general increase in cloud cover expected both
days.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
High pressure will continue to remain in control today with an
upper level ridge continuing to build across the eastern CONUS.
Resulting strong subsidence will yield sunny skies with dry air.
Under this abundant sunshine, highs this afternoon will again 
climb into the mid to upper 70s. Low dewpoints and clear skies 
tonight will allow temperatures to dip into the lower 50s across 
the southern valley and the 40s elsewhere.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...
Bottom line...dry and unseasonably warm days with seasonal nights
through Thursday. Moisture gradually creeps back into the area 
with slightly increasing pcpn chances by the weekend.

Ridge axis remains anchored over the Eastern US through Wednesday 
before flattening out across the Ohio Valley Wednesday Night. Ridge 
then elongates east to west from the Mid Atlantic Coast across TN by 
Thursday Night as shortwave energy moving across the Great Lakes 
begins to break down the ridge. This finally allows for shortwave 
energy to influence our weather by the weekend. 

Disagreement remains on timing and position of surface front late 
week. Models range from ECMWF pushing front into the area Friday 
night to GFS keeping the front north of the area across the Ohio 
Valley through Saturday. Forecast remains a blend of these 
solutions.

Surface high pressure centered over the DELMARVA through mid-week 
will keep dry, downsloping easterly flow across the area. With it, 
daytime highs will reach about 5-7 degrees above normal for early 
October. Meanwhile, lower dewpoints will let overnight lows get to 
within 2-3 degree of normal making for some pleasant fall nights.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...
A mild and dry pattern continues as a midlevel ridge will be
building over the region through this period. High and midlevel
clouds will be crossing the area through the evening, but they
will be decreasing as the ridge continues to build and a jet
streak moves away, with clear skies expected by midnight. This
should allow temps to drop a bit lower than last night, in the low
40s north to low 50s south. Highs tomorrow will again be in the
mid to upper 70s.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)...
An anomalously strong ridge over the eastern CONUS will result in 
continued dry, sunny conditions for the extended period across our 
area. At the surface, high pressure shifts to the east with tropical 
moisture on its southern edge across the Gulf Coast. A dry 
east/southeasterly low-level flow supporting downsloping and large 
scale subsidence keeps us dry. The upper ridge will be strongest 
midweek on Tuesday and Wednesday with 500mb heights of around 594 
dm, near record max heights. Later in the week, the ridge 
retrogrades and is suppressed southward. This will place the region 
under a dry westerly to northwesterly flow on Thursday and 
continuing into the weekend. There is the potential that a frontal 
boundary will approach the region late in the week or next weekend, 
but there is considerable uncertainty with timing and location. The 
most recent 12z GFS favors a solution where the front never makes it 
south of the Ohio River Valley and the 12z ECMWF is quicker with a 
frontal boundary dropping southward and approaching our area Friday 
night. Even though the ECMWF does bring the front closer to the 
area, a predominantly westerly flow will limit moisture return and 
keep PoPs very low. Both models are consistent with the overall dry 
pattern through the week.

Expect temperatures to be generally about 10 degrees above normal 
for the upcoming workweek under the strong ridge. With clear skies 
and dry air, large diurnal temperature swings are likely with 
minimum temperatures into the 50s (and even the upper 40s across the 
terrain) overnight.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Once again the quiet weather will continue through the rest of the
early morning, today, and into tonight. Will have a bit clearer
skies tonight compared to last night meaning temperatures will
drop a few degrees cooler (into the 40's in NE Tennessee/SW
Virginia). But temperatures will rebound nicely and get close to
what we experienced last night.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)... 
A strong ridge over the eastern CONUS will result in continued dry, 
sunny conditions for the extended period. The upper ridge peaks on 
Tuesday then retrogrades and gets suppressed southward through the 
rest of the workweek. Models show a frontal boundary approaching the 
area by Friday. However, with very little moisture in place ahead of 
this boundary, will keep the forecast dry for Friday.

Temperatures will be near normal on Sunday with highs then climbing 
slightly above normal for the upcoming workweek under the strong 
ridge. With clear skies and dry air, temperatures will dip into the 
50s (and even the upper 40s across the terrain) overnight.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...There is just enough moisture 
and lift in an area of convergence associated with an inverted 
trough along the Appalachian spine for the formation of a narrow 
layer of strato cumulus mainly east of interstates 75 and 81 this 
afternoon. There may even be a brief shower over the higher 
terrain with the added support of orographic lift. Would expect 
the layer to gradually dissipate toward evening leaving a mostly 
clear sky in place. Cooler air which has filtered into the region 
will continue to slip south behind another weak frontal boundary 
due in the region overnight. The cooler push and some radiation 
will lead to low temperatures in the upper 40s across the northern
third of the forecast area to the 50s over the remainder of the 
region. Another beautiful Saturday is in store with dry air 
compliments of the prevailing northerly flow. The abundant 
sunshine will boost high temperatures to the upper 60s and lower 
70s across Southwest Virginia and northern sections of the 
Cumberland Plateau while much of the remainder of the forecast 
area warms into the middle and upper 70s.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)... A high amplitude 
midlevel ridge will be dominating the eastern Conus through the 
first half of next week. The surface high will drift from the 
Great Lakes to New England through Monday, and the easterly fetch 
off the Atlantic may spread some moisture across GA on Monday. The
NAM brings some precip to our GA/TN border counties, but other 
models keep it well to our south, and will go with that drier 
solution. Temps will be near normal on Sunday, rising to 3-6 
degrees above normal by Tuesday underneath the strong ridge. 

The upper ridge peaks on Tuesday, then retrogrades and gets 
suppressed southward through the rest of the week. This may open up 
an opportunity for a cold front to affect the area on Friday. 
However, the Gulf never opens up ahead of it as the ridge over TX 
will extend along the Gulf Coast. With the air mass ahead of the 
front expected to remain dry and stable, the forecast will take a 
skeptical approach to any rain chances with the front, and will 
remain precip-free on Friday.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
A weak boundary has pushed through earlier today which is helping
to cool things off just a bit overnight. We could see some
isolated fog in the sheltered areas, but nothing widespread is
expected at this time. Should be another pretty quiet day today
with the slight possibility of some showers developing along the 
higher terrain of the Southern Appalachian mountains during the 
daylight hours. Temperatures this afternoon look to be a few
degrees cooler than yesterday as the trough axis pushes a bit
further south over the area.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)... 
It will remain quiet through much of next week with a strong upper 
ridge building across the eastern US. Resultant strong subsidence 
will mean clear skies and dry air for the forecast area. This 
combination will finally result in a bit of a taste of fall with 
mild days of highs in the 70s and cooler nights due to radiational 
cooling. The coldest night appears to be Saturday night/Sunday 
morning with temperatures dipping into the mid 40s across southwest 
Virginia and far northeast Tennessee. With anomalously strong 
ridging continuing into next week, highs will again climb into the 
upper 70s/lower 80s by Tuesday. 

Surface high pressure and weak flow will suppress precipitation 
chances, and at this point, rain is not expected through at least 
midweek. October is climatologically our driest month, so this is 
not overly surprising. However, fuel moisture has been decreasing 
recently, and continued lower RHs will further dry fuels.

column. PWs at the surface are expected to be low between 0.25- 
0.5 inch which is approaching the 10th percentile of climatology. 
The low boundary layer moisture and clear conditions means we'll 
see large diurnal temperature swings with cool nights and pleasant
afternoons. While RH will be low and further contribute to drying
of fuels, winds are expected to be weak with high pressure in 
control. Temperatures this weekend will be closer to normal.

The upper ridge continues to strengthen Monday through Wednesday of 
next week with 500mb heights of 594-596 dm, around the 97th-99th 
percentile compared to climatology. Concurrently, surface high 
pressure will shift eastward resulting in a more southerly component 
to low-level flow. However, moisture return looks questionable and 
potentially limited to southern areas of the forecast area because 
of downsloping across the mountains, especially across northeast 
Tennessee and southwest Virginia where downsloping would be expected 
to be strongest. While there could be a stray rain shower across 
southern portions of the CWA early in the week as some slightly 
higher moisture arrives, the continued subsidence, weak flow, and 
low instability make PoPs unlikely. Any isolated rain shower which 
manages to defy the odds will be constrained to live a short life 
across the higher terrain. High temperatures next week should 
generally be about 8-13 degrees above normal with anomalously strong 
ridging in place.

The main story for the long term is the continued dry weather with 
ridging dominating the Eastern CONUS. Fuel moisture has been 
decreasing recently, and lower RH through the weekend will further 
dry fuels. As we head into October, our climatologically driest 
month of the year, this pattern of dry weather looks like it will 
continue.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Weak frontal boundary will
continue to progress southward through the forecast area today. As
a result slightly cooler temperatures will occur over SW VA and 
NE TN. Should cloud cover be thicker and stick around longer than
currently expected...temperatures will be a few degrees cooler. A
few showers will be possible mainly over the higher terrain along
the mountains of TN/VA. Unfortunately, most locations will remain
dry. Otherwise max daytime temperatures will be noticeably cooler
than previous days particularly north of I-40 and at least a few 
degrees cooler south of I-40. The more distinct temperature 
change will be Friday morning low temperatures which will fall 
into the 50s and lower 60s. 

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...An upper trough will dig 
into the northeast United States for Friday with northwest flow 
across the Tennessee valley/southern Appalachians. A weak inverted
trough develops across western North Carolina with pooling of 
moisture/instability to produce a chance of showers there.

For this weekend, building upper and surface ridging with a very dry 
airmass with PWs dropping below 0.50 inch. Plenty of sunshine will 
be the rule with large diurnal temperature swings.

For Monday through Wednesday, strong upper ridge remains across the 
southern Appalachians with surface ridge moving slowly east allowing 
for southerly winds to pull some moisture/instability return. PWs 
gradually increase to 1.25-1.5 inches. Feel overall moisture return 
may be a bit overdone given the dry air in place. Will bring a 
slight chance of convection by mid-week, but overall continued dry 
conditions.

Main concern for this weekend through early next week will be the 
dry afternoon relative humidity.

A cold front continues to approach from the northwest, and is
loacted across northern and western KY. The front is precip-free,
and should continue to be overnight as it moves into our area. The
forecast appears to be on the right track tonight, although 
hourly temps have been running a few degrees cooler than forecast.
Some slight tweaks will be made to account for this, but we 
should still end up with lows in the lower to mid 60s for most 
locations tonight. As has been the case the past few nights, 
patchy fog in the valleys will be possible but not widespread.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Thursday)...
With continued ridging across the Eastern CONUS and warm, moist 
air across the region, minimum temperatures tonight should remain 
10-15 degrees above normal. We may once again have some patchy fog
development near favored locations such as area lakes and rivers.

Troughing across the Great Lakes will act to move an area of low
pressure across the Northeast CONUS and drag a trailing cold 
front across our area on Thursday. The front first reaches the 
northwest corner of the forecast area on Thursday morning and 
travels southeastward through the day. As the result of a dry 
northerly flow ahead of the front, don't expect much, if any, 
precipitation. The main impact for our area will be a cooler and 
much drier airmass behind the front with lower relative humidity.
We'll say goodbye to the near-record highs in the short term with
max temperatures still expected to be above normal on Thursday 
ranging from the upper 70s to mid 80s for most areas.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...
H5 shortwave will move through the Great Lakes during the late 
week and help usher cooler air into our region, dropping 
temperatures to near normal values into the new work week. But 
once we get to next week, the models begin to diverge in their 
solutions, with the ECMWF maintaining a stronger ridge of high 
pressure over the southeastern U.S. than does the GFS or Canadian.
In fact, the Canadian lifts the ridge center to NJ/NY by middle 
of next week, opening us up to increased moisture here; but GFS 
and ECMWF focus the ridge over Arkansas, keeping us dry, and that 
looks to be the likely scenario. The ECMWF would only be warmer. 
Thus, rain chances are too low to carry any mention of precip 
throughout the extended.

.AVIATION...
Great flying weather expected this afternoon with VFR conditions
expected as high pressure remains in control. Light north to
northeast winds weaken tonight with MVFR fog possible near area
lakes and rivers which could lower visibilities at TRI between
08z-13z Thursday. Some guidance shows the potential for IFR fog at
TRI early Thursday, but believe this is too dense with the dry 
boundary layer and will only reduce visibilities to MVFR in the
TRI TAF. Any fog dissipates early after sunrise on Thursday with 
VFR conditions through the remainder of the period.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...The forecast shows no major 
changes from yesterday. Today will be nearly a carbon copy of 
yesterday's weather with well above normal temperatures...near 
record highs. Winds will be light. Overnight a weak frontal
boundary will slowly ooze into northwest portions of the forecast
area before sunrise. Limited moisture means that the front will
come in dry with little more than a wind shift from the north. 

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...The persistent ridge of the 
area will break down for Thursday and Friday with a series of short-
wave digging out an upper trough over the Great Lakes. This will 
allow a frontal boundary to move south into the region for Thursday.

Due to continued surface ridging into the Gulf and mid-level warm 
layer, instability will be quite limited with MLCAPEs of 200 J/Kg or 
less. Also boundary layer flow along and ahead of the frontal 
boundary will already be weak northerly, so little to no convergence 
along frontal boundary. Given these limiting factors, little to no 
convection anticipated for Thursday's frontal passage.

For Friday and early Saturday, upper trough deepens across the 
northeast United States with cooler 850mb temperatures and dry 
northwest winds dropping PWs to 0.5-0.75 inch for the weekend.

Upper trough lifts out for Sunday into early next week with ridging 
aloft strengthening. Dry conditions and warmer thickness/850mb 
temperatures will produce dry afternoon relative humidity for early 
next week.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Early this morning temperatures
were generally in the 60s under mostly clear skies and light
winds. Only a few high clouds were noted on satellite. A look at
the mid-level water vapor channel on GOES-16 shows extremely dry
air over the forecast area. This is echoed by forecast soundings.

As such, very warm daytime temperatures will occur today. In fact,
they will likely be 3 to 5 degrees cooler than the all-time
records. For reference...Knoxville's record high for today is 89,
Chattanooga's is 91, and Tri-Cities is 89. 

Overnight lows will be closer to seasonal normals. Dry weather
persists as well.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...A persistent ridge of high 
pressure will remain across the area through Wednesday night keeping 
warm mid-level temperatures and dry airmass over the Tennessee 
valley.

For Wednesday and Thursday, a series of short-waves will dive into 
southeast Canada/Great Lakes with associated frontal boundary 
pulling south across the Ohio/Tennessee valley by late Thursday.
Since flow ahead of the front will already be northerly, little if 
any convergence noted with FROPA. Also, mid-level temperatures 
remain warm keeping instability ahead of front quite limited 
(generally below 200 J/Kg). Given these factors, little to no chance 
of convection is expected with frontal passage.

Deeper upper trough for Friday and early Saturday with cooler 850mb 
temperatures pulling into the southern Appalachians. Dry northwest 
winds also expected with PWs dropping to 0.5-0.75 inch for the 
next weekend.  Quite dry indeed.
 
Upper trough lifts out for Sunday and Monday with a warming trend 
but continued dry conditions. Low afternoon relative humidity values 
expected this weekend and early next week.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...During this period, we will be 
under a weak upper level ridge, between tropical system Maria and 
the fading upper low along the central Gulf Coast.  We will also be 
under a low level ridge, with a light breeze through the period, 
generally having a dry northerly component.  With this pattern, the 
forecast should not be too far away from a persistence forecast. 
Will not include a mention of fog tonight in the forecast--there 
could be some localized fog, but even much of that will not get that 
thick, so not planning to mention it.  Guidance temps look good 
overall, and look to be close to persistence as well.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...Models in decent 
agreement overall, and forecast confidence is a bit above average 
for this time of year.  Persistent ridge of high pressure breaks 
down early continues over the area early, but then breaks down 
allowing a cold front to push through Thursday. Moisture very 
limited and not much forcing with this front, so will go dry for 
now. Cooler and drier air will push in behind the front, and the 
mid/upper level ridge will be building once again for the latter 
part of the period. No precipitation forecast for the extended 
period at this time, with a very warm start followed by more 
seasonable temperatures.

.DISCUSSION...
This morning we find ourselves a rare upper flow from the
southeast, between a weak upper low over the lower Miss Valley 
and a weak ridge over the northeastern US, with Hurricane Maria 
off the southeastern US coast. We should continue our dry trend 
this afternoon with very warm temps. Record high temps look safe 
overall for today, with KCHA 97, KTYS 94, and KTRI 91--most of the
valley is forecast generally in the upper 80s, so the 91 is the 
most threatened. Will stick with the forecast Max Temps for this 
afternoon and no other changes needed at this time.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Forecast remains relatively
unchanged as high pressure generally centered just east of the
Great Lakes Region remains in control. Only real change is that
mid-level dry air will work its way in from the east as Hurricane
Maria approaches the Carolinas today. This should mean less cloud
cover for our forecast area compared to yesterday. Highs will be 
in the upper 80s which is 8 to 10 degrees above normal. Calm 
conditions persist tonight with little to no cloud cover and lows 
in the upper 50s to low 60s, which is around 5 degrees above 
normal. 


.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...Persistent ridge of high 
pressure will dominate the weather across the Tennessee valley and 
southern Appalachians through the Thursday. An upper trough will dig 
into the Great Lakes and northeast United States for 
Thursday night and early Saturday before lifting.

This upper trough will pull a frontal boundary across the region for 
late Thursday and Thursday night.  Due to the persistent mid-level 
warm air associated with upper ridge and limited Gulf moisture 
return into the Tennessee valley, instability along and ahead of the 
front will be limited. Overall, front will move across the area dry.

Main effects from front passage will be cooler 850mb temperatures 
for the weekend. Cooler and more seasonal temperatures are expected 
for Friday through Sunday.

For Friday, an inverted trough into western North Carolina will keep 
a slight chance of showers for southwest North Carolina.

Upper trough lifts for late Saturday with riding re-establishing 
itself for next Sunday.

Due to continued dry ground across much of the area, will remain on 
the warmer side of guidance for highs through the extended.

night across the Southern Appalachian region. The ridge was able
to suppress convection to a large degree this afternoon and 
tonight the only cloud type around is a bit of cirrus in spots; 
compliments of Maria. Lows should dip into the upper 50s and lower

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Monday)...
The closed upper low near the Gulf Coast and the high pressure
ridge along the eastern seaboard will retrograde through this
period, but there will be virtually no change in the sensible
weather across the area compared to today. Above normal 
temperatures with no precip and light winds will persist through 
tomorrow. Will lean tomorow's high temperatures on the warm side 
of guidance and close to persistence as much of the TN Valley
hasn't seen rain in quite some time.

.LONG TERM (Monday Night through Sunday)...
Will see little change in area weather through Wednesday with 
high pressure continuing to dominate. This will keep conditions 
dry and temperatures warm. Highs are expected to climb well into 
the 80s across most valley locations both Tuesday and Wednesday. A
cold front remains on track to move through the area 
Thursday/Thursday night. This system looks less impressive with 
each model run. Moisture appears to be quite limited and the 
forecast will only have a few northern locations with POPs 
approaching 20. Dry and cooler air will move in behind the exiting
system on Friday but do see some differences in models for the 
Friday through Sunday time frame. The main questions are... will a
secondary surge of cold air move in and will an upper low well to
our north be able to affect the Southern Appalachian Region. 
Current trend is towards a mainly dry period with temperatures 
generally near to slightly below normal.

Stable forecast soundings, falling dewpoints in the past 24 hours,
and a downslope wind component in the 850-700 mb layer all point 
toward a dry day across the TN Valley. Forecast highs today are a
little higher than the latest MOS guidance, which seems 
reasonable given verification of high temps over the past few 
days and the dry soil conditions, especially in the northern half.
No changes are needed to the forecast this morning.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Early this morning, patchy fog
expected, especially across southeast Tennessee and southwest
North Carooina where recent rains occurred.

For today and tonight, weak upper trough over the Gulf coast
states will retro-grade west allowing ridging to build into the
area with mid-level temperatures warming. The sinking motion
around the ridge/warming mid-level temperatures will suppress
convection development. An isolated storm possible across the
southern Plateau this afternon, but overall dry conditions.

Another day of unseasonably warm temperatures. The relatively dry
ground and plenty of insolation will allow tempeatures to warm
above guidance.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...Long term forecast beginning 
to feel like a broken record. Little change as high pressure 
dominates. The only change to speak of is forecast looks to be 
trending drier in regards to Thursday/Friday cold front.

High pressure firmly in control Monday and Tuesday with no precip in 
sight and temps in the upper 80's. Went a degree or two above 
guidance on both days due to temp trends the past few days. On 
Tuesday high temps will flirt with record highs but no record temps 
in current forecast, but only a degree or two away. Still could see 
some cirrus bands approach our eastern mountains Tuesday afternoon 
from Hurricane Maria. By Wednesday high pressure begins to break 
down with upper trough swinging down into the Ohio River Valley but 
we stay dry and warm. 

Very little moisture to work with out ahead of approaching cold 
front on Thursday. Forecast has been getting drier and drier over 
the past few days. Only have slight chance POPs in for a few areas 
at this point. Actual front moves through late Thursday/early 
Friday. Friday temps drop a few degrees below normal behind the 
frontal passage. Most areas will see highs in the mid to upper 70s 
with lows on Friday night in the mid 50s. There are differences for 
Saturday. GFS now doesn't show the second surge of cold air on while 
the ECMWF still does. Saturday still looks nice no matter which 
model ends up being correct, but temperature forecast will depend on 
whether we see the second surge or not.

there may be a bit of fog will be at tri, but visibility may not
even descend into the mvfr category at this particular terminal

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)... 
The large high pressure ridge to our northwest will drift east and 
be positioned over the eastern Great Lakes tomorrow, while an upper 
low near the Gulf Coast will drift west. The resulting flow across 
the Appalachians will be easterly, with a greater downslope 
component than we have seen the past few days. This should have a 
stabilizing effect for our area tomorrow. Forecast soundings and 
convective parameters also show less potential for development 
tomorrow, so a dry forecast will be continued for the whole area on 
Sunday. Fog potential tonight will mainly be limited to areas that 
have a shower this afternoon/evening, like the Sequatchie Valley and 
SW NC valleys. High temps will continue to be above normal tomorrow, 
in the mid/upper 80s across the Valley.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)...
All remains quiet through at least Wednesday as high pressure 
continue to control area weather. This will keep the forecast dry 
with above normal temperatures. The weather pattern changes on 
Thursday as a weakening cold front pushes across the Southern 
Appalachian Region. There is minimal moisture and only limited 
energy associated with the front. As a result...expect to see an 
increase in cloud cover with only a slight chance of showers and 
thunderstorms. On Friday...a dry and cool air mass will push in 
behind the exiting frontal boundary. Confidence becomes quite low 
by the end of the extended...but could see an upper low drop into 
the Ohio Valley and this could rotate in some isolated 
convection... mainly along the East TN mountains for Saturday. For
now...will leave the rest of the area dry with near seasonal 
temperatures.

.SHORT TERM (Today through tonight)...The upper level flow should
be different today, changing from a NE flow down the spine of the
Appalachians, veering today to more of an easterly flow off the 
mountains. This flow along with some weak lift will favor better 
chances of storms across the central and southern valley this 
afternoon. Will keep the northern half of the valley dry for now, 
as the storm threat tapers off farther north where the lower 
levels are drier. Southern valley will likely have CAPE values 
over 1000 J/kg, and with dry air aloft, there could be some 
locally gusty outflow winds, but not expecting any severe storms.
 
Valley fog and lake fog are a little slower to get going this 
morning--temps are generally 1-2 degrees warmer, thereby taking 
longer to cool down and saturate. Think fog will go ahead and 
continue to form this morning and again late tonight, so will 
include some localized fog again tonight.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...Pretty much a persistence 
forecast through the majority of the long term with high pressure 
dominating the region but there is a change a coming...coming round 
the bend.  

High pressure over the Great Lakes leaves us warm and dry Sunday 
through Wednesday. No precip chances in the forecast during this 
time. Highs will be in the mid to upper 80s with lows in the low to 
mid 60s, which is above normal for this time of year. The only thing 
of interest during this period is latest model runs bring Hurricane 
Maria closer to the Outer Banks. If this plays out, we could see 
some of Maria's outer cirrus bands Tuesday afternoon/evening but 
that's about it.

On Wednesday high pressure begins to break down as an upper level 
trough swings down through the Great Lakes but we remain warm and 
dry. Thursday afternoon slight chance for showers and storms in for 
all areas as associated frontal boundary approaches our area. The 
frontal passage doesn't look to occur until Thursday night. Moisture 
is weak with this boundary so very little QPF anticipated at this 
time. Stronger shortwave drops down into the backside of the trough 
on Friday and digs the trough further south into our area. This wave 
will bring much cooler and drier air into the region, making it feel 
like fall again with highs in the low to mid 70s and lows in the 
upper 40s to mid 50s. As of now, looks like this second wave only 
brings cold and dry air, still not much moisture to work with. Only 
a slight chance POP in for NETN and SWVA.

summer, 80 degree plus heating. The dry air and radiation have 
allowed for some decent diurnal ranges the past few nights and 
tonight should be similar. Patchy fog looks good again as 
saturation occurs along the waterways later tonight.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Saturday)...Enough upslope
flow into western North Carolina and instability (MLCAPEs around
1000 J/Kg) to produce scattered showers and thunderstorms there
this afternoon. Since the storm motion is west southwest, some of
this activity may move into the far eastern Tennessee mountains
and especially southwest North Caroline through early this
evening. Around sunset, the activity will dissipate.

Persistent pattern of clear sky and calm winds to allow patchy fog
to develop, mainly near area lakes/streams, early Saturday
morning.

For Saturday, upper ridge will be over the Ohio valley into the
mid-Atlantic states with broad upper trough over the northern Gulf
coasts. The flow area these system will produce easterly upslope
flow into west North Carolina and Plateau. Again, enough
instability and orographic lift to warrant chance of
afternoon/early evening showers and thunderstorms over far eastern
Tennessee mountains, southwest North Carolina, and Plateau.

Ridging and generally dry ground will allow temperatures to warm
nicely again Saturday. Unseasonably warm high temperatures are
expected.

.LONG TERM (Saturday Night through Friday)...High pressure will 
dominate area weather through much of the extended.  As a 
result...will see generally dry conditions with above normal 
temperatures through Wednesday.  Thursday and Friday will see a 
pattern change with the approach of a weakening cold front. 
Confidence low on timing...and limited moisture and only weak lift 
is expected.  This should provide an increase in cloud cover with 
the chance of showers and thunderstorms remaining rather low and... 
for now...will keep POPs at around 20 percent for the end of the 
period.

Visible satellite imagery indicating that fog has burned off
across all of the area leaving clear skies throughout. Expect some
afternoon convection to develop across the higher terrain of East
Tennesee/SW NC. Mean flow out of the northeast will help to keep
any cells that do develop to track SW while remaining over the 
higher terrain this afternoon, although coverage is expected to be
modest at best. Did make slight adjustments to temps and sky cover

.SHORT TERM (Today through tonight)...At the beginning of this 
period, we are under a rare northeast flow aloft, between high 
pressure to our west and northwest over the Miss Valley and a trough 
to our east associated with tropical system Jose.  Short-range 
models show some deep convection developing today over the high 
terrain near the TN/NC state line during the afternoon heating, but 
with the flow from the northeast, much of this convection/precip 
will stay over this high terrain, riding down the ridgeline. The 
NE flow will proceed to push this convection across the Hiwassee 
and Ocoee Valleys in our extreme southeastern counties this 
afternoon. With the convection being driven by the diurnal 
heating, it should fade quickly this evening. Drainage winds again
tonight should favor a repeat of localized valley/lake fog late 
tonight. Will stick close to guidance temps.

.Long Term (Saturday through Thursday)...Once again, a quiet 
and uneventful long-term period in store but change is on the 
horizon. High pressure centered over the Great Lakes region will 
continue to dominate our weather through the extended, allowing for 
above normal temperatures and little to no rain chances. 

Have slight chance POPs to start the period Saturday afternoon 
across portions of southern plateau, SWNC, and our eastern 
mountains. Then no POPs through the rest of the week until Thursday. 
Highs Saturday through Wednesday will generally be in the mid to 
upper 80s, which is around 5 to 8 degrees above normal. Lows will be 
in the low to mid 60s, which is around 5 degrees above normal. High 
pressure breaks down on Thursday in response to an upper level 
trough moving across the Great Lakes. This trough has an associated 
frontal boundary that will make it's way through our area but beyond 
this long-term forecast. The front is across the Ohio River Valley 
on Thursday. By Thursday afternoon have slight chance POPs in for 
all areas as front draws closer. Highs on Thursday will be a few 
degrees cooler as flow becomes more zonal. Highs will be in the 
upper 70s to lower 80s.

.AVIATION...
High pressure over the area making for very light winds, with
local drainage winds being the rule. This will make for prime
cooling in the valleys and the cool air riding over the warm 
lakes will result in steam fog in a majority of these localized 
scenarios. KTRI has the best chances of being affected, and will 
go close to persistence with BR forecast for several hours. 
Thursday morning the vsby went down to 1/2 mile very briefly--will
take it down to 1SM this morning. At KTYS and KCHA might have 
some light fog briefly, but will keep them at P6SM, since they are
not in as favorable location as KTRI for this localized scenario.
By around 12z, the fog should mix out pretty quickly at KTRI as 
the sun warms the surface. This afternoon, storms are expected to
stay east of these sites, over the mountains.

.SHORT TERM (Today into tomorrow)...
Isolated showers and thunderstorms are forming (mostly along the
higher terrain) this afternoon. We should continue to see these
storms through the afternoon and into the evening hours. Storms
are slowly drifting to the south and not able to hang around for
too long due to the almost non existent shear over our forecast
area. Some of the storms could become strong, but widespread
strong/severe weather is not anticipated at this time. Expect to
see some more fog form in the overnight hours, especially in
sheltered locations and places that receive moderate rainfall 
this afternoon. Another similar story can be expected tomorrow 
with afternoon thunderstorms and slightly above average 
temperatures across the area.

.Long Term (Friday night through Thursday)...Quiet weather will 
continue through much of the long term period with strong ridging 
continuing over the area. Diurnal convection is possible Saturday 
with a bit of weak moisture moving into the area. Showers/storms 
will be limited and mainly over the southern portions of the 
forecast area. 

Highs will remain near to slightly above average through the 
forecast period with the strong ridging in place. Ridging does look 
like it will break down late in the extended period with a trough 
and associated frontal boundary moving in for Thursday.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Friday)...H5 high centered near
Indianapolis and a low pressure axis from coastal NC out to TS 
Jose has us beneath a northerly to northeasterly steering flow for
any isolated/scattered convection to be directed by. Best chances
of precip is over the Appalachians both afternoons. Temperatures 
will continue to run several degrees above normal.

.Long Term (Friday night through Wednesday)...There really isn't 
a whole lot to talk about during the the long term period as it 
looks very quiet. Quiet conditions can be attributed to the large 
area of high pressure generally centered over the Great Lakes 
area. The biggest story is the above normal temperatures we will 
see through the period due to the strong ridging. 

Highs will range from the mid to upper 80s which is around 5 to 8 
degrees above normal. Lows will range from the low to mid 60s which 
is around 5 degrees above normal. The only precip chances in sight 
occur on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday afternoon as the area of high 
pressure pulls in some weak moisture from Tropical Storm Jose. 
Moisture is very limited though and only result in slight chance 
POPs across portions of the Southern TN Valley and SWNC. Something 
to watch moving forward, it does look like the heat will break 
across the area but that is just beyond the current long term period.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...
Tonight, the isolated showers near the Plateau and mountains should 
be short-lived and dissipate with sunset. Fog will again be an issue 
tonight, mainly in valleys and near bodies of water as was the case 
last night, and will mention patchy fog in the forecast. An upper 
level low over SW VA today will track SE across NC tonight and be 
near the Outer Banks by tomorrow. This will place our area under a 
northerly flow through the column, which will actually help to 
increase moisture depth slightly as PW rises into the 1.3-1.5 inch 
range in forecast soundings. This should support a little more 
shower/storm activity in the afternoon than we have seen today, but 
most of it should remain near the terrain of the Plateau and 
mountains with a lack of forcing mechanisms. Warm temps will 
continue, with highs in the mid to upper 80s in the Valley. 

.LONG TERM....(Friday night through Wednesday)...
A strong ridge will build over the area for much of the extended 
period. This ridge will limit convection through the first half of
next week , but can not rule out isolated to widely scattered 
mainly afternoon/evening storms over the terrain. Ridge will begin
to break down late in the extended with cold front approaching 
from the west and Hurricane Maria moving north in the Atlantic, 
but model solutions vary on how fast this breaks down.

Abnormally high height values will keep temperatures above normal 
through the period with highs well into the 80s.

Showers are already developing just outside our area in SW VA and
srn WV, associated with an upper level low that will be drifting
SE through the day. The 12Z OHX sounding does not look promising
for much convection to develop with an inversion just above 850 mb,
but the 12Z RNK sounding appears more favorable with greater
moisture depth. Latest rapid update models show isolated coverage
of showers in SW VA and NE TN this afternoon, but less than the 
current forecast PoPs would suggest. The update will lower PoPs to
a slight chance in that area, while maintaining the slight chance
mention in the Plateau. Temperatures have been slow to rise due to
valley fog this morning, which will require some adjustments to
hourly temp grids, but forecast high temps in the 80s across the 
Valley appear on the right track.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Thursday)...A weak trough trapped 
between Mississippi Valley high pressure ridge and Tropical Storm 
Jose will be responsible for isolated to scattered convection 
today and Thursday. Since this weak trough is embedded in what is 
otherwise fairly high pressure, temperatures will continue to run 
above normal. But today will be greeted with patchy fog...some of
it dense in the west half of the area. Will avoid an advisory and
hope an SPS will suffice for this morning's fog.

.DISCUSSION...Overall forecast still on track with minor updates
to temperatures and rain chances through the night. Instabilities
have become limited with any showers drying out over the area...so
lowered rain chances to reflect this. Also lowered temperatures a
couple of degrees to become more in line with the cooler air
behind the showers and decreasing cloud cover. Otherwise...mostly
dry weather is expected through the rest of the night...with
patchy dense fog possible across the area.

.AVIATION...Dry air over the area will keep any convection weak
and limited to far southern areas. Have left out any mention of
showers at KTYS and KTRI through the night due to low coverage of
any further showers developing. Moisture will be present in the
low levels overnight...so included MVFR fog at KCHA and 
KTYS...though visibilities may need to be adjusted depending on 
how soon the clouds can move east of the area. KTRI was taken down
to IFR visibilities due to mostly clear conditions expected 
through the night. Wednesday...showers and thunderstorms are 
expected along the higher elevations of east TN with little to no 
impacts to any TAF site...so left mention out of TAF for now.

.SHORT TERM (Today into tomorrow)...
Line of showers and thunderstorms is continuing to move east 
into the Valley early this afternoon. As it moves into the Valley 
it will begin to run into drier air which should slow down it's 
progress and begin to decrease the coverage of storms. 
Mesoanalysis indicates that there is up to 1000 J/Kg of CAPE to 
work with, but little to no shear, and very little low level 
forcing means that severe weather is unlikely this 
afternoon/evening. Once these storms fizzle out we should see a 
bit of clearing in the clouds which means we should see another 
round of fog overnight, especially in locations that receive 
rainfall today. Another round of showers and thunderstorms looks 
possible tomorrow with the best chances being in the higher 
elevations along the terrain. Temperatures today and tomorrow will
continue the trend of the last several days of slightly above 
average for this time of year.

.Long Term (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
A strong ridge building into the region will control the local 
weather pattern through much of the extended period. With enough 
moisture in place through Saturday, diurnal showers and 
thunderstorms are possible each afternoon, especially across the 
higher terrain which will provide additional forcing. Drier 
conditions follow for early next week as the building high pressure 
cuts off the moisture flow to our area.

Temperatures through the extended period will be near or slightly 
above seasonal normals, topping out in the low to mid 80s each 
afternoon.

.Short Term...For the near term, GOES-16 Fog Channel and area
observations once again show fog development along the river
valleys and lakes. Some of the fog will be locally dense.

For Today, a weak short-wave over the western Ohio and Tennessee
Valley will move into the area this afternoon and tonight. Model
soundings show a marginally moist/unstable airmass with MLCAPEs of
1000 j/Kg. Low-level forcing is limited with this wave. Best
chance of convection today will be across the Plateau given the
orographic lift.

Another round of patchy fog development is expected early
Wednesday morning. 

.Long Term (Wednesday through Monday)...A slow moving upper trough 
over the forecast area will bring chance/slight chance of showers 
and thunderstorms in the wake of the weak frontal passage. The 
Appalachians will remain on the fringe of the high building into the 
region by Thursday. Thus, chances for showers and thunderstorms 
continues particularly for the higher terrain while valley locations 
have less chances to see measurable precipitation. Diurnal showers 
and thunderstorms persist into Saturday afternoon before drier 
conditions follow into early next week. 

Temperatures through the remainder of the week will be near or 
slightly above seasonal normals.

.SHORT TERM (Today into tomorrow)...
Once again we can expect to see similar conditions today to what
we saw yesterday with mostly sunny skies and slight above normal
temperatures. Light winds and mostly clear skies will allow for
some more fog to develop overnight in the sheltered locations.
Fog should not be too widespread, partially, because we will
begin to see increasing cloud coverage moving into tomorrow. A
trough moving to our north will help bring in more clouds and keep
temperatures a few degrees cooler. With the trough moving in we
could see a few isolated showers/thunderstorms tomorrow, but am
currently not expecting widespread precipitation with this weak
system for tomorrow.

.Long Term (Tuesday night through Monday)...High pressure over the 
coastal states will be present through the beginning of the work 
week...keeping moisture available...especially in areas south of 
I40. A weak boundary will move through the area on Wednesday...with 
scattered showers and thunderstorms possible in the afternoon. Lift 
will be weak...but enough instability will be present that can't 
count out convection developing. PW values are around the 90th 
percentile in far southern plateau...southern valley...and southwest 
NC...so would expect the greatest chance for development in these 
areas.

Behind the front...low level high pressure sets up over the Gulf 
Coast states...while an upper level trough and associated low 
pressure develop. Wednesday night...winds behind the frontal 
boundary will allow for northerly flow to briefly set up over the 
area through Thursday night with PW values decreasing to between the 
median average and 75th percentile. With instability also 
lowered...would expect only scattered showers and isolated 
thunderstorms to develop. 

By Friday morning...low level flow will transition to out of the 
east due to the flow around the low level high pressure. This will 
allow for greater warm air and moisture advection to areas south of 
I40 through Saturday. Upper level forcing will be weak Friday and 
Saturday...but enough moisture and instability will be present for 
weak diurnal showers and isolated thunderstorms to develop each 
afternoon. The greatest chance for this convection will be in areas 
south of I40 where the greatest advection is located. 

Sunday and Monday...the upper level trough will be east of the 
Appalachians...and moving towards Hurricane Maria which is expected 
to be off the FL coast. High pressure behind this trough will allow 
for mostly clear skies and dry weather to remain through the
weekend.

.SHORT TERM...Area observations and satellite shows patchy fog,
some locally dense, across the area. The fog is mainly restricted
across the area waterways.

For Today and tonight, ridging will remain across the Tennessee 
valley with mid-level warm layer capping convection over the area.
Patchy fog is once again expected acrsos the region early Tuesday
morning.

.Long Term (Tuesday through Sunday)...An upper level trough and 
associated cold front shift southeast toward the Southern 
Appalachian region on Tuesday bringing a small chance of a shower or 
thunderstorms to the Cumberland Plateau. The rest of the long term 
period, both the ECMWF and the GFS try to advect this very weak area 
of low pressure aloft anticyclonically around a persistent Eastern 
U.S. upper ridge. In the lower levels, higher dewpoint air never 
really becomes established with the flow veering from northerly 
through southeasterly into the weekend as the 700 and 850 mb ridge 
strengthens over the southeastern states. It appears that the 
superblend probability of precipitation is a little too high through 
much of the extended forecast and broadbrushes pops across the 
entire forecast area. Due to the low level flow pattern and the 
strengthening ridge presented by both medium range models, tried to 
limit the chance for convection to higher terrain features right 
through the weekend. It looks like more above normal warmth is in 
store in this pattern with highs in the 80s and lows in the 60s.

Another pleasant weather day is expected with conditions similar
to what we saw yesterday. High temperatures, again, are expected
to be about 2-5 degrees above normal for this time of year. Winds
will remain light through the day and into the night. The light
winds and mostly clear skies will allow for fog formation once
again overnight into tomorrow morning. Once the fog clears out we
will see similar conditions tomorrow.


.Long Term (Monday night through Sunday)...
High pressure will be present over the southern MS 
Valley...weakening and moving towards the Gulf coast through the 
middle of the work week. The flow around this high pressure will 
allow for mid level flow from the north...which will keep warm air
and moisture advection limited. At the same time...a weak trough 
and boundary will move from the west to east across the Great 
Lakes region. Diurnal showers and thunderstorms are possible ahead
of this boundary on Tuesday...though moisture is limited and 
instabilities are weak. Not expecting anything severe with this 
convection.

The frontal boundary is expected to be through the area on 
Wednesday...with scattered showers and thunderstorms again possible. 
Models are trying to dry this system out...but have kept in chance 
precipitation chances for now due to the upper level lift present 
and instabilities at or above 2000 J/kg across much of the area. 
With the very weak low and mid level winds in place...would expect 
little movement from anything that does form.

Thursday through Saturday...low and mid level winds transition to 
out of the east...with diurnal showers and thunderstorms possible 
each afternoon...mainly in the higher elevations. Enough lift and 
slightly more moisture is present to warrant chance precip chances 
in areas south of I40 and slight chance precip chances in areas 
north of I40.

Little change in airmass through the extended will keep temperatures 
in the upper 70s to mid 80s each day. Temperatures could cool a 
couple of degrees behind the frontal boundary passage Wednesday into 
Thursday...with temperatures near normal through the end of the 
weekend.

early Monday morning. Expect patchy fog, some locally dense,
mainly nearly waterways.

Otherwise, ridging surface and aloft will remain with model

moisture into the region from the Gulf of Mexico. Maintained a dry 
forecast for the first couple days of the extended on Monday and 
Tuesday. However, used the medium through high chance pops for some 
showers and thunderstorms on Wednesday as a weak trough edges 
southeast into the Southern Appalachian region. The weakness in the 
upper level pressure pattern hangs around through the end of the 
forecast period encouraging slight and low chance probabilities for 
convection in a sufficiently unstable atmosphere across the 
southeastern quarter of the nation. The pattern will be more

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...The influence of the upper
ridge and associated surface high pressure will provide a mostly
clear sky overnight. Patchy fog development will occur with good
radiational cooling along with calm winds. Fog will develop in 
favorable areas similar to this morning. A couple hours after
sunrise the fog will dissipate leaving scattered clouds and
temperatures warming into the lower and mid 80s.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)...High pressure over 
the northeastern US will weaken and move east. A weak low pressure
system moving through Canada will swing a frontal boundary 
through the Ohio Valley...while at the same time a trough will 
begin to deepen over the western US. The frontal boundary will 
approach the area by Wednesday...with scattered showers and 
thunderstorms Wednesday afternoon and evening. Weak lift is 
present with limited instabilities...so expecting very light 
rainfall totals along with no possibility for severe storms. The 
boundary is expected to be east of the area by Thursday 
morning...with upper level high pressure developing. The deep 
trough over the western US will begin moving eastward with a low 
pressure and frontal boundary developing across the MS Valley. 
Ahead of this low...diurnal showers and thunderstorms are expected
Thursday afternoon through Saturday afternoon...mainly along the 
higher elevations...with no severe storms again expected. 

Tropical Depression Fifteen is in the Atlantic with a westward 
progression expected through the week. Long term models are showing 
the path to curve to the north and impact the Carolina coast by the 
end of the weekend and the beginning of next week.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
There will be very little change to the pattern over the next 24
hours as high pressure from the surface through 700 mb remains
stationary over the WV/OH/western PA region. Thus, the forecast
will follow persistence with a slight warming trend. High-res 
GOES-16 microphysics imagery shows fog is isolated to valleys this
morning, much less than yesterday, so no advisory will be needed.
Forecast soundings show a stable column and a very light flow 
today, although the HRRR develops isolated afternoon showers. It 
did the same yesterday so it will be ignored. A warming trend will
continue, with some mid 80s in the central and southern Valley 
today. More valley fog will be possible tonight.

.LONG TERM...
At the beginning of this period, we will be in a quiet pattern with 
ridges both at the surface and aloft.  The closest upstream cold 
front will be well to the west, stretching NNW-SSE from Wisconsin to 
Texas.  To our east in the Atlantic, Tropical system Jose will be 
moving northward off the Carolina coast.  Looks like the upper ridge 
will hold in place for most of the duration of this period, although 
it looks like we will have some chances for scattered afternoon 
convection on the plateau by Tuesday afternoon and across more of 
the area Wed - Fri afternoons.  We should have a weak upper level 
disturbance push through the ridge around Wednesday helping to get 
more lift and weak storms going.  After the cool readings so far 
this September, this extended forecast looks to have temps closer to 
normal, as the main frontal boundaries stay away to our northwest.

Looking well ahead, at the end of the 00Z operational GFS, it shows 
a tropical system on Day 10 (a week from Monday) moving into GA, 
that is this verified could affect us. However, most GFS 18z 
ensemble members have this system curving northward sooner than the 
00z Operational GFS, staying farther east, with a path that would 
have little impact on our area. This tropical system is the Tropical 
Disturbance, now out in the middle of the Atlantic, about 12N/47W. 
We can keep watching this one, but it's a long way away right now.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...
Diurnal cumulus will dissipate this evening leaving us with a 
clear night. With a calm wind and clear sky, we may have some 
patchy fog once again late tonight and early Saturday morning. 
With lots of sunshine on Friday and slightly drier soils, don't 
anticipate fog being as widespread or dense as on Friday morning, 
but could still have some localized dense fog, especially in the 
favored areas such as sheltered valley and rivers. Low temperatures
should be near the dew point in the upper 50s to lower 60s.

High pressure centered over the Eastern CONUS will keep things dry
for the most part in the short term. Diurnal heating will lead to
afternoon cumulus development and possibly an isolated shower or
thunderstorm (10%-20%) across the higher elevations on Saturday.
However, with soundings indicating a stable layer aloft, think the
potential is very low. It should be a very nice day once again
with plenty of sunshine. For temperatures, most models indicate
850mb temperature increasing a degree or two, so anticipate max
temperature will be about 1-3 degrees warmer on Saturday.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...
The return to warm weather will continue through the rest of the 
weekend and through the upcoming work week. Warm weather will be 
mostly brought on by a ridge of high pressure expected to sit over 
the southern United States/Mexico throughout the forecast. It will 
not be a particularly strong ridge, but will help keep widespread 
showers/thunderstorms out of the area. Temperatures through the long 
term portion of the forecast are expected to max out about 1-5 
degrees above normal for this time of year, and aiding this warmer 
weather will be the mostly sunny to partly cloudy skies as well. 
That being said there are a few chances for rain in the forecast...A 
few days we could see enough Gulf moisture get trapped under the 
ridge and warm enough temperatures that some showers/thunderstorms 
could develop over the higher terrain. More widespread rain chances 
will come in the second half of the work week as the ridge begins to 
break down as a trough moves in from the west. With the weakening 
ridge we could see some more widespread precipitation in the 
afternoon, but chances remain relatively low. Much better chances 
for rainfall will come just beyond the end of this 7-day forecast as 
the trough continues to move closer.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Dense fog will be possible in some spots this morning, but an area
of clouds across parts the Valley may prevent it from being 
widespread enough for an advisory. A SPS has been issued to 
address the fog. Fog will likely persist for a few hours after 
sunrise due to the low sun angle, possibly until 10 am in spots. 
The rest of the day should be mostly sunny as high pressure 
centered over OH/western PA extends across the Appalachians, with 
temperatures close to normal for mid-September. The NAM shows some
showers developing in the NC mountains this afternoon, but these
should stay to our east thanks to a deep westerly flow through the
colmun and a midlevel inversion acting as a cap. Patchy fog will
continue to be included in the forecast for tonight. 

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...
After several days of clouds and light rain, a nice period of 
improved weather will follow as pressure rises with a building 
ridge. Moisture will remain rather shallow as well. There will be 
some weak instability present which may allow for the development 
of a shower or thunderstorm over the higher terrain on the North 
Carolina border and across the Cumberland Plateau in Southeast 
Tennessee. By the end of the long term period on Wednesday and 
Thursday, a slightly stronger southerly flow will develop as 
another amplified upper trough builds into the Mississippi Valley.
Therefore, kept some slight and small chance pops on the major 
terrain features as increasing moisture and healthy daytime 
heating leads to higher instability. Temperatures will be a few 
degrees through the extended forecast with highs mainly in the 80s
and lows in the upper 50s and 60s.

Midlevel cloud cover will make for a very difficult fog forecast

the most likely sites to clear out and thus have best fog

broken/overcast clouds that should keep vis VFR or perhaps
temporarily MVFR. Overall forecast confidence is low however, and

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...
As the remnant low of Irma moves northeast away from our region, 
cloud cover should decrease tonight as subsidence keeps us mainly
free of mid to high level clouds. Antecedent moist soil 
conditions from recent rainfall along with clearing conditions 
will favor areas of fog development late tonight and early Friday 
morning. Expect minimum temperatures to be near dew point 
temperatures tonight in the upper 50s to lower 60s which is close 
to normal for this time of year.

Any fog should dissipate early Friday as boundary layer mixing
mixes in drier air aloft. High pressure will be in control with
ridging developing across the Eastern CONUS leading to mostly
clear conditions with only some afternoon cumulus expected. Max 
temperatures are expected to be within a couple of degrees of MAV
guidance which will be near seasonal normals in the upper 70s to 
mid 80s for most.

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Thursday)...
Ridging aloft keeps warm temperatures across the forecast area 
through for the extended part of the forecast. High pressure sets up 
over the east and southeast states Saturday and continue through mid 
week. Tropical system Jose will be off the Florida coast at the 
beginning of the extended period and get close to the North Carolina 
coast sunday night through Tuesday and mid Atlantic Wednesday. A 
cold front moves into the Ohio Valley Monday but begins to weaken 
Tuesday. Wednesday southerly flow around the ridge increases as the 
high pressure area tries to shift east. With the moisture increase 
there will be a slight chance of showers northeast Tennessee 
mountains Monday and Tuesday and then in the southwest Wednesday...higher
elevations on Thursday. Highs will be in the lower to mid 80s a 
few degrees above normal through the period.

.DISCUSSION...
Morning satellite and surface observations show the remnant low 
of Irma located across SE Ohio. WV imagery indicates dry air and 
subsidence aloft across the Tennessee Valley and this is 
reflected in forecast soundings showing very shallow moisture and 
an inversion near 600mb. A few areas of vorticity maxima are 
rotating around the low this morning helping to generate a few 
light rain showers across the region, but lift is very weak. As 
the day progresses, this low should move to the northeast taking 
the best lift with it. This will result in decreasing rain chances
through the afternoon with some clearing sky conditions expected 
from SW to NE across the forecast area this afternoon. However,
cannot rule out a few light rain showers remaining across 
northeast TN/southwest VA late this afternoon and into the early 
overnight hours.

Made no adjustments to the temperature and dew point forecast

.AVIATION...An upper trough brings some relatively poor flying
weather to the terminals today. However, conditions this morning
may actually hold in a vfr condition even with a few showers
around except at tri where visibilty and ceiling may be in the
mvfr category for a period. The light showers may be around
through much of the morning but probability is low enough at each
terminal that maintained a vicinity wording. Weather improves most
of the Great Valley during the afternoon. Then vfr weather will be
the rule through much of the evening. However, saturated
conditions will probably develop around 06z or later so included
some fog and even an ifr ceiling at tri.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...So the old tropical system that
came on shore a few days ago is still in the Eastern U.S. having
merged with another, weaker migratory trough associated with the
prevailing mid latitude westerlies. The good news is the trough
continues to gradually weaken as it shifts slowly east. The
feature should be largely east of the Southern Appalachians by
Friday, but before that happens we will deal with another mostly
cloudy and seasonably cool day with highs in the 70s. The mass of
moisture over the region will be lifted into a pattern of widely 
scattered to scattered light showers with a greater likelihood of
seeing some of the light rain over the northern third of the 
forecast area. There will still be a little light rain around 
tonight; mainly in this same northern section but any 
precipitation will be fading away after midnight.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...The main story for the 
long term period will be the abrupt shift to abnormally warm 
temperatures over the weekend. A large high pressure ridge will be
over the Southeast through most of the period, providing dry 
conditions, mostly clear skies, and high temperatures that are 
expected to be 3-6 degrees above normal for mid-September - quite 
a change from the cool temperatures we have had so far this month.
Toward the end of the period, the models differ on the potential 
breakdown of the ridge, with the ECMWF being faster to do so that 
the GFS, and bring a front into the OH Valley. The latest trend 
suggests this front will stay well to our north as it runs into 
the Southeast ridge , so will drop the PoPs from Tuesday and have 
just a slight chance for Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Broad low pressure area left
over from Irma now over the Ohio Valley continues to spin and
bring in some light rain showers across plateau and central valley
areas at mid afternoon. Temperatures today ranged widely from the
mid 50s on the southern Plateau to the upper 70s in the far
northeast where skies were mostly sunny. The system will slowly 
rotate weak shortwaves around it as it moves east and northeast 
toward the northeast states. This will increase rain chances 
tonight and Thursday morning...however rainfall amounts will be 
very light. Skies will be mostly cloudy tonight and Thursday 
morning. Skies will slowly begin to clear from the southwest by 
afternoon with highs ranging through the 70s.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...Warmer temperatures 
and mostly clear skies are expected through the weekend as high 
pressure builds across the area. Near to above normal temps will 
return, with highs in the low to mid 80s from Friday through early 
next week. After Sunday, there are some model differences, but the 
general consensus is that a weak front will approach the mid 
Atlantic late Monday. For our area, this will redirect surface flow 
out of the south and help pull moisture back into the area. This 
will bring a slight chance for diurnal showers and maybe a 
thunderstorm both Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon.

and spread some light showers around it into western parts of the
area with best rain chances Cumberland Plateau and southern valley
and then moving farther north by late today. Have lowered cloud
cover slightly and rain chances for next few hours. Most of the
area will have no to low chance pops except plateau and south
valley shifting to northern plateau and southwest Virginia by
sunset. Actual rainfall amounts will be light. Temperatures now in
the 50s to upper 60s should rise into the lower 60s mountains and
plateau to as warm as mid 70s lower elevations in the northeast
where the sun will be out longer. Updated forecast sent.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...There is still a fair amount of
spin ongoing over the Southeastern U.S. this morning. Model
forecasts pick up on at least three short waves in association
with the deep low pressure system. The first couple of waves
should bring some light showers to western sections of the
forecast area including the Cumberland Plateau and Southeast
Tennessee this morning. As the upper low gets picked up in the
main westerly flow, it will gradually shift east through the short
term increasing the chance for a shower across Central East
Tennessee from mid day into the afternoon. Southwest Virginia and
Northeast Tennessee will probably not see any rain until late in 
the day and more likely, tonight with the eastward migrating low 
pressure system. Once again, high temperatures will be warmest 
over Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee where southerly 
flow across the terrain leads to warming and drying and associated
increased insolation. Deep moisture with the upper low keeps 
western sections a few degrees cooler. 

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...The midlevel circulation 
will be located over OH by 12Z Thu, with our northern sections 
still under its influence, with near saturation up to 600 mb and 
cool 500 mb temps. But as the low pulls farther to the NE through 
the day, drier air aloft and midlevel stabilization will bring an 
end to rain chances by the evening. Cloud cover will keep northern
sections cool, with highs in the upper 60s to lower 70s, while 
mostly sunny skies south will bring temps there into the upper 
70s.

Warmer temperatures and mostly clear skies can be expected throught 
the weekend as the models agree on a strengthening high pressure 
ridge through the mid and upper levels that will extend from the 
TX/LA coast into the OH Valley region through Sunday. After a long 
spell of below normal temps of late, above normal temps will return, 
with highs in the lower to mid 80s for most of the Valley for Friday 
through Tuesday. There is model disagreement on the handling of Jose 
and how fast the ridge breaks down next week. With uncertainty high, 
will maintain the previous forecast of slight chance PoPs on Monday 
and Tuesday associated with the suppression of the ridge and the 
approach of a weak front depicted by the ECMWF.

.AVIATION...An impulse contained within the Mid South upper low
will rotate northeast across the Southern Appalachian region
generating some light showers over the Great Valley. The light
precipitation and lower flight conditions will impact cha
initially with likely the worst flying weather. It looks like mvfr
ceilings and visibility are a good possibility at cha and there is
a smaller chance for ifr conditions. The southerly flow ahead of
the low pressure center won't allow for any extended period of
lower ceilings at tys and when the light rain moves in across
Central East Tennessee, flight weather may remain vfr. Once again,
tri will have the best weather for flying operations today with
downsloping keeping the lower ceilings out of the picture until
this evening when some light rain is possible with the slowly
advancing disturbance.

Remnants of Irma continue to push west of the area. Wrap around
cloud cover will continue over southern portions of the area while
downsloping winds off the mountains will result in clearer skies
across the northern valley. Scattered showers remain possible
under the cloud cover overnight, but PoPs should remain low. The
low pressure system formerly know as Irma will shift back towards
the northeast on Wednesday and move up the Ohio River Valley. This

Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED
National Weather Service Morristown TN
451 AM EDT Tue Sep 12 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Tropical depression Irma is over
East Central Alabama early this morning and will again be the main
driver of weather conditions over the forecast area today. The
higher resolution mesoscale models do a better job of showing how
important that expanse of higher terrain along the Tennessee and 
North Carolina border is in limiting rainfall intensity across 
much of the Great Valley when a strong easterly flow is present in
the region. Irma will provide those easterly winds today 
generating more warming and drying in the first few thousand feet 
off the surface. Therefore, tried to scale back pops a bit for 
showers today from Central East Tennessee northeast through the 
Tri-cities area. Maintained likely or categorical pops on higher 
terrain features and across much of Southeast Tennessee and 
Southwest North Carolina where upslope flow, and less mountainous 
terrain upstream won't allow for the adiabatic warming seen 
farther north through the Great Valley. The probability of 
precipitation will be gradually decreasing through the day and 
into the overnight hours for the entire region as Irma continues 
to drift away to the west. Wind speed will continue to be a factor
through late morning in the lower elevations and should continue 
a little while longer into the early afternoon for higher terrain.
Therefore, kept the wind advisory in place today. High 
temperatures will be well below normal in the 60s across much of 
Southeast Tennessee, Southwest North Carolina, and on the 
Cumberland Plateau today. It won't be quite as cool farther 
northeast through the valley with highs ranging from the upper 60s
to the lower and middle 70s.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...The mid/upper level 
circulation will track NE from West TN across the OH Valley on 
Wednesday and Wednesday night. Model soundings show deep moisture 
for the western half of our area, while the eastern half will be 
under a downslope southerly flow and under the dry slot of the 
jet. Thus there is expected to be a sharp gradient of rain chances
and QPF on Wednesday (likely west, slight chance east). As the 
circulation reaches OH, the flow turns more SW and the jet moves 
to our east, which should end the downslope flow and bring rising 
PoPs (likely) for the evening for northern sections. With little 
dynamic forcing and saturation below 500 mb, light rain/drizzle is
expected. Precip will end Thursday morning from SW to NE as the 
low pulls farther away.

419 AM EDT Tue Sep 12 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Tropical depression Irma is over
East Central Alabama early this morning and will again be the main
driver of weather conditions over the forecast area today. The
higher resolution mesoscale models do a better job of showing how
important that expanse of higher terrain along the Tennessee and
North Carolina is in limiting rainfall intensity across much of
the Great Valley when a strong easterly flow is present in the
region. Irma will provide those easterly winds today generating
more warming and drying in the first few thousand feet off the
surface. Therefore, tried to scale back pops a bit for showers 
today from Central East Tennessee northeast through the Tri-cities
area. Maintained likely or categorical pops on higher terrain
features and across much of Southeast Tennessee and Southwest
North Carolina where upslope flow, and less mountainous terrain
upstream won't allow for the adiabatic warming seen farther north
through the Great Valley. The probability of precipitation will be
gradually decreasing through the day and into the overnight hours
for the entire region as Irma continues to drift away to the west.
Wind speed will continue to be a factor through late morning in
the lower elevations and should continue a little while longer
into the early afternoon for higher terrain. Therefore, kept the
wind advisory in place today. High temperatures will be well 
below normal in the 60s across much of Southeast Tennessee, 
Southwest North Carolina, and on the Cumberland Plateau today. It
won't be quite as cool farther northeast through the valley with
highs ranging from the upper 60s to the lower and middle 70s.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...The mid/upper level 
circulation will track NE from West TN across the OH Valley on 
Wednesday and Wednesday night. Model soundings show deep moisture 
for the western half of our area, while the eastern half will be 
under a downslope southerly flow and under the dry slot of the 
jet. Thus there is expected to be a sharp gradient of rain chances
and QPF on Wednesday (likely west, slight chance east). As the 
circulation reaches OH, the flow turns more SW and the jet moves 
to our east, which should end the downslope flow and bring rising 
PoPs (likely) for the evening for northern sections. With little 
dynamic forcing and saturation below 500 mb, light rain/drizzle is
expected. Precip will end Thursday morning from SW to NE as the 
low pulls farther away. 

Through the rest of the forecast period, a large high pressure 
ridge will be building over the Midwest, with a gradually 
eastward movement. This will provide dry conditions and mostly 
clear skies each day, with temperatures warming closer to normal 
or slightly above normal for this time of year, in the upper 70s 
to mid 80s for highs.

321 PM EDT Mon Sep 11 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...
Irma will continue to impact the area through Tuesday. Not much
change vs. previous forecast with regards to impacts for our area.
The low pressure center is expected to track across GA and AL
towards west TN through Tuesday. Winds will continue to increase 
through the rest of the afternoon and evening hours, topping out
with gusts over 50 mph across the highest terrain. Valley
locations will likely see gusts of 40-50 mph. A wind advisory
remains in effect through tomorrow afternoon for the entire
forecast area. Already seeing some gusts over 40mph in the higher
terrain of NE GA/SW NC, so will have to continue to monitor
observations throughout the evening to ensure gusts stay below
high wind warning criteria at the highest elevations. Latest QPF 
forecast from WPC indicates a period of heavier rain across the 
lower Cumberland Plateau from 00-06Z, so have increased storm 
total rainfall amounts slightly across this area to just around 3"
in Marion County. With this event being of a longer duration, 
river levels and soil moisture should be able to handle this 
amount without widespread flooding problems, although localized 
heavier amounts are possible and will need to be monitored. Drier 
air wrapping around the circulation and a continued downslope flow
off the mountains on Tuesday will result in lowering rain chances
and lighter precip for most areas.


.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...The remnants of 
Irma are expected to be centered around the MS Valley Tuesday 
night and will lift northeast Wednesday through Thursday night. We
should continue to see clouds/showers especially western portions
of the area Tue night into early Wednesday, then spreading across
the rest of the area later Wednesday and especially Wed night 
before diminishing from southwest to northeast Thursday/Thursday 
night. Will carry highest PoPs Wed night most areas. High pressure
surface and aloft is forecast to build in behind this system, 
with drier conditions expected for the Friday through Monday time 
frame.

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
321 AM EDT Mon Sep 11 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today through Tuesday)...
Not much has changed in the expected impacts of Irma over East TN.
The low pressure center is expected to take a turn toward the NW
and track across SW GA to N AL to West TN through Tuesday.
Easterly low level winds north of the circulation will increase
sharply around midday today - up to 55 kts at 850 mb at 00Z - 
creating a downslope flow that will likely create a precip shadow 
for the northern and central TN Valley into the evening. The main 
change from previous forecasts will be to lower QPF amounts in 
that area. Southern Valley locations are still expected to have 
storm total amounts of 2-2.5 inches. With a duration of 12 hours 
or more, river levels and soil moisture should be able to handle 
this amount without widespread flooding problems, although 
localized heavier amounts are possible and will need to be 
monitored. The Wind Advisory will not be changed, although the 
northern and central Valley, SW VA, and northern Plateau will 
likely be on the low end of Advisory criteria (26 mph sustained or
40 mph gust). Dry air wrapping around the circulation and a 
continued downslope flow on Tuesday will result in lowering rain 
chances and much lighter precip for all areas.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Sunday)...
The low pressure of the remnants of Irma are expected to be 
around the MS Valley Tuesday night through Wednesday morning. SW 
flow will be over the area from this low...keeping enough low and 
mid level clouds around for mostly cloudy skies through most of 
the day Wednesday. The low pressure will then begin to move to the
northeast By Wednesday night...moving close enough to the 
southern Appalachians to bring a brief period of moisture to the 
area. Scattered showers are possible moving southwest to northeast
through the area Wednesday night through Thursday morning. 

As the low pressure makes its way north of the area Thursday 
afternoon...low and mid level flow will transition to out of the 
west. This will limit the moisture advection to the area and allow 
for higher pressure to develop along the Gulf coast states. Plenty 
of dry air will then move into the upper levels...limiting cloud 
cover and allowing temperatures to slowly warm each day to near 
normal. Friday afternoon...enough instability is present for diurnal 
showers and isolated thunder along the higer elevations. 

Saturday and Sunday...a frontal boundary associated with a trough 
moving through the Great Lakes will begin to move through the MS 
Valley and approach the area. With this boundary to the west...and 
Jose forging a path through the Atlantic through the east...the 
southern Appalachians will be under high pressure. Clear skies and 
warm temperatures are expected through both days.

.AVIATION...
The impacts of Irma will begin to be felt later today and tonight
in the TN Valley, with gusty winds being the main aviation impact.
Winds are expected to increase sharply in the early to mid
afternoon hours as the center of the system continues a NW track
into GA. Peak wind gusts around 40 kts are expected around 00Z at
CHA, with slightly lower gusts at TYS and TRI, in the 30-35 kt
range. Rain will lower vis and cigs to predominantly MVFR at CHA
and TYS in the late afternoon/evening, with downslope wind effects
likely keeping cigs/vis higher (VFR) at TRI. Forecast confidence
is high on winds but low on how vis/cigs will play out.

318 PM EDT Sun Sep 10 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today and tomorrow)...
Quiet and pleasant weather will continue for one more day as 
sunny skies, dry air, and light winds out of the north continue to
be the main story. Once again temperatures will likely be similar
to what we saw yesterday. As we move into tonight and especially 
into tomorrow our weather pattern will start to be dominated by 
whatever remains of Hurricane Irma. Will likely begin to see an 
increase in mid/low level clouds tomorrow, and as we move into 
the afternoon hours the precipitation and winds will begin to pick
up. Precipitation will begin in the south and spread northward as
the afternoon continues. The winds are a bit tougher to time out,
especially with the more complex terrain in our forecast area. 
Current forecast soundings and models suggest that 850mb winds 
will be pretty strong (definitely in wind advisory criteria and 
some of the highest elevations could see high wind warning 
criteria met as well). Have the entire forecast area in a wind 
advisory tomorrow, but have the higher terrain of the Southern 
Appalachian mountains starting their wind advisory a bit earlier 
and continuing longer than the advisory down in the Valley 
counties. 

.LONG TERM (Tomorrow night through Saturday)...
Categorical and likely POPs to start the period as the now 
depression, formerly known as Irma, moves northward into Georgia 
and then Alabama Monday night. Moderate to locally heavy rainfall 
possible to start the night Monday but transitioning to 
light/moderate showers late in the night/early Tuesday morning as 
downsloping winds over our eastern mountains help to dry us out a 
little. Still looks like the southern valley and southwest NC will
see the highest rainfall totals Monday night with amounts from 1 
to 1.5 inches. NETN and SWVA should see the least with around a 
quarter of an inch. The central valley will see around half an 
inch. Again, some areas along the foothills may only end up with a
few tenths of an inch due to strong downsloping winds. 

A wind advisory has now been issued for our whole CWA as the wind-
field from the depression remains quite strong over our area, which 
is largely due to the tight pressure gradient that sets up because of 
an area of high pressure to our north and the depression to our 
west. Winds will gust between 30 and 40 mph across valley locations, 
40 to 50 mph across elevations above 3000 feet, and potentially up 
to 60 mph above 5000 feet. On Tuesday the center of the circulation 
drifts toward Memphis and showers become lighter and more 
intermittent across our area with winds settling down by Tuesday 
afternoon. Clouds and cool temps will remain across areas west of I-
75 with perhaps a peak of sunshine or two across far NETN and SWVA 
Tuesday afternoon as some drier air tries to work in. Because of 
this, the western portions of our CWA will have temps in the upper 
60s to low 70s while eastern areas will be in the mid to upper 70s. 

Tuesday night the low wobbles further west, brining potential 
clearing further west into our CWA. Lows will be in the upper 50s 
Tuesday night. The first half of Wednesday looks dry but then POP 
chances increase later in the day as the low begins to lift 
northward into Western KY. Far eastern areas, NETN and SWVA, should 
see a decent amount of sunshine early Wednesday before clouds take 
over late in the day. High temps trends on Wednesday similar to 
Tuesday. POPs and clouds increase for all areas Wednesday night into 
Thursday as the low begins to pull further east across KY. Still 
some low-end POPs in place on Friday as the low is generally 
centered across our area, although much weaker now. Temps on Friday 
back into the upper 70s. Slight chance POPs over the high terrain 
for Saturday and Sunday but dry elsewhere as high pressure is trying 
to work its way back into the area. Highs will be in the lower 80s 
with lows in the lower to mid 60s.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
One more pleasant day for East TN before we begin to feel the
effects of Irma's remains. Winds in the 925-700 mb layer will be
at an easterly direction, creating a downslope flow that will help
warm temps in the Valley a little. With this and mostly sunny
skies, highs should reach into the 75 to 80 range in most spots.
High clouds on the fringes of Irma may begin to increase late
tonight in southern portions of the area. 

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...
NHC has the track of Hurricane Irma moving through GA and across 
northern AL. Because of the increased time over land ahead of 
Irma's much anticipated arrival...wind speeds and moisture will be
slightly lower than our states to the south...and the time period
of heavy rain and gusty winds will therefore be slightly shorter 
than previously forecasted. 

Wind speeds and rain accumulation totals are expected to increase 
from east to west across the Southern Appalachians beginning early 
Monday afternoon. By Tuesday morning...the rainfall accumulation and 
wind speeds will have reached the peak values. The greatest chance 
for higher wind gusts and highest rain accumulation will be in areas 
south of I40...as well as the higher elevations of eastern TN. 
Prevailing winds of around 25-35 kts are expected...along gusts 
around 40-50 mph. Rainfall accumulation totals will be between 2-4 
inches with locally higher amounts possible if the rain bands bring 
strong showers across the same area. Areas north of I40 will be 
farther away from the center of the low...and with less dynamics and 
moisture. Wind speeds will be between 15-25 mph with gusts around 30-
40 mph. Rainfall accumulations will around 1-2 inches. With these 
wind speeds across the entire area, several trees and powerlines 
could be knocked down...as well as localized power outages. The 
rainfall accumulation totals could cause flooding 
problems...especailly in areas that do not drain well or have a 
history of flooding. 

The system then continues to weaken and move east...and will then 
take most of the moisture and lift with it temporarily...allowing 
for only light scattered showers to remain through late Tuesday 
night through much of Wednesday. Wednesday night through Thursday 
afternoon...models are fairly consistent on this low getting picked 
up by an upper level trough moving through the northern Ohio Valley. 
Rain chances will increase one last time from SW to NE as the 
remnants of Irma shoot to the NE and become an event of the past. 

Friday and Saturday...diurnal showers are possible...with the 
greatest chances on the Plateau and higher elevations of east 
TN...as well as NE TN and SW VA. Mid and low level flow will be from 
the SW...keeping a decent amount of moisture over the area. 

Temperatures will be at least 10 degrees below normal from Monday 
through Wednesday due to the cloud cover and rain showers. By 
Thursday...a gradual warming trend will be in place as clouds begin 
to clear and SW flow slowly brings warm and moist air to the area.

.SHORT TERM (Today through tomorrow)...
We continue the quiet and pleasant weather today with similar
conditions to what we saw yesterday. Light winds, generally out of
the north, will help to keep things cool and dry with temperatures
expected to remain about 5 - 10 degrees below normal for this time
of year. Only a few minor tweaks were made to the short term
portion of the forecast.

.LONG TERM (Tomorrow night through Friday)...
The period starts off quiet but that quickly changes as we await 
Irma's remnants to advance northward into the East Tennessee 
Valley. Clear skies Sunday night with lows in the lower to mid 
50s. The latest model guidance, along with updates from the NHC, 
suggests that Irma drifts a little further west than in previous 
runs as it moves up through Georgia. Now the center of the 
circulation is forecast to cross over into Northern Alabama. This 
westward movement will affect the weather conditions we receive 
here in the E TN Valley which will be discussed below.


The first impacts we see from Irma, which will likely be a 
depression by the time it reaches us, will be from it's wind-field. 
The latest run of the NAM shows the winds picking up across our 
eastern mountains early monday morning. Clouds and precip chances 
begin to increase during the late morning hours and continue 
to do so through the rest of the day.

Winds: The highest winds look to occur 00z Tuesday through around 
15z Tuesday. Valley locations south of I-40 could see winds from 20 
to 25 mph with gusts up to 40 mph. Valley locations north of I-40 
could see winds from 15 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph. 
Elevations between 3000 and 5000 feet could see gusts between 40 and 
50 mph while elevations above 5000 feet could see gusts up to 60 
mph. There may also be a period where we see some mountain waves as 
the 850mb flow becomes perpendicular to our eastern mountains. There 
are still some uncertainties though with a mountain wave event 
because soundings show us losing the necessary inversion before the 
winds turn to allow for the preferred perpendicular component. If we 
were to get mountain waves it would occur sometime between 06z 
Tuesday and 15Z Tuesday for about a 6 hour period as this is when 
the winds are ideal. 

Precip: The highest POPs are in place beginning 00z Tuesday and 
lasting through about 15z Tuesday, coinciding with the highest winds. 
The latest westward shift may lower QPF amounts slightly across our 
area. It does still appear that the southern valley will see the 
higher precip amounts with SWNC seeing the highest. Current forecast 
is 2 to 3 inches across the southern valley and 2 to 4 across SWNC. 
Areas just north of I-40 1 to 2 inches but only half an inch to 1 
inch across portions of NETN and SWVA. As the event draws closer it 
does look some areas along and near the foothills of our eastern 
mountains may not end up with very much precip due to strong 
downsloping winds. The past few runs of the GFS and NAM have picked 
up on this and show little precip along the foothills north of I-40 
and up into NETN and SWVA. These favored downsloping areas could see 
as little as a few tenths of an inch of precip but we will have a 
better idea over the next few model runs.


POP chance drop Tuesday afternoon as showers become more 
intermittent. With the westward movement of the system, we may 
actually see peaks of sunshine late Tuesday as some drier air tries 
to work in across our area. The westward shift now keeps the early 
portion of Wednesday a little drier with the higher POP chances in 
place later in the day on Wednesday as the now area of the low 
pressure moves back to the east. We could see some sunshine early on 
Wednesday too. Better chances for showers on Thursday as the low 
moves further east. The same story continues on for Friday with the 
low not pulling out of the area until Friday night. As of now, 
Saturday looks like a pretty nice day. 

If the more western tracks holds, it would mean periods of lesser 
POP chances and cloud cover between Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday 
afternoon than previously forecast. We will continue to adjust based 
on the latest NHC track. Temperatures warm later in the period when 
the low pulls east.

provide a low level flow of cool, dry air. Stayed close to the
blend of MOS guidance for temperatures this period, giving a
slight warming trend today over the past few days. Low level 
easterly winds begin to increase in the mountains late Sunday as 
Irma approaches and the pressure gradient tightens. 

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Friday)...
Irma is expected to weaken to winds that equal a strong Tropical 
Depression by the time the system reaches the Southern 
Appalachians. With the center of this low expected to around west 
central GA by Monday afternoon into the evening...winds will begin
to increase across the area. By Monday night...Irma approaches 
northern Alabama...allowing areas south of I40 to experience 
sustained winds of 30 - 40 mph and gusts up to 50 mph. Areas north
of I40 could have wind speeds of around 20- 30 mph with gusts of 
around 40 mph. Winds of this speed are capable of knocking down 
trees and powerline polls. The increased winds are expected to 
last through Tuesday morning and through most of the 
afternoon...weakening by Tuesday evening as Irma weakens. 

Rain arrival will be slightly delayed from the increased wind 
speeds...with chances beginning along the higher elevations Monday 
night...and moving into the valley by early Tuesday morning. 
Expecting widespread rain showers through the day Tuesday...with the 
greatest accumulations of 2-4 inches expected through the day 
Tuesday. Localized flooding is possible across the entire 
area...with the greatest chance in areas south of I40.  

Tuesday night...the low pressure begins to fall apart with drier 
upper level air filtering into the area. At this point...the 
convection will become more diurnal in nature...with scattered 
showers expected Wednesday and Thursday afternoon. With the decrease 
in moisture...expect any rainfall accumulations to be a couple of 
tenths of an inch to half an inch over both days. By Friday 
night...the low tries to get picked up by a passing upper level 
trough over the Ohio Valley. 

Temperatures will cool to around 10 degrees below normal beginning 
Monday night...as the cloud cover increases and moisture arrives 
from Irma. These cooler temperatures will remain through Thursday... 
until the low is far enough to the west of the Southern Appalachians 
that SW flow around this low is able to bring more warm air and 
moisture advection to the area to warm temperatures to only a 
few degrees below normal for this time of year.

The main weather concern for aviation continues to be the
potential for fog at TRI around sunrise. If fog does form,
visibility will likely be highly variable and temporary, so a
TEMPO for MVFR vis will be forecast. Winds are expected to remain
just above calm, which should make for less dense fog potential 
than yesterday morning. Otherwise, VFR conditions are expected at
all sites, with a NE wind of 7-10 kts.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...
A large area of high pressure remains in control tonight and
tomorrow resulting in pleasant, benign weather. With light to calm
wind tonight, may see some patchy fog develop once again near area
rivers and lakes, but widespread fog is not anticipated. On
Saturday, subsidence continues to result in a mostly clear sky.
850mb temperatures are expected to be a degree or two higher than
today, so expect max temperatures on Saturday to be about 1-2 degrees
warmer than max temperatures on Friday. Still, highs should be 5-8
degrees below normal.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...
Pleasant conditions 
over the weekend with high pressure in control. Lows on Saturday 
night will be in the low 50s for most places along with clear skies. 
Plenty of sun again on Sunday with temperatures in the mid 70s for 
most areas. 

Monday starts off nice but conditions will slowly take a turn for the 
worse as the day progresses as Irma approaches from the south. By 
the time the initial rain bands make it into our area Irma will 
likely have become a depression by then. The first bands of rain 
look to move in late Monday afternoon/early evening. Monday night 
POPs increase to categorical/Likely as Irma moves northward through 
Georgia. The bulk of our precip looks like it will occur Monday 
night through Tuesday morning. During this time, areas north of I-40 
can generally expect to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain with isolated 
amounts up to 3. Areas south of I-40 can expect between 1.5 to 2.5 
with isolated amounts up to 3.5 inches. Some locations along the 
foothills may receive lesser rain amounts due to downsloping winds.
 
Winds will start to pick up with the onset of the initial rain band 
Monday night. Most valley locations will see gusts between 20 and 30 
mph while the higher elevations (3000 to 5000 feet) will see gusts 
up to 40 mph. However, elevations over 5000 feet could see gusts up 
to 50 mph. The highest winds will begin to subside late Tuesday 
morning but will remain breezy through the rest of the day. By 
Tuesday afternoon POP chances will begin to decrease from NE to SW 
as the circulation from Irma wobbles to the west and starts to 
become stretched out and elongated.

The circulation doesn't move much over the next few days but it is 
much weaker than when it first entered into our area. So from 
Tuesday night through Thursday night, expect chance POPs for most 
areas with intermittent rain showers, plenty of clouds, and below 
normal temperatures. By Friday remnants of Irma pull east of us, 
bringing out the sun along with rising temps. Temps on Friday will 
be in the upper 70s to near 80. The coolest temps of the period will 
occur on Tuesday and Wednesday, with highs in the upper 60s to near 
70 which is around 15 degrees below normal.

With a similar setup to the past couple of nights, fog may form 
along rivers which could briefly drop TRI to MVFR or even IFR 
between 10z-12z Saturday. However, because of the limited spatial
coverage of fog and uncertainty, refrained from taking TRI below
MVFR at this time. After fog dissipates around 13z, should have

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Another sunny day with below normal temperatures is expected
across the area today as a broad mid/upper trough remains near the
east coast and surface high pressure builds SE across the Great
Lakes region. Temperatures should be a few degrees warmer than
yesterday, with highs in the mid to upper 70s in most spots. TRI
has already broken a record low temperature this morning, but the
records for Saturday morning should be safe with lows expected to
be in the upper 40s to mid 50s. 

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...
High pressure will remain over the Ohio valley through the 
weekend...with easterly flow bringing warm air and mositure 
advection to the area. Temperatures are expected to warm slowly 
each day...reaching near normal by Sunday afternoon. 

Hurricane Irma still has a variable track and confidence is still 
low on the degree of impacts Irma will bring to the area. NHC 
currently has a track that moves across FL and GA before moving into 
middle TN. With this track...Irma will be over land enough to weaken 
the sustained winds by the time Irma reaches northern GA. 

With the track forecasting the center of Irma to move just to the SW 
of the Southern Plateau...the highest wind speeds and rainfall 
accumulation are expected to be located in areas south of 
I40...and the higher elevations of east TN. Winds will begin to 
increase late Monday morning into the afternoon...with rain 
chances increasing by Monday afternoon. By Tuesday morning...winds
are expected to reach their peak...lasting through much of the 
day. Winds of up to 30-40 mph are possible in area south of I40 
with gusts of around 50 mph. Areas north of I40 could still see 
winds of 20 to 30 mph with gusts up to 40 mph. Tuesday 
night...winds will decrease as the remnants of Irma stall across 
the TN Valley. 

For rainfall...the rain is expected to last through Wednesday 
morning as Irma slows its movement. Rainfall accumulation totals of 
3-5 inches are possible across the area. Although the Southern 
Appalachians is moving into the driest time of year...and river 
levels have been at or below average for this time of 
year...localized flooding is a possibility especially in areas that 
receive several rainbands of heavier showers. Rain showers will 
become lighter and more scattered Wednesday afternoon through 
Thursday as an upper level trough moving through the Ohio Valley 
will influence the remnants of Irma and begin move all instability 
and lift east of the Appalachians.

Details on area and amount of wind speeds and rain totals will 
change and will udpate as each model run tracks Irma.

Clear skies, calm winds, and the proximity of TRI to Lake Boone 
will make fog a strong possibility again tonight, with predominant
IFR conditions and temporary LIFR. Dewpoint temperatures during 
the afternoon suggest that TYS and CHA are less likely to have 
fog, and so the TAF will keep VFR conditions through the period at
those locations. Once the fog lifts at TRI around 13-14Z, clear
skies and a light N-NE wind can be expected at all sites through
the day.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...Skies will clear shortly after
sunset giving way to nice, cool evening. Patchy fog will develop
under mostly clear skies and light and variable winds in the usual
low lying areas (similar to this morning). Expect fog to dissipate
by mid to late morning. High pressure continues its hold on the 
forecast area Friday. Max daytime temperatures will be a few
degrees warmer than today but still well below seasonal norms.


.LONG TERM (Friday Night through Thursday)...The early part of 
the forecast which includes the weekend looks great with weather 
dominated by the deep Eastern U.S. upper trough and its dry 
northwesterly flow, massive eastern states surface high, and 
increasing subsidence ahead of Irma. Most pleasant sunshine driven
daytime highs in the 70s and mostly clear nights with lows mostly
in the 50s will be the rule over the weekend. At this time, much 
of Monday may be dry however the National Hurricane Center 
forecast track for Irma keeps the system on a northward path into 
Western sections of the Carolinas late Monday night into Tuesday 
morning. Therefore, probability for showers will be on the 
increase into Tuesday with breezy conditions developing with the 
system weakening to a Tropical Storm shortly after it builds onto 
the Piedmont. During this same period, easterly winds will 
increase to around 15 to 20 mph across much of the forecast area 
but the strongest winds will occur in the higher terrain along the
North Carolina border into Southwest Virginia where easterly 
winds will increase to around 25 to 35 mph with higher gusts. 
Winds will be subsiding Tuesday afternoon into the evening hours 
as the system northeast into the Central Appalachians weakening 
significantly as it encounters the higher mountain terrain. There 
will still be a medium chance for showers on Wednesday with the 
models bringing a weak upper trough southeast into the region. 
Forecast uncertainty increases by the end of the period with 
another cold front approaching the Mid South. Just went with the 
Superblend slight chance pop on Thursday while awaiting better 
system resolution in later model runs.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Upper level trough will remain 
over the eastern US but heights will gradually rise over our area. 
Meanwhile surface high pressure and a rather dry airmass will remain 
over the region for the short term period. Expect a mainly clear sky 
for the period and cool temperatures.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday night)...High pressure will 
develop and settle over the MS Valley...turning winds over the area 
to out of the north and north east. Skies will remain clear with 
temperatures slowly increasing with warmer and more moist air slowly 
advecting into the region through the weekend. Hurricane Irma is 
expected to move north along the FL coast and make landfall 
somewhere between northern FL and the Carolinas. Models are 
diverging on the path of Irma...with GFS now wanting to keep Irma 
moving north and well east of the Southern Appalachians. With model 
uncertainty continually showing...will offer low confidence for now 
on amount of rain and wind...as well as coverage...that will impact 
the area. 

Have left the forecast more pessimistic...with Irma moving almost 
directly over the area. With this forecast...winds will begin to 
increase ahead of this system beginning Monday morning...with the 
greatest chance for strong wind gusts in the higher elevations in 
east TN and areas north of I40. The rain is expected to arrive late 
Monday afternoon into the early evening. The highest accumulation 
values are again expected in the higher elevations of east TN and 
areas north of I40. Depending on the path of Irma...the flow 
wrapping around the system will be the greatest contributer to what 
areas receive the greatest wind speeds/rain accumulation. PW values 
are at or above the 90th percentile for this time of year...so can 
expect a couple of inches of rain accumulation. Areas that receive 
several bands of rain could experience localized flooding. 

Irma is expected to continue to weaken as it moves north...and cause 
wind and rainfall chances to decrease from south to north beginning 
late Wednesday afternoon.

.DISCUSSION...
Tweaked temps and dewpoints with this update to account for
observations and trends. Temperatures are dropping off a bit
fasterthan previously forecast, and with dews hovering around 50
degrees or below, adjusted lows tonight down a degree or two. 
Also added in mention of patchy fog just before sunrise. There 
should be enough dry air in place to inhibit widespread fog 
formation, but we could see some steam fog forming along area 
rivers and lakes.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Thursday)...
The base of the longwave trough pivots through our area tonight
with surface high pressure continuing to move into the region. We
should have a mostly clear sky tonight with winds that should be
light. This will allow temperatures to drop into the upper 40s and
lower 50s for most. May have some localized steam fog around some
of the warmer water bodies overnight, but widespread fog is not 
anticipated with dry air advection.

The upper-level trough axis will be east of us on Thursday with
500mb heights beginning to rise. The atmosphere between 850mb-
500mb will be very dry as subsidence dominates on the east side of
a ridge to our west. This should allow abundant sunshine and
mostly clear conditions. Expect max temperatures to be close to 
MAV guidance which will be around 5-10 degrees below normal for
this time of year.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...
Unseasonably amplified upper level trough very slowly weakens 
across the Northeastern U.S into Monday. This will be a period of 
most pleasant weather across the forecast area with dry advection 
at all levels as an expansive area of high pressure fills in 
across a large chunk of the eastern states. The dry regime will 
allow for sunshine filled days and pleasant highs in the 70s. At 
this time, the hurricane is expected to lift slowly north along 
the carolina coast Tuesday and Wednesday. The superblend goes wild
again with much higher pops but tried to pull back on this 
concept if the track is to be believed, any deep moisture 
advection into the region is quite a bit too fast. And, the 
location of the low pressure center with a deep easterly flow 
around the weakening tropical system would lead to a fair amount 
of downsloping across the Appalachian crest and thus, lower 
chances for showers; except for this higher terrain feature.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Surface high pressure to our 
west will build into the region during the short term period.  Drier 
and cooler air will be moving in today as the cold front to our east 
and southeast pulls away.  May be a lingering shower mainly eastern 
areas this morning, otherwise expect a clearing sky today followed 
by a clear to mostly clear night. MAV temps generally look 
reasonable so will stay close.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...A deep upper level trough 
will remain over the area through Friday...continuing cool and dry 
air filtering in due to the NW flow through the trough. By 
Saturday...the trough weakens and moves to the east with high 
pressure developing in its wake. Winds will shift to out of the 
northeast around this high pressure...keeping skies clear though 
allowing temperatures to warm a few degrees from the work week. 
Moisture and clouds will increase through the weekend into Monday 
morning...as Hurricane Irma approaches the area.

Uncertainty in the track still remains for Hurricane Irma. 
Widespread showers are expected to begin to impact the Appalachians 
Monday...with area of coverage slowly moving westward through Monday 
night and Tuesday....with the biggest question being how far west 
through the Valley and Plateau these showers will reach.  Models 
have been consistent enough in bringing Irma across the Carolinas 
and close to the Southern Appalachians to warrant likely precip 
chances along SW VA...NE TN...eastern TN Valley...and SW NC 
beginning Tuesday. PW values are around 90th percentile Monday night 
through Tuesday...with consistent rain accumulation being the main 
threat. Instability is low...so only mention of thunder was to 
include slight chance for Tuesday afternoon.

.DISCUSSION...
Front continues to push across the forecast area overnight, and 
rain showers have moved out of all but the southernmost counties.
Should be mainly dry overnight, but a few light showers can't be
ruled out between 06 and 12Z tonight. Temps will drop sharply
behind the frontal passage, bottoming out in the 50s (or lower in
the mountains) areawide. Patchy fog is also possible early
Wednesday, especially across the northern half of the forecast
area. Drier air moves in for Wednesday on a brisk northwest flow,
but upslope flow and steep low-level lapse rates across the TN/NC
mountains may produce some scattered rain showers across the
higher terrain on Wednesday afternoon. With a strong upper level
trough in place overhead following tonight's frontal passage,
temperatures should remain below normal for Wednesday, with highs
generally in the lower 70s.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...
Longwave trough deepens across the Eastern CONUS tonight and
Wednesday with an associated surface cold front expected to move
through the forecast area late tonight. Ahead of this front,
likely to categorical PoPs are expected. PW values of 1.8 – 2.0
inches across central and southern portions of the forecast area
this evening will combine with residual outflow boundaries, a pre-
frontal trough, frontal forcing, and our position within the right
front entrance of the upper-jet streak to promote strong lift
across the entire region with the focus for heavier precipitation
across central and southern portions of eastern Tennessee late 
this afternoon. May have some localized flooding with some of the 
heavier precipitation, especially if it begins to form and train 
along some of the remaining outflow boundaries from earlier 
convection. The severe weather threat is low, but with HRRR model 
forecast SBCAPE of up to 2000 J/Kg and effective shear of 20-30 kt
across central and southern portions of the area, we may have 
some damaging wind gusts with the strongest convection.

After sunset, most of the convection should be to our east with 
lingering rain showers until the front passes through between 06z 
and 12z tonight. Temperatures will remain mild early tonight but 
cool off late tonight and Wednesday morning as the front moves 
east and drier and cooler air begins to filter in. 

With the front east of us on Wednesday, will have slight chance
PoPs of a few light rain showers early in the day with drier
conditions in the afternoon. The only exception will be across the
TN/NC mountains where upslope flow and steep low-level lapse rates
may lead to some scattered rain showers across the higher terrain
on Wednesday afternoon. PW values behind the front drop quickly to
around 0.5 – 0.7 inches with dew points in the 40s and 50s by
Wednesday afternoon. The upper level trough across the region is
anomalously strong for this time of year in the 1st percentile of
climatology and this setup is expected to keep max temperatures
below guidance on Wednesday afternoon.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday Night through Tuesday)...
Deep upper trough presses slowly east and gradually deamplifies 
through the end of the week, pulling much cooler air into the 
region despite a healthy dose of sunshine in the expected dry 
northerly flow regime. Surface high pressure hangs on over the 
region with the lower level flow gradually shifting from northerly
to easterly moving into next week as the massive circulation of 
Irma comes into the picture as it transits Florida. However, it 
should be another great weekend in the mrx forecast area with an 
abundance of sunshine, thanks to dry air advection and subsidence 
ahead of the hurricane. A pleasant warming trend over the weekend 
will top out with temperatures a little closer to normal for early
September. On Monday and Tuesday, Irma builds slowly northeast 
toward the Carolina Piedmont with increasing moisture advection 
and lift. This strengthening easterly flow pattern typically 
results in relatively strong downsloping across the Appalachian 
Crest and diminished rain chances, however, used some increasing 
probabilities for showers due to uncertainty in the tropical 
system track, timing, and strength. The tropical system arrival is
still several days away and forecast changes are possible during 
the next few days.

Forecast looks on track, so only made minor adjustments to lower
temperatures and max temps across the northern plateau where rain
and cloud cover will hold temperatures down another couple of 
degrees. MUCAPE of 1000-1500 J/kg and effective shear of around 20
kt is resulting in multicell thunderstorms. With additional 
heating during the afternoon, may have some marginally severe or 
strong thunderstorms, especially across the central and southern 
portions of the CWA. Some storms may also have heavy rain as PW 
values approach 1.8 - 2.0 inches across central and southern 
portions of the area generally between Knoxville and Chattanooga

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...An approaching cold front will 
push through the area today and will exit by early this evening. 
Expect showers and thunderstorms ahead of and near the front as it 
moves through.  Enough instability and some low level shear 
indicated in model soundings to warrant HWO mention of possible 
strong to marginally severe storms especially northern parts of the 
area.  As the upper trough digs into the region tonight, showers 
will linger especially east and northeast areas, aided by divergence 
aloft associated with the right entrance region of the upper jet. 
Only minor tweaks to MAV temps, which look reasonable overall.

.LONG TERM...Wednesday through Monday)...Light scattered showers 
will be possible through the early morning hours on Monday. The 
chance for showers will slowly decrease from the west to east 
following the frontal boundary that will be continuing east of the 
Appalachians by mid morning on Monday. A deep trough following this 
boundary will then set up over the area bringing northwest flow and 
much cooler and drier air. Temperatures filtered in through this 
northwest flow will allow for almost 10-15 degrees below normal 
for this time of year. 

The deep trough will keep clear skies...temperatures below 
normal...and light winds through the end of the work week. By 
Saturday...the trough begins to break down and more zonal flow sets 
up over the area. Around this time...Irma makes its debut somewhere 
across the southern Florida peninsula. Models have only slight 
variation with the track...taking Hurricane Irma through 
Florida...and up to the Southern Appalachians. By Sunday...winds 
will shift to out of the east...and moisture from the Atlantic will 
begin to advect towards the mountains. Clouds will start to increase 
with the additional moisture. Monday brings the first chance for 
rain from Irma...which will have low chances of being Hurricane 
strength by the time impacts to our area begin. As Monday 
progresses...chances increase for showers and occassional 
thunderstorms...with the greatest chances remaining in the higher 
elevations of east TN and SW VA and NE TN. By Monday night in to 
Tuesday...the entire area could see showers and thunderstorms from 
Irma.

.DISCUSSION...
No changes are needed to the forecast this evening as all forecast
parameters are on track with observations and the latest model
data. Precip across IN/IL will make its way across KY overnight
and be near our northwest counties around 12Z. Based on the
stability seen in the 00Z OHX sounding, it should be in a much
weakened state by the time it gets here.

.AVIATION...
Clear skies are expected overnight, with a light wind remaining
around 5 kts from the SW. Tomorrow, clouds will increase in the
morning with showers and possibly a few thunderstorms moving in
from the northwest in the early afternoon hours. Will include TSRA
at all sites with MVFR vis. MVFR cigs will probably linger after
the rain exits through the mid to late afternoon, but confidence
on that is low at this time.

.SHORT TERM...
With a clear sky and relatively weak wind, should see the boundary
layer cool quickly this evening decoupling the boundary layer from
the southwesterly flow aloft. This will limit winds and moisture 
advection at the surface as moisture advection continues above the
inversion. Clouds should increase late tonight as deeper moisture
arrives.

Ridging will continue to shift to the east as a deep trough moves
southeast into the Southern Appalachians on Tuesday. This will
bring a surface cold front into the area Tuesday afternoon. 
Southwesterly winds ahead of the front will advect moisture rich 
air with PW values of between 1.5 – 2.0 inches with the highest 
amounts across southern portions of the forecast area near 
Chattanooga and lower values across northeast TN and southwest VA.
Instability will also be highest across southern portions of the 
forecast area with MLCAPE between 1000-2000 J/Kg and effective 
shear of around 20-25 kt. This will support at least some 
ordinary/multicell convection Tuesday afternoon. With the 
combination of: (1) our region being in the right-front entrance 
region of the upper-level jet streak promoting upper-divergence, 
(2) a potent shortwave moving across the region and deepening the 
large-scale trough, and (3) a strong surface cold front providing 
a surface lifting mechanism, expect strong forcing and ascent 
with widespread rain and a few thunderstorms by Tuesday afternoon 
and evening. Max temperatures should be near to a few degrees 
below normal on Tuesday as a result of increasing cloud cover and 
precipitation during the afternoon.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday Night through Monday)...
H5 trough axis over the Great Lakes Tuesday night will help usher
in cooler air behind Tuesday's frontal passage. Precip generally 
ending during Wednesday. Temperatures expected to run below normal
for the period as low level flow remains generally northerly 
thanks to the slow trough and then due to the potential approach 
of Hurricane Irma to the southeastern states. Extended models 
still progging westward-moving Irma to take a fairly sharp right 
hand turn as it nears south Florida, thus running northward. In 
question is timing of the turn...but our new day 7 grids continue 
to show northeasterly winds with precip spreading in from NC. This
late-extended forecast is of course highly subject to Irma, whose
forecasted track and potential landfall is subject to change as 
the time approaches. Additional met data will begin to be 
routinely added to the models from here on, such as data from 
increased upper air soundings and from hurricane hunter aircraft.

VFR expected to prevail through the period at all sites. There is
the potential for patchy fog again near TRI tonight, but with 
high pressure moving to the east and increasing cloud cover by 12z
Tuesday, believe that any fog will be limited. There is a slight 
chance of a few rain showers early on Tuesday, but left rain out

.DISCUSSION...
Forecast looks on track with minor adjustments made to
temperatures and dew points. Surface high pressures shifts east of
the area today resulting in a southwesterly flow ahead of an
upper trough and surface cold front that will begin to affect our
region on Tuesday. For today, only anticipate some afternoon 
cumulus with warm max temperatures around 3-6 degrees above 
normal.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Surface high pressure over the 
area will drift east during the short term period, and the 
atmosphere will remain on the dry side. Once any patchy early 
morning fog dissipates, expect plenty of sunshine today with a warm 
afternoon, then a mostly clear sky tonight.  MAV temps generally 
look reasonable, so only some minor tweaks.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday though Sunday)...The extended will begin with 
the area transitioning into an active weather pattern.  A band of 
convection will move in late Tuesday into Tuesday night ahead of an 
approaching cold front.  Expect widespread showers and thunderstorms 
to develop and track through from northwest to southeast for likely 
POPs especially Tuesday night.  Will continue to see scattered 
convection through Wednesday with precip slowly exiting from west to 
east late Wednesday into Wednesday evening. Northwest flow aloft and 
surface high pressure will bring in much cooler and dryer air behind 
the system for Thursday and Friday.  Flow aloft become zonal for 
Saturday and Sunday.  This will keep things dry but should allow for 
a bit warmer temperatures to return for the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...Flow becomes more zonal 
tonight as the previous trough lifts further off to our NE. 
Expecting a calm and pleasant night with light to calm winds, little 
cloud cover, and temperatures in the upper 50s to low 60s which will 
be around 3 to 5 degrees below normal. Not expecting as much fog 
overnight compared to last night and early this morning due to 
warmer overnight temps but still some patchy fog is possible across 
some areas. 

Temperatures continue to rise tomorrow as southerly flow begins to 
increase in the low levels as surface high pressure migrates east of 
us and as an upper level trough begins to push into the Ohio River 
Valley. Highs will be in the low to mid 80s which is normal for this 
time of year. Dewpoints also rise, allowing the air to feel not as 
crisp as it did today. Plenty of sun again tomorrow. Overall, a calm 
and tranquil short term period in store with near normal 
temperatures.


.LONG TERM...(Monday Night through Sunday)...H5 trough will drop out 
of Hudson Bay into the Great Lakes early in the extended period, 
sweeping a cold front through our region during Tuesday. Expect 
scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms Tuesday and Tuesday 
night, diminishing Wednesday. From Wednesday through Sunday, post 
frontal temperatures could persistently run 8 to 12 degrees below 
normal. Why such a persistent cool period? Because the cold H5 
trough will be slow to leave the eastern U.S., not doing so until 
the upcoming weekend. That's when things get further complicated. As 
the trough departs, the Bermuda High seemingly wants to nudge 
westward onto the Mid-Atlantic coast Sunday morning. This is 
significant because the underbelly of the Bermuda high has been the 
feature steering Hurricane Irma across the Atlantic, and at this 
time the long-range GFS and ECMWF bring Irma ashore between Myrtle 
Beach SC and Wilmington NC on Monday. Just how far westward she 
moves once inland will impact our weather late Monday and beyond. 
Bear in mind that these long-range model forecasts of landfall can 
experience much variation as the time draws near, and landfall 
itself is no certainty.

fog. Once any fog/low clouds dissipate this morning, will be a 
tranquil period for the short term with an area of surface high

will stay close, but will go a bit under for most low temps tonight 
using a blend of the MAV and the lower MET numbers.

.LONG TERM...(Monday though Saturday)...The extended will begin dry 
and warm with near seasonal temperatures.  However...we will quickly 
shift to a more active pattern with the approach of a strong cold 
front.  Clouds will increase from northwest to southeastern during the 
day Tuesday with showers and thunderstorms slowly pushing in late in 
the day.  The main band of convection should move through Tuesday 
evening into the overnight hours.  A few storms may become strong 
during the late afternoon/evening hours but instabiltiy should 
diminish with sunset...limiting the threat of strong storms. Showers 
will continue into Wednesday as the system slow exited the region. A 
few showers may linger over the eastern mountains into Thursday... 
but overall behind the system...dry...northerly flow aloft and 
surface high building in should allow for mainly dry and cool 
conditions through the end of the extended period.

.DISCUSSION...
Rain has exited the area and the 00Z OHX sounding shows much drier
air will be advecting in through the night. The update will remove
all mention of precip. One uncertainty in the forecast tonight 
will be the potential for fog, and whether the surface dewpoints 
will stay up enough while clouds clear out and winds drop off to 
allow fog to form. Will maintain some patchy fog wording but it 
will likely be more in the sheltered valleys of the mountains and 
plateau. Northern areas will likely hang on to low clouds all 
night, making dense fog less likely there.

As low pressure pulls farther away from the area this evening,
drier air will build in from the west through the night. However,
it is expected that this will not happen fast enough to keep all
sites VFR through the night. CHA currently has a large dewpoint
depression and will likely stay VFR. But where clouds have held
longer...TYS and TRI...fog and/or low cigs are likely. Confidence
is highest at TRI where low cigs in the IFR range are expected
late tonight, possibly dropping to LIFR. Cigs will be slow to rise
with the lowering sun angle, with VFR conditions returning in the
early afternoon. Confidence is lower at TYS, but MVFR fog seems to
be the most likely scenario as clouds clear out and winds go calm.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...The remnants of Harvey will 
continue to move to the NE with scattered light showers possible 
in areas north of I40 through the evening and early night. Winds 
will shift to out of the NW behind this system...slowly bringing 
in drier and cooler air. Skies will begin to clear tonight 
starting in the southern TN Valley...and shortly after 
sunrise...the entire area should have enough dry air to see clear 
skies. Patchy fog development is likely overnight...especially in 
areas north of I 40 that see rain showers through the evening. 
Light winds and overcast skies should remain in these areas 
though...so will leave mention of dense fog for a later update. 
Sunday...high pressure and cooler weather will remain through the 
rest of the day.


.LONG TERM (Sunday night though Saturday)...Only one event to 
really focus on during the long term and that is the large upper-
trough and strong cold front set to move through 
Tuesday/Wednesday.

We start the period in weak NW flow as a trough pulls off to our NE. 
Lows will be around 3 to 5 degrees below normal under clear skies. 
On Monday the flow becomes zonal with highs near normal under mostly 
sunny skies. Lows warmer on Monday night as we began to return to a 
more southerly flow out ahead of our next system. Lows will be in 
the low to mid 60s, near normal. 

On Tuesday clouds begin to increase as a high amplitude upper-level 
trough begins to swing down into our area from the NW. This trough 
is quite robust for this time of year and will have strong upper 
level support as a 90 to 100kt 300mb jet rotates through the trough 
base, though the 850mb flow remains weak. As of now, it looks like 
most of Tuesday will be dry but with increasing chances for showers 
and storms as the day progresses. Highs will be in the in the mid 
80s, near normal. The best chances for precip will be during the 
overnight hours as the front approaches. There could be a few strong 
storms earlier in the evening but storms should weaken as the night 
goes on and we lose instability. The front pushes through Wednesday 
morning and exits during the afternoon hours. Much drier and cooler 
air rushes in behind the front along with decreasing clouds. Highs 
will only be near 70, around 15 degrees below normal.

On Thursday and Friday we remain under the influence of the upper 
trough with below normal temperatures. On Saturday higher pressure 
begins to build back in from the west as the trough lifts off to the 
NE. Temps will slowly warm from Thursday through Saturday.

shift northeast, allowing improving conditions. Expect conditions
to be mainly MVFR at TYS and TRI before the improvement arrives, 
although certainly may see lower conditions especially in more 
significant showers. Fog will be possible late especially at TRI,

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Remnants of Harvey will 
gradually pull northeast away from the area during the period. Drier 
air will work in behind this system from southwest to northeast. 
Best chances for showers will be north and northwest areas today, 
with a gradual diminishment of precip chances during the period from 
southwest to northeast.  May still be a few lingering showers north 
first part of tonight before precip ends.  Clearing will gradually 
work across the area from southwest to northeast as well, although 
this will be slow.  Only minor tweaks to MAV temps.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday though Friday)...Surface high pressure will build 
in for Sunday and Monday...providing a quiet beginning to the 
extended.  This will allow for dry conditions with plenty of 
sunshine. Temperatures should warm back to normal levels as well. 
Will then...transition into a more activity weather pattern for mid 
week as a cold front tracks across the region.  There remains some 
question on exact timing and details but overall...models in 
reasonable agreement with the frontal passage.  Ahead of the 
front...expect a line of convection to move through late Tuesday 
into Tuesday evening...with the air mass becoming weakly unstable 
for thunderstorm activity.  The front will slowly move across the 
area Tuesday night into Wednesday...providing a continue chance of 
convection.  Cooler...drier air moving in behind the front should 
limit instability for only a slight chance of thunderstorms by 
Wednesday afternoon.  Model consistency becomes quite poor for 
Thursday and Friday and confidence is low.  Current trend is for the 
boundary to slow or to briefly stall near or just east of the area 
on Thursday...allowing for a continued chance of showers over the 
northeastern locations.  By Friday...models move the boundary out 
with high pressure building in for a possible dry day.

.AVIATION...Always difficult with a nice, deep tropical low and
all its moisture and wind abilities in the vicinity. The low 
level flow southerly over most of the Great Valley and also 
westerly over Southeast Tennessee leading to some drying in the 
first few thousand feet off the surface. Therefore, ceilings could
be bouncing between an mvfr category and vfr category; initially 
at cha, but later in the night at tys and tri. Trended the 
forecast from vfr to mvfr at both cha and tys, while waiting until
the second half of the forecast period to bring this change to 
tri where there could be a shower this evening and again during 
the day on Saturday. Wind speed will be dropping a bit with the 
loss of insolation as well but we should see a few gusts again on 
Saturday at the terminals.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...The circulation around
Harvey's remnants was beginning to open up or weaken as it lifts
northeast into Kentucky this evening and into the Ohio Valley 
later tonight and Saturday. Water vapor satellite pictures show 
drier air advecting into the forecast area with most of the 
showers and a few storms along the northeast Tennessee mountains 
and scattered over the northern plateau and part of southwest 
Virginia. Some showers were also now developing across southeast 
Tennessee moving around the southern edge of the surface low. 
Strong shear but only weak MUCAPE of 500 J/kg may strengthen a few
storms in the extreme northeast part of the area through early 
evening with a weak brief tornado possible. Otherwise light 
showers will linger overnight with winds decreasing in the 
evening. Colder air will also move in behind Harvey. Lows will 
drop into the upper 50s to lower 60s areawide. Saturday Harveys 
remains...the remnant low will still be over Kentucky and the 
flow around it will bring clouds and enough instability for a few 
showers until about noon southeast and late afternoon northeast. 
Temperatures will still be cool and range from about 80 at 
Chattanooga to the lower to mid 70s lower elevations. Higher 
elevations in the mountains and northeast will stay in the 60s 
also with more cloud cover. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
A slight chance for showers will remain Saturday night with 
lingering moisture across NE TN and SW VA. By Sunday morning...dry
and cool northwest flow will cause mostly clear skies and 
temperatures to be a couple of degrees normal for this time of 
year. Pleasant conditions will remain through Monday night as high
pressure develops and remains over the area. 

A frontal boundary ahead of a deep upper level trough will approach 
the Southern Appalachians Tuesday morning. Mid and low level winds 
will shift to out of the southwest bringing moisture and warmer air 
to the area ahead of this boundary. Models show inconsistency 
with parameters for much confidence in anything other than 
scattered showers and thunderstorms...with a few storms becoming 
strong. Tuesday afternoon and evening...the largest amount of 
instabiltiy will be present...though Wednesday has the chance for 
greatest lift as the right entrance region of the upper level jet 
moves across the area. Temperatures will also be several degrees 
cooler on Wednesday...limiting the instability present. Right 
now...can expect scattered to widespread showers and thunderstorms
on Wednesday...with little to no threat of any strong storms 
possible. 

The front will move east of the region by Thursday morning...with 
skies slowly clearing through the day. Thanks to the forecast of 
Hurricane Irma...models are back to inconsistent runs. Models are 
now keeping high pressure over the area as Hurricane Irma moves 
across the east coast.

.DISCUSSION...The circulation associated with Harvey's remnants
is now centered near Nashville and will move very slowly into
eastern Kentucky by tonight. Models continue to indicate the most
concentrated rainfall on the northern and western parts of the
system with somewhat of a dry slot on the eastern side as it moves
across the forecast area today. A small threat for severe storms
continues mainly across northeast sections this afternoon to early
evening. Breaks in the clouds developing now over east Tennessee as
downsloping off the mountains is occurring. Showers and storms 
should increase during the next few hours. Still looks like 
between 18Z- 22Z will be the best chance for storms. Quick spin 
ups of tornadoes and/or wind damage could occur in northeast TN 
and southwest VA north of a weak frontal boundary extending east
out of the remnant surface low. Have issued a wind advisory for 
higher elevations of east Tennessee and southwest North Carolina 
for breezy conditions with some gusts 40 to 50 mph. Elsewhere 
winds expected to be 15 to 25 mph with gusts to 35 mph.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...The main circulation
associated with the remnants of Harvey will meander towards
Louisville through tonight. Short range models indicate that the
majority of rain will occur on the north and western portions of
the low. Some sunshine may make a debut particularly over
northeast Tennessee where downsloping is best. There is some hint
that between 3pm ET and 6pm ET will be the window for some 
thunderstorms to develop. SPC has outlined portions of southwest 
Virginia and northeast Tennessee in a slight risk area. Quick spin
ups of tornadoes and/or wind damage could occur in the areas 
mentioned. Otherwise, it will be breezy today with some gusts
approaching 30 mph. The latest forecast does not meet wind 
advisory criteria...but you should still hold on to your hat.

Overnight, the wrap around rain will be much lighter in intensity
and closer to sunrise it will be hit or miss generally south of
I-40. Better chances for rain through the night will occur over
the northern Plateau (west of I-75) and into far southwest
Virginia.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday though Thursday)...A few showers may 
linger into Saturday as the remnants of Harvey continue to pull 
away from the region. High pressure builds in behind this with dry
conditions and temperatures warming to near normal levels for 
Sunday and Monday. Models in reasonable agreement with bringing a 
cold front through the area Tuesday into Wednesday. This should 
spread a line of showers and thunderstorms across the area and 
provide our best chance of precipitation during the extended. 
Models begin to show significant differences by Thursday and 
confidence is low. The ECMWF keep the frontal boundary over the 
general area with an area of low pressure moving up from the 
gulf...while the GFS takes the boundary a bit further east with a 
weaker area of low pressure. Will continue with a blend of the 
models and keep 20 to 30 POPs in place for the end of the period.

pops back just a bit for the first few hours after midnight with
adiabatic warming producing some nice drying across Central East

shallow rotating storms but instability should be gradually
weakening through the overnight period. Did a minor upward

.AVIATION...Tropical circulation continues to grind its way slowly
northeast through Northern Mississippi at this hour. A beautiful
broad swath of slightly drier air has shifted east across the
Great Valley. The strengthening cross terrain flow should 
remain detrimental to lower cloud deck formation across the 
valley for several more hours at both tys and tri where advancing 
showers with the approaching system may not affect the terminals 
until around 08z. Showers may hold off at cha until about 04z but 
some uncertainty about how much coverage there will be so kept 
vicinity wording going here. However, would expect precipitation 
to fill in at cha by 08z, so used a prevailing mvfr flight 
category extending through about 14Z. Difficult to say how much 
the strengthening downslope flow will limit precipitation 
intensity at tys and tri but tried to stay in a vfr mode at these 
terminals through the forecast.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...Mostly cloudy skies today so
far with widespread rainfall across the region. Temperatures have
struggled to reach the mid 70s over most lower elevations due to
clouds and rain. Heaviest rain has been across the southeast
Tennessee mountains and southwest North Carolina. Rainfall amounts
of one to one and one half inches have occurred in this area. Showers
were developing more across central sections at mid afternoon and
should lift north and east the remainder of daylight hours. The 
surface low with Harvey was moving slowly northeast now located 
across northern Mississippi. Heavy rainfall was located mostly 
north and northeast of the center in parts of eastern 
Arkansas...Mississippi and southwest Tennessee. Other strong 
storms were over eastern Georgia and moving into western South 
Carolina. For the overnight period and Friday. Rainfall should
gradually decrease by this evening with sunset and then increase
from the west and southwest late tonight as the surface low from
Harvey moves into western and middle Tennessee. Still looks like
the forecast area will be on the eastern edge of the heavier
rainfall amounts as the system moves north into Kentucky Friday.
Rainfall amounts from after sunset tonight through Friday should 
be only about 0.50 to 1.50 inches...with isolated places around 2
inches. Some localized flooding still possible mainly plateau 
areas Friday.

Low to mid level cyclonic flow persisting around the remnants of 
Harvey as the system moves slowly NE across middle TN into KY 
will keep strong low-level shear over east to northeast TN and far
western VA. The considerable cloud cover and precipitation will 
give only weak lapse rates and limit destabilization. Even with 
small CAPE values the strength of the low-level shear will give a 
slight risk for a few tornadoes to occur across the region per Day
2 Severe Outlook. Temperatures tonight will stay warm mid 60s to
near 70 and highs Friday similar to today in the 70s.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
The cyclonic circulation formerly known as Harvey will be 
located in central KY to start the period, with the dry slot over 
much of the TN Valley and a low level convergence zone extending 
E-SE across our SW VA and NE TN counties. This may keep the 
potential severe storms/tornadoes going into the evening. 
Decreasing shear and instability along with the deepening dry slot
will lowering chances of storms through the rest of Friday night.
The movement of the midlevel circulation along the upper OH River
will wrap moisture into our northern areas on Saturday, but with 
little forcing other than some weak instability under the trough. 
Will keep a chance of showers through Saturday, along with 
temperatures well below normal.

Surface high pressure across the TN Valley and a W-NW flow aloft 
will provide sunny and warmer conditions for Sunday and Monday, with 
highs getting closer to normal again on Monday. GFS and ECMWF agree 
on a longwave trough dropping into the Great Lakes on Tuesday, with 
a cold front nearing our area Tuesday night. A chance of rain will 
return with the front Tuesday afternoon and night, but the models 
diverge after this time. The ECMWF hangs the front over the 
Appalachians while cutting off a closed low at the base of the 
trough, keeping precip in our area through Thursday. The GFS is 
progressive and brings a dry and unseasonably cool air mass for 
Wednesday and Thursday. Confidence is low but will compromise by 
keeping a chance of rain into Wednesday but starting off Thursday 
dry.

.DISCUSSION...
The low pressure associated with Harvey has moved to extreme NE
Louisiana at mid morning. There has been increased rainfall 
across the northern part of the forecast area initially early
today as moisture has increased from southwest to northeast. At 
late morning some increased showers are now developing across 
southeast Tennessee and southwest North Carolina. Lowered rain
chances early most of forecast area and then increased them from
the south in the afternoon. Temperatures have only risen slightly
from this mornings lows. Adjusted current temperatures to current
trends. Real problem with forecast is will partial clearing cause
enough instability for thunderstorms to develop and with the 
available MLCAPE of 1000-1500 J/KG per Day 1 Outlook and 
increasing shear...will severe storms develop with isolated 
tornadoes possible by late afternoon into the evening. A dry slot
has also developed in western Alabama so this will have to be
watched as the surface low moves farther northeast today. Updated
forecast sent.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Friday Night)...It will be an active
weather pattern through the short term as the remnants of Harvey
move into the Southern Appalachian Region. Today into tonight...a
rain band from Harvey will lift north and into the MRX CWA as a
warm front. This boundary will act as a focus for scattered
afternoon convection. Deep low level moisture will move in with
the boundary and the air mass will become weakly unstable with
some low level wind shear. As a result...may see a few storms
become strong to marginally severe...mainly south of I-40. The
main threat will be strong winds and a slight chance of tornados.
Then...the remnants of the low will lift north and east over
middle TN into central KY on Friday into Friday night. A 50KT
850MB jet will accompany the low and increase low level wind shear
across the area. Sustained winds will increase on Friday with
southerly winds become breezy and gusty across the area. Afternoon
convection is expect to develop once again and again a few storm
may become strong to severe with the best chance this time
generally north of I-40.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Wednesday)...Saturday morning the 
low pressure center from the remnants of tropical system Harvey 
will be north of the area, and continuing to move away to the 
northeast in the upper Ohio River Valley. Drier air will be moving
into the area as a pseudo-cold front rotates through the area due
to Harvey. Wrap-around lift and moisture will keep a threat of 
showers on Saturday, especially in our northeastern areas. The 
chances of precip should be ending SW-NE Saturday night. Sunday 
and Monday look dry with the next chance of precip around Tuesday 
ahead of a weak cold front. For temps, Saturday with the showers 
and clouds, temps should be quite cool for early September, and 
temps in general will remain a little cooler than normal through 
the remainder of the forecast.

occasional MVFR conditions due to rain/fog and low-clouds at CHA, 
possibly at TYS for the next hour.

A break is expected between 01-03Z, but another round of showers, 
currently over central Alabama/Georgia, will move north into CHA/TYS
and eventually TRI overnight. MVFR conditions can be expected.

For Thursday, MVFR conditions due to low-clouds/fog are expected in 
the morning giving way to VFR conditions by afternoon. Increasing 
moisture/instability as circulation around remnants of Harvey moves 
toward western Tennessee. Scattered showers/thunderstorms are 
expected.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Friday)... 
The remnants of Harvey will be tracking from LA to eastern KY 
through this period, spreading deep moisture into the TN Valley 
beginning this evening. The band of rain on our southern border is 
associated with isentropic lift, which the models prog to spread 
northward through our area overnight. No lightning is currently 
observed in this band, and is unlikely to develop overnight, so the 
forecast will carry moderate showers but no thunderstorms tonight. 
Radar estimated rain amounts across AL/GA are between 0.5-1 inch, 
and the southern half of our area is expected to be in that range 
through tonight, with less for northern sections where the southerly 
flow and isentropic lift will be weaker. 

The southerly flow on the east side of Harvey will strengthen on 
Thursday as the remnant low tracks into MS, and the associated warm 
from lifts northward into the southern TN Valley. This will help 
increase surface-based instability and 0-3 km wind shear, especially 
south, raising our thunderstorm chances and giving a slight chance 
of severe storms with damaging wind gusts and isolated tornadoes 
near the frontal boundary. Coverage of storms is expected to be more 
discrete compated to tonight, but cells may be capabale of producing 
locally heavy rainfall, with training cells causing localized 
flooding. This threat will continue into Friday night as the low 
center tracks across Middle TN and the southerly LLJ picks up to 
near 50 kts, although CAPE will be less. Winds in the higher 
elevations could be an issue Thursday night/Friday, and will need 
to be monitored for Wind Advisory criteria as we get closer. We 
should see decreasing rain chances through Friday as the low moves
into KY and a mid- upper level dry slot moves over the area.

Rainfall amounts through Friday are expected to be in the 1-2 inch 
range for most of the area, with the lower end of that range for 
northern sections and the higher end for southern sections. However, 
as noted above, localized amounts could be much higher if discrete 
cells train over the same areas. Flooding problems are not expected 
to be widespread at this time.

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Wednesday)...
The weakening tropical circulation will be shifting slowly 
northeast up the Northern Ohio River Valley generating a few more 
showers and thunderstorms Friday night into Saturday. A northern 
stream upper trough will be dropping southeast into the Eastern 
Lakes and Extreme Northeastern States on Sunday picking up the old
circulation and shoving it out to sea by Sunday allowing for a 
drier regime both Sunday and Monday with a westerly flow 
developing. Kept the trend of increasing pops for convection 
Tuesday into Wednesday with deeper moisture advancing north out of
the Gulf of Mexico ahead of another synoptic cold front due into 
the area later Tuesday into Wednesday. A gradual warming trend is 
in the works with temperatures returning closer to normal by the 
beginning of the new work week.

Adjustments to the forecast this morning will be based on the
latest radar and HRRR trends, which show rain spreading into our
southern sections around 18Z. Light returns on radar ahead of the
main rain shield in central AL are not reaching the ground, so
PoPs for the northern half will be trimmed back during the day, as
will cloud cover. Temperatures so far have been on track, but high
temps for northern areas will be raised slightly to account for
the lack of cloud cover so far that should continue into the mid
afternoon.

.SHORT TERM(Today and Tonight)...Main concern for the short term
will be the approach of remnants of Harvey. While the main system
remains well to our southwest...near the TX/LA border...the
initial band of showers is expected to move through the area
during the short term. Cloud cover will increase and lower from
south to north throughout the day and rain will slowly spread
northward through the day and into the night. Do expect so
embedded thunder but this activity should be minimal. The main
threat will be heavy rainfall. PWs will increase through the
period...approaching 2 inches overnight. We have been relatively
dry over recent days...so do not expect any significant issues
through the short term. However... locally minor flooding is
possible. The clouds and rainfall will limit warming today and
highs will struggle through the 70s with some central/northern
locations expected to reach around 80 degrees. 

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...The remnants of TS Harvey 
will finally be getting out of Texas and moving close enough to our 
area to contribute to our weather.  Thursday morning Harvey's Low 
Pressure Center is expected to be in NE LA, heading to the northeast 
and by Saturday morning should be in northern or northeastern KY. 
During this time, there will be the possibility of localized 
tropical heavy rains as well as gusty winds as the Low Center gets 
closer. The threat for flooding will likely be made more localized 
since it has been relatively dry lately.  

Also, the wind structure near the Low will bring at least a low risk 
of small, brief tornadoes that accompany tropical systems. Damaging 
winds are also possible in some of the heavier downpours that bring 
down stronger winds from aloft. The main threat for these isolated 
tornadoes will be Thursday afternoon, Thursday night, and Friday for 
some parts of the area.  For Thursday and Thursday night the better 
chances will be along and west of I-75, while on Friday the best 
chances will be mainly north of I-40 and east of I-75.  

By Friday night, conditions will start to change as west winds 
behind Harvey bring in drier air and chances for showers will slowly 
fade over the weekend as well.  Temperatures this weekend will be a 
little cooler than average for this time of year, with overnight 
lows dipping well into the 60s, with 50s common in the mountains 
each morning this weekend.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...
The focus for the near term is TS Harvey's gradual approach from
the south and an increasing flow of Gulf moisture over the region.
Clouds will increase from the southwest overnight. PoPs will ramp
up quickly after 12Z Wednesday as rain moves in. By Wednesday
afternoon, there will be a good chance for showers/scattered
thunderstorms areawide. Still some minor differences in model
timing with how fast precip moves in Wednesday. For now, am
leaning towards the slower NAM solution. With subsidence over the
area as we are squeezed by TS Harvey to the south and a system off
the Mid Atlantic coast, it should take a while to overcome all of
the dry air overhead. PWAT values up near 1.75-2.00" should be
enough for some heavier downpours by the afternoon and evening
hours, especially across the southwestern half of the forecast
area. Noting this, WPC is outlooking this area for a marginal risk
of excessive rainfall for Wednesday. This area has been the driest
portion of the CWA recently, and RFC Flash Flood Guidance suggests
we will need quite a bit of rain to cause any issues. With 6 hour
FFG up over 4 inches across this area, no flood issues are
anticipated tomorrow. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...The weakening 
circulation of what was Harvey will track northeast along the 
Mississippi River Valley through the end of the work week and then 
moves in a more easterly direction along the Ohio River Valley 
through Saturday with likely probability of showers and some 
thunderstorms. However pops drop into the chance category Saturday 
into Sunday as the tropical low finally gets picked up by the 
westerlies and gets a shove to the Eastern Seaboard on Sunday. The 
next system to affect the forecast area will be another amplifying 
North Central U.S. upper trough and cold front, which is modeled by 
the faster GFS. Used chance probabilities for convection ahead of 
this frontal system. Max temps remain below normal through the 
period, however there will be a modest warming trend developing by 
the weekend. Mins may be a little above normal due to higher 
dewpoint temperatures and cloud cover associated with the active 
weather pattern.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Over the Southern Appalachian
Region...an upper trough will lift northward with the flow aloft
becoming zonal during the short term. This should allow low level
moisture to slowly increase across the area. With diurnal heating
and orographic lift...may see isolated convection develop over
higher terrain this afternoon. Otherwise...it should be a quiet
and dry day with highs near to slightly below normal. Lingering
convection may continue into the evening hours across the eastern
mountains...then towards morning...a few showers to our south may
push a bit northward and into far southern areas. But overall... 
most locations will be dry tonight with lows in the 60s to around
70 across most valley locations.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...Rain chances will 
continue for every period in the long term portion of the forecast
with the upper level trough being the synoptic force behind early
PoP chances. Trough will slowly move eastward, just to our north,
and in response low level winds will begin to pick up out of the 
south bringing in additional Gulf moisture. Aiding in this 
increase in moisture will be Harvey, as models are coming into 
better agreement that it will be a partial player in the upcoming 
weather in our area. Most models are in agreement that Harvey will
slowly spin to the east and north passing through the Memphis 
area and increasing low level winds out of the south. These moist 
low level winds will experience some upslope flow leading to 
cloudy/rainy weather across the Gulf Coast states and even into 
our forecast area. What this means for us is that rainfall chances
will continue through the forecast with the highest chances being
in the south and decreasing as you head further north. During the
middle of the week as this is going on we could see brief periods
of heavy rain since this will be a very moisture rich environment
across the Southeast United States. Could see some rounds of 
thunderstorms but widespread severe weather is not anticipated at 
this time with the clouds helping to keep temperatures down and 
weak synoptic forcing as well. 

Models begin to diverge in the synoptic solutions as we 
move towards the end of the week. ECMWF wants Harvey to get caught 
up in the upper level flow and move further east quicker and move 
precipitation out of our area faster, while the GFS keeps Harvey 
tracking further north and the southerly flow present over us with a 
longer duration of thunderstorms out of the Gulf. So forecast 
certainty goes down towards the weekend until models come into 
better agreement.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...Atmospheric flow structure 
during the period limits low level moisture advection as the tropical 
depression over the South Carolina coast continues to strengthen. 
Lower level wind direction remains easterly across the high terrain 
along the North Carolina/Tennessee state line limiting precipitation 
over most of the region. Did maintain a slight chance pop for higher 
terrain for the evening hours due to some orographic lifting. Tried 
to limit probability of precip to higher terrain features again on 
Tuesday with the upgraded tropical storm along the Carolina coast 
forcing north and northeasterly lower level winds across the mrx 
forecast area. Due to limited instability, kept most of the 
precipitation in these areas in the form of showers. Held quite 
close to suggested min/max temperature guidance through the period; 
edging mins up a degree under the veil of cirrostratus and 
altostratus while pulling back a degree off maxes on Tuesday due to 
weak cool advection. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Monday)...Main synoptic weather
players in the long term portion of the forecast continue to be 
an upper level trough and Tropical Storm Harvey. Will start the 
extended period with Harvey still spinning over the Gulf Coast and
NW flow across our area. This will keep Tuesday night mainly dry.
On Wednesday, Harvey finally starts to move north and winds 
across our area will start to veer out of the south-southwest, 
bringing increased moisture to the forecast area. With today's 12Z
model run, models finally seem to be coming to some agreement 
with regards to where Harvey will move for at least the second 
half of the workweek. Consensus takes Harvey almost directly due 
north across Louisiana and into the Mississippi River Valley for 
Thursday and Friday as it slowly gets picked up by the upper level
trough. This would bring a steady stream of Gulf moisture flowing
into our area and consistent cloud cover and PoPs. Some of this 
rain could be heavy at times with PWATS surging into the 
1.75-2.00" range by Thursday afternoon. Model solutions diverge by
Friday afternoon with the ECMWF having an upper level trough pick
up the remnants of Harvey, quickly swinging the system north 
across the Ohio Valley on Saturday, and leaving our area dry under
weak NW flow for basically the remainder of the extended period. 
In contrast, the GFS has the remnants moving much slower, and 
would keep a steady flow of moisture coming up into the Tennessee 
Valley through the weekend. For now, have split the difference and
kept chance PoPs in through the weekend.

.DISCUSSION...Interesting forecast with a couple of tropical
circulations driving Southern Appalachian weather today. The
southern location of each circulation should be able to keep most
of the forecast area dry this afternoon. Model solutions show a
nice relatively deep, easterly flow across the crest of the 
Appalachians which leads to drying in the lower levels keeping
precip out of the Great Valley. Of course, the upslope component
on the Cumberland Plateau leads to a few showers and possibly a
thunderstorm. Temperature forecast will be a little difficult with
the easterly flow moving around the southern edge of the highest
Appalachian terrain across Northern Georgia. This stronger flow
can lead to reduced temperatures across Southeast Tennessee and
was considering tweaking maxes back in this area. However, with
the strength of radiant energy in the latter part of the Summer
season along with a few breaks in the clouds, thrown in for good 
measure, temperatures can rise rapidly. Therefore, will not change
temperatures at this point.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Weak surface trough gives way to 
upper-level trough that swings into the area today from out of the 
NW. Most areas look to stay dry today but areas along and west I-75 
will have a slight chance POP and chance POP for the Northern 
Cumberland Plateau later this afternoon. POP chances are result of 
weak cold front moving in with the trough. Due to the tropical 
system down across southern Georgia, our eastern foothills will have 
weak downsloping flow today. This will allow for a little less cloud 
cover across portions of those areas compared to the rest of the 
CWA. 

Will put slight chance POP in for extreme NETN and SWVA tonight as 
the system across southern GA migrates into the Carolinas. Most of 
the moisture will stay on the leeward side of the Appalachias but it 
does appear that enough makes it over into our side to warrant 
aforementioned POP chances. Highs today below normal with highs in 
the upper 70s to low 80s. Lows will be near normal due to increased 
cloud cover with lows near 60 to the mid 60s.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...Main synoptic weather 
players in the long term portion of the forecast will be an upper 
level trough and possibly Tropical Storm Harvey. Trough will help 
bring in a frontal boundary on Tuesday into Wednesday and this 
could be the focal point for more widespread showers and 
thunderstorms during the middle of the week. Better chances will 
come when low level winds start to veer out of the south and bring
in increased moisture from the Gulf. Upslope flow combined with 
somewhat warm temperatures will lead to decent rainfall chances 
the Wednesday through Friday. 

We will keep an eye on Tropical Storm Harvey as long term models are 
now in slightly better agreement that storm will likely head 
north/northwest from it's current position along coastal Texas. 
Models are still in disagreement on how fast it moves and how far 
East it is able to make it with very little in the way of upper 
level steering. Some of the long range models have the storm moving 
through Nashville before merging with the upper level trough... 
While others show the system lingering in Texas for much longer 
before heading north into Oklahoma. So it goes without saying that 
certainty in the latter part of the forecast is low at this time. 
But regardless of the direction of this storm it looks like we will 
see an increase in moisture through the weekend which will keep the 
cloud and precipitation chances around. With these systems in place 
partly sunny to mostly cloudy skies can be expected and temperatures 
are forecasted to remain below normal into the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...

Seeing a few more showers currently than previously anticipated and 
have increased PoPs in the near term to account for this. There is a 
surface trough across the area with some low level convergence. 
Several synoptic features of note on the current water vapor imagery 
across the CONUS. Tropical Storm Harvey continues to spin nearly 
stationary across SE Texas with a highly amplified ridge across the 
Western CONUS. There is a closed low spinning slowly northward 
across the Florida Peninsula with another shortwave trough diving 
southeastward out of the Northern Plains into the Mid-Mississippi 
River Valley. Closer to home, the flow is northwesterly to westerly 
aloft ahead of the shortwave trough approaching from the northwest. 
PW values are near average for this time of the year in the 1.4-1.6
inch range. As previously mentioned, there will continue to be a 
few isolated to scattered diurnal showers and storms throughout 
the remainder of the afternoon and evening thanks to the low level
convergence. Tropical Storm Harvey and the system across Florida 
are really cutting off the deep moisture flow from the region and 
expect mostly dry conditions throughout the short-term forecast. 
Overnight lows will be a little bit cooler than last night with 
drier easterly to southeasterly flow setting up. Lows will 
generally be in the upper 50s to low 60s. 

Tropical Storm Harvey to the southeast and the system currently 
across Florida will cut off any deep moisture advection ahead of the 
approaching system on Monday. A jet streak will develop to the north 
as the trough pivots across the Great Lakes. The atmosphere will 
saturate in the upper and mid-levels with cloud cover increasing 
throughout the day. The PW values will tick up slightly but the 
moisture transport is just not in place ahead of this system and 
only have a small mention of PoPs late in the day for the Northern 
Plateau. Dropped high temperatures by a couple of degrees with the 
increased cloud cover. Forecast highs are in the upper 70s to mid 
80s. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Saturday)...

An upper level trough will move across the Great Lakes and swing 
a frontal boundary through the Ohio Valley Monday night through 
Tuesday night. At the same time...a low pressure system will move 
along the east coast...bringing a small amount of wrap around 
moisture to the northern part of the area. The frontal boundary 
will bring lift...though moisture and instability will be limited.
Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms are possible Tuesday
afternoon through the evening...with the greatest chance for 
development in the higher elevations. 

Wednesday through Thursday night...a deep upper level trough over 
southern Canada will move another trough through the Ohio Valley. 
Diurnal showers and thunderstorms will be possible Wednesday 
afternoon. Moisture and instability will remain limited...due to the 
low level flow remaining chaotic instead of steady out of the 
southwest. Thursday afternoon...scattered showers and thunderstorms 
are possible again as the frontal boundary moves through. Winds are 
expected to be light so any convection should be short lived. 

Friday through Sunday...low level high pressure will develop over 
the southeastern US. The remnants of Harvey are expected to move to 
the north...remaining east of the MS Valley. With the flow around 
Harvey, combined with the flow around the high pressure...more 
moisture and slightly warmer air are expected to begin to 
transition to the TN Valley. Have kept in scattered showers and 
thunderstorms each day...mainly in the afternoon and early evening
to account for any instability that may be created.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
The quiet weather patter continues for yet another day with mild
temperatures expected. Some mid/high clouds out there are helping
to keep away the worst of the fog overnight with temperatures
expected to drop into the 60's across most of the area. Weak
trough to near zonal flow will allow for anther copy/paste
forecast with temperatures expected to be similar to what we saw
in the past 24 hours. With a slight increase in moisture over the
forecast area we could see diurnally driven showers develop in the
afternoon/evening hours, but odds are that most places see quiet
weather and mostly sunny skies.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday night)...
Upper-level trough and frontal boundary arriving late in the day 
on Monday. Not a lot of moisture associated with this boundary so 
will keep most areas dry Monday and into Monday night. Slight 
chance and chance POPs in place on Tuesday as we get better lift 
across the area due to increasing upper-level support and perhaps 
some additional moisture from the low off the coast of the 
Carolinas. Mainly slight chance POPs in place overnight Tuesday. 
Highs will be in the lower 80s both days with lows generally in 
the mid 60s. Chance POPs for Wednesday as frontal boundary and 
good upper-level lift remain across the area even the the trough 
has lifted NE. Highs and lows similar to the previous two days.

By Wednesday night the boundary starts to migrate south of our area, 
thus decreasing POP chances overnight. Boundary remains south on 
Thursday with perhaps a little drier air trying to work its way into 
our northern areas. Will have slight chance POPs in for northern 
areas with low-end chance for southern valley due to proximity of 
the front. Front appears to drift further south on Friday, leaving 
only slight chance POPs in for our area, with the same story for 
Saturday.

With the boundary moving south of the area later in the week 
moisture from Harvey never reaches us, at least according to most 
recent model runs. The overall trend has been decreasing POP chances 
with less QPF through the long term period compared to just a few 
days ago.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...
With the remnants of Harvey nearly stationary in Texas and a
shortwave trough across the western Great Lakes, we are stuck in a
benign weather pattern across the Tennessee Valley and Southern
Appalachians. We'll see just a few high clouds tonight after most
of the diurnal cumulus dissipates with evening cooling. Temperatures
should be near normal for this time of year with only some light 
patchy fog in sheltered river valleys.

Sunday is more of the same as high clouds stream across the area
and temperatures are near normal for this time of year. Thickness
values and 850mb temperatures are nearly identical to Saturday so
max temperatures should be similar once again. There will be some
additional low-level moisture across southern portions of the CWA
as well as slightly lower 500mb heights, so we may see a few
additional diurnally forced showers or an isolated thunderstorm on
Sunday afternoon across the higher terrain features.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday night)...
An upper level trough and associated frontal boundary will 
approach the area Sunday night through Tuesday night. Not 
expecting much in the way of diurnal convection on Monday...due to
the low and mid level winds remaining chaotic and lacking the 
southerly flow bringing increase in moisture and warm air 
advection. Would not count out a light stray shower to move across
the higher elevations...but instability should remain limited. 

Tuesday afternoon through Tuesday night...the frontal boundary is 
expected to move through the area. At the same time...a low pressure 
system strengthens off the eastern coast of Florida and moves up the 
east coast...causing wrap around moisture to move into the area from 
the northeast. The boundary should provide decent lift...though the 
atmosphere will still be weak for much development besides showers 
and a low chance for isolated thunderstorms.  

By Wednesday...any remaining moisture and convection should quickly 
move east of the Appalachians as the frontal boundary moves off 
the eastern coast...and the low pressure system moves into the 
Atlantic. The remainder of Wednesday is expected to be mostly 
cloudy with temperatures dropping a couple of degrees for 
Wednesday night with northwest flow and drier and cooler air 
filtering in to the area. 

Another low pressure system will swing a front through the area 
Thursday into Thursday night...but due to the previous northwest 
flow and lack of lift with the weak front...not expecting much 
coverage or intensity with any convection that does develop. Looking 
at more scattered showers with isolated thunder possible. By 
Friday...southwest flow returns to the area bringing moisture and 
warm air advection...thus allowing for a slight increase in 
temperatures ahead of an approaching system by the end of the 
weekend.

humidity and a pleasant afternoon for most areas once again. Only
expect a slight chance of a few diurnal rain showers across the 
highest peaks of the TN/NC mountains this afternoon. Minor updates
to hourly temperatures and dew points to reflect current 
observations and expected trends this afternoon.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Once again, over the next 24 hours, we can expect to see pretty 
similar weather compared to the previous 24 hours. Early this 
morning a few locations are reporting low dew point depressions so
there's a chance for isolated fog in low lying areas near bodies 
of water. Weak troughing overhead will allow for some clouds to 
move in keeping temperatures similar to what we saw yesterday 
which was slightly below normal for this time of year. 

High resolution models indicating we could see some shower
development in the higher terrain in the afternoon/evening hours.
Environment doesn't look very conducive to see thunderstorms, but
a stray clap of thunder can't be ruled out at this time. If storms
do form they would likely stick to the higher terrain and remain
very isolated, while most people will enjoy another pleasant day
like we have for the past several days.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...
Sunday still looks relatively nice but maybe some increased cloud
cover across the Southern Valley. Sunday will again feature some 
slight and chance POPs in for the elevated areas. Temps slightly 
warmer, in the mid 80s with lows in the lower 60s. The arrival of 
Monday's trough and front appeared to have slowed down a bit in 
the lasted model runs, thus keeping us drier. The trough and low 
also look much weaker now compared to previous runs. Highs will be
in the low to mid 80s with lows in the low to mid 60s. POP 
chances begin to increase late Monday night and into Tuesday as 
the low wobbles closer. Looks like the weak low over our area 
prevents us from seeing in affects from the tropical system coming
into the Carolina Coast. Chance POPs in for most areas Tuesday 
with the low and frontal boundary across our area. The boundary 
hangs in across the area into Wednesday allowing for chance POPs 
to continue. Wednesday night into Thursday the low lifts off to 
our NE but the the old boundary remains stretched across our area.
Also during this period, it looks like moisture from Harvey 
begins to reach up into the Tennessee Valley. Old boundary still 
looks to be present and added moisture will again allow for chance
POPs, with the same theme continuing into Friday. 

At this point it is really tough to say what will happen with Harvey 
due to ever changing model solutions. Latest runs suggest Harvey's 
remnants never even moves across our area but yet slowly dissipate 
across the state of Texas. Will continue to watch the trends.

So the overall theme is clouds with chances of rain through much of 
the period with highs a few degrees below normal and lows starting 
out below normal but returning to normal toward the end of the 
period.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...
High pressure remains centered to our north tonight with only a
few passing cirrus expected in a northwesterly upper-level flow.
With a dry boundary layer and light breeze, expect any fog to be
localized to sheltered river valleys as has been the case the past
couple of nights. Low temperatures will generally be near to 
slightly below normal for this time of year.

Trough axis across the Northeast CONUS pivots eastward on Saturday
allowing some subtle ridging across the area. However, thickness
values and 850mb temperatures will be similar to Friday, so max
temperatures should be similar once again. Models hinting at the 
potential for some showers or thunderstorms across the higher 
elevations of the TN/NC mountains on Saturday afternoon as diurnal
surface heating and an upslope flow leads to some marginal 
forcing along the terrain for slight chance PoPs. Think the 
potential for showers or thunderstorms will be very low because 
(1) soundings indicate a stable thermal layer around 700-850mb, 
(2) most of the instability for diurnal convection will be on the 
NC side of the mountains, (3) instability is not impressive and expected
to only be around 1000 J/kg or less, and (4) effective shear for 
storm organization and maintenance is low around 10-20 kts. Most 
areas should stay dry and enjoy another pleasant weather day.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday night)...
Overall confidence in the long term is low...mainly due to 
consistency in timing differences between all the weather features
this coming week. Several low pressure systems try to develop 
across the eastern half of the US...and where they move and how 
close to the Southern Appalachians will impact the amount of rain 
and cloud cover over the area. The initial concern is a low 
pressure developing across the Great Lakes region...swinging a 
frontal boundary through the area beginning Sunday night through 
Monday. Models are now coming in tune with a stronger low pressure
system (not as strong as Hurricane Harvey) developing off the 
eastern coast of Florida...and moving up the east coast. Between 
all of these low pressure systems...our area will be under an area
of weak lift...light winds...and low moisture advection through 
the first half of the work week. 

A weak boundary will approach the area from the northwest Sunday 
through Monday...though winds are light and chaotic...and PW values 
are less than half the normal value for this time of year. At this 
time...not expecting any diurnal showers or thunderstorms to develop 
ahead of this frontal boundary due to lack of lift and moisture. 
Monday night through Tuesday...the low pressure system developing 
off the coast of Florida will have moved up towards the 
Carolinas...and wrap around from this low pressure will bring 
moisture to areas north of I40...causing scattered showers and 
isolated thunder. From here...models are inconsistent on how close 
this low pressure system moves to the coast...as well as how strong 
the low pressure system becomes. With the frontal boundary from the 
weekend now over the area...combined with the possibility of wrap 
around moisture...kept chance precipitation in for scattered showers 
and thunderstorms through the middle of the work week. 

By Wednesday and Thursday...a few models try to bring the remnants 
of Hurricane Harvey across the Mississippi Valley and towards the 
Southern Appalachians...while other models let Hurricane Harvey 
weaken and rest over central Texas. Regardless...winds will shift to 
out of the Southwest...bringing slightly warmer temperatures and 
more moisture advection to the area. With an increased chance for 
lift...moisture...and stronger winds...have kept in chance 
precipitation through the end of the extended.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
A quiet weather day is in store for us today with conditions
expected to be very similar to what we saw yesterday. Slight
troughing overhead and light winds out of the north will help to 
keep temperatures cooler than normal. Conditions are very similar
today compared to yesterday so have kept forecasted high
temperatures almost identical to what we saw yesterday. A slight
chance for some showers to form on the higher terrain of the
Southern Appalachian Mountains, but chances are to low to
introduce PoPs into the forecast at this time.

LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...
A mainly dry start to the period as we remain under the influence
of ridging. Only slight chance POPs in place for the eastern 
mountains due to orographic lift and some limited moisture on both
Saturday and Sunday. Highs will be in the low to mid 80s with 
lows in the upper 50s to lower 60s. Not too much change for Monday
as we have the upper-level trough still set to drop down out of 
the Ohio River Valley along with weak frontal boundary. First half
of the day looks pretty dry though as the front will approach 
late in the day. Even then, only slight chance POPs in place by 
late afternoon. Highs still in the lower 80s and lows in the lower
60s. Front moves in overnight and becomes stationary across our 
area through Wednesday. During this period, generally have chance 
POPs in place with cloudy conditions. Temps will continue to be in
the lower 80s with lows gradually warming into the mid to upper 
60s by Wednesday night. 

No new info on Harvey, the actually remnant are still across Texas 
on Thursday but we do begin to see a better surge of moisture into 
our area. The additional moisture plus old stationary boundary will 
again lend to chance POPs in place throughout the day. It still 
remains to be seen on how exactly Harvey's remnants will impact our 
area due to the uncertainty of timing and track of the 
system.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...
High pressure remains in control leading to clear conditions and
light winds tonight. With dry air in place, efficient radiational
cooling will take place leading to low temperatures about 5-7
degrees below normal. Expect any fog development tonight to 
remain localized around some of the river valleys because of the 
dry boundary layer.

Friday is expected to be very similar to Thursday. High pressure
remains centered to our north with light winds out of the NE. A
shortwave trough across the Great Lakes will transition eastward
across the Northeast CONUS reinforcing a longwave trough across
the Eastern CONUS. Forecast 1000mb-500mb thickness values of
568dam-574dam and 850mb temperatures of 13C-16C are almost
identical to Thursday from north to south across the forecast
area. Therefore, expect max temperature to be very similar to
Thursday with highs across southern portions of the area being
about a degree warmer on Friday with slightly higher 850mb
temperatures expected to return in these areas. High temperatures
will be near to slightly below normal.

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Thursday)...
For Friday night through Sunday...surface ridging across the 
southern Appalachians and Tennessee Valley will continue. Only 
chance of rain will be near the spine of the Appalachians due to 
upslope flow into western North Carolina. Instability and moisture
are limited, so will only call for isolated showers. 
Otherwise...dry conditions.

For Monday and Tuesday, an upper level trough digging southeast 
across the western Great Lakes into the Ohio Valley. This system 
will increase chances of convection over the area. Model soundings 
show enough CAPE to warrant inclusion of thunderstorms for the 
afternoon/early evening hours.

For Wednesday and Thursday, models begin to differ in respect to how 
moisture from remnants of Harvey move northeast into the Tennessee 
Valley. Also frontal boundary becomes quasi-stationary somewhere 
over the southern Tennessee Valley/northern Gulf coast states. Will 
maintain a chance of showers, but confidence is low. 

For the latter half of next week, we will need to watch the movement 
of remnants of Harvey closely since heavy rainfall is possible.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Surface high pressure building in from the north will combine with
upper level northwest flow to create a pleasant day with fall- 
like temperatures, low dewpoints, and plenty of sunshine. Highs 
will top out in the upper 70s to mid 80s this afternoon with RH 
values dipping into the 40s. Under clear skies, lows tonight will
drop into the mid 50s to lower 60s.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
Our beautiful fall-like weather continues to start the period. 
Friday will feature high temps in the upper 70s to low 80s with 
plenty of sunshine along with low dewpoints. Lows will generally 
be in the upper 50s to near 60 Friday night. This beautiful 
weather continues into Saturday with most areas dry but will 
maintain slight/chance POPs across our eastern mountains. Highs 
and lows similar to Friday. By Sunday we start to get a little 
more moisture to work back into the area along with an approaching
upper-level trough out of the Ohio River Valley. Upper trough 
allows for weak upper-level forcing across the area. Forcing plus 
moisture return will allow for an increase in POP chances and 
coverage for Sunday, chances still not overly high though. Temps 
still relatively unchanged. 

Now attention turns to Harvey; forecast models in a little better 
agreement now on how they handle this system. On Monday the upper
trough and closed low drop further down into our neck of the 
woods bringing a weak front along with it. This will bring 
increasing chances for POPs across the CWA. The latest run of the 
GFS is more similar to the Euro now. Both models show the trough, 
closed low, and stalled out front hanging in across our area 
through Wednesday due to a brief period of Omega blocking in 
place. It's interesting that a tropical system out in the Atlantic
breaks the block across New England and allows the weak, closed, 
low across our area to finally move northeast which in turn allows
Harvey to finally progress northeast. So for now, chance POPs in 
place Monday through Wednesday along with plenty of clouds and 
still cool temps. At this point, Harvey doesn't really begin to 
affect our area until after this long-term period.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Thursday)...

A quiet weather pattern is setting up over the short-term forecast. 
The cold front is now to the east of the Appalachian Mountains with 
drier air advecting in from the northwest. There were a few showers 
earlier this morning across the higher elevations but not seeing 
much in the way of radar returns currently. Visible satellite 
indicates a field of cu across the region but nothing that looks 
impressive. For now, have continued a small mention of precip. for 
the higher elevations over the next couple of hours with dry 
conditions forecast afterward. 

PW values will take a significant drop tonight with cold and dry air 
advection moving into the region. Values will range from 0.6-0.8 
inches. These values are below the 10th percentile for late August. 
Therefore, not expecting any precipitation overnight. There could be 
some areas of patchy fog with clear skies and light winds overnight. 
Low temperatures will be cooler than normal ranging from the mid 
50s to mid 60s. The drier air advecting in should limit any 
widespread fog issues. The atmosphere remains under the same 
regime during the day on Thursday. Temperatures will warm quickly 
with plenty of insolation but will top out below normal in the mid
70s to mid 80s. 

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...

At the beginning of this forecast period, we are on the southern 
end of an upper level NW flow, while at the surface, in the wake 
of the cold front, high pressure and north winds continue to build
into the area, resulting in dry weather. However, all eyes are 
focused on the western Gulf of Mexico where Harvey is forecast to 
be off the TexMex coasts, but in particular for the SE US, where 
Harvey will be located toward the end of this forecast period and 
beyond.

Back to the early parts of the forecast--the dry weather looks to 
continue area-wide through Friday night, then it looks like moisture 
might build back along the eastern mountains to give a chance of 
showers there for Saturday and Saturday night, then by Sunday enough 
moisture will return to the area to have a chance of showers and 
storms over the rest of the area as well.  Low level moisture will 
continue over the area through the remainder of the forecast with 
chances of showers and storms.

There is agreement that by the end of this forecast period on 
Wednesday that Harvey would still be well west of here.  The longer 
it takes to move east, the less impact it would have, even if it 
moves directly through the area.  We will need to keep up on the 
latest trends for both the timing and the path of this tropical 
system. Harvey will likely help continue to feed moisture northward, 
even well to the east, but there will likely be some dry slots 
behind areas of lift, that will be deeper in the details as well. 
Right now, will continue with "chance" POPs for these periods.

.DISCUSSION...

The cold front is now to the east of the mountains with drier air
beginning to advect into the Plateau. Current radar imagery
indicates that the shower activity is limited to the higher
elevations of the Smoky Mountains. Therefore, adjusted PoPs
downward throughout the remainder of the day with best chances in
the higher elevations. Drier air will continue to advect into the
region with mostly to partly sunny skies in most locations this
afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Cold front continues to push through the area today, bringing
scattered showers and potentially an isolated thunderstorm this
morning. Hi-res models continue to show a weakening line with
almost all precip out of the forecast area by noon. Behind the 
frontal passage this afternoon, skies will clear out and much more
pleasant, drier air will work in on a steady northwest flow. 
Highs today will be about 10 degrees cooler than the last few 
days; settling comfortably in the lower 80s. Under clear skies, 
lows tonight will dip into the upper 50s to lower 60s. Fog is not 
anticipated overnight with very little moisture present.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...
Thursday and Friday continue to look fantastic, a true taste of 
fall in August, behind the departed front. Both days will feature 
abundant sunshine with highs generally in the low 80s and 
dewpoints in the mid to upper 50s. If that won't do it for you, 
head up to Newfound Gap or Mt LeConte where temperatures will be 
in the upper 50s to low 60s! Lows overnight Thursday and Friday 
will generally be in the upper 50s. 

POP chances return on Saturday and Sunday as we start to get 
moisture return flow into the area. Overall chances aren't too high 
though so the weekend doesn't look to be a complete washout. Most 
areas should stay dry Saturday but low-end chance POPs in for most 
areas by Sunday as moisture continues to build in from the south 
due to the remnants of Harvey across the Gulf Coast States. Temps 
remain in the low 80s for both days with lows in the lower 60s. The 
forecast after the weekend is quite complex and have very low 
confidence at this point on when/how Harvey interacts with incoming 
trough. Latest run of the Euro doesn't show the remains of Harvey 
moving into our area until Wednesday, beyond this forecast period, 
while the GFS shows it moving in on Monday. The timing of this 
system all depends on the trough interaction and it's very hard to 
say at this point when exactly Harvey will get picked up by the 
trough. At this point, will go with chance POPs for the Monday 
through Tuesday period as a broadbrush attempt. POP chances will 
become more refined as we get closer to the event and hopefully 
start seeing better model consensus.

.DISCUSSION...Initial broken line of showers and thunderstorms has
basically faded away in the relatively stable air well ahead of
the main pre-frontal trough making progress through Middle
Tennessee. RAP, HRRR predict quite a bit of weakening of the
southern portion of the line heading through the post midnight
period, although the WRF doesn't agree. Believe there will be
continued weakening as convection gets closer to the forecast area
but not as much as the previously mentioned mesoscale models.
Therefore, will tweak pops up a little south of I-40. Temperature
drop will be held up a bit under the alto cu ceilings advancing
with the front but current forecast looks ok.

a little better than mvfr, however conditions may drop into this

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...A cold front will move into 
the region overnight, and will exit to our south and by early 
Wednesday afternoon.  Best forcing for showers and thunderstorms 
looks to be mid/late tonight with better upper support and a 
prefrontal trough.  Will carry likely PoPs northwest and chance 
elsewhere. May be some lingering showers or thunderstorms at least 
first part of Wednesday until the front moves through, but will go 
with lower PoPs.  Drier air will be moving in late behind the front 
along with increasing sunshine and lowering humidity.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday Night through Tuesday)...
Long term forecast starts off with trough axis extending SE from New 
England across Western VA and into Western NC. With trough axis to 
our east, dry air funnels in for a glorious Thursday and Friday. Dew 
points dipping into the middle to upper 50s area wide on Thursday 
will gradually rebound into the lower 60s by Saturday. Daytime highs 
will be about 4-7 degrees below late August normals while the 
overnight lows reach even deeper below norms at 6-9 degrees cooler. 
Temps are in very good agreement with both NAM and GFS MOS, which 
have been consistent with the late August cool down.

Things begin to get a bit more complicated over the weekend and into 
the early part of next week. Twin tropical systems, one the remnants 
of Harvey, will enter the Gulf of Mexico Wednesday and approach the 
TX coast by Saturday. The other, a tropical disturbance moving 
toward the SE coast of FL, will drift northward over the next 
several days with the potential of being located off the SE coast of 
the US by the weekend. With Harvey remnant helping to pump Gulf 
moisture northward, current fcst begins to raise POP chances across 
the area Sunday through the end of the fcst pd. Latest GFS has 
slowed forward progress of the Gulf system, aka Harvey remnants, 
bringing it more in line with the ECMWF soln. If correct, likely 
onset for best pcpn chances will be later Sunday into Sunday night. 
Additional consideration is general model consensus which suggests 
that the Atlantic feature will intensify for the early part of next 
week as it rides around the western periphery of the subtropical 
ridge off the SE US coast. If this should verify, our area could 
find itself in a subsidence zone between those two systems which 
would greatly change the current fcst, keeping things fairly dry 
here for the beginning of the work week. Will need to continue 
monitoring evolution of both those features as the work week 
progresses.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A strong upper trough will move
across the Great Lakes with the associated cold front moving
toward the lower Ohio and Tennessee Valleys late today and
tonight. This trough will suppress the upper ridge over the region
southward allowing for increasing southwesterly flow pulling
moisture and instability north. For Today, main forcing will
remain orographic lift thus best chances of convection will be
there this afternoon.

For tonight, frontal boundary will approach the area with
increasing chances of showers and storms area-wide, expecially
over the northern Plateau. Main concern with these storms will be
heavy rain and gusty winds, but model soundings show severe 
storms potential is limited.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...An upper level trough is 
swinging through the area to start the period. Showers and storms 
should be ongoing just ahead of and along the cold front. Best 
chances for rain/storms are early then decrease through the day as 
the cold front pushes in. As of now it looks like the front exits 
sometime Wednesday evening. Once the front passes, cooler and drier 
air will rush in bringing a taste of fall-like weather to our area. 
Lows on Wednesday night will be in the upper 50s to low 60s, around 
5 degrees below normal. 

Thursday through Friday look fantastic as we are still cashing in on 
the cooler and drier post-frontal airmass. Both days will feature 
temps in the upper 70s to low 80s with little cloud cover and lower 
dewpoints. Temps at night will be in the upper 50s to low 60s. 
Saturday we remain in an overall NW flow pattern but moisture starts 
to creep back in from the south, will have slight chance and low-end 
chance POPs in place for most areas. Highs still in the low 80s. 
Sunday and Monday look interesting as a tropical system across the 
state of Texas could end up affecting our weather. Won't even get 
into timing or too many other details this far out but it generally 
looks like an upper level trough comes in late in the period, 
picking up this tropical system, and transporting it in our 
direction. Again, something to watch moving forward.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...Surface high pressure 
extending into our area will continue to shift east.  After a mainly 
clear night tonight, moisture will start to increase Tuesday ahead 
of the next cold front.  Isolated to scattered showers and 
thunderstorms are expected by Tuesday afternoon as the moisture 
increases and atmosphere becomes more unstable, with best chances 
over/near the plateau and eastern mountains. A few of these storms 
may become strong to severe especially around the Northern Plateau 
and Southwest Virginia, with damaging winds the primary threat. Will 
mention in HWO. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...An upper level trough 
builds east across the eastern states Tuesday night through 
Wednesday bringing a decent chance for showers and thunderstorms. 
The rain and clouds will help abate the heat on Wednesday. However, 
temperatures should be several degrees cooler for the remainder of 
the extended period as a northerly low level flow pulls more 
comfortable air from northern latitudes. The drier regime should 
last into Saturday for much of the forecast area but an upper wave 
builds southeast out of the Western Lakes Sunday into Monday with a 
gradual increase in low level moisture and instability. Therefore, 
used some chance pops for the possibility of more convection to 
start the new week.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Eclipse day across the area.
Upper and surface ridging will limit convection as well as cloud 
cover today. Only chance of convection will be near the North 
Carolina state-line where upslope flow may produce isolated 
showers/storms. Due to the high number of people outside viewing 
the eclipse and the many venues, heat exhaustion and sunburn will 
be a concern. Plan on issuing a statement discussing these 
concerns.

Due to the eclipse, have reduced forecast max by a degree or two.
Also, have reduced the hourly temperatures at 3 pm by 3 to 5
degrees. The greatest temperature reduction due to the eclipse
should be observed between 235 and 245 pm. Places in full
obstruction could see a temperature drop of 6 to 8 degrees.

Otherwise, patchy fog development early this morning and Tuesday
morning. Some of the fog may be locally dense, especially near
area lakes and streams.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...
Forecast remains largely unchanged from previous with good agreement 
in the breakdown of the ridge on Tuesday being replaced by troughing 
midweek. Cold front drops south Tuesday night forcing convection and 
likely PoPs late Tuesday night and Wednesday. PWs ahead of the front 
jump up to around 2.0 inches which is near the 90th percentile for 
this time of year, so may have some moderate to heavy rain on 
Wednesday. However, widespread flooding issues are not anticipated 
with the quick moving front and general synoptic setup. Instability 
and shear also look marginal during this event, so really do not 
anticipate much of a severe weather threat beyond general 
thunderstorm hazards.
 
The front should move to our southeast Wednesday night and Thursday 
bringing in a drier airmass and keeping potential tropical 
disturbances off of the East Coast. Dry PWs of 0.7-1.0 inch look 
possible late Thursday through Friday which would be around the 10th 
percentile for this time of year. Should have a mostly dry Thursday 
and a dry Friday with temperatures expected to be below normal 
Wednesday through Friday. The next trough may bring some additional 
chance/slight chance PoPs late next weekend.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...Skies are mostly sunny and
very warm to hot at mid afternoon with temperatures in the upper
80s to lower 90s. Heat index values are in the lower to mid 90s
this afternoon. High pressure ridge has strengthened over the 
forecast area since Saturday and heights may build even more 
Monday. Cloud cover is limited to some scattered cu over the 
plateau and higher eastern Tennessee and southwest Virginia 
mountains. No precipitation is showing up on area radars too. 
Pattern looks similar Monday but a slight increase in moisture 
from east of the mountains will bring a small chance for showers 
and storms to higher elevations of Clay County NC and extreme 
northeast Tennessee mountains late afternoon to around sunset. 
This should not affect Eclipse viewing during the early to mid 
afternoon. The main concern is the warm temperatures and high UV 
index before and after the eclipse for people spending the day 
outdoors. Not much relief from winds which will be light south to 
southwest. Lows tonight should be a couple degrees warmer than 
Sundays...mid 60s north and northeast to lower 70s around 
Chattanooga.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...This part of the 
forecast remains basically unchanged with the main event being a 
high likelihood of frontal convection primarily Tuesday night into
Wednesday with a gradual drop in probability Wednesday night as 
the cold front slips south and east onto the Piedmont. Cooler and 
drier air builds in for much of the remainder of the extended 
forecast. However, had to keep a little bit of an orographic pop 
going for the higher terrain features on Saturday and Sunday with 
a weak cyclonic flow developing aloft and a hint of an inverted 
trough forming at the surface. It still appears that there will be
a nice drop in temperatures behind the cold front with maxes a 
good five to ten degrees cooler through the end of the work week 
and only a slight warming trend expected over the weekend.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Main concern early this morning
and early Monday morning will be patchy fog, some locally dense, 
near area lakes and streams due to steam fog development.

Upper and surface ridging will be the rule for Today and Tonight.
Forecast soundings show a fairly strong mid-level inversion which
will essentially cap convection from developing today. A fairly 
hot day is in store with a warming temperature profile.

.LONG TERM...
We should start the week hot and mostly dry. On Monday (Eclipse 
Day), a strong 500mb ridge will expand with heights expected to be
around 594-596 dm which is near the 97th-99th percentile compared
to climatology for this time of year. Subsidence aloft will act 
to dry the air column and limit clouds and convection. Cannot rule
out about 10 percent PoPs around the higher terrain where 
differential heating will create a valley-mountain circulation 
with rising air across the higher elevations and sinking air 
across the Tennessee Valley. Models is good agreement tonight with
only very limited convection anticipated across the higher 
terrain features. Effective deep layer shear is very weak around 
10 kts or less which means any ordinary convective development 
would not be well maintained and would dissipate quickly.

The total solar eclipse will have some unique impacts on our diurnal 
weather on Monday. Decreasing incoming solar radiation during the 
mid-afternoon as the eclipse reaches its max for our area between 
17z-20z will have several effects. Hourly temperatures are expected 
to drop 2-8 degrees during maximum eclipse with the greatest drop in 
temperatures occurring within the path of totality. High 
temperatures expected to be slightly cooler by a degree or two as 
well. With near surface temperature reductions, may actually start 
to see a boundary layer profile similar to evenings near the path of 
totality where a stable or neutral thermal layer forms near the 
surface. This would likely further limit convection and cumulus 
development during the hours around the eclipse, especially near the 
path of totality. Even for local winds, may see some brief mesoscale 
wind patterns due to the total solar eclipse where a weak divergent 
flow occurs near the path of totality.

Overall, it is still looking like good viewing conditions for the 
area with mostly clear skies across the valley and additional 
cumulus/partly cloud skies across the higher terrain. At this point, 
only few, to at most scattered, cirrus would be expected. After the 
eclipse has ended on Monday afternoon, temperatures will quickly 
rebound with highs in the upper 80s to lower 90s. Heat index values 
will be in the 90-95 degree range on Monday afternoon. With the hot 
and sunny weather, it's important for anyone spending a lot of time 
outdoors on Monday to stay hydrated, find shade, and use sunscreen 
because of very high UV index values of 8-10 around midday before 
the solar eclipse even begins.

The ridge breaks down on Tuesday as an upper-level trough 
approaches. Model solutions in good agreement with a cold front 
moving through the area on Wednesday with increasing PoPs late 
Tuesday night and likely PoPs on Wednesday. May have a few lingering 
showers across the mountains on Thursday before high pressure builds 
in late week with dry weather expected. With troughing in place, 
expect cooler, below normal temperatures late next week behind the 
cold front.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Monday)...Mostly sunny skies at mid
afternoon Saturday with temperatures in the lower to mid 80s north
and mid to upper 80s south. Winds are light and dew points are 3 
to 4 degrees lower for the most part across the region. Area
radars are quiet with the closest showers in southern KY/northern
Tennessee near Clarksville TN. A weak boundary over southwest KY
should lift north tonight and Sunday as ridging aloft strengthens
over the region. Another boundary to the south...the front from 
Friday will stay along the southeast US coast. The forecast area 
in the middle will be mostly clear and temperatures will warm a 
few degrees to the upper 80s to as warm as mid 90s Sunday after 
another slightly cooler Sunday morning. Monday not much change 
with the ridge pattern with skies again mostly sunny in the 
morning and a few clouds in the afternoon. An increase of moisture
by Sunday night will keep lows slightly warmer Monday morning. 
Did not change rain chances much Monday with only about a 20 
percent chance of afternoon showers and a few storms from 
southwest North Carolina and southeast Tennessee northeast along 
the Appalachians into Virginia. The showers will be most numerous 
from mid afternoon until sunset. The eclipse may act to delay 
cloud development until late afternoon or after eclipse time. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Saturday)...Models still bringing 
another, most pleasant heat busting upper trough into the Eastern 
U.S. at mid week. Showers and thunderstorms should become likely 
ahead of the associated cold frontal boundary mainly later Tuesday 
night into Wednesday. Tried to edge back on pops for the pre-frontal 
period during the day Tuesday as the models try to generate some 
convection. It looks like it may take a little deeper influx of 
moisture and instability to push pops higher with soundings 
indicating quite a bit of warm, subsident air from the strong, early 
week upper ridge. Any rain is pretty much over by Thursday as the 
drier and cooler northerly flow builds in behind the mid week 
system. The dry pattern may continue into the weekend, however 
models hint at the possibility of a weak upper wave moving across 
the area, along with the development of a low level trough on 
Saturday, so included some slight and low chance pops for a shower 
or thunderstorm here. Temperatures start out several degrees above 
normal on Tuesday but mercifully cool off to a few degrees below 
normal with the cold front and associated northerly flow developing 
Wednesday through the remainder of the forecast.

Skies are mostly sunny late this morning with a slightly drier

the lower to mid 60s this afternoon which is several degrees lower
than yesterdays. A weak cold front lies to the south and a weak 
surface low was located near the Indiana/Illinois border with a 
warm front over the lower Ohio Valley. Some thunderstorms were 
developing over far western KY ahead of the warm front. Some high 
and mid clouds had moved into the forecast area ahead of the warm 
front but were dissipating late this morning. Higher pressure will
slowly build over the eastern Tennessee Valley over the next 24 
hours. Temperatures are expected to continue climbing from the 
lower to mid 70s to the mid 80s to lower 90s by mid to late 
afternoon near average for this time of year. Cloud development 
will be limited with a little more sky cover over the mountains. 
Winds will be light and variable to light west to southwest.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Surface high pressure and a drying upper level northwest flow 
will result in calm, pleasant conditions today. Some patchy fog is
possible around sunrise this morning, but it is not expected to 
become widespread. Otherwise, skies will be mostly sunny with 
light winds and highs generally in the 80s.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...
For the second half of the weekend, an upper-level ridge begins 
to build on Sunday increasing max temperatures by 1-3 degrees 
compared to Saturday. With the drier low-level airmass and a 
building ridge, anticipate dry and pleasant conditions with highs 
in the mid 80s to low 90s and lower humidity.

Taking a look at Monday (Eclipse Day) the 500mb ridge will continue 
to expand with heights expected to be around 594-596 dm which is 
near the 95th-98th percentile compared to climatology for this time 
of year. Subsidence aloft will act to dry the air column and limit 
clouds and convection. Cannot rule out about 10-20 percent PoPs 
around the higher terrain where differential heating could act as a 
forcing mechanism for convection. Models are showing the potential 
for convection along the mountains, and to a lesser extent, the 
plateau with the NAM being most vigorous with convective 
development. Taking a closer look at soundings, the 0z NAM sounding 
shows cooler mid-levels as opposed to the 0Z GFS which has a more
typical sounding for a strong summer ridge with subsidence and 
associated warmer mid-levels. Based on the very strong ridge for 
Monday, believe that the NAM is over-doing convection and trended 
toward the drier GFS and ECMWF solutions. Further, effective deep 
layer shear is very low around 5 kts which means any ordinary 
convective development would not be able to be maintained for very
long. As has been mentioned previously, it will be interesting to
see the effects of decreasing incoming solar radiation during the
mid-afternoon on Monday as the eclipse reaches its max for our 
area between 17z-20z. Hourly temperatures are expected to drop 2-8
degrees during maximum eclipse with the greatest drop in 
temperatures occurring within the path of totality. High 
temperatures may even be slightly cooler by a degree or two than 
on a similar day without a total solar eclipse. With near surface 
temperature reductions, may actually start to see a boundary layer
profile similar to evenings near the path of totality where a 
stable or neutral thermal layer forms near the surface. This would
likely further limit convection and cumulus development during 
the hours around the eclipse and this was reflected in the 
forecast. Overall, it is still looking like good viewing 
conditions for the area. After the eclipse has ended on Monday 
afternoon, temperatures will quickly rebound with highs in the 
upper 80s to lower 90s. Heat index values will be in the 90-95 
degree range on Monday afternoon. It will be a very hot and mostly
sunny day, so anyone spending a lot of time outdoors on Monday 
needs to stay hydrated, find shade, and use sunscreen with very 
high UV index values of 8-10 around midday before the solar 
eclipse even begins. 

The ridge will break down and rain chances will increase through 
midweek. PoPs increase late Tuesday and Tuesday night with likely 
PoPs on Wednesday as a cold front moves through the area and 
troughing deepens across the region. Long term models are actually 
in good agreement with this system. Drier air is expected to move
in behind the front, but we may continue to see some additional 
clouds and rain showers on Thursday primarily across the 
mountains. Temperatures late next week expected to be cooler than 
average with troughing across the Eastern U.S.

.AVIATION...
Slightly cooler and drier air moving into the area today.
Lingering surface moisture from recent rainfall combined with
clearing skies and light wind will allow patchy fog to for around
sunrise across the area. However, drier air moving in may limit
fog development. As a result, will only mention fog and MVFR
conditions at TRI where the evening rainfall occurred. Otherwise,
VFR conditions expected today with a few scattered clouds and
winds generally less than 10kts.

.DISCUSSION...The few evening showers have ending across the 
Southern Appalachian Region this evening as a weakening cold front 
slides through the area.  Behind the front...slightly cooler and 
slightly drier air will move in.  Lows tonight should fall into the 
60s at most valley locations.  With recent rains and clearing 
skies...may see patchy fog develop...however...this may be limited 
by the drier air.  Current forecast in good shape...no updates 
anticipated.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Saturday)...A few areas in NE TN and SW VA
will continue to experience scattered showers with isolated
thunderstorms until the late afternoon as the frontal boundary
continues to move through the region. With mid and upper level 
drier and cooler air filtering in to the area from the NW...clouds
will slowly clear through the evening. Enough low level moisture 
will be left through the night...especially in areas still 
receiving rainfall this afternoon...for patchy dense fog 
development through the early morning. 

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...
The main theme for Saturday night through Monday is developing 
ridging into the southeast United States and southern Appalachians. 
This ridging will tend to suppress any convection development with a 
fairly dry airmass across the region. PWs will be between 1 and 1.2 
inches. Some upslope flow into the mountains, especially Monday, 
that isolated showers/thunderstorm possible by confidence is low.

The eclipse forecast overall looks favorable for mid/late August 
with only scattered cloud cover between 18-20Z.

For Tuesday, ridging begins to break down with moisture and 
instability returning to the Tennessee Valley as an upper trough 
moves across the western Great Lakes. Will include low chance PoPs.

For late Tuesday night and Wednesday, a fairly strong upper trough 
establishes itself across the Great Lakes/northeast United States
with associated cold front swing across the Tennessee Valley. 
Model soundings show airmass will be moist and unstable with CAPES
of 1000- 1500. Main concern will be isolated strong/gusty winds, 
lightning and heavy rains. WBZ are fairly high (above 12kft), so 
hail threat is minimal. 

Fair strong surface ridging will build into the Ohio Valley with 
drier weather anticipated. Only caveat is an inverted trough near 
the spine of the Appalachians. The convergence along this trough may 
produce isolated convection for the latter half of next week.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A weak cold front will approach and cross the area today.
Scattered showers will push across the area this morning along 
and ahead of the boundary. Just a few rumbles of thunder, if any,
will accompany these showers with very little instability to work
with. With PWAT values of 1.75 to 2 inches, could see some brief 
heavy rain with this morning's showers however their progressive 
nature should preclude any flooding issues. Clearing skies are 
expected this afternoon as drier air works into the area. Highs 
will be a few degrees cooler today due to the northwest flow, 
staying in the 80s areawide. For tonight, with clear skies and 
drier air overhead temperatures will dip into the 60s in most 
locations.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...
We start the long term period with much drier air across the 
forecast area in the wake of a cold front. A shortwave trough will
swing through the Ohio River Valley on Saturday, but with limited
lift and dry air in place, expect no precipitation and only a few
additional clouds. PW values will only be in the 0.8-1.0 range on
Saturday which is near the 10th percentile for this time of year.
An upper-level ridge begins to build in on Sunday increasing 
temperatures by 1-3 degrees compared to Saturday. With the drier 
low- level airmass and a building ridge, anticipate dry and 
pleasant conditions with highs in the mid 80s to low 90s and low 
humidity through the weekend.

The ridge continues to expand on Monday (Eclipse Day) with 500mb 
heights around 594-596 dm which is near the 95th percentile for this 
time of year. Subsidence aloft will act to dry the air column and 
limit clouds and convection. Still cannot rule out about 10-20 
percent PoPs, especially around the higher terrain where 
differential heating could play a role as a forcing mechanism for 
convection. However, effective deep layer shear is less than 10 kts 
which means any convective development would have a difficult time 
sustaining itself. It will also be interesting to see the effects of 
decreasing incoming solar radiation during the mid-afternoon on 
Monday. We may actually start to see a boundary layer profile 
similar to evenings around the path of totality where a stable or 
neutral thermal layer forms near the surface. This would help to 
limit convection and cumulus development. Thoughts are that between 
(1) the building ridge and associated subsidence, (2) weak shear, 
and (3) decrease in boundary layer heating between 17z-20z on 
Monday, it looks to be mostly dry with a mostly clear to partly 
cloudy sky leading to good eclipse viewing conditions. Temperatures 
will be very warm for this time of year, and without the eclipse, 
highs would be several degree warmer. The eclipse will act to drop 
temperatures between 2-8 degrees during max coverage with the 
largest temperature drops occurring along the path of totality. With 
dew points in the upper 60s to lower 70s, expect heat index values 
to be in the 90-95 degree range on Monday afternoon.

Rain chances will increase through the middle of the week and peak 
on Wednesday/Wednesday night as the ridge is replaced by troughing 
and a cold front moves southward across the area. Long term models 
are currently in good agreement with frontal passage occurring late 
Wednesday and Wednesday night with likely PoPs along and ahead of 
this front. Behind the cold front, much drier and cooler air settles 
over the region late week.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Friday)...Scattered showers and
thunderstorms will continue to move through the area this
afternoon and evening as a front approaches from the NW. Limited 
instability and high PW values over 2 in many areas will cause the
greatest threat from any convection to be heavy rain. 
Tonight...models try to bring a break in the activity...before a 
line develops and passes through just ahead of the frontal 
passage. With the amount of lift available...have left in slight 
chance to chance precip through the entire night to account for 
isolated showers developing...mainly over the plateau and higher 
elevations. No severe weather is expected.

Friday...The front moves east of the Appalachians by late
morning...with any lingering light showers dissipating shortly 
after. Clouds will be slow to clear...especially in the low
levels...as mid and upper level dry air advect into the area
through the early afternoon. Temperatures will be a few degrees 
cooler than today due to the NW flow. 


.LONG TERM (Friday night through Wednesday)...
With the frontal boundary moving off to our southeast by Friday 
afternoon/evening we will see a drop off in cloud coverage and 
precipitation chances as we head into the weekend. Mostly sunny 
skies and quiet weather will be the main story through the weekend 
as drier westerly/northwesterly winds take over. With the clear 
skies temperature will be able to slowly increase by a couple of 
degrees each day this weekend. As we move into next week the ridge 
will begin to build in strength a bit leading to warmer 
temperatures, but extra terrestrial objects will cause temperatures 
to be a bit cooler on Monday...

Monday (Eclipse day): Latest model runs are coming in a bit drier 
than before with only a few blotches of precipitation hinted at in 
our area. This set up is pretty typical for this time of year in 
this part of the country. So we would expect to see some afternoon 
cloud development which could produce a few isolated 
showers/thunderstorms. But with the eclipse moving through in the 
afternoon some of the diurnal heating from the sun will be offset 
leading to a likely decrease in cloud coverage during the eclipse. 
Right now it looks like Monday afternoon should be mostly sunny with 
great viewing for the majority of people. But unfortunately, there 
may be a few unhappy onlookers as there is the possibility that a 
rogue cloud could pass over parts of the area obscuring the view. 
Temperatures will be affected by the eclipse, but to what extent is 
the big question. some preliminary experimental computer simulations 
suggest that we could see a decrease in temperatures of up to 5-7 
degrees. Have gone ahead and adjusted hourly temperatures for the 
time frame of the eclipse and have lowered maximum temperatures by a 
couple of degrees over the area (and a bit more in the path of 
totality).

We remain dry for a couple more days before another frontal boundary 
pushes through in the second half of the work week. This will lead 
to another round of showers and thunderstorms in our area and cooler 
temperatures as we head towards the weekend.

300 AM EDT Thu Aug 17 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
An upper-level ridge centered across the Gulf Coast will remain in
place for much of the day Thursday resulting in a typical summer 
pattern across the region. The combination of forcing mechanisms 
due to terrain based differential heating and upper-level 
divergence due to a 200-300mb jet streak will act to position 
highest PoPs across northeast Tennessee, southwest Virginia, and 
across the TN/NC mountains. Modest MLCAPE of 1000-2000 J/Kg and 
effective bulk shear of 10-15 kts means that the risk of severe 
weather is low with mainly ordinary convection expected. However, 
the atmosphere remains very moist with PWs of 1.8-2.0 inches, so 
some rain showers and thunderstorms may produce heavy rainfall. 
High temperatures are once again expected to be several degrees 
above normal.

The upper-level ridge will finally start to break down Thursday
night in response to an approaching trough and surface cold front
with chance PoPs across the area. Highest PoPs on Thursday night
expected to be across western portions of the CWA after midnight.
With increasing cloud cover and a very moist boundary layer, low
temperatures are forecast to be 5-8 degrees above normal on
Thursday night.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...
A cold front will be moving into the forecast area on Friday as a
shortwave trough passes to the north across the Great Lakes. PW 
values ahead of the boundary will be in the 1.9-2.1 inch range. 
These values are in excess of the 90th percentile for mid-August. 
The timing of this front continues to be late morning into the 
early afternoon. Due to the timing of the front, SBCAPE values 
will only increase into the 750-1500 J/Kg range with 0-6 km Bulk 
Shear values in the 10-15 range with the upper level trough 
passing well to the north. Therefore, not expecting any strong to 
severe storms with this frontal passage.

PW values will crash behind the boundary with much drier air 
advecting in from the northwest. Chances for showers and storms will 
come to an end from northwest to southeast during the afternoon and 
evening on Friday. PW values by Saturday morning will be in the 0.7-
0.9 inch range, which are around the 10th percentile for mid-August. 
Another mid-level shortwave trough swings across the Ohio River 
Valley on Saturday, but with the lack of lift, only expect a slight 
increase in cloud cover. Overall, the weekend is forecast to be dry 
with highs in the mid 80s to low 90s both Saturday and Sunday with 
sunny to partly sunny skies. An upper level ridge across the 
Atlantic builds westward on Sunday. Temperatures will be 3-5 degrees 
warmer on Sunday than on Saturday with the increasing heights aloft.

On Monday (Eclipse Day) start to see some weak southerly return flow 
with surface high pressure across the Atlantic. In the upper levels, 
the ridge continues to expand across the area with upper level 
heights in the 594-596 dm range. This is a typical late summer time 
pattern across the area. The main questions continue to be about 
cloud cover and precipitation chances. Based on the latest model 
trends with the further amplification of the ridge these chances 
have gone down to around 10-20 percent. The lack of insolation 
from the sun during the Eclipse will act to decrease these chances
as well and beginning to think based on the latest trends that 
viewing will be good throughout the forecast area. Temperatures 
will warm quickly into the early afternoon and beginning to 
plateau as the eclipse begins and will decrease by 2-8 degrees 
during the peak of totality. Without the eclipse expect highs 
would be in the low 90s areawide with the strength of the ridge 
but have forecast highs in the mid to upper 80s across most of the
area at this time. 

Chances for showers and storms will increase on Tuesday and 
Wednesday as the ridge begins to dampens with an upper level trough 
passing to the north. Temperatures during this timeframe will be 
near normal.

.DISCUSSION...
Overall the forecast is on track, but a few small changes will be
made for the evening update. Showers and a few storms have
persisted past dark, and in this moist environment, outlow
boundaries from this activity may be enough to maintain some PoPs
in the forecast through the night. But the threat of thunder will
likely end by midnight so will remove it from the forecast. A
mention of patchy fog will be added, which will be mainly in areas
that received rain. Hourly temps and dewpoints will be adjusted
closer to current obs, but forecast lows are in the ballpark.

.AVIATION...
Showers are projected to pass just north of TRI in the next hour,
with TS possible in the vicinity. While rain should miss the
terminal, the nearby shower will raise dewpoints and make fog more
likely overnight. IFR to LIFR conditions are expected toward
sunrise, with a gradual rise to VFR around noon. At TYS and CHA,
VFR conditions are likely to persist through the TAF period, with
scattered showers and storms possible tomorrow afternoon.

.SHORT TERM (Today into tomorrow)...
We continue to see mid level ridging over the area, similar to
what we saw yesterday, so in general, will continue with a mostly
persistence forecast when it comes to temperatures this afternoon
into tomorrow. Already seeing some scattered thunderstorms out 
there, with the better chances expected to be in the higher
terrain of the area. With PW values pushing 2 inches in some
places we could see some of these storms produce brief heavy rain
with some isolated flooding possible. But due to the isolated to
scattered nature of this convection am not expecting widespread
flooding this afternoon/tonight. Showers will start to dissipate
with the setting sun, with another round of patchy fog possible in
the typical valley locations and places that receive abundant
rainfall this afternoon. Once again similar weather is expected
tomorrow with near normal temperatures and scattered showers and
thunderstorms once again.

.LONG TERM (Thursday Night through Wednesday)...
A weak cold front will push through the Southern Appalachian 
Region Thursday night into Friday. Abundant low level moisture 
will be in place with PWs near 2 inches but the air mass will be 
only weakly unstable. There is some upper level support but it is 
not particularly impressive. So...overall will see a line of 
convection move across the area in advance of the front but do not
anticipate much potential for strong or severe storms. Drier air 
and surface high pressure moves in behind the exiting front late 
Friday into Saturday. Models do show a short wave moving across 
the Ohio Valley on Saturday. Much of the associated moisture and 
energy should stay to our north and it should have minimal effect 
on area weather. Low level moisture begins to return to the area 
on Sunday so...may see normal summertime diurnal type convection 
develop...mainly confined over higher elevations. For Monday...the
day of the eclipse...weak surface high pressure will be over the 
general region providing a few clouds and isolated to scattered 
diurnal convection is possible late in the afternoon. For Tuesday 
and Wednesday...will move back to a more unsettle weather pattern.
A boundary will lift north into the area Tuesday with a cold 
front approaching the area Wednesday for a chance of showers and 
thunderstorms each day.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Ridging continues to build in on Wednesday with relatively weak 
upper-level flow across the area. A weak boundary will move 
through the area on Wednesday afternoon advecting higher moisture 
and providing a forcing mechanism for showers and thunderstorms to
develop. With ridging in place and weak synoptic scale forcing, 
believe that showers and thunderstorms should not be widespread 
and will mainly develop and be confined to the higher elevations with
chance PoPs primarily in the afternoon. PWs will remain near 
1.8-2.0 inches, so heavy rainfall would be expected with some 
convection. With ridging in place and sufficient sunshine, expect 
high temperatures to be several degrees above normal.

Showers and thunderstorms should decrease in coverage with the
loss of daytime heating after 0z. Depending on exact cloud cover,
lows should be near dew point temperatures with patchy fog
expected near areas that received measurable rainfall on
Wednesday.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...
A moist airmass will be in place on Thursday with PW values in the 
1.8-2.1 inch range. These values are above the 90th percentile for 
mid-August. The Gulf Coast ridge will begin to flatten some 
during this timeframe as an upper level trough moves into the 
Great Lakes Region. Due to this, expect the coverage of showers 
and storms will be a bit more widespread than the average diurnal 
activity. Due to this, have PoPs in the 40-60 percent range for 
Thursday. Continued with elevated PoPs during the overnight period
as well as a cold front approaches from the northwest. 

The latest model guidance is a bit quicker with the frontal passage 
late Friday morning into the early afternoon. Drier air will begin 
to push into the area by the end of the day with PoPs decreasing 
from northwest to southeast throughout the day. SBCAPE values will 
range from around 1000-2000 J/Kg ahead of the boundary and 0-6 km 
Bulk Shear values in the 10-20 kts range with the trough passing 
well to the north. Therefore, not expecting any strong to severe 
storms at this time. 

The front will stall to the south of the forecast area on Saturday. 
Another upper level trough will dive out of the Northern Plains into 
the Ohio River Valley on Saturday. PW values by this time will be in 
the 0.9-1.2 inch range and do not expect there will be enough 
moisture for any showers to develop. Therefore, have left the 
forecast dry during the day on Saturday. On Sunday, a ridge tries to 
build in from the west as the aforementioned trough exits the East 
Coast. Temperatures will increase with the increasing heights aloft 
with small chances for afternoon showers and storms along the higher 
elevations. 

On Monday (Eclipse Day) the forecast favors a climatological typical 
late summer day. Not seeing any signals of significant synoptic lift. 
Moisture will be on the rise with chances for diurnally driven 
showers and storms during the afternoon. It will be interesting to 
see how the lower temperatures from the Eclipse may limit the 
coverage of these showers and storms and have decreased PoPs during 
this timeframe slightly below the SuperBlend PoPs but still have 
PoPs in the 20-30 range.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...Scattered showers and a few
thunderstorms will linger over the area this evening. PWs remain
high with values around 2 inches...however..there is little
instability to work with...so main concern will continue to be the
potential for heavy rainfall. Much of the lingering activity
should end overnight with only minimal showers possible. On
Wednesday...an old boundary to our south will lift north across
the area as a warm front. This will act as the main focus for
afternoon convective activity. Instability and upper support
remain low but PWs will stay around the 2 inch mark. This will
again translate to the main concern being the potential of heavy 
rains. Also...temperatures will be warmer with highs expected to 
reach into the 80s and low 90s.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...A ridge near the 
Gulf coast will keep the Southern Appalachian region in a westerly
flow through the end of the work week. This will maintain the 
humid air mass with PW values of 1.75 to 2 inches. Little forcing 
in the moist air mass will mean mainly diurnally- driven storms on
Thursday. Coverage will generally be scattered to isolated in the
afternoon, and favor the higher terrain. But some weak forcing 
ahead of a shortwave trough and surface front may bring an 
increase in coverage late Thursday night/Friday morning, mainly 
for northern sections. Passage of the front/trough around midday 
Friday will be folllowed by drier air through the column in the 
afternoon. 

The ridge to our south retrogrades over TX for the weekend, putting 
our area in a weak west to northwest flow through Tuesday. This 
should result in PW values The models do not show any significant 
forcing or boundaries near our area during this period, so the 
forecast will lean toward a typcial summer pattern of isolated 
afternoon convection that favors the higher terrain, and 
temperatures near normal.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Another 500mb shortwave will pass through the area on Tuesday 
bringing a chance of some rain showers and a few thunderstorms to 
the region. Best lift appears to be across northern and eastern 
portions of the forecast area where highest PoPs are forecast.
High PWs around 2.0 inches are around the 90-95th percentile of 
climatology which will support some heavy rain rates with the 
stronger cells. By around 0z Wednesday, shortwave axis expected to
be east of the area with ridging building in overnight leading to
subsidence aloft and decreasing PoPs. This should result in some 
dissipation of clouds with patchy fog possible, primarily across 
northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...
A low amplitude Gulf Coast ridge will be in place Wednesday through 
Friday with weak westerly waves moving across the region. PW values 
will be elevated during this timeframe in the 1.7-2.0 inch range. 
These values are in the 75th-95th percentile for mid-August. Timing 
of each shortwave trough is difficult but with these higher PW 
values raised daytime PoPs a bit above the average diurnal coverage. 
Continued at least some low end mention of PoPs during overnight 
period as well. The higher heights aloft will push temperatures 
closer to average values for mid-August with highs in the mid 80 to 
low 90s during this timeframe and lows will be above normal in the 
upper 60s to mid 70s. 

The ridge will breakdown late Friday into early Saturday as a 
shortwave trough passes to the north across the Great Lakes. The 
models are in fairly good agreement with a frontal passage late 
Friday into early saturday. Due to this, have the highest PoPs of 
the extended forecast late Friday. A more amplified trough will dive 
southeastward out of the Northern Plains into the Ohio River Valley 
on Saturday. The questions is how much moisture will remain behind 
the boundary. Both models indicate enough lift and moisture to 
continue with at least 20-30 PoPs. 

As for the day of the Eclipse, neither the GFS or ECMWF have a 
strong synoptic signal for precipitation with weak flow and ridging 
aloft. However, it looks as though a surface boundary exists across 
the area which could lead to a bit more coverage in afternoon 
showers and storms then the typical diurnal activity. Based on this, 
have gone with 20-30 PoPs for now with temperatures near normal for 
mid-August with highs in the mid to upper 80s.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...A weak short wave is moving
through the region...riding along a old boundary that has been
stretched across the area. As a result...a band of convection has
developed and is moving through the MRX CWA this afternoon and
evening. There is minimal upper level support and little in the
way of instability. However...PWs are quite high...averaging
around 2 inches...so expect the main concern from the convection
will be the potential for heavy rainfall. This activity will
diminish into scattered showers overnight. The boundary will
slowly begin to shift south and east on Tuesday but should remain
the main focus for area weather and will continue to generate
scattered showers and thunderstorms across the Southern
Appalachian Region through the day. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Monday)...A ridge through the 
mid and upper levels will be near the Gulf coast through the rest 
of the work week, with a weak westerly flow through the column 
across East TN. Any enhanced precip chances above the typical 
summertime scattered diurnal convection will depend on weak 
disturbances in the westerly flow, which models typically do not 
depict well. So with the finer details being uncertain, the 
forecast will favor the typical summer pattern of chance PoPs 
following a diurnal trend. Friday may have slightly higher precip 
chances compared to Wednesday and Thursday, when a low pressure 
system is expected to track across the Great Lakes, with the tail 
end of a weak cold front pushing toward our area. Temperatures 
should be close to normal for this time of year.

For the weekend and Eclipse Day, the pattern amplifies with a ridge 
building over the Plains and a trough along the east coast, with 
surface high pressure area over the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes. 
This puts our area in a generally N-NW flow, favoring dry/stable 
conditions and weak forcing. The GFS brings a shortwave trough 
across the area Saturday night/Sunday, but moisture will likely be 
pretty limited in this pattern. Will have slight chance PoPs in the 
forecast each afternoon due to uncertainty about the convective 
potential this far out. If this pattern holds, eclipse viewing 
should be good for most locations - mostly sunny with just a slight 
chance of afternoon showers and near normal temperatures.

.AVIATION...Overall weather pattern shows a broad...diffuse frontal 
boundary stretched across the region with a short wave tracking 
along it.  This will bring occasional bands of showers and 
thunderstorms across the TAF sites during the afternoon and evening 
hours. As a band of showers/thunderstorms moves across a TAF 
site...be prepared for brief MVFR conditions with lowering CIGs and 
reduce VIS. Scattered activity is again expected to redevelop on 
Tuesday but coverage should be less and for now...will not mention 
in TAFs. Winds should generally stay below 10 KTS through the 
period. Only other concern will be the potential for patchy fog 
development late tonight for local MVFR conditions between 08Z and 
12Z.

.DISCUSSION...Overall weather pattern shows a broad...diffuse 
frontal boundary stretched across the region with a short wave 
tracking along it.  This will generate occasional bands of showers 
and thunderstorms across the area today.  Currently...radar is 
showing a few unorganized light showers moving across the MRX CWA. A 
more solid band of convection should push in this afternoon for 
likely POPs.  Cloud cover will limit daytime heating and afternoon 
highs should top out in the upper 70s to mid 80s. All on track in 
the current forecast...will update to remove morning wording.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A very moist atmosphere with 
precipitable water values up around two inches will be lifted into
a pattern of scattered showers and thunderstorms today as a short
wave shifts east across the Mid South. The precipitation will 
continue into the evening but will be diminishing toward midnight 
as the upper wave exits through the Carolinas. Increased cloud 
cover and rain should limit high temperatures to the lower and 
middle 80s this afternoon. Lows would be expected to end up in the
upper 60s and lower 70s in the humid overnight air mass.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...The main story for the 
extended forecast will continue to be the wet and active patter. 

A surface boundary will be located just to the south of the area on 
Tuesday as Tropical Storm Gert moves northward across the Western 
Atlantic. The upper level flow will generally be zonal but the 
proximity of the boundary and slightly above normal PW values should 
lead to at least isolated to scattered showers and storms during the 
day. It looks like there will be a break in the precipitation late 
Tuesday into early Wednesday as a shortwave ridge builds into the 
area. The 00z NAM shows a drastically different solution for this 
time period with a MCS forming to the west late Tuesday and moving 
into the Southern Appalachians during the overnight period. Not 
seeing any indication of this with any of the other models and will 
not factor in this scenario at this point. Ridging will continue on 
Wednesday but the lingering boundary and higher than normal PW 
values will lead to isolated to scattered afternoon showers and 
storms once again. 

The ridge axis will push to the east on Thursday with westerly to 
southwesterly flow developing. PW values will increase into the 1.8-
2.0 inch range with better chances for afternoon showers and storms. 
Continued elevated PoPs into the overnight hours Thursday as an 
upper level trough passes to the north. The GFS and ECMWF are both 
in fairly good agreement with a frontal passage on Friday in 
association with the trough to the north. Drier conditions are 
forecast Friday night into Saturday. The SuperBlend continues with 
some low end PoPs during this timeframe but could see these dropped 
completely if trends continue. 

The GFS indicates another frontal passage by Monday while the ECMWF 
indicates a ridge building in behind the departing front. For now, 
have at slight chance to chance PoPs for Sunday to account for the 
GFE solution.

High temperatures throughout much of the extended forecast will be 
near normal for this time of the year. Lows will be slightly above 
average with higher dewpoints forecast around the lingering surface 
boundary.

producing some pcpn in that area but remainder of Middle and East 
TN expected to be dry through the first half of tonight. Decreased

All sites to remain VFR through the period. Fog not likely with 
increasing cloudiness and a persistent light wind overnight.
However, cannot rule out completely at KTRI, although chance too
low to include in TAF. Weak disturbance over West TN tonight 
moves into the area by late morning. Best pcpn chance expected 
mainly after 18Z, so will carry VCTS at all sites from late 
morning on. Terminals will approach MVFR cigs late in the period 
with increasing low level moisture and more widespread showers and

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...Moisture will increase again 
during the period, and an approaching weak mid level short wave will 
help to increase chances for convection later tonight and especially 
on Monday.  Model solutions diverge a bit on timing of precip moving 
back in with this feature but some showers may be moving in latter 
part of tonight.  Will keep PoPs fairly low for tonight, but likely 
Pops all areas for Monday with the better forcing and instability. 
MAV temps look close overall, so just a few minor adjustments. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...Surprise, surprise, still 
looking at an unsettled pattern through the period. Though models 
have been inconsistent with the meandering frontal boundary they 
have been consistent in showing the unsettled pattern.

For what it's worth, a general summary follows. Boundary just to our 
south Monday night will allow for chances of showers and storm. Weak 
ridging tries to build in for Tuesday but lingering boundary and 
moisture serve as mechanisms/aides for convection. Weak ridging 
continues Wednesday but boundary doesn't leave, with yet again 
chances of convection in place through the day. Thursday another 
upper-level trough is approaching and convection is possible out 
ahead of this system with weak zonal flow in place. Friday is when 
the trough and associated front swing through the area with near-
likely POPs in place for most areas. Perhaps a brief window of drier 
air Friday night behind the front but the SuperBlend keeps chance 
POPs in overnight. Another weak wave moves through the flow Saturday 
into Sunday, allowing for additional POP chances. 

Since this past several forecasts have been a bit of a broken 
record, let's talk about something a little more interesting. All 
three of our ASOS sites are running above average on precip so far 
this August. CHA is sitting at 2.54 inches which is 1.06 inches 
above normal, TYS is at 4.30 inches which is 2.85 inches above 
normal, and TRI is at 2.86 inches which is 1.34 inches above normal. 
It definitely has been a wet start to the month and that doesn't 
look to change in the near future. The wet start is helping to build 
on our yearly surplus too. CHA is at 42.81 inches for the year which 
is 9.56 inches above normal, TYS is at 35.87 inches which is 4.09 
inches above normal, and TRI is at 31.39 inches which is 3.89 inches 
above normal.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

The cold front is now to the south and east of the forecast area. 
However, surface dewpoints are still in the upper 60s to low 70s. 
Dewpoints in the 50s are well back to the northwest into Southern
Illinois and Indiana. With the elevated dewpoints and recent 
rainfall, expect patchy fog across the area this morning but not 
expecting any widespread dense fog issues.

Drier air will begin to filter into the area today with PW values 
dropping down into the 1.3-1.7 inch range with the higher values 
across the mountains. Northwesterly flow behind the front and a weak 
low amplitude shortwave trough will lead to a few showers and storms 
later this afternoon across the higher elevations of the Southern 
Appalachians. The lack of lift and slightly drier air should keep 
most of the valley locations dry. High temperatures will be near to 
slightly below normal today with reading generally in the 80s. For 
tonight, expect coverage of showers and storms will decrease 
slightly with lows in the mid 60s to low 70s.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...

Little change in the extended forecast from what we've seen in 
the past week or so. Just a very active weather pattern for August
complete with several short waves riding along a storm track 
across the Mid South and Southern Appalachian region. Deep 
moisture and instability in the vicinity of a synoptic frontal 
boundary with the periodic upper level enhancement will keep a 
semi-permanent thirty to fifty percent chance for showers and 
thunderstorms going through the week. There may be a brief break 
in the action about Tuesday night into Wednesday. Max and min 
temperatures should be near normal much of the period however, the
models indicate a little warmer air building in from the west for
the final three days of the forecast.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...It is looking much less likely 
that the weak frontal boundary pushing in from the west/northwest 
will actually make it through our area before stalling out.  In any 
case, not much drying is expected.  Will carry slight chance to 
chance PoPs early tonight for lingering ongoing convection. For 
Sunday convective energy looks limited again and with less forcing 
indicated will just carry slight chance PoPs for most of the area 
and chance PoPs eastern mountains.  MAV temps look reasonable for 
the short term period so will stay close. 

.LONG TERM...
(Sunday night through Saturday)...Long term period 
similar to previous issuances. Overall, an unsettled pattern with 
chances for showers and storms most days along with near normal 
temperatures.

Hard to tell where the frontal boundary is on Sunday night as it is 
becoming washed-out and less defined but it looks like it is close 
enough to our area that it will allow for chances of showers and 
storms on Monday. The better chances look to be just to our south 
and east, closer to the old boundary. Monday night into Tuesday a 
weak short-wave moves across the area, providing another chance for 
showers and storms. Weak ridging tries to build in on Wednesday but 
enough lingering moisture hanging around will still allow for low-
end chances of showers and storms. More showers and storms Thursday 
out ahead of an approaching upper-level trough. Models show the 
front pushing through the area on Friday but don't show it advancing 
to our south, rather hanging it up across the area into Saturday. 
This will allow for chances of showers and storms on both days.

As you can see, the long-term doesn't look too ideal with clouds and 
POPs in for most of the period. There will be some brief periods of 
sunshine here and there but more clouds than sun. Temps will remain 
near normal to a few degrees below normal.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Seeing some patchy fog early this morning with the widespread 
rainfall yesterday afternoon and evening but not expecting any 
widespread issues. Low level moisture remains elevated with surface 
dewpoints in the upper 60s and low 70s ahead of a slow moving cold 
front. Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis 
indicate a broad trough across the Upper Midwest into the 
Northeastern U.S. with several shortwave troughs rotating around the 
base of the broader trough. The radar is quiet early this morning 
but continued with at least some small mention of precipitation 
this morning. 

A more robust shortwave trough will rotate around the base of the 
longwave trough today with the front beginning to push to the 
east. Showers and storms will develop ahead of this boundary with PW 
values in the 1.7-1.9 inch range. Widespread cloud cover ahead of 
the boundary will keep temperatures a bit below normal today with
highs in the upper 70s to mid 80s. SBCAPE values will range from 
around 750- 1500 J/Kg and do not anticipate any strong to severe 
storms today. The cold front is forecast to move through the 
forecast area this afternoon, however, the drier air will be a bit
further behind the boundary and there will be some lingering 
showers and storms into the evening hours before coming to an end 
late tonight. Precipitation will be moderate to heavy at times and
could produce some localized flooding issues and will continue 
this in the HWO. 

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...

The extended starts out basically dry on Sunday however, more 
active weather in the works for Monday through Tuesday as another 
frontal wave aids convective development across the region. Tried 
to pull back on pops a bit on Wednesday with some short wave 
ridging and drier air behind the early week system. The superblend
applies higher pops again Thursday through Friday with 
amplification of an eastern states upper trough and another 
frontal boundary building into the region enhancing the 
development of showers and thunderstorms. Temperatures will not 
vary too far from typical August climatology with highs in the 80s
and lows in the mid 60s to around 70.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...The atmosphere continues to 
be quite moist and very weak mid level disturbances have been 
helping to trigger convection at times.  The latest mid level wave 
will exit tonight, then a weak cold front will push into the area on 
Saturday. Will carry chance PoPs all areas tonight, with likely PoPs 
on Saturday as the front moves in. Will mention possibility of heavy 
rain leading to localized flooding in the HWO for the period, but 
widespread flooding issues not expected.  MAV temps look reasonable 
for the short term. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...Overall, unsettled 
pattern through most of the long term period with not a ton of 
forecast confidence as models have been varying. 

We start the period with a few showers and storms around but the 
bulk of the precip will have moved off to the east as a cold front 
is entering the area. The front pushes through overnight Saturday 
with drier air building in behind the front. Models show the front 
stalling just to the east of the Appalachians on Sunday. This will 
keep chance POPs in for our eastern mountains with that boundary in 
proximity. Also, will have slight chance POP in for the Southern TN 
Valley as a shortwave approaches from out of the Plains but most 
areas will by dry on Sunday with the brief bout of drier air in 
place. Drier air quickly becomes a thing of the past Sunday night 
into Monday as the atmosphere moistens in response to the 
aforementioned shortwave progressing closer. Chances of showers and 
storms in place through the day on Monday. The old boundary from 
Saturday night becomes washed out by Tuesday but its remnants may 
lift northward with the shortwave moving across the area, this will 
lead to chances for showers and storms again on Tuesday. Weak, 
secondary, front associated with the shortwave on Tuesday pushes 
through Tuesday night/Wednesday with drier air and high pressure 
trying to briefly work back in for Wednesday. Still have slight 
chance and low-end chance POPs in for Wednesday with residual 
moisture lingering. Chance POPs in place again for showers and 
storms on Thursday and Friday ahead of another front associated with 
a low pressure center moving across the Great Lakes Region. 

We will see periods of sun, and some more than others, but clouds 
around through much of the period will keep temperatures near
normal.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper level analysis indicates 
broad troughing across the eastern and central U.S. Several 
shortwave troughs rotating around the broader trough will keep 
conditions active over the short-term period. Already seeing a few 
showers and storms on radar imagery early this morning. PW values 
range from 1.6-1.9 inches which is near the 90th percentile for 
early August. Radar estimates range from 1-2 inches in some of the 
heavier downpours this morning and expect there will continue to be 
the threat for localized flooding issues, especially in areas of 
poor drainage. Widespread cloud cover today will limit instability 
values later this afternoon and not expecting any severe storms. 
SBCAPE values will range from around 1000-1500 J/KG with 0-6 km bulk 
shear values in the 25-35 kt range. Due to this, will continue the 
mention of stronger storms in the HWO. Timing of each individual 
shortwave trough is difficult and have continued at least some 
chance for precipitation into the overnight hours. Additionally, a
cold front will approach late in the forecast period, which 
should allow for some additional lift. Widespread cloud cover 
today will keep high temperatures in the upper 70s to mid 80s with
lows in the mid 60s to mid 70s

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...

A short wave trough moving through the Eastern Lakes will help to
push a cool front across the region on Saturday keeping the 
chance for some showers and thunderstorms alive mainly during the 
first half of the day. Drier air builds in behind this front for a
generally dry Sunday. It still looks like Monday and Tuesday will
be another active period for convection as trough amplifies into 
the Eastern U.S. driving another front into the Southern 
Appalachians. The boundary will be typically slow moving as it 
works on a moist and unstable air mass. Surface high pressure and 
drier air shift into the forecast area behind this front for a dry
Wednesday. Forecast uncertainty a bit on the high side at day 
seven, but tweaked pops back up into the medium chance category 
for Thursday, with yet another upper trough due in the region by 
Thursday night and Friday. With all the active weather expected in
association with the arrival of at least two cool frontal 
boundaries, high temperatures will be near normal in the lower and
middle 80s while lows hold a couple degrees above normal due to 
higher humidity associated with the frontal systems.

Friday morning, especially in those areas that received rainfall 
this evening. Recent model runs of the RAP, HRRR, and NAM are also
beginning to pick up on fog development across the northern 
plateau where several inches of rain fell in spots. Made some 
minor changes to forecast parameters such as temperature and dew

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...Considerable moisture will 
linger over the area.  Current weak mid level short wave energy that 
is affecting the area will shift east tonight, but an additional 
weak disturbance is forecast to move across the region Friday.  Will 
carry chance PoPs tonight for lingering convection, then back up to 
likely PoPs all areas on Friday.  While convective energy does not 
look very impressive for Friday, will keep mention of strong gusty 
winds and heavy rainfall that could lead to localized flooding in 
the HWO.  

.LONG TERM...(Friday Night through Thursday)...At the beginning of 
this period, we are still under the presence of an upper trough over 
the eastern U.S., with a surface cold front to our NW near the Ohio 
Valley, moving to the southeast sluggishly toward us.  There is poor 
agreement with the models on the actual frontal passage, but 
generally some time on Saturday. If the front hangs up somewhat, it 
doesn't appear to have huge impacts--yes, rain chances linger, but 
with little focus along thre front and only marginal instability, 
only weak thunderstorms would be expected Saturday.  The setting for 
late Saturday night looks dry overall, but by Sunday a surge of 
elevated lift and moisture stream into the area as the frontal 
boundary lingers in the southeastern U.S.  The overall pattern is 
quite unsettled for the remainder of the forecast period.  By next 
Tuesday, a weak ridge tries to build into the area, but another 
shortwave or two race through the area keeping the ridge at bay.

the Southern Appalachians today. A few showers will be around this
morning impacting cha and tys with the lowest flight condition at

313 AM EDT Thu Aug 10 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today through Saturday night)...
The pattern through this period will change very little, with a
broad trough over the eastern CONUS and a moist air mass remaining
in place. The timing of the best rain chances will depend on small
disturbances in the flow that the models typically do not resolve
well, so confidence in the details is low, particularly outside
the first 24 hours. A diurnal trend to convection will be favored.

Today will feature likely PoPs as a midlevel shortwave trough 
that is currently near the MS River will track across our area 
this afternoon. Weak instability with tall/skinny CAPE profiles 
and PW near 2 inches may make for a threat of locally heavy rain
and minor flooding issues, but no severe threat. Friday looks much
the same but with better dynamics and wind shear as an upper jet 
streak dips into the OH Valley, so PoPs in the likely range will
continue, as will the heavy rain threat.

On Saturday there will be a weak surface boundary moving through 
during the day that will require chance PoPs for the area, but a 
more northwesterly flow in the 850-700 mb layer should lead to 
some drying aloft and thus lower rain chances compared to today
and Friday. Afternoon high temperatures will continue to be 
slightly below normal through Saturday.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Wednesday)...
It still appears that there will be a chance for convection to 
start the new week with plenty of moisture and a long wave trough 
over the Eastern U.S. along with at least a couple shorter 
wavelength features progged to shift southeast across the Ohio 
Valley and Central Appalachians. Perhaps the probability of 
precipitation will be a little higher Monday and Monday night as 
an associated cool front builds south across the forecast area. 
The boundary will still be moving slowly south through the viewing
area on Tuesday, so kept some decent chance pops going for this 
period. The boundary is expected to be far enough south of the 
area by Wednesday to lower the chance for a shower or 
thunderstorm. Max and min temperatures will be close to normal 
through the long term.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...A weak inverted surface 
trough will be centered to our west overnight, and the more 
southerly flow over our area will help to increase moisture.  A weak 
short wave trough in mid levels is forecast to track across the 
region Thursday.  With considerable moisture across the area and at 
least weak instability, should see more numerous showers and 
thunderstorms on Thursday.  MAV temps generally look reasonable, so 
nothing more than minor tweaks for the short term period.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday Night through Wednesday)...For Thursday night 
and Friday, main weather feature will remain an inverted trough over 
the far eastern sections of the area. Airmass remains moist and 
unstable, especially near the spine of the Appalachians. Will call 
for likely PoPs across the far eastern Tennessee mountains/southwest 
North Carolina with only low chance PoPs over the Plateau.

For Friday, an upper trough will move across the Great Lake states 
with trailing frontal boundary moving through the Ohio Valley. This 
boundary will remain north of the area for Saturday, so will only 
call for chance PoPs in the afternoon and mainly across the terrain 
features.

For Sunday and Sunday Night, moisture/instability returns with PWs 
increasing to near 2 inches. Frontal boundary remain just north of 
the area, but will call for high chance/likely PoPs.

This frontal boundary will remain near the area for Monday and 
Tuesday keeping PoPs, especially for the afternoon/evening hours.

Another upper trough moves across the Great Lakes for late Tuesday 
and Tuesady night helping to pull the frontal boundary south with 
cooler, drier and stable air moving into the southern
Appalachians.

reaches of the Great Valley this morning with a layer just below
five thousand feet and some alto cu ceilings above that layer.
Just enough afternoon heating and instability could allow for the
formation of a few showers and a thunderstorm around cha later in

with flight weather throughout the forecast period. However, there
will be a broken to overcast layer around five thousand feet at

.SHORT TERM (Today through Friday night)...
The pattern across the region through this period will feature
ample low level moisture with a weak flow - a pattern that the 
models generally do not handle well, and thus there is quite a bit
of divergence between them. 

For today, as high pressure drifts east across OH into MD, we 
should see an increasing S-SE flow in the low levels that will
advect moisture into the area. Southern sections and the mountains
will be favored for afternoon convection as northern sections will
have a downslope wind component and thus greater stability. More
sunshine and downsloping may give higher temps north than south
today. 

Models show some agreement on the passage of a shortwave trough on
Thursday that will bring enhanced rain chances to the entire 
area, mainly in the afternoon. PoPs will rise to likely this 
period as PW values rise above normal ahead of the trough. At this
point, the models diverge. The NAM shows a second, stronger 
shortwave trough following closely behind on Friday, with a 
surface low tracking across KY Friday night. The GFS and SREF show
a more diurnal trend to rain chances on Friday with weak forcing
within the broad upper trough. Will stick closer to the latter 
solution for the current forecast given the lack of confidence in 
the fairly strong forcing shown by the NAM.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Tuesday)...
The period should be a little more unsettled than we usually see 
in the middle of August in the Mid South. A mean upper level 
trough holds its position over the Eastern states through the 
weekend into the early part of the work week. The probability of 
showers and thunderstorms will gradually increase Sunday into 
Monday as moisture builds across the Southern Appalachian region 
in advance of a relatively significant cool front expected to slip
just south of the forecast area by Tuesday morning. Temperatures 
will remain near normal in the middle 80s while lows hold a few 
degrees above normal in the upper 60s and lower 70s in the more 
humid airmass over the weekend. It will be a couple degrees cooler
with the frontal boundary in the area Monday and Tuesday.

.AVIATION...It should be a generally quiet period for the 
aviation community with some drier air across most of the Great 
Valley. However, a little more moisture and instability is in 
place near the northern Alabama and Georgia border. Weak short 
wave energy and some heating could allow for the development of a 
few showers and a thunderstorm in this area which would include

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...
Frontal boundary remains south of the area tonight with a mostly 
clear sky, especially across northern portions of the forecast 
area. Depending upon exact cloud cover and boundary layer 
moisture, may have some patchy fog develop in the favored 
locations such as sheltered valleys and near rivers and lakes.

A warm front begins to move north on Wednesday resulting in
additional cloud cover expanding across the area from south to
north during the day. A few showers and thunderstorms may be
possible, especially during the afternoon across southeast
Tennessee and southwest North Carolina. Highest PoPs expected to
be across southern portions of the forecast area where best lift
and moisture will be collocated near the frontal boundary.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
H5 troughing will persist from the Great Lakes toward the 
Ohio/Mississippi Valleys for most of the period. Moist southerly 
low level flow will remain in place and occasionally interact with
weak frontal boundaries that will enter the area. Peak precip 
timeframe look like Thursday and Sunday, in keeping with frontal 
boundary encroachments. Locally heavy rainfall that could produce 
flooding looks to be the primary weather risk in this extended 
forecast. Models suggest that the Sunday/Sunday night front will 
actually push far enough south to scour out the moisture and rain 
around next Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Rain across our southern sections this morning is aligned with a
trough axis at 850 mb, while a surface cold front identified by a
weak dewpoint gradient and wind shift is across our northern
sections. Through the morning, both features will continue a
southward movement, bringing in a northerly low level flow and a
drier air mass. Most of the area should stay dry through the
afternoon, with just low/slight chance PoPs in the southern
sections and TN mountains as the front will still be in that area
this afternoon. Cold advection will be counterbalanced by 
decreasing clouds and partial clearing, giving temps in the lower 
80s in most spots, with 60s for lows tonight as high pressure
settles across the Ohio Valley region.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...
Will remain in a rather active weather pattern throughout the 
extended. A weak...broad frontal boundary will be to our south 
Tuesday night and this will provide us with our best shot at a dry
period. However...a few showers/thunderstorms developing along 
the boundary may still move into some southern and eastern 
locations...so will continue with 20 and some 30 POPs those areas.
The boundary will slowly lift northward and back into the MRX CWA
on Wednesday into Wednesday night...increasing the chance of 
convection from south to north. Then...with the diffuse boundary 
over the general area...the next system will move in. There 
remains some disagreement on timing of the next frontal boundary 
but it should move in around Thursday or Friday and should provide
us with our best chance of convection for the extended. With high
PWs in place...the main threat is expected to be heavy rainfall 
with the potential for localized flooding. Lingering showers or 
thunderstorms combined with the potential for some diurnal 
convection on Saturday will keep chance POPs in place for the 
first part of the weekend. The next system is progged to move in 
around the Sunday/Monday time frame and will once again see an 
increased chance of convection across the area.

into the 1.0-1.5 inch range and expect mostly dry conditions on
Tuesday. The front is forecast to stall just to the south of the

first part of the weekend. The next system is progged to move in

Forecast is on track today with cooler than normal temperatures
due to extensive cloud cover and numerous showers and a few
thunderstorms. With the saturated tropical-like airmass between

Variable conditions can be expected at all TAF sites as periods of

condition should be MVFR, with IFR possible at times if a stronger
storm with heavier rain moves directly over a terminal.
Thunderstorms will be possible but too infrequent to mention
beyond VCTS. Most rain should taper off in the evening as a front
moves through the area, but lingering low level moisture behind
the front will likely keep IFR cigs through the night.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
A stationary front is located E-W across southern KY this morning,
and a surface low now over SW KY will be tracking along it through
the day. With PW values around 2 inches and tall/skinny CAPE
profiles in forecast soundings, there will be some potential for
locally heavy rain and flooding, and a marginal severe threat from
strong downburst winds. Northern areas will be favored for highest
PoPs today, but still in the categorical range for the entire
area. As the surface low moves into VA this evening, the front 
will push southward and bringing drier air into northern sections
as the low level flow turns to NW. This should result in lowering
rain chances spreading through the night. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...
Low and mid level winds on Tuesday will shift to out of the north
and northeast as a mid level high pressure develops just to the 
north of TN. This will limit the amount of moisture and 
instability available...as well as hinder the showers and 
thunderstorms that can initiate through the afternoon. Only left 
in chance precipitation in areas south of I40 with weak lift 
possible trailing the frontal boundary that will be east of the 
Appalachians by Tuesday morning. By Wednesday...the mid level high
pressure is expected to weaken and move to the east...with flow 
returning to out of the south and southwest. This will begin to 
increase moisture to the area. Showers and thunderstorms will 
again be limited with instabilities less than 1500 J/kg. Could 
expect isolated short lived showers in the afternoon...but 
otherwise expect a mostly dry day. 

By Thursday...winds will continue to bring moisture into the 
area...while a trough develops over the Great Lakes and a frontal 
boundary approches. Showers and thunderstorms are possible ahead of 
this front Thursday late morning through Thursday evening. With 
moderate instabilities...large PW values...and a weak wind 
profile...not expecting any storms to be severe. The greatest threat 
appears to be heavy rainfall with high accumulations possible from 
slow moving storms. The frontal boundary will move through the area 
on Friday...with showers and thunderstorms possible again through 
the day. PW values remain large with heavy rainfall and high 
accumulation totals the main threat. By Friday night...coverage of 
convection should be less due to weakened instabilities. 

Saturday and Sunday...models try to keep the front held just south 
of the area...with scattered showers and thunderstorms possible each 
day. Temperatures through the extended are expected to remain fairly 
stagnant due to the cloud cover through the week.

An upper level shortwave trough is just to the west across west
Tennessee and northern Mississippi. A warm front has lifted north
across the area with surface dewpoints now in the mid 60s to low
70s at most locations. PW values have increased into the 1.8-2.1 
inch range and expect widespread showers and storms throughout the
remainder of the night. Precipitation has been a bit slower to 
move into NE TN and SW VA and pushed back the higher PoPs until 
after 06z for these locations. Rainfall totals tonight are 
forecast to be in the 0.5-2.0 inch range and there could be a few 
areas of localized flooding especially in areas of poor drainage.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Monday)...
A warm front will continue to move north across the region this
evening and move north of our area tonight as low pressure
approaches from the west. Because of the increasing cloud cover
and being located south of the warm front, expect low temperatures
to be a degree or two above guidance. 

An upper-level jet streak to our north across the Ohio Valley will
support a strengthening low-level jet across our area tonight and
tomorrow supporting moisture transport and low-level convergence.
At the same time, a 500mb shortwave trough will result in
additional support for ascent late tonight into Monday as the
surface low moves just to our north. This will lead to deep moist
convergence in our area, especially across northern portions of 
the CWA closer to the surface low and front. Together, this will 
lead to likely and categorical PoPs across the area late tonight 
and Monday. Given the combination of PW values of around 
2.0”-2.2” which are around the 95th percentile of climatology,
deep moisture between the surface and 500mb, warm cloud layer 
depths greater than 12k feet, strengthening low-level convergence,
and storm motion nearly parallel to the approaching front, areas 
of heavy rainfall are expected with localized flooding possible 
late tonight and Monday. Temperatures should be below normal on 
Monday with extensive cloud cover and precipitation.

.LONG TERM (Monday night through Sunday)...
A frontal boundary stretched across TN will remain stalled over 
the general area throughout the extended period as a series of 
weak short waves track along it. Models continue to show 
differences in details but overall...the boundary will continually
shift over the region... occasionally dropping south of the TN/GA
border. This boundary will remain the focus of convective 
activity throughout the extended and will therefore see at least a
chance of showers and thunderstorms each day. Due to the 
continual chance of convection and the dominant cloud 
cover...temperatures through the week should stay near to slightly
below normal.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Showers moving east across northern West TN early this morning are
likely to weaken and dissipate before reaching our area as the
environment is quite dry and stable at the moment. This will begin
to change in the afternoon as low pressure moves east across the
Ozarks and the SW 850 mb flow advects higher theta-e air into the
area. A surface warm front will be spreading northward into the
area by the evening, so southern areas appear favored for
afternoon and evening showers and storms. A 500 mb shortwave
trough will approach from the west tonight, and with PW values
approaching 2 inches and the LLJ increasing to around 30-35 kts, 
likely PoPs will be forecast for the entire area after midnight.
Overnight timing will mean weak instability and little to no
severe threat, and perhaps only scattered thunderstorms, but 
localized heavy rain may be a possibility in the moist 
environment.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...
The boundary that sets up over the area will remain through the 
extended. Several short waves move through this boundary through 
the work week...and with enough instability and moisture...will 
more than likely see diurnal showers and thunderstorms each day. 
With instabilities hovering around 2000 J/kg each day...and PW 
values around the 75th percentile for this time of year...would 
expect any severe storms to be limited with plenty of rainfall 
accumulation possible. With no great change in air mass over the 
area...high temperatures will stay fairly consistent in the upper 
70s to lower 80s each day...with low temperatures in the mid to 
upper 60s

fair and cool night, with fair weather continuing through Sunday 
morning. A quick-moving weather system will induce southerly flow 
and moisture-return by Sunday afternoon, with isolated to 
scattered afternoon convection expected over the central and 
southern portions of the CWA. 

.LONG TERM (Sunday Night through Saturday)...A short wave will move 
in from the south as a broad frontal boundary settles over the 
region Sunday night into Monday.  This will bring a band of showers

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Surface obs show a strong dewpoint gradient from east to west
across the area, identifying the location of a cold front. By
sunrise, the front will be to our east, and dewpoints will
continue to fall through the day, with clearing skies and 850 mb
cold advection. This will make for a very pleasant day, with below
normal temperatures reaching the upper 70s to mid 80s and
afternoon dewpoints in the 50s. Under clear skies and calm winds,
temps tonight will drop into the mid 50s to lower 60s in most
spots.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...
Not much change to the long term portion of the forecast from 
previous updates. Still expect mostly dry conditions to end the 
weekend before our next system moves into the area. Broad trough 
over the eastern half of the United States will bring along a 
frontal boundary that will remain the main player through the work
week. Front will slowly push through to our south for the first 
part of the week before stalling out. The boundary, wherever it 
decides to set up shop, is forecasted to remain close to our 
forecast area. This will lead to increased cloud coverage and rain
chances throughout the work week. It's a bit difficult to pin 
down the exact location of this frontal boundary at this time 
since there is no major synoptic level forcing it to move a 
particular direction. So for this forecast broadbrushed 
precipitation chances were applied to most of the CWA, especially 
in the second half of the work week. Rain chances will likely 
linger into the weekend and beyond this 7-day forecast.

.AVIATION...
A cold front is currently crossing the area, and behind it, winds
will shift to NW and cigs may become broken at MVFR levels at
times. Satellite and obs suggest that the MVFR conditions will be
variable overnight, so they will be covered with TEMPOs at all
sites. Clear skies are expected by late morning with a north wind
below 10 kts at all sites through the day.

.DISCUSSION...Little change from previous forecast. Shower and 
storm coverage has dwindled greatly. What is left will continue to
move eastward and eventually out of our area as the front passes 
through. Expect clouds to slowly clear through the night with 
overnight lows around 5 degrees below normal. A few minor tweaks 
to forecast which included updating hourly temps and dewpoints, 
and adjustments to POP and SKY grids to better time the frontal 
passage. No new zones will be sent.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Sunday)...The primary weather this
period will be ongoing as the evening begins, with frontal 
boundary driving the development of convection from the TN Vlly 
westward. Back edge of convection extends southwest from 
Nashville, and that edge should be moving through our area 
through the evening hours. SPC continues the marginal risk of 
severe thunderstorms, with high wind gusts and hail being the 
primary threat, though marginally. But the weather will be 
clearing out of our area as the night progresses, and we are 
looking forward to a nice weekend, with only slight chances of 
showers during Sunday afternoon, if that.

.LONG TERM (Sunday Night through Friday)...Will be in an active 
weather pattern throughout the extended.  On Sunday night into 
Monday...a cold front will drop into the Southern Appalachian 
Region.  The associated band of thunderstorms will spread across the 
area for likely to category POPs.  The frontal boundary is then 
progged to stall over region. It will remain the focus of activity 
through the rest of the period as a series of weak impulses track 
along it.  Models continue to show differences in the placement of 
the boundary but do expect the boundary to oscillate back and forth 
over the general area.  Models also show difference in timing of the 
weak waves moving through.  So overall...confidence low on details 
but continuing a forecast of chance to likely showers/thunderstorms 
each period is reasonable and will therefore see little change in 
the forecast.  With the occasional precipitation and associated 
cloud cover...temperatures should stay near to slightly below normal 
through the extended.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
A low pressure system tracking across the upper Great Lakes region
today will bring a cold front toward our area by the evening.
Isolated to scattered showers may be possible in the morning, but
the main period of storms will begin in the early afternoon as a
pre-frontal trough moves into the Cumberland Plateau, with peak
forcing in the 18-22Z time frame as the upper jet dips into KY/WV.
Instability is modest through the day as is shear, so the threat 
of severe storms appears low but cannot be ruled out entirely. 
Precip chances will decrease in the evening as the upper level 
forcing exits, with isolated to scattered storms possible until 
the surface cold front exits around 06Z. 

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...
First part of the weekend looks to be dry as the frontal boundary is 
pushed off to our southeast and keeps the moisture away for a brief 
period of time. With the lack of moisture the skies will clear 
through most of the weekend and Sunday will most likely be the 
warmest day of this forecast with, but even then temperatures are 
expected to be near, or just below normal for this time of year. 

The clear skies won't last for very long as broad troughing and some 
shortwaves in the upper atmosphere zip along a frontal boundary that 
is expected to stall out over us at the beginning of the work week. 
This is not a very strong system, but with the frontal boundary 
expected to slowly meander north/south over the area for several 
days this upcoming week we will likely see mostly cloudy skies and 
prolonged periods of rain chances. Models are having a bit of a 
difficult time in determining the location of the boundary and 
therefore the precipitation associated with it, so broadbrush rain 
chances have been put into the forecast. Hopefully these will be 
trimmed and refined as we move forward in time and models come into 
better agreement. These increased rain chances come with increased 
cloudiness and the temperatures in our area are expected to remain 
below normal for this entire 7-day forecast. Most of the valley 
locations will likely see highs in the upper 70s to mid 80s.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Saturday)...Only isolated convection
over higher terrain is expected this evening. But bands of
convection currently over the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys are 
signs of things to come. A cold front is forecast to move through 
the area late Friday with showers and thunderstorms associated 
with it. The peak period of activity will be between 3 pm and 
midnight. SPC has covered the event with a marginal risk of severe
storms. The convection will push eastward by Saturday morning, 
with a mostly sunny day for much of the forecast area to kick off 
the weekend.

.LONG TERM (Saturday Night through Thursday)...Behind an exiting 
cold front...flow aloft will quickly become zonal with surface high 
pressure building in.  This will provide us with a brief dry period 
for Saturday night. The next system will push in rather quickly and 
should reach into the MRX CWA late Sunday into Monday. Ahead of the 
approaching frontal boundary...scattered thunderstorm can be 
expected Sunday afternoon. Then...will see a line of organized 
convection develop and move across the Southern Appalachian Region 
with the frontal boundary late Sunday night into Monday.  The 
boundary is expected to stall across the region.  However...models 
in poor agreement as to where the boundary will settle...but 
overall...it is expected to fluctuate along the TN/GA border. With 
this feature over the general area...expect us to remain in an 
unsettle weather pattern through the rest of the extended.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Similar forecast to what we 
saw yesterday with a weak and broad upper-level trough still in 
place and weak high pressure at the surface. Expect another round of 
isolated, terrain-based, convection this afternoon with valley 
locations staying dry. Based on soundings, looks like we will see a 
little more sunshine today. Few clouds means warmer temps. Most 
areas will see temperatures a degree or two warmer than yesterday 
with highs generally in the mid to upper 80s. Clouds on the increase 
tonight as the trough begins to amplify in response to a low 
pressure system moving into the Great Lakes region. Lows will be in 
the mid to upper 60s for most areas.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...Unsettled pattern will 
continue through the extended period with upper level troughing in 
place. The first period of active weather will be Friday into 
Saturday morning as a cold front pushes through the area. Have 
included chance to likely PoPs for Friday afternoon through early 
Saturday for convection associated with this frontal passage. We'll 
be between systems Saturday through early Sunday and it should be a 
fairly pleasant weekend. The next weather system to impact our area 
is another shortwave pushing through Sunday night into Monday. 
Again, have included chance to likely PoPs due to increasing 
moisture and instability combined with lift provided with the upper 
trough overhead. Precipitation chances behind this second system 
remain elevated with another cold front moving in later in the 
workweek. Forecast high temperatures will be quite tolerable for 
early August in the trough pattern only warming to the lower and 
middle 80s through the extended period.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Thursday)...

Current radar and satellite imagery indicates a few showers and 
storms beginning to fire along the higher elevations of the Southern 
Appalachians and the Cumberland Plateau. SBCAPE values currently 
range from around 1000-2000 J/Kg but the atmosphere is relatively 
dry for early August with PW values in the 1.1-1.3 inch range. 
Overall, expect the activity to remain limited to the higher 
elevations with mostly dry conditions in the valley. Current water 
vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a broad trough 
across the Central and Eastern CONUS. A jet streak moving through 
the region has kept high clouds in throughout much of the day with 
cooler than average high temperatures today. 

Expect any ongoing showers and storms should come to an end this 
evening and overnight with the loss of daytime heating. Also 
forecasting some areas of patchy fog similar to last night. Mid to 
high clouds will continue into Thursday with broad troughing 
continuing across the region. Temperatures will once again be a 
couple of degrees below normal. Moisture starts to return some late 
in the short-term period ahead of an approaching front and expect to 
see a bit more coverage of showers and storms late Thursday 
afternoon.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...

It looks like three periods of more active weather interspersed 
through the extended forecast. The first is the advertised upper 
trough and associated surface cool frontal passage late in the 
week with highest probability of convection Friday into Saturday 
morning followed by a rather pleasant and mainly dry weekend. The 
next feature is another short wave riding east across the Mid 
South Sunday night into Monday with some likely probabilities for 
showers and thunderstorms due to increasing moisture and 
instability, along with lifting associated with the upper trough. 
The chance for rain will remain relatively high through the end of
the long term as another cool front moves in behind the early 
work week wave. Forecast high temperatures will be quite tolerable
for early August in the trough pattern only warming to the lower 
and middle 80s through the extended period.

306 AM EDT Wed Aug 2 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Weak and broad upper-level 
trough resides over the area. With weak upper-level forcing in 
place do expect a few terrain-based storms to develop this 
afternoon; the valley should stay relatively dry with surface high
pressure still in control. Mid-level moisture will keep the sun 
behind the clouds for the most part but some areas will see more 
sun than others throughout the day. Cloudiness will keep 
temperatures in the mid to upper 80s, which is near normal to a 
few degrees below normal. Convection that does develop this 
afternoon will fade this evening with the setting sun. Expect some
partial clearing overnight, allowing lows to drop into the lower 
60s to mid 60s, which is a degree or two below normal. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...Troughing will remain in 
place over the region for the majority of the extended period, 
resulting in an unsettled pattern. For Thursday, diurnal convection 
is possible across the higher terrain. A cold front pushes through 
the area Friday into early Saturday, bringing a better chance for 
widespread showers and thunderstorms. MLCAPE values around 1000 J/kg 
and bulk shear values maxing out around 25 kts would be enough to 
support some marginally severe storms, but a widespread severe 
threat is not expected at this time. More significantly, PWAT values 
around 1.5"-1.8" could lead to some localized flooding issues, 
especially if storms begin to train over the same area. Models want 
to hang the cold front up just south of the forecast area on Sunday, 
which would bring a continued chance for convection, especially to 
the southern half of the forecast area. Another upper level trough 
and associated cold front will impact the area early in the 
workweek, bringing another increased chance of showers and 
thunderstorms. With some differences in coverage and timing between 
models, for now have broadbrushed mainly chance PoPs for Sunday 
night through Tuesday across the forecast area. Highs should remain 
relatively steady in the lower and middle 80s through the period 
with overnight lows in the 60s.

.SHORT TERM (Today through tomorrow)...
Surface level high pressure still over the area, but weak upper
level trough above us has lead to an increase in cloud coverage
today. Currently there is some isolated convection occurring in 
the higher terrain of the southern Appalachian Mountains, which 
could slightly increase in coverage through this evening. However 
it pretty dry down in the Tennessee Valley, so I am not expecting 
storms to be able to move very far away from the higher terrain. 
Another quiet night is expected tonight with another chance for 
some convection along the higher terrain again tomorrow.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Sunday)...
Once again, the Superblend broadbrushes chance probability 
throughout the forecast period. However, the main periods of 
precipitation appear to be Friday into Friday night as an upper 
trough amplifies into the Eastern United States driving a cold 
front through the region. There should be a reduced chance for 
convection behind this feature over the weekend but another upper 
level trough will be pressing into the eastern states again for 
the beginning of the work week. This will lead to an increasing 
chance for showers and thunderstorms Monday into Tuesday as 
another cool front builds toward the forecast area. Highs should 
remain relatively steady in the lower and middle 80s through the 
period.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Surface high pressure remains in place today. Upper level
troughing deeps overhead, allowing winds to shift to the south and
funnel moisture into the area. A few isolated showers/ 
thunderstorms may fire this afternoon along the higher terrain
with this little bit of moisture in place and high clouds will
overspread the area. Otherwise, will be another quiet day with
temperatures a few degrees below normal. Overnight lows will be
near normal again tonight with dry conditions and mostly cloudy
skies.

.LONG TERM...
We will be in somewhat of a trough pattern through the long term. We 
start the period under the influence of a weak, non-amplified, upper-
level trough. Enough upper-level jet energy and moisture in place 
that diurnal terrain based storms look possible during the 
afternoon Wednesday, with even a chance for an isolated storm down
in the valley. Some of this activity may linger into the night 
Wednesday due to the mid and upper-level support still in place. 
Highs will be in the mid to upper 80s with lows in lower to mid 
60s. By Thursday we have a stronger wave dropping down into the 
Northern Plains that will help to amplify the pre-existing trough.
Our weather will remain relatively unchanged though, with diurnal
showers and storms possible. 

By Friday the trough becomes even more amplified as a now well 
defined closed low moves across the Great Lakes region. There are 
timing differences with this system as the GFS has the pre-frontal 
showers and storms moving through during the day on Friday and ECMWF 
holds it off until Friday night. Storm strength will depend on 
timing. In general, there does look to be enough instability and 
shear with this system to warrant a few strong to severe storms, but 
that all depends on timing. Front pushes into our area late Fri 
night/Saturday depending on what model you prefer. Will have likely 
POPs for Friday and Friday night. Could be some lingering showers 
through the day on Saturday depending on where the front is. Highs 
on Friday will be in the low to mid 80s with lows in the lower to 
mid 60s. Cooler highs on Saturday as we start to get some cooler and 
drier air moving in behind the front. Highs will be in the upper 70s 
to lower 80s with lows in the upper 50s low 60s. Still some chances 
for showers and storms on Sunday as the ECMWF shows the front washed 
out across the area, which could provide focus for precip. Another 
wave rotates through the trough on Monday into Tuesday which will 
give us another shot at showers and storms. Highs will be in the low 
80s Monday and upper 80s Tuesday.

National Weather Service Morristown TN 
438 PM EDT Mon Jul 31 2017

.Update...Updated zone package to correct Monday, August 7th.

.SHORT TERM...
Quiet weather continues today with a few more clouds in the skies
than we have seen in the past few days. Moisture in the atmosphere
will begin to increase overnight into tomorrow causing increased
cloud coverage. Otherwise a persistence forecast was basically run
this time with conditions expected to be similar as they were
yesterday, and again similar conditions are expected during the 
daytime tomorrow.

.LONG TERM...
At the beginning of this period, the upper trough is still in place 
over the eastern U.S. and at the surface our area is still under the 
ridge although it is weakening. As we get deeper into the week a 
frontal system works its way through the Plains and Miss Valley 
and induces a return flow from the Gulf as our surface ridge stays
put. It looks like around Friday the front will pass through with
showers and storms along and ahead of it. Instability for Friday 
looks iffy at best now for any threat of severe storms. Right now 
the timing looks like the main line of storms might hit at night 
when instability would be lower as well. The front looks like it 
will not surge through the area, so it might hang up close enough 
to not completely get rid of the POPs in the eastern most areas. 
For this post-frontal precip, will just go with showers.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Pleasant, quiet weather continues under surface high pressure and
dry northwest flow aloft. Under clear skies, temperatures will
quickly warm into the low to mid 80s today. However, with the dry
airmass overhead it will still feel pleasant with relative
humidities in the 30s and 40s this afternoon. After sunset, 
temperatures will drop into the 60s areawide under limited cloud 
cover.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...
Dry northwest flow aloft and surface ridging will remain Tuesday.
A gradual increase in moisture and instability will begin 
Wednesday and Thursday, but still limited with forcing confined to
orographic lift. Will call for low chance PoPs, mainly over the 
terrain features.

For Friday, an unseasonably strong upper trough will move across the 
Great Lakes and northern Ohio Valley with a trailing cold front 
moving through the Tennessee Valley late Friday/Friday night. 
Models show right entrance region of the upper jet across the 
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys which will enhance the lift along the 
frontal boundary. Will call for high chance/likely PoPs for Friday
(mainly afternoon) and Friday night. 

Increasing wind fields may produce some strong/possibly severe 
storms with the frontal boundary. However, models show limiting 
factor may be instability. Will need to watch the evolution of this 
system closely, especially given the unusual strength of the upper 
trough for this time of the year.

For Saturday/Sunday, frontal boundary moves south of the area with 
return of drier west/northwest flow. ECMWF and GFS have differences 
in respect of moisture return into the Tennessee Valley for Sunday, 
but for now will trend toward the drier solution.

230 PM EDT Sun Jul 30 2017

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Monday)...

A quiet and tranquil day weather wise across the Southern 
Appalachians. Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis 
indicates the trough axis is along the Eastern Seaboard with a ridge 
across the Central and Western CONUS. Closer to home, seeing dry 
northerly to northwesterly flow aloft behind the departing trough 
with the ridge expanding into the area. PW values are near the 
minimum observed for late July with readings ranging from 0.6-0.8 
inches. Much of the same is forecast throughout the short-term 
forecast. Overnight lows will range from around 5-10 degrees below
normal tonight. May even see some lows near record values. The 
record low for Tri-Cities for July 31st is 55 degrees set in 1993 
and the forecast low is currently 57. 

The dry airmass and mostly sunny skies should lead to a quick warm 
up during the day on Monday. Highs will climb up into the mid to 
upper 80s across most valley locations but the lower humidity will 
continue with dewpoints in the upper 50s and low 60s. 

.LONG TERM (Monday night through Sunday)...

Dry northwest flow aloft and surface ridging will keep the region 
rain-free with limited cloud cover on Monday night and Tuesday. 
Surface ridging weakens on Wednesday and Thursday with a gradual 
increase in moisture and instability. A weak 500mb shortwave will 
move into the region but dynamics are quite limited across our area 
with best lift and moisture to our south. May still see a small 
chance of general ordinary convection across the higher terrain of 
the mountains and plateau.

An anomalously deep upper trough will approach/move across the area 
on Friday and Saturday with a cold front at the surface. Timing has 
improved since yesterday with the GFS coming into better agreement 
with the ECMWF solution moving the cold front through our area 
Friday night and early Saturday. The best lift and moisture is 
expected to be just ahead of this front with likely PoPs late Friday 
and Friday night. Depending on timing and mesoscale details which 
will have to be fine tuned later, a few thunderstorms could be 
strong with such a deep trough in place. May still have a few rain 
showers along the eastern Tennessee mountains and southwest Virginia 
early Saturday. Gradual clearing is expected behind the front with 
drier conditions by Saturday night and Sunday.

.DISCUSSION...

The forecast is in good shape today with dry conditions forecast 
to continue. PW values are currently in the 0.6-0.8 inch range, 
which is near the minimum values observed for late July. For the 
update, just made some minor adjustments to the hourly 
temperature and dewpoint grids.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Continued northwest flow aloft and building surface high pressure will
allow for dry and sunny conditions today with highs generally in 
the low to mid 80s. PW values will drop into the 0.60-0.75" range 
today, which is near the minimum climatological averages for late 
July. With continued northwest flow and dry air overhead, lows 
overnight will drop down into the upper 50s to lower 60s; feeling
quite cool compared to recent nights. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...
For Monday and Tuesday, dry northwest flow aloft and surface ridging 
will keep the region rain-free with limited cloud cover.  For 
Wednesday and Thursday, surface ridging weakens with a gradual 
increase in moisture and instability. Aloft, a weak short-wave will 
move into the Tennessee valley, but dynamics quite limited. Will 
introduce a small chance of convection, but mainly for the 
orographic lift areas.

For Friday and Saturday, an unseasonably deep upper trough will 
approach/move across the area. Extended range models differ in 
timing with the GFS the slowest. Will call for high chance/likely 
PoPs. Given the strength of the upper trough and expected increase 
moisture/instability, will need to watch for the potential of severe 
storms with this system.

.DISCUSSION...Overall weather pattern shows north to 
northwesterly flow aloft with surface high pressure building in. 
This pattern has brought cooler and much drier air into the region. 
Dew points are in the 50s to low 60s and lows tonight are expected 
to fall into the mid 50s to mid 60s across most valley locations. So 
should generally see a quiet...dry and seasonally cool night.    All

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Sunday)...

A much more pleasant day across the Southern Appalachians with 
surface dewpoints this afternoon in the upper 50s to mid 60s and 
temperatures in the upper 70s to mid 80s. Current water vapor 
imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a trough along the 
Carolina coast with northerly to northwesterly flow aloft across the 
forecast area. Drier air is filtering in behind the departing front 
with PW values currently in the 0.9-1.1 inch range. There have been 
some low level clouds today across the region especially across SW 
VA and NE TN. The northwesterly flow in the low levels has also lead 
to some clouds from orographic lift along the mountains. The cooler 
and drier air will continue to advect in overnight with forecast 
lows in the mid 50s to mid 60s. PW values will continue to drop on 
Sunday to near minimum values observed for late July. Therefore, 
expect cooler than normal conditions with mostly sunny skies. 

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)...

Longwave troughing across the East Coast will bring a dry northerly 
flow across the Southern Appalachians and Tennessee Valley early 
this week. Surface high pressure and dry air will keep conditions 
mostly clear for Monday and Tuesday. Daytime highs on Monday will be 
a couple of degrees below normal with daytime highs closer to 
seasonal normals on Tuesday and Wednesday as troughing exits and 
heights rise. Nighttime lows will be several degrees below normal 
through Wednesday with calm winds and dry air at the surface. It 
will be very nice for this time of year with low humidity.

Expect a few shortwaves moving through the region through mid to 
late week. Expect activity in our area on Wednesday to be largely 
suppressed with the best lift and moisture to our south along the 
Gulf Coast. PoPs will slowly be on the increase on Thursday and 
especially Friday as low level moisture will be on the increase, 
height falls provide support for ascent as troughing starts to 
develop across the Eastern CONUS, and a surface cold front drops 
south from the Ohio River Valley. However, there is uncertainty with 
how quickly the surface cold front and trough axis will move east of 
the area. The ECMWF brings the cold front quickly through Friday 
night and early Saturday with dry conditions by Saturday afternoon. 
The GFS favors a slower solution with a wetter weekend. Based on 
current guidance, best rain chances look to be Friday through 
Saturday. Based on synoptic setup, next weekend would be expected to 
have temperatures back below normal.

.DISCUSSION...

The cold front is now to the southwest with cooler and drier air
filtering into the area. Some low level moisture lingering behind
the front in the 925-850 mb layer has lead to a deck of stratus
across SE KY and NE TN. Due to this, increased cloud cover in the
grids for NE TN and SW VA. Temperature and humidity levels will be
much more pleasant today for late July with forecast highs in the
upper 70s to mid 80s.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Drier and cooler air will work into the region today under
northwest flow behind yesterday's cold frontal passage. With
lingering surface moisture from yesterday's rain, some patchy fog
will form during the morning hours today. However, winds should
stay up and this should prevent widespread dense fog formation. With
building surface high pressure, skies will clear throughout the 
day. Winds may gust to 20kts at times this afternoon. Highs will
be mild, topping out in the upper 70s to lower 80s. Under clear
skies with drier air in place, lows tonight will dip into the
upper 50s to lower 60s. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...
Guidance continues to remain in excellent agreement for the long 
term period. 

Longwave trough axis sets up along the East Coast through Monday as 
broad/weak ridging and dry northerly flow dominate the pattern. At 
the surface, high pressure will gradually shift Southeast through 
Wednesday keeping low level moisture out of the region. Daytime 
highs start the week about 2-4 degrees below normal before climbing 
back to normal by midweek. Overnight lows remain 2-5 degrees below 
normal through Thursday with the help of low level dry air already 
in place.

Approaching front on Thursday and Friday will reintroduce POPs with 
greatest rain chances expected to hold out until Friday as low-
levels finally moisten with dewpoints getting back into the upper 
60s, in return SW flow.

730 PM EDT Fri Jul 28 2017

.UPDATE...Updated forecast package to remove late afternoon period.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Saturday)...

Scattered to numerous shower and storms currently across the 
forecast area as a lead shortwave trough moves ahead of a cold 
front. The best coverage early this afternoon is across NE TN and SW 
VA. There have been a few rumbles of thunder with this activity but 
not seeing any widespread thunder presently. Radar estimates of 
rainfall range from 0.5-1.0 inch in the heavier downpours and have 
not seen any flooding issues so far. PW values are elevated across 
the area with readings in the 2.0-2.3 inch range. Expect there will 
be a few areas with localized flash flooding issues this afternoon 
and evening. Most locations have seen less than a tenth of an inch 
with 3-hr FFG values around 2-3 inches and do not expect any 
widespread flooding issues. 

As the front progresses through the forecast area later this 
afternoon and evening, expect an increase in the coverage of showers 
and storms across the region. Current radar imagery indicates this 
beginning across Middle TN and Kentucky. Widespread cloud cover has 
kept temperatures down in the mid 70s to low 80s and only expect 
SBCAPE values in the 500-1000 J/Kg range as the front moves in. Deep 
layer shear will increase into the 25-35 kt range. Therefore, there 
could still be a couple of strong to marginally severe storms with 
gusty winds being the main threat but confidence is rather low due 
to the limiting factors. 

The front is forecast to move through the area this evening and into 
the overnight hours. Expect to see some precipitation linger across 
the mountains overnight with some weak orographic lift from the 
northwesterly flow behind the departing front. However, the main 
theme will be drier and cooler conditions late tonight into 
Saturday. PW values on Saturday will drop down into the 0.8-1.0 inch 
range which is near the 10th percentile for late July. Lower 
dewpoints in the low to mid 60s will make for a much more pleasant 
day with highs in the upper 70s to mid 80s.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...

It should be a quiet start to the long term period with the 
longwave trough axis to our east and a dry northerly flow aloft. 
At the surface, high pressure will be in control leading to ample 
sunshine and clear conditions for late this weekend through the 
first half of the week. This will result in temperatures slightly 
below normal with low humidity. This will be a rare treat for late
July.

Shortwave trough moves through the region on Wednesday, but limited 
moisture will still keep precipitation chances low. An approaching 
longwave trough and increasing moisture will lead to some chance 
PoPs on Thursday and Friday. 

Guidance is in very good agreement through the long term showing dry 
weather early in the week and troughing becoming more dominant once 
again by next weekend with rain chances on the rebound.

.AVIATION...

IFR to MVFR conditions currently across the terminals with
numerous to widespread showers moving over the region ahead of an
approaching front. The cloud cover has limited the amount of
instability and have not seen much lightning over the last couple
of hours. Due to this, removed VCTS over the next couple of 
hours. Expect there could be a few rumbles of thunder between 
21-02z and have continued with VCTS during this timeframe but 
confidence is not very high. Winds should remain up overnight 
preventing any dense fog issues but ceilings will remain in the 
MVFR category. Drier air will filter in behind the front and 
should see some improvements begin towards the end of the TAF 
cycle.

.DISCUSSION...

Current radar imagery indicates scattered showers across the area
with the best coverage across the Southern Valley and Plateau.
Radar estimates in Marion county show rainfall amounts of half an
inch to an inch with the higher rates to the south and west across
Northern Alabama and Southern Middle TN. Based off the current and
forecast rainfall rates, not expecting any widespread flooding
issues but could see some localized flash flooding today. PW
values are near the maximum observed for late July. Cloud cover 
ahead of the approaching front will keep temperatures in the mid 
70s to low 80s today. Due to this, SBCAPE values will only climb 
up into the 750-1500 J/Kg range. Deep layer 0-6 km shear will 
increase into the 25-35 kt range later this afternoon as the front
approaches from the northwest. There is a small chance there 
could be an isolated strong to marginally severe storm ahead of
the front. Overall, there appears to be too many limiting 
factors. The front will move through the area later this evening 
into tonight and drier conditions are forecast for Saturday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
An upper trough will move through the area today, with a weak
shortwave crossing the area this morning and a surface cold front
sweeping through this afternoon/evening. This will spark 
widespread showers and thunderstorms starting around sunrise this 
morning and continuing into the overnight hours. PW values are 
currently around 1.5 to 2 inches and will steadily increase today 
as the front approaches; topping out around 2 to 2.3 inches by 
this afternoon (which is near the climatological max for late 
July). Therefore, showers/storms today will be efficient rainers.
This will lead to a localized flooding threat today, especially
where multiple cells affect the same location. Areawide rainfall
averages should be in the 1-2" range. As for any severe weather
threat today, there's still a bit uncertainty with regards to how
much instability will be available as the front crosses the area
later today. While there will be decent shear (~30kts) by this 
afternoon, a lot depends on this morning's shortwave and how much 
it works over the atmosphere. The more widespread the showers and 
storms this morning, the less time there will be for the 
atmosphere to destabilize this afternoon. Models at this point 
indicate MLCAPE values of 700-1000 J/kg for the afternoon, which
isn't a ton of instability to work with. Can't rule out a few
stronger storms, but do not see a widespread severe potential
today. Will continue the mention of strong to severe storms in 
the HWO, with the main threats being isolated damaging winds and 
localized flooding. Front pushes east of the area overnight and 
cooler, drier air begins to work into the area. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...
Overall, guidance is in excellent agreement for the long term 
period. 

A possible lingering shower for the Appalachians and SW VA Saturday, 
but confidence is fairly low that much of this will even materialize 
as the best moisture is already east of the mountains. By Saturday 
evening, dry air funnels into the region as dewpoints drop into the 
lower 50s across SW VA and into the upper 50's in the Southern 
Valley by Sunday night. 

Longwave trough axis shifts over the Atlantic seaboard late Sunday 
with dry northerly flow aloft dominating through the mid-week and 
eliminating any pcpn chances through Wednesday morning. Model 
indicated weak shortwave looks to push across the area late 
Wednesday. However, with very limited low level moisture to work 
with, expect very low pcpn chances across the area. 

Approaching trough aloft, associated surface front, and increasing 
low level moisture on Thursday will help to further increase pcpn 
chances by the afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...(This Afternoon through Friday)...A humid airmass 
across the area this afternoon with dewpoints in the low 70s. 
Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates 
that the ridge axis has now pushed to the south with a trough to 
the northwest across the MId-Mississippi River Valley. PW values 
continue to increase ahead of this approaching system with values 
currently in the 1.6-1.8 inch range. Also, seeing a few more 
shower/storms this afternoon than the past few days thanks to the 
increased moisture. The ongoing cloud cover should keep SBCAPE 
values in the 1000-2000 J/Kg range this afternoon and 0-6 km shear
is only around 10-20 kts. Therefore, expect there could be a 
storm or two that becomes strong to marginally severe with 
damaging winds being the main threat. Models indicate a sharp drop
off in the coverage and intensity this evening and overnight with
the loss of daytime heating. Another mild night is forecast with 
lows in the upper 60s to mid 70s. 

The forecast is rather challenging tomorrow and there are still 
some slight timing differences in the models. A cold front will 
track southeastward across the Mid-Mississippi and Ohio River 
Valleys as a closed upper low moves southeastward across the Great 
Lakes region. Closer to home a weak shortwave ahead of the front 
will move through during the morning hours. Models indicate that PW 
values during this timeframe will be up into the 2.0-2.3 inch range, 
which are near the maximum values for late July. Most of the models 
suggest that a shortwave will come through in the morning leading to 
numerous to widespread showers and storms. In this scenario there 
would be less time for instability to build and may see slightly 
lower chances for severe weather. The front is not forecast to move 
through until later in the day and 0-6 km bulk shear values will 
increase into the 30-40 kt range Friday afternoon. However, thanks 
to the cloud cover it may be hard to get SBCAPE values above 1000 
J/Kg. The shear is decent for a late July event and will continue 
with the threat for severe weather in the HWO with damaging winds 
and localized flooding being the main threats. Rainfall amounts 
between 1-2 inches will be common across the area as the event comes 
to a close.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Wednesday)...Lingering 
showers/thunderstorms will be possible across the area Friday 
night until the front has completely moved through during the 
overnight hours. We then move into a period of prolonged northerly
to northwesterly flow over the area. This will lead to a drier 
atmosphere with lower dew points and clearer skies. Temperatures 
will start the weekend out about 5 degrees cooler than normal for 
this time of year. Temperatures will slowly climb through the 
weekend and through next week until the end of the work week when 
temperatures are expected to be back or slightly above normal. 
Otherwise there's not much in the way of notable weather to talk 
about in the forecast. The GFS tries to zip across some energy in 
the second half of the week bringing isolated showers and 
thunderstorms to the area, but will only go with low end 
precipitation chances over the southern/western portions of the 
forecast area. More widespread weather will likely move in just 
beyond this 7-day forecast, next weekend, with increasing shower 
and thunderstorm rain chances.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...The upper ridge of high pressure
will begin to dampen over the area today as a cold front starts
its approach. This should allow for very slightly cooler
temperatures...though the high dew points and humid conditions 
will persist. The air mass should become weakly unstable this 
afternoon and this...combined with the strong diurnal heating and
good low level moisture...should generated scattered convection 
across the region. Cannot rule out the chance of a stray storm 
becoming strong to marginally severe...the main threat should be 
strong winds. The thunderstorm activity should diminish during the
evening for relatively quiet conditions for much of the night. 
However...the chance of convection will increase towards morning 
as the cold front continues to approach the area.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...Models showing decent 
agreement/run to run consistency, and forecast confidence is a bit 
above average for this time of year.  Upper trough will be dropping 
into the region early in the period, and a cold front will push 
through Friday/Friday evening. Expect widespread showers and 
thunderstorms.  Still some question about how much convective energy 
will be available on Friday, as model soundings mostly saturated 
with little CAPE.  However, there will be significant wind shear, 
and severe storms will be possible with the primary threats being 
wind damage and to a lesser extent hail.  Heavy rainfall may lead to 
localized flooding as well. If the prefrontal airmass destabilizes 
more than current model soundings indicate then an isolated tornado 
could occur, but right now that threat looks quite low.   Once the 
front moves through, there will be some lingering showers perhaps 
even into early Saturday. Drier and cooler air will be pushing in 
for the weekend, with gradual warming after that through the end of 
the period.  May be enough moisture return by Wednesday isolated 
convection.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Thursday)...

Not seeing much on the radar early this afternoon just a couple of 
isolated shower/storms across the Southern Plateau and Valley. 
Expect this will continue to be the main area for any showers and 
storms throughout the remainder of the afternoon. Current water 
vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a ridge 
extending across the Central and Southern Appalachians. PW values 
across the Southern Plateau and Valley are above normal with 
drier air to the north and any afternoon convection should be 
limited to the southern zones. A mild night is forecast again 
tonight with lows in the mid 60s to low 70s. Most ongoing 
convection should come to an end after sunset with just a small 
chance for an isolated shower or two across the mountains.

The ridge will breakdown on Thursday as a mid-level shortwave trough 
tracks through the region. There are still some minor timing issues 
between the models with this system. Deep layer shear will increase 
slightly as the trough approaches into the 20-30 kt range for the
0-6 km bulk shear. SBCAPE values will range from around 1000-1500
J/Kg. The PW values will slowly increase on Thursday into the 
1.7- 1.9 inch range, which is in the 75th-90th percentile for late
July. With this, expect numerous to widespread showers developing
ahead of the trough tomorrow afternoon. Some of these storms 
could be strong to marginally severe with damaging winds and 
localized flooding being the main threats. 


.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...

We will likely start the period with ongoing showers and 
thunderstorms across the area ahead of an incoming upper-level 
trough. Not too often do we see a trough of the amplitude this 
late in the year. This system has been difficult to pin down and 
models still not in the best of agreement on the timing and 
evolution. For now, the more likely scenario looks to fall more in
line with the GFS. The GFS suggests ongoing showers and storms to
begin the period with some of this activity lingering through the
overnight hours but with decreasing coverage. It appears that a 
second wave will move in Friday morning and continue through early
afternoon. The initial activity Thursday night looks to be pre-
frontal and more diurnally driven, thus the expected decrease in 
coverage overnight. The wave Friday morning is in response to the 
trough beginning to dig into our area and the arrival of the 
upper-level jet. Because of the timing on Friday morning, it looks
like the risk will mainly be for localized heavy rainfall and 
some isolated wind damage. Shear does pick up with the advancement
of the trough and jet into the area but instability isn't overly 
high due to saturated sounding profiles. Because of the better 
upper-level support can't rule out an isolated tornado but this 
isn't the main concern. PWs are at max values for this time of 
year with values between 2.00 and 2.3 inches. The potential for 
flash flooding will have to be monitored especially with any 
training storms due to the mean flow being somewhat parallel to 
the boundary.

Showers and storms push out of our area through the day on Friday 
and things should be relatively calm by Friday night. The good news 
is that cooler and drier air move in for the weekend as we are under 
the influence of northerly flow and it's looking real nice...real 
nice. Saturday and Sunday we will see highs in the low to mid 80s 
with lows in the upper 50s to mid 60s during the overnight hours. RH 
values will be in the 40s on Sunday! Next week is looking pretty 
nice as well. Temps slowly climb through the period but rain chances 
are slim. By Tuesday and Wednesday slight chances for terrain based 
convection return but most areas stay dry. By wednesday our highs 
and lows are closer to normal with highs back in the upper 80s and 
lows in the mid to upper 60s.

portions of the forecast area with PW values in the 1.5-1.7 inch 
range. Due to this, have expanded the slight chance PoPs for the 
morning update. Will be another hot and sunny afternoon for most 
with highs in the upper 80s to mid 90s.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Little change in area weather
through the short term with a ridge of high pressure in control.
This will continue the trend of hot and humid conditions with
afternoon temperatures climbing back into the upper 80s and 90s
across most valley locations. With the strong daytime heating and
low level moisture in place...expect another afternoon/evening of
normal summertime isolated diurnal convection. This activity
should mainly be focused over higher terrain. A few storms may
continue into the overnight hours across far southeastern
locations where a weak impulse will be moving through the upper
flow. 

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...Models in decent agreement 
overall, although some differences in the details including the 
handling of the cold front that moves through early in the long term 
period. Forecast confidence is about average for this time of year. 
A cold front will be approaching Thursday/Thursday night and will 
push through our area Friday.  Expect numerous showers and 
thunderstorms especially late Thursday night into Friday.  Model 
soundings show significant shear ahead of this front, although at 
this point the timing of the stronger shear is somewhat out of sync 
with the better instability. However, a lead upper trough out ahead 
of the front may help with destabilization and forcing Thursday 
afternoon and evening, and enough shear indicated at that time to 
aid in storm organization so there is a risk for severe storms 
during that time. And given the possibility of better shear ahead of 
the front on Friday, there will continue to be a risk for severe 
storms Friday as well.  Will mention this threat in the HWO. Once 
the front moves through, drier and cooler air will move in for the 
weekend. While some warming will occur, models show the drier air 
lingering through Tuesday, so will go with a precip free forecast 
Saturday through Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...There may be an isolated 
shower or storm ongoing to start the period as a weak frontal 
boundary remains near our southern border. This activity will fade 
around sunset as we lose our daytime heating. Calm and clear skies 
overnight will lead to some patchy fog, especially across Northeast 
TN and Southwest VA where lows will be in the low to mid 60s. 

Another hot one tomorrow as high pressure remains in control. Front 
is further south tomorrow but there still could be an isolated shower 
or storm develop during afternoon peak-heating, most areas stay 
dry. Highs will be in the lower 90s across the Central and 
Southern Valley and near 90 elsewhere. Heat index values will be 
in the mid to upper 90s across the Central and Southern Valley. 
Drink plenty of water and take frequent breaks if outdoors.


.LONG TERM...Wednesday night through Tuesday)...Hot and humid 
conditions continue Wednesday night with only isolated evening 
showers and storms and warm temperatures upper 60s north to mid 
70s around Chattanooga. Then Thursday models show increasing 
showers and thunderstorms ahead of a cold front that approaches 
late Thursday into early Friday. Possible strong storms Thursday 
evening into the overnight hours if NAM model is correct. It shows
stronger 850 MB SW winds ahead of this system over northeast 
section of the Forecast area. GFS model much slower and showing 
more concentrated storms possible Friday. Thursday high 
temperatures still above 90 around Chattanooga but expect highs to
be mainly mid to upper 80s elsewhere as clouds increase ahead of 
the front. The front will move slowly through the area Friday with
likely chances and cooler temperatures mostly upper 70s to mid 
80s. For the period Friday night through Tuesday rain chances 
decrease as higher pressure builds back in and front sinking 
south. Also drier air mass with upper trough settling over eastern
part of the country will keep lows mostly in the cooler low to 
mid 60s and highs in the 80s. The weekend will be mostly dry and 
then increasing moisture Monday and Tuesday will bring slight 
chances back into the forecast mainly afternoons and evenings.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Weak frontal boundary will be 
near our southern border today. This boundary may be enough to 
trigger a few showers and thunderstorms mainly south, although model 
soundings look weakly capped over most of the area.  Will carry 
slight chance PoPs south for this afternoon.  Should be dry 
overnight tonight with a mostly clear sky.  Temperatures today will 
be rather hot, but humidity levels will not be as high especially 
north/central. Will not stray from from MAV temps.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...The extended will begin with 
continued hot and humid conditions.  Low level moisture will be in 
place and this with the strong diurnal heating will allow isolated 
convection to develop over higher elevations and some southern 
locations for Wednesday into Wednesday evening.  Models in rather 
poor agreement with timing of an approaching frontal boundary around 
the Thursday/Friday time frame.  The NAM is a bit faster...bringing 
the boundary in late Thursday into Thursday evening while the GFS 
and ECMWF moves it in late Thursday night into Friday.  This feature 
should provide our area with the best chance of organized 
thunderstorms throughout the extended.   Will continue with change 
pops on Thursday but trend towards the slower solution with higher 
pops into Friday.  By Saturday and Sunday...the front should have 
exited the region with surface high pressure building in.  This will 
allow for a bit cooler weekend with a chance of normal summertime 
diurnal convection.  A weak short wave may push into the area on 
Monday...bringing an increased chance of convection into the area.

Overall there is very little change to the forecast tonight.
Showers and thunderstorms have mostly stayed out of our area with
only a few weak storms making it into SW Virginia. We could see
some more fog overnight tonight, but dew point spreads are higher
than they were at this time last night so fog would likely be
patchy and less dense than last night.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...Fairly quiet short term 
period in store. Frontal boundary still off to our north will 
slowly sag southward overnight. Current convective activity 
associated with the front across KY will approach SWVA this 
evening but should fade as it nears our area. Some patchy fog 
possible tonight but very isolated. Lows should range from the mid
to upper 60s to lower 70s. 

Frontal boundary draped across our area tomorrow could provide 
focus for convection tomorrow afternoon but soundings show capping
in place. Due to capping, will only have slight chance POP in for
the Central Valley and low-end chance POP across the Southern 
Valley and SWNC. Highs will be in the upper 80s to near 90. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...High pressure ridge
centered over the south central and southeast states will still 
be in control of weather pattern Tuesday night and Wednesday with 
only small rain chances Tuesday evening extreme south and eastern 
mountains Wednesday. A weak cold front that is moving through 
today will still be over the southern areas with drier air mass 
over northern areas with lows Wednesday and highs slightly cooler.
Temperatures will still be hot with highs in the lower 90s 
central and southern valley Wednesday and Thursday. Rain chances 
begin to increase again Thursday ahead of another front moving 
south into the Ohio Valley by Friday. Scattered to numerous 
showers and thunderstorms ahead of the front will lower 
temperatures for Friday just ahead of the front and behind the 
front Saturday through Monday. Stronger storms will also be 
possible Friday and Friday night.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Some drying today behind the 
weak prefrontal trough shifting to our south.  The weak front will 
remain to our north.  Models indicate enough convective energy 
despite the drying to warrant mainly slight chance Pops for isolated 
convection today, with the best chance across southern areas where 
will carry low chance PoPs.  May be a lingering isolated shower or 
thunderstorm early tonight mainly south, then should be precip free 
overnight. It will be hot today but a bit less so than recent days. 
MAV temps generally look reasonable so will stay close.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...Probability of showers and 
thunderstorms drops off for most of the forecast area Tuesday into 
Wednesday as a weak frontal boundary slips southward to Southeast 
Tennessee and Southwest North Carolina. There will continue to be a 
chance for convection in these areas near the boundary at mid week. 
The remainder of the long term period is similar to previous 
forecasts however, timing of the end of the work week frontal 
boundary may be pushed back just a tad. It still looks like there 
will be a small increase in pops for Thursday, but the main period 
of unsettled weather with the next upper trough and cold front will 
be Friday into Saturday as the front drops slowly south through the 
Southern Appalachian region. Kept the Superblend token pops for 
Sunday mainly along the Tennessee and North Carolina border. High 
temperatures remain in the upper 80s and lower 90s until Friday when 
clouds and precipitation with the front help to cool things down a 
bit. Highs could drop to the lower and middle 80s behind the front 
over the weekend so a little heat relief is in store.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Monday)...
Over the next few hours and into the evening, the showers and storms 
in our southern tier should be decreasing, while activity to our 
north near a pre-frontal trough should be increasing. The short term 
rapid refresh models point toward convective development near our 
border with KY in the 23Z-02Z time frame, which seems reasonable as 
mesoanalysis shows a stability gradient in that area. PoPs through 
the evening will be in the likely range in northern sections, then 
gradually decrease as the storms progress southward overnight. A 
threat of damaging wind gusts cannot be ruled out in northern 
sections. 

Tomorrow the surface convergence zone and 850 mb theta-e front will 
be to our south, leaving a NW flow through the low and midlevels, 
which should keep the convection mainly south. Southern sections may 
have a slight chance of showers, but forecast soundings from the NAM 
and GFS look quite stable and dry aloft tomorrow. There will be a 
cold front across the Ohio River that will be moving into KY, but 
moisture and instability ahead of it looks unfavorable for much 
development or any severe threat.

.LONG TERM (Monday night through Sunday)...
An upper trough will continue to move east of the area Monday 
night through Tuesday night. PW values will remain slightly above 
average for this time of year...and winds will shift to out of the
NW. Monday night will see the best forcing in areas south of 
I40...but the best instability will be north of I40 where less of 
an inversion develops overnight. Have included only slight chance 
precip in the southern areas for any diurnal storms that develop 
through the afternoon...but otherwise Monday night should be 
fairly dry. Diurnal showers and thunderstorms are possible Tuesday
afternoon...though PW values will continue to decrease as the NW 
flow impacts the moisture available. If any storms do 
develop...expect a few to become strong...but no severe storms 
expected.

Wednesday...High pressure develops over the coastal states as a 
frontal boundary begins to move through the MS River Valley towards 
the area. Models have been inconsistent with Wednesday...now drying 
out the atmosphere for no showers and thunderstorms expected. Would 
not be surprised to see an isolated shower form...but otherwise 
Wednesday and Wednesday night look dry. The frontal boundary then 
approaches the area Thursday...with scattered showers and 
thunderstorms developing ahead of the front. Most of the activity 
should remain over the Plateau and SW VA where the best lift will be 
located. Coverage of showers and thunderstorms increases for Friday 
as the front swings through the area. Low instabiltiy will be 
present with a very moist atmosphere. With the light winds...severe 
weather does not seem to be a threat...though heavy rainfall could 
cause concerns across the area. Saturday and Sunday...showers and 
thunderstorms are again possible as an upper level trough tries to 
swing through the area.

.DISCUSSION...
A few changes will be made with the morning update based on the
latest trends of radar and surface obs. With the northern sections
having been worked over by morning rainfall, convective
development over the next few hours will likely be along and south
of I-40. Outflow boundaries ahead of the MCS in central KY may 
bring storms into northern areas again later this afternoon. 
Mesoanalysis shows MLCAPE values already over 2000 J/kg in 
southern sections, so storms will need to be monitored for severe 
potential, with downburst winds being the main threat. With the 
lack of shear and high CAPE, pulse storms may develop and peak 
rapidly, so those outdoors will need to pay attention and find 
shelter quickly.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...The frontal boundary across the 
ohio valley will sag a bit closer during the period.  Some weak 
short wave energy will be moving across the region later 
today/tonight, and remnants of outflow boundaries from northern 
convection will likely be in our vicinity as well. This combined 
with considerable convective energy should provide a more active day 
with scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms, especially 
this afternoon and the first part of tonight.  Some of the storms 
this afternoon/evening may become strong to severe, so will mention 
this threat in the HWO. It will be hot and humid again today, but 
heat index values should top out below heat advisory criteria.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...An upper trough will 
mercifully press gradually east across the northeastern corner of 
the nation, helping to push a cool frontal boundary through the 
Southern Appalachian Region. The boundary will not entirely drift 
south of the forecast area and may become stationary over Southeast 
Tennessee and Southwest North Carolina. Thus, the probability of 
convection will gradually decrease from north to south Monday into 
Wednesday as the front hangs up near the Georgia border. Another 
upper trough will build southeast out of Canada through the Eastern 
U.S. late in the week. The probability of cooling showers and 
thunderstorms will increase again later Thursday through Friday 
night as an associated cool front presses south across the forecast 
area. The heat will briefly return mid week along with the 
decreasing chance for convection however, some temperature relief 
can be expected again Friday into Saturday with the front, 
precipitation, and week northerly flow behind the boundary.

Confidence is too low to mention at this time, but will keep abreast 
of the thunderstorm development near the Ohio River this evening.

A frontal boundary will approach the TRI late Sunday. This boundary 
along with orographic lift will produce a chance of storms. Have 
include vicinity thunder at all TAF sites late Sunday afternoon.

MVFR fog possible once again at TRI for a period between between 10-

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...
Scattered to isolated storms around the area will dissipate with 
sunset as forcing to maintain convection overnight will be lacking. 
The models disagree sharply on what will happen later tonight, as 
the HRRR brings a few showers to our north into SW VA, which develop 
rapidly in NE TN around 06Z. The GFS shows a lot of QPF in this area 
too. Meanwhile, the NAM is completely dry. The HRRR seems too eager 
to enhance overnight convection of late, and forcing aloft is 
lacking, so will lean toward the NAM and only have a slight chance 
PoP overnight in SW VA. 

Tomorrow, the front across IN/OH that has been the focus for 
convection the past few afternoons will sink south into northern KY 
as a shortwave midlevel trough moves across the Upper MS 
Valley/western Great Lakes region. With this forcing for better lift 
approaching and low level moisture remaining high in a SW flow, we 
should see numerous showers and thunderstorms in northern sections 
tomorrow. Model CAPE depictions are likely too high as their surface 
dewpoints have been too high lately, but we should still see 
adequate instability for a low threat of pulse severe storms in the 
afternoon. Southern sections appear a little more capped tomorrow, 
so storms should be more scattered there and with less of a severe 
threat.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)...
A frontal boundary will continue to move to the south and east as
an upper level trough moves through the Ohio Valley. Scattered 
showers and thunderstorms are expected to remain across the area 
through most of Sunday night...as enough instability and list is 
present...though these storms are expected to weaken in intensity 
as the night progresses with no severe storms expected through the
overnight hours. Monday...winds will shift to out of the west and
northwest...with moisture less than previous days...around 
average for this time of year. High pressure to the southwest and 
low pressure to the northeast will create a boundary that will 
allow diurnal showers and thunderstorms each day Monday through 
Thursday. Models are inconsistent of coverage and intensity each 
day...though Thursday looks like showers and thunderstorms will 
remain in the highest elevations through most of the day. Strong 
storms are possible each day with isolated severe storms possible.
Damaging downburst winds and large hail will be the main threat. 
Friday and Saturday...a frontal boundary is expected to move 
through the area with scattered widespread showers and 
thunderstorms each day.

Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED

1020 AM EDT Sat Jul 22 2017

.DISCUSSION...
The forecast appears on track this morning, so no changes are
planned at this time. The 12Z soundings at OHX and RNK show a
pretty good cap that will have to be overcome for convection to
develop this afternoon, and with the lack of forcing today, that 
seems unlikely to happen outside of the higher terrain. The 12Z
FFC and BMX soundings show less of a cap, so our southern areas
may see a little better chance of showers, but still expecting
just isolated coverage. The HRRR supports this and the latest runs
have reduced the coverage of precip across most of the area today.
Observed afternoon dewpoints yesterday were higher than what the
models suggested. This will likely be the case again today, 
although with a stronger SW flow today, mixing may not lower 
dewpoints as dramatically as yesterday. Expect max heat index 
values in the TN Valley between 98 and 103 this afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...Today and tonight)...Another very hot day for today. 
Low amplitude mid level ridge will remain centered just to our west 
but its influence over our area will begin to weaken a bit. 
Significant convective energy again today but model soundings 
continue to show weak capping and there is again little forcing 
evident, so convection likely to be diurnally and terrain driven 
again.  Will keep PoPs on the low side. Will mention possibility of 
strong to severe storms in HWO, as any convection that does form may 
be able to produce some strong gusty winds. Dewpoints may run a bit 
higher than yesterday given a bit more low level flow from the 
southwest. However, heat index values still look to top out near to 
a bit above 100 in the southern and central valley areas, so no heat 
advisory at this time.
 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...At the beginning of this 
period (Sunday morning), the upper ridge is receding back to the 
west and the westerly upper flow to our north is sagging more into 
our area.  A cold front will be north of the area Sunday that will 
be sagging southward as well.  Low level moisture will be plentiful 
in the area and MLCAPE values will likely rise above 2000 J/kg . 
Sunday afternoon. The model blend has been initializing with surface 
dew points too high in the afternoon hours, when mixing has been 
lowering the dew points, so I've trimmed back the afternoon dew 
points on Sunday by about 3-4 degrees.  This will also keep the Heat 
Index values from being as high as well. 

Late Sunday and into Sunday evening, an upper level  disturbance 
will be moving into the area. Storms will likely develop north of 
the area and move into the northern counties.  With CAPES high, 
storms will likely be strong. As the storms move southward nighttime 
cooling will start to lower the CAPE values, so the storms will lose 
some of their intensity farther south.  The SPC Day 2 threat areas 
reflect this scenario.  

Models diverge on how things play out for the rest of the week, 
whether the front moves through as well as timing and strength of 
upper level disturbances. However, there is agreement that we will 
stay in this pattern, with the upper ridge staying to the west and 
our area being under an unsettled upper northwest flow.  So, POPs 
will be in the forecast for most periods.

Isolated thunderstorm across the Plateau is dissipating. However,

especially across the Plateau counties. Also, complex of storms
across the Great Lakes may get close enough for some convection
across southwest Virginia.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...
The southern sections of our area should have the best chances of
showers and storms through the evening, with most activity being
diurnally driven, ending before midnight. However, as the
mid/upper level ridge to our west drifts slightly to the south
tonight, convection across IN may track in a more SE direction and
into WV/SW VA late tonight. The NAM may be overdone with
sustaining convection overnight, but the RAP supports it and to a
lesser extent, the HRRR as well. So a slight chance PoP will be 
kept for SW VA overnight. On Saturday we will have very little
forcing and a weak cap in place, so most convection will likely be
terrain-based and diurnally-driven. Temperatures tomorrow look
pretty similar to today, but with slightly higher dewpoints, heat
index values near or a bit above 100 are expected in the central
and southern TN Valley.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...
A weak upper level high pressure ridge will move south through 
the Mississippi Valley through the beginning of the work week. At 
the same time...a weak low level boundary will move south through 
the Ohio Valley and just to the east of the upper level high 
pressure. Models have moved this boundary through the area a 
little faster...bringing the rain chances beginning early Sunday 
afternoon and lasting through monday afternoon and evening. Ample 
instability is present Sunday with greater than 3000 J/kg 
expected...along with PW values around the 90th percentile for 
this time of year. With low level flow from the SW...mid level 
flow from the west...and upper level flow from the NW...decent 
shear is present. However winds will be far too weak to influence 
storm structure or motion. For Sunday afternoon and evening...can 
expect scattered strong to isolated severe showers and 
thunderstorms for downburst winds and large hail...with the 
greatest threat in areas north of I40. With the large PW values 
for this time of year...and the mid level flow parallel to the 
boundary...could see the possibilty of localized flooding in many
areas for storms training over the same locations. 

Monday...models disagree on timing of the frontal boundary moving SE 
of the southern Appalachians. Right now...have left rain chances in 
through the day. Instabilities and winds will be much weaker on 
Monday...so expecting scattered showers and thunderstorms...with a 
chance for a few strong storms but nothing severe expected at this 
time. There does remain a threat for localized flooding with storms 
that move across the same area as PW values remain high. Coverage of 
showers and storms is expected to weaken overnight...with only a few 
showers remaining along the higher elevations. 

Tuesday...scattered showers can be expected in the higher elevations 
of E TN and areas south of I40 where forcing is still 
present. By Wednesday and Thursday...models disagree on timing of a 
frontal boundary swinging through the area. Have included slight 
chance precip chances for both days for scattered showers and 
thunderstorms.

.DISCUSSION...
A MCS over NE KY this morning will be tracking into SW VA, with a
projected arrival time in our area around 18Z. Some weakening of 
the storms is expected as it encounters a less favorable 
environment, as seen in the 12Z RNK sounding. Still, coverage of 
storms in SW VA and NE TN will probably be more than reflected in 
the current forecast, so the update will raise PoPs into the high 
end of the chance range for that area. Other soundings to our 
south and west suggest a pretty good cap that will limit 
convection to isolated coverage at best. Temperatures will be 
unchanged for central and southern sections today, with the heat 
index over 100 around CHA. Temps will be lowered slightly for NE

248 AM EDT Fri Jul 21 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...A hot day in store today as mid 
level ridge remains over the region, centered just to our west. 
Model sounding continue to look on the dry side and weak capping may 
limit convection especially in valley areas.  Will continue with the 
slight chance PoPs for most valley areas with low chance in the 
mountains for this afternoon and evening, although would not be 
suprised if even that may be overdone. Temperatures will be in the 
90s for the valley areas, and heat index values expected to be 
around 100 in the southern valley and should approach 100 up into 
the central valley for a few hours this afternoon. However, should 
stay below heat advisory levels.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...At the beginning of this 
period (Saturday morning), the upper ridge is still holding on while 
at the surface our weak moist flow from the Gulf of Mexico 
continues.  An upper level shortwave is tracking through the 
northern plains. It looks like there will be enough instability to 
induce some isolated to scattered diurnal showers and storms on 
Saturday.

By Sunday, this shortwave moves southeastward into the Great Lakes 
and the southern end of this shortwave starts carving pretty heavily 
into our ridge.  The front associated with this system will still be 
to our north on Sunday, but models agree that a weak wave of lift 
will be coming into the area that will increase the chances of 
showers and storms. By Monday as the front approaches, a leeside 
trough also develops in the Carolinas, that splits the organization 
of this system--with some organization along the W-E oriented front 
as it sags into our area, but also there is some organization along 
the NNE-SSW oriented lee trough.  For Tuesday through Thursday, 
models start to diverge on the placement of the front as well as 
whether we stay under the influence of the Great Lakes trough 
(keeping better chances of rain in the area )or if the ridge from 
the Plains builds back over our area (that would tend to dry us out 
again). In general, there is enough agreement that the front will 
probably sag south of the area and take the better rain chances 
south, so our higher POPs will be in our southern areas.  

With the aforementioned pattern changes, the hot and steamy thermal 
conditions over the past several days will be subsiding as the upper 
ridge fades.  Saturday will still be very steamy, but staying below 
heat advisory levels, Sunday not quite as hot, and then for Monday 
through the rest of the forecast, the Heat Index will be closer to 
seasonal normals.

The upper level ridge is centered to the west across the Central
CONUS. At the surface, high pressure extends across the Southern
Appalachians. Quiet conditions are forecast to continue tonight
with a bit of patchy fog near sunrise. The upper level high will
shift to the east tomorrow making for the hottest day of the

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...
There will be very little change to the general weather pattern over 
the next 24 hours as a large midlevel high pressure ridge will 
remain to our west. However, the ridge does drift slightly to the 
south tomorrow, which allows a weak vort max and a surface trough to 
track into our NE sections. Forecast soundings show weak capping 
across the area, but the forcing may be enough to produce scattered 
showers and thunderstorms in SW VA and NE TN in the afternoon, while 
the rest of the area will likely remain capped. Temperatures will 
continue to be well above normal, and with slightly higher dewpoints 
expected tomorrow, heat index values may touch 100 in the southern 
Valley for a couple hours.

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Wednesday)... 
High pressure will weaken and slowly move to the SE through the 
weekend...while a low pressure and assocaited weak frontal 
boundary strengthens over the Great Lakes and moves towards the 
southern Appalachians. Winds will shift to out of the SW and 
W...bringing a slow increase in moisture Saturday through Monday. 
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are possible Saturday and 
Sunday afternoon...with a greater increase in coverage across the 
area for Sunday. Instabitlies are between 3000 - 4000 J/kg...with 
weak winds throughout the atmosphere. PW values around around the 
90th percentile for this time of year. Any showers and storms that
develop Saturday and Sunday have a greater threat for heavy 
rainfall and damaging winds as the main threat. 

Monday through Monday night...the weak boundary will move through 
the area in the afternoon...allowing scattered showers and 
thunderstorms to begin developing in the morning and increase in 
coverage through the afternoon. Instabilities will remain around 
3000 J/kg...PW values in the 90th percentile...and winds fairly 
uniform but weak throughout the atmosphere. Severe weather is not 
expected with these storms...though heavy rainfall and localized 
flooding remain a large threat. Showers and thunderstorms should 
weaken and decrease in coverage through the night Monday. 

Tuesday and Wednesday...slightly cooler temperatures will remain 
through both days as the flow shifts to out of the NW. Isolated 
showers and thunderstorms are possible Tuesday afternoon...but 
mainly in the higher elevations of east TN...southern TN Valley and 
SW NC. Wednesday should remain dry and mostly clear as high pressure 
sets up.

.DISCUSSION...
The forecast generally appears to be on track, in line with the 
latest obs, but some small tweaks to PoPs will be made for the
morning update. It is noted that the latest HRRR runs seem to 
develop more convection in our western half this afternoon than 
the weak instability and lack of moisture in the 12Z OHX sounding 
might suggest. Also, model PW values at CHA this morning appear 
to have verified too high compared to the 12Z soundings around the
region. PoPs in the forecast will be reduced to a slight chance 
for southern sections and the Plateau this afternoon.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Increasing low-level moisture
has allowed patchy fog to development this morning. Will dissipate
soon after sunset.

For Today, increasing moisture/instability indicated by model
soundings across the southern Tennessee Valley/Plateau. Orographic
lift across the southern Plateau will allow scattered convection
to develop. For the central/north, airmass remains too dry with
limited convection.

Temperatures in the lower 90s and increasing low-level moisture
will allow heat indices to climb into the middle and upper 90s
across much of the Valley.

For Tonight, after loss of daytime heating, convection will end by
sunset. Clear sky, calm winds will allow for patchy fog develop,
especially where rain occurs this afternoon across the southeast.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...
Upper ridge will reach its peak Friday with hot and humid conditions 
by afternoon. Highs in the lower to mid 90s will occur with heat 
index values in the mid to upper 90s north to 100 to around 105 in 
the central and southern valley. Isolated to widely scattered 
showers and storms are possible due to the strong daytime heating 
and instability across the higher elevations and a chance over the 
extreme northeast. The ridge will begin to weaken Saturday but 
temperatures will still reach into the lower 90s. Slightly better 
rain chances too. On Sunday the ridge breaks down even more with an 
upper trough dropping down over the eastern states. Highs will be 
around 90 and rain chances around 40 to 50 percent. The wetter 
...cooler pattern will continue through Tuesday. A weak cold front 
will approach the eastern Tennessee Valley late Monday into Tuesday. 
Wednesday a drier airmass will try to move into northeast sections 
with the cold front. Rain chances will drop to 20 percent or less 
Wednesday.

.DISCUSSION...

High pressure continues to be the story across the Southern
Appalachians. Earlier this evening there were a couple of isolated
showers but the coverage was limited. The few showers that formed
earlier have diminished due to the lack of diurnal heating. Could
also see a few areas of patchy fog early in the morning, 
especially near areas of water but not expecting anything 
widespread. Made some minor tweaks to the hourly temperature and
dewpoint grids for the overnight period but other than that the
ongoing forecast looks to be in good shape.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Thursday)...
The few small showers near the mountains this afternoon will 
dissipate by sunset. The showers/storms in southern IN will track 
S- SE across KY. A few may make it to the TN border into Middle 
TN, but with the loss of heating, they should dissipate before 
reaching our area. They may leave some residual boundaries across 
our southern sections tomorrow, which could help initiate 
convection in the afternoon. Similar to today, forecast soundings 
tomorrow continue to show greater moisture and instability in our 
southern sections, and drier/stable conditions for northern 
sections. As a result, a slight chance PoP will be mentioned 
tomorrow afternoon in the Smokies, SW NC, and soutern 
Valley/Plateau areas. Temperatures will mainly follow persistence,
but perhaps a degree or so warmer as the mid/upper level ridge 
over the Ozarks builds slightly eastward. Heat Index values in the
upper 90s are expected in the southern Valley.

.LONG TERM (Thursday Night through Wednesday)...
Upper ridge of high pressure will continue to strengthen across 
the region on Friday. This will continue the hot and humid 
conditions. Highs should reach into the 90s over most valley 
locations...and with dew points around the 70 degree mark...heat 
indices should climb to the mid 90s north to near 105 degrees 
south. With the strong daytime heating and low level moisture in 
place...isolated afternoon thunderstorm development is possible 
over higher elevations. We will then slowly transition into a more
active weather patten as a weak short wave moves into the area on
Saturday. This will increase cloud cover a bit which will lower 
high temperatures slightly. It will also increase the chance of 
convection for the afternoon hours. Sunday through Tuesday...a 
boundary will settle over the region with a series of weak 
impulses move along it. This will provide a chance of showers and 
thunderstorms each day. The high will dampen over the region as 
the boundary and added clouds cover settle in...and this should 
allow temperatures to fall to near normal levels early in the work
week. Confidence is quite low by the time we get to Wednesday but
the trend is for the boundary to slow move off with a few bands 
of convection possibly lingering over the area.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Patchy fog early this morning,
mainly southwest North Carolina and southeast Tennessee.

Broad upper ridging across the central/southern Plains will 
continue to strengthen across the Tennessee Valley. Warm mid-level
temperatures will limit convection again Today. Isolated storms 
are possible, mainly across the Terrain Features, but main story 
will remain hot and dry afternoons.

Highs today will likely remain below record levels. Current Record
highs today are the following: TRI-95, TYS-100, and CHA-100
degrees. Heat indices will be in the middle to possibly upper 90s
across the southern Tennessee Valley.

For Tonight, Mostly clear and dry.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...
Mostly sunny and hot pattern to continue Thursday as upper level 
ridge is centered over the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys. 
Left out rain chances for Thursday. On Friday the ridge begins to 
weaken and an upper low forms over north Florida and Georgia. A 
slight chance of showers and storms are possible across higher 
elevations outside the valley. The other issue is the hot 
temperatures both Thursday and Friday. Highs Thursday will be in the 
low to mid 90s with heat indices from 95 to 100 for a few hours 
across the central and southern valley. On Friday temperatures will 
be a couple degrees warmer mostly mid 90s lower elevations and dew 
points higher so heat index values between and 1 pm to 7 pm in the 
upper 90s to around 102. An heat advisory may be needed Friday. As 
the ridge breaks down on the weekend temperatures will lower a few 
degrees Saturday mostly lower 90s with a 20 to 40 percent chance of 
showers and storms. Heat Index values will still be around 95 to 100 
across lower elevations since dew points will be in the lower 70s. 
On Sunday more cloud cover and higher rain chances will drop highs 
back down to the upper 80s to near 90 and lower heat index values to 
mostly below 95. Also a weak front will move south into the Ohio 
valley late Sunday and stay there through Tuesday as an upper trough 
moves across the northeast part of the country. Cloud cover and 
higher rain chances will keep temperatures slightly below normal in 
the 80s across the forecast area.

301 PM EDT Tue Jul 18 2017

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...A massive ridge currently
over the middle part of the nation will continue to gradually 
edge its way into the Southern Appalachian Region. The ridge
should be able to suppress convection over most of the forecast
area. There may be just enough lift to produce an isolated shower
or thunderstorm over some of the higher terrain on the Cumberland
Plateau, Southwest Virginia, and the mountains along the North
Carolina border. Lows tonight won't be too far above normal for 
mid July, however highs on Wednesday will be above normal in the 
upper 80s and lower 90s over most of the region.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...Not much change 
in the overall thoughts for the long-term forecast. The main 
message will continue to be the increasing temperatures late this 
week and into the weekend with heat indices near heat advisory 
levels on Friday. 

The upper level ridge across the Central Plains will expand eastward 
Wednesday night into Thursday with a closed low along the Carolina 
Coast. PW values will be around 1.3-1.5 inches on Thursday which is 
around normal for mid to late July. The lack of lift and the 
influence of the upper ridge should keep the forecast dry on 
Thursday. The upper level ridge will continue to expand eastward on 
Friday into the Mid-Mississippi River Valley with the closed low 
drifting westward across the northern Gulf Coast. Upper level 
heights will increase into the 592-594 dm range. Friday will be the 
warmest day of the forecast period with highs in the low to mid 90s 
across most valley locations with heat indices ranging from 95 to 
103 degrees. These values will approach heat advisory criteria and 
an advisory may be needed for later this week. Slightly higher PW 
values will move into the region Friday and could see a few 
afternoon showers and storms across the higher elevations.

The ridge breaks down slightly over the weekend and into next week 
as the closed low passes to the south and the pattern become more 
active just to the north. Chances for afternoon showers and storms 
will increase late in the forecast period with temperatures cooling 
by a couple of degree with these higher rain chances. Monday looks 
to be the day with the highest rain chances with PW increasing to 
around 2 inches with both the GFS and ECMWF in agreement.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...
Weather pattern very similar to Mondays except dew points 
expected to be a little higher today which will bring Heat Index 
temperatures into the lower 90s northeast and central east 
Tennessee and mid to even upper 90s southern valley for a couple 
hours late this afternoon. No fog has formed as of 300 AM EDT and 
expect only isolated patches between now and sunrise. Weak upper 
trough along the east coast and Appalachians will keep 
temperatures in the eastern mountains slightly cooler with clouds 
forming in the afternoon and scattered late day showers and 
thunderstorms there. Upper ridging from the Plateau westward will 
keep afternoon storms at a minimum there so took rain chances out 
except extreme south and dry conditions as well for the lower 
elevations of the Tennessee Valley. Storms should end early in the
mountains with skies mostly clear overnight. Lows about average 
for mid summer mid 60s to lower 70s.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...
Main concern through the rest of the week will be intensifying 
heat wave across the area with heat indices increasing to 100-105 
degrees over most of the Tennessee Valley for Friday and Saturday.
Heat Advisories may be needed across the southern half of the 
Tennessee Valley.

An upper and surface ridge will be the main player across the region 
through Friday. Mid-level warm air will limit convection with a 
capping inversion. Isolated storms can not be ruled out, but 
coverage will be limited. Increasing low-level moisture by Friday 
into the weekend with heat indices becoming a problem.

For this weekend and Monday, upper ridging slowly weakens as trough 
over the Carolinas/southeast United States retrogrades south/then 
west. The mid-level warm layer will move out of the area with 
increasing moisture (PWs increasing to 1.7-1.9 inches). Increasing 
moisture and instability will allow convection to increase in 
coverage and intensity. Isolated strong/severe storms are possible 
each afternoon/evening. Main concern being damaging winds, heavy 
rainfall, and frequent lightning.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...The big upper ridge will be 
trying to build into the forecast area during the short term 
however, a weak upper trough will be gradually exiting through the
Eastern Seaboard. Some cool air aloft in association with the 
upper feature may allow for an isolated shower or thunderstorm 
over the major terrain features with very little chance for rain 
outside these areas. High temperatures will be very warm; typical 
for mid July and will top out mainly in the upper 80s to around 90
degrees. Lows tonight should be near normal ranging from the 
middle 60s north to the lower 70s across the extreme south. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Monday)...The heat late this 
week will be the focus for the long-term forecast. 

A slow moving trough will be located along the Carolina coast early 
in the period with a ridge established across the Central U.S. This 
ridge will expand eastward throughout the week. Wednesdays forecast 
will feature a few isolated to scattered showers in the higher 
elevations along the TN/NC line with high temperatures in the upper 
80s to low 90s across most valley locations. 

The heat continues to increase on Thursday as the ridge migrates 
across the Mid-Mississippi River Valley. 500 mb heights will increase 
into the 594-596 dm range with forecast highs in the low to mid 90s 
across most valley locations. Heat indices will approach 100 degrees 
in portions of the central and southern Valley. Anti-cyclonic flow 
aloft and drier air will keep rain chances below mentionable PoPs. 

The hottest day of the forecast will be on Friday with temperatures 
and dewpoints producing heat indices near heat advisory criteria 
across portions of the central and southern Valley. Most locations 
outside the higher terrain should see heat indices in the 95-103 
degree range. In addition, models have backed off on the PoPs some 
and have limited PoPs to the higher elevations where there could be 
some additional orographic lift. These PoPs seems more reasonable 
with the upper ridge over the Tennessee Valley. 

Over the weekend, an upper level closed low retrogrades across the 
Northern Gulf Coast as the ridge begins to breakdown slightly. High 
temperatures are still forecast to be in the upper 80s to mid 90s. 
Chances for afternoon showers and storms will increase slightly 
over the weekend with lower heights aloft.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Skies are mostly clear again
tonight. Temperatures are cooler again in the lower to mid 60s
northeast to upper 60s to near 70 center and south. However mostly
cloudy skies near Chattanooga have kept temperatures still in the
mid 70s. Just to the south in north Georgia showers persist near 
the old cold front that moved through the forecast area a couple 
days ago. Todays forecast will be similar to Sunday but with a few
more mainly diurnal showers and storms in the higher elevations 
and along the southern Tennessee border with Georgia. The 
remainder of the area looks mostly sunny and seasonably hot with 
highs in the mid to upper 80s northeast to near 90 to lower 90s 
central valley south to the Georgia border. Tonight showers and 
storms should die off early and be gone around sunset. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through through Sunday)...Bring on the 
heat, is the theme of this long term period. With a side serving 
of low rainfall chances.

On Tuesday we our weak upper level trough remains centered on the 
lee side of the Appalachians. Tuesday POPs will be focused on 
diurnal terrain based convection with chance POPs in. Slight chance 
in for valley locations in case a storm were to drift off the 
mountains and down into the East TN Valley. Highs will be in upper 
80s to near 90, one of the coolest days of the period. High across 
the Plains migrates further east Wednesday pushing the trough 
further into the Carolinas. Little chance for rain but will have 
slight chance/chance POPs focused across our eastern mountains. 
Highs will be in the upper 80s to low 90s with a heat index of mid 
to upper 90s across the Southern Valley. High pressure slides 
further east and dominates on Thursday with no POPS in the forecast. 
Highs in upper 80s to lower 90s with heat index in the mid to upper 
90s across the Central and Southern Valley. 

The GFS has been fairly consistent in showing some type of MCS 
activity moving down out of the Ohio River Valley and into our area 
for Friday. ECMWF continues to keep this activity further north 
though. Will keep slight chance and low-end chance POPs in for our 
Northeast TN and SWVA, along with our eastern mountains. Hottest 
temps of the period expected on Friday with highs in the low to mid 
90s. Heat index values of upper 90s across NETN, near 100 to 102 
across the Central and Southern Valley. These values in the lower 
100s will approach heat advisory levels, which is 105 degrees. 
Slight chance/chance POPs in for Saturday as we remain in proximity 
to the "ring of fire". Highs will be a degree or two cooler with 
highs in the lower 90s. heat index values in the upper 90s to near 
100 expected.  Superblend gives us the best POP chances of the 
period on Sunday with an upper-level trough beginning to dig down 
out of the Great Lakes and suppress the high. Low-end chance POPs in 
for all areas with highs a little cooler, near 90s to lower 90s. 
Heat index in the upper 90s. From Thursday night through Sunday 
night overnight lows will range from the low to mid 70s.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...
Fairly quiet weather pattern shaping up for today and tomorrow.
Some isolated showers/thunderstorms will linger over mainly the
higher terrain of SE Tennessee/SW North Carolina with a frontal
boundary positioned just south of the forecast area. Boundary
pushes farther south overnight and surface high pressure gains
control. With upper level NW flow, skies will clear and temps will
dip as low as 60 degrees across the north. A weak upper level 
trough swings through on Monday. Without a lot of moisture, not 
really expecting much precip as it rotates through; however, it 
should be enough to trigger another round of isolated to scattered
showers/storms across the higher terrain of the Smoky Mountains 
tomorrow afternoon. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through through Sunday)...
The period remains basically unchanged with a little bit of 
cyclonic flow still hanging around aloft Tuesday and less likely 
for Wednesday for the development of an isolated shower or 
thundershower mainly on major terrain features. The big ridge 
should be building in limiting chances for convection Thursday 
into Friday. Weather for the weekend somewhat uncertain with the 
European indicating the big ridge holds sway, limiting probability
of precip. However, the GFS knocks the ridge down enough across 
the Northeastern U.S. that the storm track and a synoptic frontal 
boundary drops south into the Southern Appalachians. Superblend 
likes the GFS solution so chance pops remain in place Saturday 
with a slightly higher likelihood for a few showers and 
thunderstorms on Sunday. Subsidence and increasing sunshine in the
ridge pattern results in a warming trend ending up with high 
temperatures in the lower and middle 90s with lows trending into 
the rather uncomfortable lower and middle 70 degree range. If a 
few showers and a couple thunderstorms develop over the weekend 
high temperatures could be a couple degrees cooler.

.AVIATION...
VFR conditions expected for the majority of the forecast period.
Isolated storms will develop this afternoon/evening near CHA, but
at this point, confidence is not high enough on storm
coverage/placement to include even a VCTS group at CHA. Storms
should be restricted to the southern half of the forecast area,
and not impact TYS or TRI at all today. With a lot of residual
boundary layer moisture across the south and clearing skies 
overnight, patchy fog may develop early tomorrow at CHA -- briefly
dropping cigs to MVFR or lower level. There is a higher chance of
this happening if the terminal is impacted by rain today.
Drier air in the vicinity of TYS and TRI should preclude fog
formation at either of the sites.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...A much drier air mass has
moved into the forecast area early this morning as seen on latest
water vapor imagery. Current temperatures at this hour are in the
lower 60s northeast to lower 70s southwest. Some patchy areas of
dense fog have formed. The cold front that was over the northern
areas yesterday has moved just south of the Tennessee border. For
the next 24 hours skies will be mostly sunny with just a slight
chance of mainly late day showers and thunderstorms across the
eastern mountains from the Smokies south and the extreme southern
plateau and valley. Upper trough that has settled over the eastern
and southeast states will continue. Another weak front will move 
south into the Ohio Valley by early Monday. To the west a ridge of
high pressure over the central states will begin to edge a little
farther east by Monday. Temperatures will stay warm today upper
80s to near 90 and slightly cooler tonight across the northern
sections like this morning as the drier air mass lingers.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...We start the extended 
with our secondary front moving in as advertised for the past 
several days. This feature continues to lack moisture but because 
we have a weak upper-level trough centered across the area and 
some upper-level jet energy, and vorticity rounding the trough 
base there is some forcing present. Will have slight chance POPs 
for most areas with the best focus across the higher terrain of 
the eastern mountains where chance POPs are in place. A little bit
of change on Tuesday compared to previous forecast but not much. 
The strength of the high to our west is too much for our lingering
trough. The high really presses on the trough and doesn't allow 
the weak closed off upper-low to develop as seen before. Now, the 
trough is a little further east and weaker, but will still have 
slight chance POP across the valley with low-end chance POPs 
across the eastern mountain. Overall for Monday and Tuesday, most 
valley areas will stay dry as rain/storm chances are low. 

By Wednesday the massive high has encroached upon us. This will keep 
the valley dry and only slight/chance POPs in place for the eastern 
terrain. Wednesday is also the day that are warming trend starts, 
with highs near 90 for most places. Thursday the high moves further 
east and is now centered over the plains, which puts us in northwest 
flow on the eastern edge of the high. Slight chance POPs in for the 
Plateau and eastern mountains while the valley looks dry. Highs will 
be in the low 90s with a heat index into the mid and upper 90s. On 
Friday we still could see some remnant MCS/outflow activity come down 
out of the Ohio River Valley, though the most recent run of the GFS 
keeps this activity further north compared to previous runs. will 
keep slight chance in for most places with low-end chance across the 
eastern mountains. Highs on Friday be near 90 to low 90s with a heat 
index in the mid to upper 90s. Saturday the high rolls a little 
further east but we still maintain northwest flow with the 
possibility of more remnant MCS type activity. Chance POPs in for 
most areas with highs in the low 90s and heat index again in the mid 
to upper 90s.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...
A cold front stretched across the forecast area will continue to 
move southward this evening and tonight. Along and south of the 
front, showers and thunderstorms will be likely with the potential
for some heavy rainfall. Behind the front, high pressure begins 
to build in with subsidence leading to a mostly clear sky. As the 
front transitions south into north Georgia by 12z Sunday, mostly 
clear conditions are expected at TYS and TRI with clouds trying to
clear out of CHA around daybreak. These clearer conditions will 
allow patchy fog to form late tonight and early Sunday morning, 
especially around those areas that received precipitation Saturday
evening. A clearer sky and lower dew points should allow low 
temperatures to be near normal for this time of year.

Boundary layer mixing of drier air aloft should quickly dissipate
any fog by about 14z Sunday. The cold front will linger just to
our south on Sunday with mostly clear to partly cloudy conditions
expected for most of the area. There may be a few showers or
thunderstorms close to the surface boundary across southeast TN
and southwest NC, but chances remain low. It should be a pleasant
day with lower humidity and high temperatures near seasonal
normals.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)...
The extended period basically remains unchanged with a weak 
upper level trough sliding southeast across the Southern 
Appalachians Monday into Tuesday a small chance for a couple 
showers and a thunderstorm or two across the forecast area with 
emphasis over the higher terrain along the western North Carolina 
border. Once this feature drifts east, we should come under the 
influence of some heavy duty ridging compliments of the massive 
ridge pattern that the western and central U.S. has been enjoying 
from June into Mid July. The pressure pattern should be able to 
limit convection over most of the forecast area. Had to keep some 
isolated showers and thunderstorms on the higher terrain features 
Wednesday through Thursday and then applied a broad brush maneuver
for slight chance pops across the entire viewing area for Friday;
mainly due to uncertainty ahead of the next system. Models beat 
the upper ridge down into submission by Saturday as a broad long 
wave trough drops through the Eastern Lakes and Northeastern 
corridor. The result of this gradual change would be a cool 
frontal boundary edging slowly toward the northern parts of the 
forecast area in backdoor style, with possible outflow driven 
showers and thunderstorms developing over the Southern 
Appalachians on Saturday. The advertised warming trend is still in
play with the big ridge pushing its way into the region by mid 
week. Highs will boil into the lower to possible middle 90s with 
lows moving back into the uncomfortable lower to middle 70 degree 
range.

A front moving through the region is leading to some showers and
thunderstorms this afternoon as well as brief MVFR or IFR
conditions within some of the heavier precipitation. Chances for
precipitation coming to an end soon around TRI with VFR conditions
expected the rest of this evening. VFR conditions also expected 
at TYS and CHA but some drops to MVFR appear possible during the
heavier precipitation. Tonight, fog looks likely in areas north 
of the front where clouds begin to clear. For this reason, added 
MVFR fog to TRI and TYS late tonight but held back on dropping 
visibilities too low at CHA since there are still questions about 
how far south the front and associated clearing will make it 
before sunrise on Sunday.

.DISCUSSION...
Surface observations this morning show a convergent wind 
shift/surface boundary across southeast TN stretching back into 
central Middle TN with the weak cold front and drier air still
across southeast KY approaching the TN border. Mesoanalysis
indicates PW values are between 1.8"-2.0" across southeast
TN and southwest NC which is very moist and around the 90th 
percentile for this time of year. Cloud layer winds are also 
fairly weak at around 10 knots and parallel the boundary. For 
these reasons, showers and thunderstorms are expected to continue 
to develop through the afternoon, generally south of Interstate 
40, and may produce heavy rainfall which could potentially train 
over the same areas. The potential for localized flooding has been
highlighted in the HWO.

Adjusted PoPs upward across southeast TN to reflect current radar
activity and expected trends into the afternoon. Made a few minor
adjustments to temperatures to reflect current conditions. Updated
zones to remove morning wording.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Isolated showers continue
early this morning across mostly extreme northeast Tennessee and
southwest Virginia. The activity is just ahead of a weak frontal
boundary across eastern Kentucky into western Tennessee. This
boundary will be the focus for additional showers and storms
during the day today and into the evening. The convection will be
scattered early this morning across the northern sections then
decrease towards sunrise and increase again later this morning 
and afternoon with the best chances southern areas as the front
moves into the central sections of the area. Have 30-50 percent
chance north and 50-60 percent chance south. Some storms may be
strong but heavy rainfall will be the main threat...especially
southern plateau and southern valley through late afternoon. High
temperatures should be held down more from increased cloud cover 
mainly lower to mid 80s...about 5 degrees cooler than Fridays 
temperatures. Tonight as frontal boundary shifts south showers and
storms will end sooner except extreme south. Cooler drier airmass
will allow temperatures to cool to lower to mid 60s north and mid
to upper 60s south about 5 degrees cooler than this mornings 
lows. A few isolated areas of fog this morning but more widespread
Sunday with more clearing overnight.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through through Friday)...Little change 
through the long term. As the period begins we are watching a 
frontal boundary move off further to our south. There are some 
differences on how fast the cloud cover clears Sunday but most 
areas look dry. The latest run of the NAM wants to have lingering 
clouds across the area Sunday morning before clearing out Sunday 
afternoon. The GFS however starts the morning off clear. With the 
proximity of the boundary just to our south, kept in low-end 
chance POPs across the extreme Southern Valley. On Monday models 
still show the secondary cold front dropping down out of the Ohio 
River Valley. Feature still looks moisture starved but will 
maintain some slight and low-end chance pops for the afternoon 
hours as forcing is there due to the 300 mb jet swing through the 
base of the trough that is still centered across the area and some
additional 500mb vorticity swinging through. On Tuesday the 
trough continues to get squeezed between high pressure off to our 
east and west. Models show this trough getting cutoff from the 
main flow and a weak upper-level closed low developing across the 
area late Tuesday. For this reason, left slight chance POPs in 
through the day. 

Wednesday features the first dry day of the period as a strong surge 
of 300 mb jet energy races in across the Great Lakes and forces our 
weak cutoff low off to the southeast. For Thursday and Friday we are 
under the influence of northwest flow as we are on the eastern 
periphery of the high centered across the plains. GFS still hinting 
at precip moving across the area on both days due to remnant MCS 
activity that looks to originate across the Northern Plains/Ohio 
River Valley. This type of scenario is common in July. Still 
maintained a gradual warming trend through the long term.

through the night...though a stronger inversion is setting
up...limiting the coverage of convection. Have lowered
precipitation chances to account for this. Also updated the
forecast to account for cooler temperatures as there has not been 
as much cloud cover through the evening. This will also lead to 
greater fog development. Patchy dense fog is possible across the

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...
Showers and thunderstorms will decrease in coverage after sunset
as instability decreases. However, chance PoPs remain overnight
with a warm and moist boundary layer combined with earlier outflow
boundaries and an approaching frontal boundary. May have some
patchy fog again tonight near lakes and rivers as well as around
areas that received rain Friday afternoon, but expected cloud 
cover would act to inhibit fog in many locations.

A cold front across the Ohio Valley will continue south toward 
the area tonight as an upper trough pivots through the Northeast 
U.S. Expect this front to be approaching the TN/KY border by 12z 
Saturday with the chance of rain showers and a few thunderstorms 
along the boundary. The front is then expected to slowly move 
southward during the day. This will lead to more likely PoPs for 
Saturday afternoon, especially south of I-40. 

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...
Still looks like some convection extending into the weekend as 
the cool frontal boundary progged to limp very slowly south toward
the Georgia line. Kept some pops for showers and thunderstorms 
going for the chance of some convergence in the slightly more 
humid and unstable air south of the boundary. The trailing short 
wave and secondary cool front dropping southeast through the Ohio 
Valley and through the Southern Appalachian region is still in the
works for Monday with some extension into Tuesday morning when 
this feature moves away to the east. Apparently the forecast area 
comes under the influence of a drier north to northwesterly flow 
regime Wednesday into Thursday with some most pleasant ridging 
building into the Mid South. This fine pattern negates the use of 
probability of precipitation on these days. However, the GFS model
dominated the Superblend concept for this forecast cycle and it 
wants to amplify an upper trough across Eastern Canada and the 
Northeastern United States toward the end of the week. This leads 
to the possibility of an outflow driven mcs or actual synoptic 
boundary building southeast into the northern reaches of our 
viewing area. Thus some chance pops for more convection were added
to the forecast at the end of the work week. Applied a very 
gradual warming trend for the long term with some drier, subsident
air eventually moving into the forecast area by mid week.

.DISCUSSION...
It will be another hot and humid afternoon similar to what we had
on Thursday. Mesoanalysis shows a small shortwave disturbance this
morning near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.
This disturbance is forecast to track ESE providing some
additional support for ascent across the northern Cumberland
Plateau later today. Instability will continue to increase this 
afternoon into the 1000-2000 J/kg range. However, effective deep 
layer shear remains weak at 10-15 kts. This will result in 
scattered ordinary pulse convection around the higher elevations 
of the plateau and mountains with some showers and thunderstorms 
spreading into the lower elevations later this afternoon as 
outflow boundaries expand. More widespread showers and 
thunderstorms may be possible around 0z-06z tonight as 
thunderstorms that are expected to develop ahead of the cold 
front across KY move southeastward into our area. Only a few minor
adjustments made to forecast temperatures and dew points based on
current observations. Made a few minor changes to PoPs as well to
reflect expected thunderstorm coverage through the early 
afternoon. Zones updated to remove morning wording.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Showers and storms ended 
shortly after midnight over the forecast area. Some fog has formed
on the plateau and southwest Virginia otherwise skies were mostly
clear to partly cloudy. More cloud cover lies to the north over
the Ohio Valley where areas of thunderstorms are still occurring
ahead of a weak cold front. This front will move closer to the
Tennessee Valley today and reach the northern areas overnight
tonight. Shortwave energy ahead of the front combined with daytime
heating into the upper 80s to lower 90s and high dew points in the
upper 60s/lower 70s will produce MLCAPE of around 2000+J/kg by
afternoon. This will develop isolated strong to marginally severe
storms with high winds across much of the area. Locally heavy
rainfall also possible. The storms should last several hours into
the night and then a good chance of showers into the early morning
hours as the front will reach northern sections of the area by
early morning. Highs today again around 90 to lower 90s before
most convection develops. Tonight lows about the same as this
morning upper 60s to lower 70s.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through through Thursday)...Showers and storms 
across the area to start the period as an upper-level trough and 
associated cold front swing through. The front moves at a very slow 
pace through the day on Saturday so it looks like we will have 
showers and storms around for most of the day. There will be very 
little shear to work with, at best we will have around 10 to 15 kts 
in the 0-6km range. For this reason, not expecting a severe threat, 
though a few storms could become strong. The main threats will be 
heavy rainfall as PW values will remain elevated until the front 
finally slips south. Models in fair agreement that the front moves 
south of us overnight Saturday and Sunday as drier air begins to 
move in. There could be a shower or two around early Sunday morning 
but Sunday afternoon looks dry for areas north of I-40, will keep a 
slight chance POP in for areas south of I-40 due to the proximity of 
the front just to our south.

A secondary wave drops down through the existing trough Sunday night 
and swings into our area on Monday. Very little moisture with this 
feature so will only have low-end chance POPs in place through the 
day. Trough hangs around on Tuesday with the axis centered along the 
spine of the Appalachians as it is sandwiched between high pressure 
to our east over the Atlantic and to our west over the Plains. Slight 
chance and low-end chance pops in place through the day Tuesday. 
Advancing 300 mb jet moves towards the Great Lakes late Tuesday and 
brings enough energy to finally push our old trough off to our east, 
keeping the Tuesday night and Wednesday period mostly dry. For 
Thursday we are on the eastern edge of the high pressure that is 
centered across the plains. Being on the eastern periphery will 
allow for a slight chance POP to be in place. The Wednesday through 
Thursday period look quite warm and humid with the large area of 
high pressure just to our west.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...
A warm and muggy airmass remains in place tonight with lows
expected to be several degrees above seasonal normals. Some patchy
localized fog may develop in the favored areas around lakes and 
rivers as well as in areas that received rainfall on Thursday 
afternoon.

On Friday, an upper-level trough will pivot into the Northeast
U.S. pushing a cold front southward through the Ohio River Valley
and approaching the Southern Appalachians and Tennessee Valley by
Friday night. Southwesterly flow will continue to advect moisture
into the region pushing forecast PW values to between 1.7-2.0
inches on Friday. This is around the 90th percentile for this time
of year meaning that heavy downpours would be possible with 
showers and thunderstorms that develop. MLCAPE during the day is 
expected to be between 1000-2000 J/kg but effective deep layer 
shear will remain weak between 10-15 knots with the jet stream and
greatest dynamics remaining far to our north. While more cloud 
cover is expected as compared to Thursday, highs are still 
anticipated to rise into the upper 80s to lower 90s. For these 
reasons, expect most of the shower and thunderstorm activity 
during the day on Friday to be mainly diurnally driven convection
from differential heating across the higher terrain of the 
mountains and plateau. Additional showers and thunderstorms ahead 
of the cold front may begin to approach the plateau and southwest 
Virginia by around sunset on Friday.


.LONG TERM (Friday night through Thursday)...
It's hard to believe that we are in mid July and yet another 
synoptic cold front is forecast to press south through the 
Southern Appalachians during the long term. The boundary slips 
into the area on Friday night into Saturday bringing an increase 
in convection to the viewing area. The boundary shifts only slowly
south but could be clear of the southern part of the region near 
the Georgia border by 12z Sunday; thus the slight and small chance
pops for a shower or thunderstorm in southern sections through 
this period. The atmosphere apparently is not finished yet with 
the active Eastern United States Summer of 2017 as another well 
developed upper trough amplifies southward into the eastern third 
of the of the nation bringing a chance for more showers and 
thunderstorms in the Southern Appalachians mainly Monday into 
Tuesday so applied the chance probability to account for this 
possibility. The increased cloud cover and convective 
possibilities argue for a slight reduction in max temps on 
Saturday with only a small rise in the mercury on Sunday into 
Monday. Intense Summer season heating and a rise in humidity 
should result in a more uncomfortable Tuesday and Wednesday.

.DISCUSSION...
It looks to be another hot and muggy day across the area. 
Differential heating along the higher terrain of the plateau and 
mountains will lead to more shower and thunderstorm development 
this afternoon across those areas. We may see a few of those 
showers or storms make its way into the valley, but with such weak
deep layer shear and cloud layer flow, expect afternoon 
thunderstorms to pulse and remain primarily across the higher 
terrain and adjacent areas. PWs are a little higher today between
1.7-2.0 inches which is near the 90th percentile, so showers and 
thunderstorms this afternoon may have locally heavy downpours and
high rain rates. Made a few minor tweaks to temperatures and dew 
points to match up with current observations. Updated zones sent 
to remove morning wording.

Expect mainly VFR flying conditions through the TAF period.
Diurnal convection is expected again this afternoon, and VCTS has
been mentioned at all TAF sites. Because of the scattered nature
of the convection, it's hard to pinpoint if a cell will develop
and impact a TAF site directly this afternoon/early evening;
however, we will continue to monitor the latest trends and update
forecasts accordingly. Convection will slowly diminish after
sunset, and more patchy fog is possible overnight/early Friday.
Again, confidence is too low on fog development and locations are
dependent on today's rain, so did not mention in TAF forecasts at
this point.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Low level moisture continues to 
increase across the region with dew points climbing into the 70s 
at many locations. With strong daytime heating...diurnal 
convection will once again develop across the area. With the 
increased moisture...thunderstorms activity should be more 
widespread this afternoon. Also...with PWs of 1.5 to near 2 
inches...heavy rainfall can be expected with the potential for 
localized flooding. Otherwise...it will be a warm and humid day 
with highs reaching into the 80s and low 90s. For tonight... 
convection will continue into the evening hours...with much of the
activity dissipating around sunset. However...a few showers may
linger through the night. It will be a mild night with lows only 
falling into the upper 60s to low 70s across most valley 
locations.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...An upper level trough 
will swing across the Great Lakes into the Northeastern U.S. on 
Friday. A cold front will push southward across the Ohio River 
Valley during this timeframe and enter northern portions of the 
forecast area late Friday into early Saturday. Moisture will 
continue to build in advance of the boundary with PW values rising
into the 1.8-2.0 inch range. These values are around the 90-95th 
percentile for mid-July. SBCAPE values will range from around 
1500-2500 J/Kg but the deep layer shear will be weak with the main
upper level forcing well to the north. The SPC has a marginal 
risk for severe weather across the area and expect there could be 
a few stronger storms possible late in the day on Friday with 
gusty winds and small hail being the main threats. Temperatures 
will be warm again on Friday with highs in the mid 80s to low 90s.
With the front coming through during the overnight hours, kept 
elevated PoPs going through Saturday morning. 

PoPs will begin to decrease from NW to SE on Saturday and Saturday 
night as the cold front exits the region. PW values remain elevated 
across southern portions of the forecast area with SBCAPE values up 
to 1500-2500 J/Kg. Due to this, expect there will once again be the 
chance for a stronger storm or two across the southern tier of 
counties or so Saturday afternoon. The deep layer shear remains weak 
and do not expect anything organized just a couple of storms the 
could pulse up and become strong.

PoPs really begin to drop off Saturday night as much drier air 
filters in behind the front. PW values will drop down into the 0.6-
0.8 inch range which is around the 5th-10th percentile for mid-July. 
Removed PoPs from most of the area during this timeframe. 
Temperatures will cool by a few degrees with highs near normal on 
Sunday. 

Seeing some major difference in the global models going into next 
week. Both indicate a northwesterly wave diving southeastward across 
the Eastern U.S. The GFS moves this wave directory over the area and 
keeps elevated PoPs in and slightly cooler temperatures in the 
forecast throughout next week. The ECMWF shows this trough moving 
southeastward across the Eastern Seaboard with a ridge building 
across the Central and Southern U.S. This would lead to warmer and 
drier conditions. For now, have sided more with the blend with near 
normal temperatures and PoPs and will wait for better model 
consistency.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...
Low level Gulf moisture will continue to flow back into the 
region from the southwest as the surface high continues to shift 
east throughout the period. Without much surface forcing, diurnal
showers and thunderstorms this afternoon/evening should quickly 
fizzle out after sunset. Conditions should be dry and muggy overnight
with lows hovering around 70 degrees. With such a moist boundary
layer, patchy fog will develop around sunrise on Thursday. More
scattered diurnal convection is expected by Thursday afternoon 
with PW values surging to 1.7-1.9 inches. Once again, showers and 
thunderstorms will dissipate after sunset.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
With the upper high just off the Carolinas coast, the trend of 
increasing moisture across the TN Valley will persist into 
Thursday night. Look for greater coverage of afternoon showers and
thunderstorms. A deepening trough over the Great Lakes and Ohio 
Valley on Friday will help push a cold front closer to the region.
As a result, showers and thunderstorms will be more widespread by
Friday afternoon and Friday night. Some concerns over how far 
south the front makes it by Saturday but if it slows...high 
precipitation chances may extend into Saturday afternoon 
particularly along and south of I-40. The frontal location on 
Sunday will largely dictate precip chances for the southern TN 
Valley.

By Sunday night into Monday night...another strong shortwave will 
translate out of the Great Lakes region bringing more unsettled 
weather to the forecast area along with another frontal boundary. It 
may be mid-week before we have a relatively dry forecast.

After this Friday, temperatures will eventually drop to near normal 
levels through the remainder of the forecast.

314 AM EDT Wed Jul 12 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Surface high pressure continues 
to shift to the east with southerly flow developing over the 
area. This will allow low level moisture to return to the region. 
As a result...the increasing moisture combined with strong daytime
heating will allow diurnal convection to form during the 
afternoon. This activity should be mainly over higher elevations 
and far souther locations with minimal impact over the rest of the
area. With the warm afternoon temperatures in the upper 80s and 
low 90s and the increased relative humidities...may see heat 
indices climb well into the 90s...especially over southern areas. 
A few showers may linger into the evening hours but due to the 
diurnal nature of the convection...expect mainly dry conditions 
for the majority of the night.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...The 500 mb ridge on 
Thursday will be located just off the Carolina coast with 
southerly flow in the mid-levels. The typical Bermuda high will be
present in the low-levels with several days of weak southerly 
flow. PW values will increase into the 1.6-1.9 inch range by 
Thursday with more widely scattered showers and storms forecast 
during the afternoon with decreasing activity during the evening 
and overnight hours. 

The upper level ridge will break down on Friday as an upper level 
trough progresses southeastward across the Great Lakes into the Ohio 
River Valley. A cold front will dive across the Ohio River Valley 
into northern portions of the forecast area late in the day. PW 
values will continue to increase ahead of the front into the 1.8-2.0 
inch range, which are above the 90th percentile for mid-July. Model 
soundings indicate SBCAPE values of around 150-2500 J/Kg but 0-6 km 
Bulk Shear values are only around 10 kts with the bulk of the upper 
level support to the north. Due to this, not expecting any strong to 
severe storms at this time. The latest models are a bit slower with 
the progression of the front and  PoPs will remain elevated during 
the overnight hours Friday night into Saturday morning as the front 
moves through the area. 

PoPs will begin to decrease from northwest to southeast Saturday 
into Saturday night as drier air filters in behind the front. Mostly 
dry conditions are forecast on Sunday with a small chances for a few 
isolated showers and storms across the higher elevations. 

The models have some timing differences early next week but agree on 
the overall pattern. Both the GFS and ECMWF keep the pattern active 
with upper level troughs embedded in northwesterly flow aloft 
forecast to start the work week. Due to this, have continued with 
slight chance to chance PoPs into early next week.

Temperatures and dewpoints will continue to lead to heat indices in 
the mid to upper 90s across most of the area Thursday and Friday 
afternoons before beginning to ease some over the weekend.

.AVIATION...Surface high will continue to shift east with southerly 
flow developing over the area.  This will allow low level moisture 
to return to the region.  As a result...may see patchy fog and low 
clouds develop towards morning...mainly near TRI where local MVFR 
conditions will be possible.  On Wednesday...with the increasing 
moisture and strong daytime heat...expect diurnal convection to form 
during the afternoon.  This activity should be mainly over higher 
elevations and at this time not expected to effect TAF sites. 
Therefore... Wednesday should see VFR conditions with scattered 
clouds and winds less than 10kt.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...Our quiet weather pattern 
begins to shift on Wednesday, returning to more summer-like 
conditions. However, we can expect tonight to remain calm and clear. 
Most areas will see overnight low temperatures in the upper 60s to 
near 70, which is near normal for this time of year.

Moisture return increases across the area tomorrow afternoon as 
southerly 850 winds transport moisture from south to north and into 
our area. Expecting terrain based diurnal convection to fire 
tomorrow afternoon with a few storms possible drifting into valley 
locations. For the most part however, valley locations should stay 
dry. These afternoon storms will be pulse type as there is no shear 
to keep them organized or sustained. With the increase in moisture 
we can expect dewpoints to continue to climb tomorrow which will 
increase RH values thus raising the Heat Index. Heat index values 
are expected to be in lower to mid 90s across the Central and 
especially Southern Valley areas tomorrow afternoon. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...The trend of 
increasing moisture across the TN Valley will continue on Thursday
as PW values are expected to rise into the 1.75-2 inch range. 
With plenty of moisture and instabilty, we should see greater 
coverage of afternoon showers and thunderstorms across the area. 
Synoptic forcing remains weak until Friday when a shortwave trough
moves into the Great Lakes/OH Valley region, suppressing the 
mid/upper ridge slightly. The surface front associated with this 
system will push into KY Friday evening, and our northern sections
will have PoPs in the likely range from Friday afternoon through 
the night. Higher precip changes will shift to southern sections 
on Saturday as the front moves across our area and a NW midlevel 
flow develops behind the exiting trough. 

Sunday through Tuesday will have less humid conditions as high 
pressure builds SE from the northern Plains into the OH Valley and a 
NW flow aloft. The GFS shows a trough crossing our area on 
Monday/Monday night, but deep moisture stays well to our south and 
east. Populating with the model blend gives chance PoPs that seem 
too high for the pattern, so will lower them to a slight chance PoP 
during Sunday and Monday.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

PW values have recovered some since yesterday but still remain in 
the 1.0-1.2 inch range, which is around the 25th percentile for 
early to mid-July. The upper level jet is to the north across the 
Great Lakes and Northern Plains. Closer to home, the upper level 
flow is light and dominated by weak high pressure. At the surface, 
high pressure continues to be in control across the Southern 
Appalachians. 

Not expecting much change in the overall weather pattern today. Dry 
conditions are forecast with lower than normal PW values and the 
lack of any forcing mechanism. However, there is small chance for an 
isolated afternoon shower or storm in the higher terrain where there 
could be some weak orographic lift. Upper level height rises are 
forecast today as a weak and rather flat ridge extends across the 
region. Expect highs will be 2-3 degrees warmer than yesterday with 
most locations in the upper 80s to lower 90s.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...

Ridge of high pressure aloft will remain across the Tennessee 
Valley and southern Appalachians through Thursday. The main change
will be increasing moisture and instability as winds become more 
southerly. The increasing instability will allow for convection to
develop, mainly across the higher terrain then move into the 
valley. Will have the highest PoPs across the local orographic 
features.

For Friday and Saturday, An upper trough will move across the Great 
Lakes pulling a frontal boundary south into the lower Ohio and 
Tennessee Valleys. The forcing along this boundary will increase the 
chances of storms. Main concern from these thunderstorms will be 
heavy rain, gusty winds, and frequent lightning. There remains some 
disagreement on how far south this boundary will go.

The upper trough will amplify across northeast and mid-atlantic 
states for late Sunday and Monday with another reinforcing 
boundary moving through the area. Will maintain chance PoPs for 
most of the area, especially near the NC/TN state-line for Monday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...A very quiet short term in 
store as we are still under the influence of drier air and high 
pressure. It will be another calm and clear night with temps a few 
degrees warmer than last night, but still a degree or two below 
normal. There may be a few areas of light patchy fog develop 
overnight but not confident enough in coverage to include in 
forecast. 

Moisture return slowly increases tomorrow afternoon as southerly 850 
flow becomes established. Still looks like it will be a dry day for 
most of the CWA though did include a slight chance of showers and 
storms down across southwest North Carolina. Highs tomorrow will be 
a degree or two warmer with temps near 90 for most places.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...With a high 
pressure ridge off the east coast and a weak SW flow through the 
lower and midlevels, a fairly typical summer pattern can be 
expected for the middle of this week. Scattered to isolated 
diurnal storms will be forecast Wednesday and Thursday, with the 
higher terrain being favored for rain chances. Temps will be 
slightly above normal each day. 

A shortwave trough moves E-SE across the Great Lakes on Friday, 
leading to falling midlevel heights and a surface trough over KY and 
the TN Valley. The upper trough and a cold front being to cross the 
area on Saturday. With some forcing acting on a warm, moist pre-
frontal environment, both days will have PoPs in the high chance 
range, with Friday PoPs favoring northern sections and Saturday PoPs 
favoring southern sections as the front/trough move south. 

Sunday and Monday will depend on how far south the front can push, 
and there is some uncertainty about this. The GFS has a stronger 
northerly flow aloft that takes the front well south, while the 
weaker flow of the ECMWF keeps it close to our southern border. 
Since several GEFS members maintain some precip in our area both 
days, a low chance PoP will be forecast for southern sections with 
temperatures near normal.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Much drier air is in place across the region early this morning. PW 
values currently range from 0.6-0.8 inches. These values are near 
the minimum values observed for early to mid July. The drier air is 
evident on the current water vapor imagery stretching across the 
Southern Appalachians into the Tennessee River Valley. At the 
surface, high pressures is overhead with light winds at the surface. 
Expect there will be some patchy fog this morning, especially near 
lakes and streams across the area. This drier air will also lead to 
a cooler than normal start to the day with temperatures this morning 
starting out in the upper 50s to low 60s across most of the region.

Not much change expected throughout the day today. PW values will 
remain near minimum values for early to mid July. The surface high 
may shift some to the east which could slightly increase the PW 
values across the region but still remaining well below normal. 
Despite the cooler than normal start to the day, sunny skies will 
quickly push temperatures into the mid 80s to low 90s during the 
afternoon.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...

On Tuesday and Wednesday...will see southerly winds develop over 
the region allowing low level moisture to return. With strong 
daytime heating...expect diurnal convection to develop...mainly 
over higher elevations on Tuesday and increasing in coverage for 
Wednesday. By Thursday...flow aloft becomes zonal and low level 
moisture should be well in place allowing for scattered 
thunderstorms over the area. A weakening frontal boundary is 
progged to move through the region around the Friday/Saturday time
frame. Timing is in question but this feature should provide us 
with our best chance of convection for the extended. By 
Sunday...models in quite poor agreement. The overall pattern wants
to take the boundary through and generally slowing or even 
stalling it along our southern border with potentially a secondary
boundary approaching from the north. Confidence is low but a 
chance of showers and thunderstorms into Sunday looks reasonable.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Monday)...
High pressure remains in control tonight and tomorrow resulting in pleasant
weather. For tonight, the combination of subsidence and dry air
aloft, a clear sky, light wind, and high antecedent soil moisture will
result in likely patchy fog development late tonight. Some of the
fog may be dense at times. With such an efficient radiational 
cooling setup, expect lows to be near dew point temperatures and 
several degrees below seasonal normals.

Most fog should dissipate by about 14z as boundary layer mixing ramps
up Monday morning. High pressure remains in control with sunshine and
scattered cumulus in the afternoon. Upper-level troughing pattern lifts
off to the northeast resulting in heights building some through the
day with 850mb temperatures expected to increase by a degree or two.
Therefore, expect high temperatures to be generally a couple degrees
warmer on Monday than we had on Sunday. Although it will be slightly
warmer, the good news is that dew points remain lower and we will
have another day of less muggy conditions.

.LONG TERM (Monday night through Sunday)...
Quiet conditions to start the long term period with surface high 
pressure lingering over the area. We will see clear skies Monday 
night with lows near normal to a degree or two below normal. On 
Tuesday we begin to get a little moisture return out of the Gulf 
as 850 winds become more southerly. Tuesday still looks dry 
though, expect for a slight chance for diurnal convection across 
our eastern mountains. Tuesday's highs will be in the upper 80s to
near 90 with dewpoints beginning to climb. Another clear night 
Tuesday and slightly warmer with lows in the upper 60s to near 70.
On Wednesday, moisture continues to slowly increase as 850 winds 
remain southerly, this will yield better coverage of diurnal 
convection on Wednesday afternoon compared to Tuesday. Highs again
in the upper 80s to near 90. A few showers and storms linger 
Wednesday night but clear out with our loss of heating. Lows will 
be in the upper 60s to lower 70s. 

The flow over our area becomes zonal on Thursday out ahead of an 
approaching upper level trough located across the Ohio River Valley. 
With more moisture now across the area, have low-end chance POPs in 
for Thursday with highs in the upper 80s to near 90. Chances for 
showers and storms increase Thursday night as the trough draws 
closer. As of now, the GFS and ECMWF generally agree that the trough 
begins to move in Friday morning, thus yielding the highest POPs of 
the period with high-end chance and likely POPs in place for Friday. 
The big question as of now is how quickly does the front move south. 
The ECMWF and GFS are in fair agreement that the front moves in late 
Friday night into Saturday morning then pushes south of the area 
through the day on Saturday. This would keep Saturday and Sunday 
mostly dry for us. The GFS shows a secondary front moving in on 
Sunday but the ECMWF keeps this feature further to our north. 

Overall, a dry start with slowly increasing POP chances through the 
period with the best chances/coverage of showers and storms coming 
Thursday night through Friday night.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Latest water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis depicts
trough axis extending SW from New England into Western NC and
Northern GA/AL this morning. Behind the trough axis, dry air aloft
is filtering into the area with clear skies dominating this
morning. Patchy fog mainly confined to river valleys and other low
lying areas should burn off rather quickly after sunrise and a
little boundary layer mixing. With a drier airmass in place,
seasonal daytime highs will feel a bit more refreshing as
dewpoints drop into the lower 60s across much of the area.
Continued dry air with clear skies overnight will push low
temperatures into the lower 60s, and about 5-8 degrees below
normal for early July. Both NAM and GFS MOS are in agreement on
both high and low temperatures for the period and are in line with
the current fcst. 

.LONG TERM (Monday Through Saturday)...
With surface high pressure and northwest flow aloft dominating 
area weather on Monday...will see another quiet...dry and warm 
day. The high shifts east of the area on Tuesday allowing winds to
shift southerly...increasing low level moisture. As a 
result...expect normal summertime type diurnal convection to 
develop over higher terrain Tuesday afternoon and evening. By 
Wednesday...flow aloft becomes more zonal and a series of weak 
short waves will track through the upper flow. Confidence remains 
low on details but this pattern will allow for a chance of 
convection Wednesday and Thursday. Models trending toward bringing
a weak frontal boundary into the area around the Friday/Saturday 
time frame. If models remain on track with this feature...it may 
provide the area with its best chance of organized convection 
throughout the extended. For now...will just continued the chance 
of thunderstorm activity through the end of the period.

isolated shower across Southwest Virginia and another over the
extreme Southeast Tennessee and Southwest North Carolina as a weak
trailing trough slips southeast across the region. Therefore, the
pop forecast basically on track. Will give min temps a chance
across most of the region. However, mid 60s over Southeast
Tennessee may be a bit optimistic and will tweak a little higher
for mins Sunday morning. Still looks like there will be some fog
around with the rain soaked surface conditions.

.AVIATION...Flight weather should be settling down in terms of the
development of convection across the Great Valley. Still just
enough moisture for an isolated shower in the vicinity of cha for
a brief period at the beginning of the forecast with a stabilizing
atmosphere in store for the rest of the night. It almost seems
like it has rained every day at the terminals for the past three
weeks and the damp conditions would likely lead to some fog
formation around daybreak; or even earlier in the soup around cha.
So, forecast mvfr reductions in visibility at each airport later
tonight with possibility of ifr fog at tri and a hint at some lifr
ceiling action. After the fog dissipates around 13z or shortly
thereafter, it should be a vfr day for flying operations in the
drier northerly flow filling in behind the departing "cold" front.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...
Cold front moves through this evening with subsidence and 
clearing conditions in its wake. With a clear sky and light winds,
may have some patchy fog develop late tonight. Temperatures 
tonight will be slightly below average with lower dew points 
advecting into the region and efficient boundary layer cooling. 
High pressure and a drier airmass will result in much lower 
relative humidity on Sunday afternoon leading to a mostly sunny 
and comfortable day. High temperatures are expected to be within 
a degree or two of average for this time of year.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)...
A quiet weather pattern will be in place early in the extended 
with surface high pressure in control. Flow aloft will be 
northwesterly which will contribute to dry, sunny conditions for 
both Sunday and Monday. The high shifts east of the area on 
Tuesday, allowing southerly flow to stream Gulf moisture back into
the forecast area. With plentiful sunshine and strong daytime 
heating, some diurnal convection will develop during the afternoon
hours, mainly across the higher elevations. For the second half 
of the week, the pattern continues to trend more unsettled with a 
series of weak upper level shortwaves rotating through the area. 
This should bring at least scattered showers and thunderstorms to 
the area each day. Timing and track of these features vary from 
model to model and run to run, so confidence is low on exact 
details and timing. As such, have continued chance PoPs each day.

.DISCUSSION...
A cold front across central Kentucky stretching SSW into Middle 
Tennessee can be discerned from surface obs and low level water 
vapor imagery indicating subsidence behind the front. This front 
will continue to move southeastward today providing a focus for 
showers and thunderstorms across our area this afternoon.

Mesoanalysis indicates an already unstable airmass across 
southeast Tennessee with MLCAPE values of 1000-1500 J/kg. 
Effective deep-layer shear is around 20-25 kts which will be 
sufficient for multicell convective organization and maintenance. 
Based on 1)current and expected afternoon instability and 2)the 
cold front and outflow boundaries from earlier convection 
providing a forcing mechanism for convective initiation, have 
bumped up PoPs slightly across the area. Hourly temperature and 
dew point mostly on track and only made minor changes to reflect 
current observations.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Showers and t'storms ahead of a cold front near the Ohio River 
will affect the northern portions of the area this morning, with a
general weakening trend expected as it spreads southward. The main
concern this morning will be minor flooding with training cells.
Residual boundaries will be across the central and southern
sections, and will likely be the focus for additional development
this afternoon. Some surface heating will provide some instability
in southern sections that may produce a marginal threat of severe
storms, with wind gusts being the main threat. The cold front will
move through the area in the late afternoon evening, which should
end all rain chances by midnight. High pressure building in will
provide a drier air mass that will allow low temps to fall into
the lower to mid 60s tonight.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...
A quiet weather pattern will be in place early in the extended 
with surface high pressure in control. Flow aloft will be 
northwesterly which will contribute to dry...clear conditions for 
both Sunday and Monday. We will be slowing moving into an 
unsettled weather pattern beginning Tuesday as the high shifts 
east of the area allowing southerly flow to develop and bring gulf
moisture back into the region. With strong daytime 
heating...expect to see normal summertime diurnal convection 
develop in the afternoon...mainly across higher elevations. For 
the rest of the extend...will see an series of weak impulses 
moving through the upper flow. Timing and track of these features 
vary from model to model and run to run so confidence low on 
details. However...this pattern should provide a chance of 
convection each day from Wednesday through Friday.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...
A cold front will approach the region late tonight and Saturday 
bringing a chance of rain showers and thunderstorms. Showers and
thunderstorms across the Ohio River Valley are expected to move
southeastward toward the Southern Appalachians overnight, but models
are indicating a weakening trend with this first round of showers
and thunderstorms as it approaches our area by Saturday morning. 
Additional scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected to 
develop along the front Saturday afternoon generally across 
southeastern Tennessee, southwest North Carolina, and far eastern 
Tennessee along the mountains. Some of these thunderstorms may be 
capable of marginally severe wind gusts and heavy rainfall. This 
activity should quickly decrease in coverage by 0z Sunday as the 
front, and associated lift, moves southeastward and drier air 
filters in.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...
Frontal boundary should be mainly south of the area by Saturday 
evening, with just a slight chance of a lingering shower/thunderstorm
over the TN/NC border. Surface high pressure will build overhead 
for Sunday and Monday, resulting in sunny, dry days with highs in 
the mid to upper 80s. The center of the high shifts east on 
Tuesday, reopening our area to Gulf moisture under a weak 
southwest surface flow. Diurnal convection is possible by Tuesday 
afternoon, mainly over the higher elevations where terrain will 
provide additional forcing. A series of weak upper level 
shortwaves will ripple through the area during the second half of 
the workweek, bringing a chance for showers and thunderstorms each
day.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
A shortwave trough and a weak surface boundary will push southeast
through the area this morning. The coverage of showers right now
is quite a bit less than the models suggest, and although there
may be more development in southern areas ahead of the boundary,
the forecast will undercut the guidance PoPs. Highest rain chances
today will be in the morning in southern sections, with decreasing
chances as you go north and into the afternoon. There is little
air mass change behind the boundary, so temps and dewpoints
should be close to what we have seen the past few days.

A cold front across the Great Lakes this morning will push toward
the area and be located near the Ohio River tonight. Showers and
thunderstorms ahead of it will begin to enter our area after
midnight. Moisture is limited with a westerly low to midlevel 
flow ahead of it, and models suggest a weakening trend as storms
move across KY, so PoPs will be kept in the chance range in
northern sections for late tonight.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)... 
A weak frontal boundary will drop through the area on Saturday. 
Moisture is minimal...but there appears to be sufficient lift and 
weak instabilty for scattered convection along/ahead of the 
frontal passage. Behind the exiting boundary...surface high 
pressure will build in with dry northwest flow aloft. This will 
bring a brief dry period to the region for Sunday and Monday. Will
transition into an unsettle weather pattern for the rest of the 
extended. The high will begin to shift east of the area by 
Tuesday...bringing low level moisture back into the region. This 
will allow diurnal convection to develop over the area on 
Tuesday...mainly over higher elevations. A series of weak short 
waves will then track through the upper flow Wednesday and 
Thursday. The result will be a chance of showers and thunderstorms
each day.

Showers and storms have continued several hours this evening in a
warm moist environment ahead of a weak front over the Ohio Valley
and West Tennessee. A slow moving shortwave moving across the 
area tonight ahead of the front will keep high chances for showers
and a few storms going for at least the next few hours. More

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...A short wave trough and 
dying frontal boundary will move into the area tonight.  This will 
enhance our chances for showers and thunderstorms.  Looks like the 
best chances may linger until well after midnight with the action 
winding down a bit by late night. Will carry likely PoPs all areas. 
Wind fields still support some organization to the convection this 
afternoon and into at least early tonight, so will keep HWO mention 
of strong to severe storms.  Weak short wave ridging behind this 
system along with some deep layer drying should help to limit 
convection for Friday, so will carry just slight chance PoPs north 
to chance south.  Will not stray far from MAV temps overall.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)... Our forecast area will 
be between two systems to start the forecast period, with a frontal 
boundary pushing southeast of the area Friday night and another cold 
front approaching from the upper midwest. Moisture will be somewhat 
limited with this second boundary due to northwest flow between the 
boundaries, but there should be enough lift along the front to spark 
at least some scattered showers and thunderstorms on Saturday as the 
front pushes through. 

High pressure at the surface and northwest flow aloft will result in 
a brief period of drier weather for Sunday into Monday before the 
center of the surface high slides east and moisture returns to the 
area. Kept broadbrushed slight chance to chance PoPs in Tuesday 
through Thursday with a moist environment and a few weak 
disturbances rotating through the base of an upper level trough. 
This should be enough to spark at least scattered 
showers/thunderstorms each day.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast for today generally looks to be on track,
as plenty of moisture lingers over the area. Likely PoPs look
reasonable, but will tweak timing based on latest trends. Will 
also tweak temps and dew points. A look at model low level wind 
fields indicate shear will increase enough for more storm 
organization later today, so if enough convective energy is 
realized there is a marginal risk for severe storms with damaging 
winds the primary concern. Will mention in HWO.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...It should be another active
period of weather in an atmosphere characterized by rich, tropical
moisture and more than sufficient cape for the development of
scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms. Taking into
account the current radar depiction with a weakening thunderstorm
complex combined with model data, it looks like there will be a 
period of decent radar coverage of showers and some thunderstorms 
during the morning followed by a break in the action for part of 
the afternoon. The Mississippi and Ohio Valley upper trough
continues slowly east to a position centered on the Appalachian 
rise by 12z Friday. Organized lift in an unstable environment 
should allow for good coverage of convection across the forecast 
this evening with gradual dissipation from west to east deeper 
into the night. Stayed with slightly moderated max temperatures 
today in the middle 80s with mild overnight lows in the upper 60s 
and lower 70s. 

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...Surface low pressure will
be centered over Delmarva with a trough/front draped across NC 
into N GA to start the period, with a mid/upper shortwave trough 
will be over our area. Southern sections closer to the boundary 
and ahead of the trough axis will have the highest chances of 
showers and storms through the day, with the chances lowering 
through the afternoon as the boundary and trough sink further 
southeast. 

Another shortwave trough and surface cold front approach the area in 
a NW flow aloft on Saturday. Moisture will be limited due to the NW 
flow preceding the system, but lift will be aided by the upper jet 
entrance region moving into E KY/WV. Timing of storms with the front 
will favor higher rain chances in the northern sections late Friday 
night/Sat AM, and southern sections Sat PM. With afternoon 
destabilization and shear higher than usual for this time of year, a 
severe threat may be possible for southern sections Saturday. 

High pressure at the surface and a NW flow aloft will provide a dry 
day with below normal dewpoints for the area on Sunday. A slight 
increase in low level moisture returns Monday as the high shifts to 
our east, with the trend continuing into Wednesday. Rain chances 
Monday through Wednesday will depend on on weak disturbances in the 
NW flow through the mid/upper levels as a broad trough remains over 
the East Coast. Will broad brush low to slight chance PoPs across 
the area each day as  the finer details are uncertain this far out.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Thursday)...Another warm and muggy July
day! Scattered showers and thunderstorms producing very heavy
rainfall in short periods of time. These showers and storms will
persist into the early evening hours with some hanging on into the
night-time hours. Look for patchy fog to develop with some areas
of possibly dense fog particularly along area rivers and lakes.

The slow moving upper trough will translate slowly east putting
our forecast area under southwest flow. Will continue with a
persistence forecast for Thursday. Very little change in the
airmass currently over our region. Therefore, expecting showers
and thunderstorms with locally heavy rain for much of the day. We
are outlooked again by SPC for marginal risk of severe weather. So
a few storms by tomorrow afternoon may approach severe limits.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...A weak low pressure 
and associated boundary will move through the area overnight 
Thursday through Friday morning...with scattered showers and 
thunderstorms possible through mid day Friday. Behind the 
front...flow will shift out of the NW with the cooler and drier air 
filtering in through Friday. PW values drop to around 1.3 to 
1.5...which is around the median average for this time of year. 

Another weak boundary will move through overnight Friday through 
Saturday afternoon. Scattered showers and thunderstorms are possible 
beginning Friday afternoon...though chances are slightly lower than 
Thursday. Models try to keep a cap over the area...so expecting less 
coverage than any day of the previous week for any storms that are 
strong enough to form. Saturday...a few showers and isolated thunder 
could be left in the morning...with clearing expected in the 
afternoon as high pressure builds across the Ohio Valley. 

Sunday through Tuesday afternoon...high pressure will keep skies 
mostly clear and dry weather across the TN Valley. Tuesday 
afternoon...flow shifts to out of the SW bringing an increase in 
moisture and warm air from the Gulf. A low pressure system across 
the Great Lakes will sweep a frontal boundary across the area. 
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are possible Tuesday afternoon 
through Wednesday morning ahead of the front...with widespread 
showers and thunderstorms expected Wednesday afternoon into 
overnight as the frontal boundary moves through the area.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...Moisture content will be
relatively high across the region again in the short term with a
southwest flow continuing off the Gulf of Mexico. Rising motion
due to heating in the buoyant airmass, along with some assistance
from short wave lift ahead of a Mid America upper low should allow
for the formation of scattered showers and thunderstorms both
today and tonight across the Southern Appalachians. It will be
another warm and humid day with highs in the mid and upper 80s
and lows in the upper 60s and lower 70s.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...A low pressure system 
over the Ozarks today will be tracking slowly east, and be over 
west/central KY on Thursday and eastern KY/WV on Thursday night, 
although the GFS and NAM differ on its speed. In either case, the 
850 mb flow increases to 25-30 kts Thursday afternoon/evening, 
continuing into Thursday night. This dynamic forcing in a 
moisture-rich environment warrants likely PoPs for the period, 
particularly in northern sections closer to the surface low. The 
slower NAM delays the mid/upper trough passage into Friday. Will 
keep some chance PoPs going for Friday but the trend will be 
toward lower rain chances through the day.

A northwesterly low to midlevel flow will push a cold front toward 
the area on Saturday. The front will have less moisture to work with 
than we have had lately, but there should be enough instability for 
scattered showers and thunderstorms. 

The models agree in a deepening trough over the Great Lakes and New 
England, which should give the front enough of a push to pass to our 
south Saturday night. With high pressure settling over the Ohio 
Valley and dry air aloft, we should finally see a period of dry 
weather for most of the area on Sunday and Monday, with temperatures 
slightly below normal. Low level moisture begins to creep up again 
on Tuesday as the high shifts off the NC/SC coast, so isolated to 
scattered diurnal convection will return to the forecast.

Southern Appalachians with best chances for showers and storms
over the next couple of hours across NE TN and SW VA. The low-
levels are moist with surface dewpoints ranging from the mid 60s

during the overnight hours but with the elevated moisture across
the area cannot rule out a shower or storm overnight. 
Additionally, patchy fog will be possible tonight but there is 
some weak mixing that should prevent widespread dense fog issues.

There is marginal upper level support but there remains good low
level moisture in place. This may allow a stray storm to reach
strong to marginally severe levels. The main threat will be
strong...gusty winds and localized flooding. Activity will
decrease late evening into the overnight hours. Then on
Wednesday...the next in a line of short waves will move into the
area and this combined once again with diurnal heating will aid
the generation of afternoon shower/thunderstorm activity. Will 
see little chance in the overall air mass...so once again will see
a chance of a few strong to marginally severe storms.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday Night through Tuesday)...Water vapor 
imagery and latest upper air analysis indicates broad troughing 
over the NE US with weak flow aloft across the Mid-South and TN 
Valley. A strong shortwave currently over NE Oklahoma will 
continue to drift NE through Thursday before getting picked up by 
a digging trough across the Ohio Valley. Associated surface 
boundary on Thursday with ample moisture (PWs nearing 1.9 inches) 
and SBCAPE values reaching 2000-3000 J/Kg, could help to support 
some strong to possible severe multicells with localized damaging 
wind gusts. However, greatest threat looks to be potentially heavy
rainfall in the weakly sheared environment combining with a very 
slow moving surface boundary. Given this, the QPF forecast reaches
as high as 1.25 over portions of the area Thursday .

After the front finally moves through on Friday, a few shortwave 
impulses diving into the base of the trough Saturday will continue 
to keep chance POPs in through the day as the low level remains 
fairly moist with dewpoints still into the upper 60s on Saturday. By 
Sunday, dewpoints drop to low 60s and spend the rest of the forecast 
period trying to recover into the middle 60s by late Tuesday. This 
should keep much of the pcpn chances low through Tuesday with 
diurnal activity, and possibly enhanced pcpn chances in higher 
terrain to be expected.

.UPDATE...Updated zone package to remove early morning period.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)... 
Showers ahead of a MCV over west TN will be moving across the area 
this morning. Radar trend shows increasing coverage across N AL, so 
will have categorical PoPs for most areas between 09-15Z. By late 
morning and early afternoon behind this initial wave, we should 
start to see increasing destabilization with a little heating from
breaks in cloud cover. As the circulation center moves into 
Middle TN this afternoon, convection will likely redevelop as 
indicated by the HRRR. Highest chances will probably be in the 
northern half as the circulation tracks east along the TN/KY 
border, but most spots will have likely PoPs during the late 
afternoon/early evening, lowering to a chance after midnight as 
the circulation moves east an instability wanes. The threat of 
severe storms will be low today with cloud cover and morning 
rainfall limiting instability, but some stronger storms could 
produce gusty winds and brief heavy downpours.

.Long Term (Wednesday through Monday)...
A weakening trough over the MS Valley will slowly move east 
Wednesday through Thursday night. Ahead of the boundary...low and 
mid level flow is out of the SW...continuing the moisture and warm
air advection and high dewpoints over the area. Wednesday 
afternoon...lift and plenty of instability will be present for 
scattered diurnal showers and thunderstorms over the area. If 
storms initiate...strong and possible isolated severe storms are 
expected...with damaging downburst winds the main threat. 

Thursday...models disagree on extent of coverage of diurnal showers 
and thunderstorms ahead of the boundary. The atmosphere looks more 
moist...with around 2500 to 3000 j/kg through the afternoon. The 
wind profile looks more unidirectional...though wind speeds are 
generally at or less than 50kts through the lower and mid levels. A 
few of the soundings top at PW values close to 2...which is around 
the 90th percentile average for this time of year. Isolated severe 
storms are possible through the afternoon and early evening 
Thursday...but the main threat looks to be flooding...especially 
with several storms that move over the same area. 

The front is expected to move east of the Appalachians Thursday 
night into Friday morning...with lingering scattered showers and 
isolated thunder possible early Friday morning. Winds in the upper 
levels will then transistion to out of the NW. Friday 
afternoon...with low level winds keeping in warm and moist air...an 
inversion will keep storms slow to form. If any do form...expect the 
severe threat to be limited as instability and mid and upper level 
dry air will keep the storms from gaining strength. 

Friday night through Saturday...a shortwave is expected to move 
through the area. Ample instability is present...but weak 
unidirectional winds remain throughout the atmosphere. Once 
more...expect scattered strong storms possible. Sunday and 
Monday...brief high pressure develops as another trough begins to 
move across the Ohio Valley. Models are holding on to enough dry air 
and stability to keep storms out of the forecast.

.AVIATION...
Showers will be crossing the area SW to NE this morning, bringing
MVFR to IFR conditions to all sites. Conditions should improve in
the late morning/early afternoon hours before additional storms
develop in the mid to late afternoon. Timing and flight categories
of this second round of storms is uncertain, but TRI is expected 
to have greater coverage of storms in the area compared to TYS and
CHA. Thus a TEMPO will be mentioned at TRI late in the day, with
VCTS elsewhere. Rain chances drop sharply after midnight, and as
has been the case the past few nights, fog and low cigs will be a
possibility again.

.AVIATION...
Based on surface obs and satellite, patchy fog is developing
across the area, particularly near TRI and CHA. However, an upper
level disturbance is approaching from the west, which will start
to bring increasing clouds and numerous showers to the area 
around 8-9Z, which should prevent vis from falling too far at CHA.
With a lower chance of showers, TRI is more likely to see low vis
tonight, probably in the LIFR range. Showers should exit the area
by noon, with additional scattered storms (VCTS) expected to
develop in the mid to late afternoon.

outside of storms will become IFR/MVFR at all TAF sites early 
Tuesday morning due to fog/low-cloud development.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...Overall...should see a rather
active short term. Diurnal thunderstorms ongoing across the area
late this afternoon should diminish this evening. However...a
decaying band of showers and thunderstorms over middle TN is
approaching the area and will keep some convection going into the
evening hours. Then another round of showers/thunderstorms is
expect Tuesday morning as the short wave pushes through the area.
By Tuesday afternoon...should see additional diurnal convection
develop. A few storms may become strong or marginally severe and
with PWs around an inch to an inch and a half... localized
flooding is also possible. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday Night through Monday)...Broad middle level 
trough is currently over the Northeast US with two well defined 
shortwaves: one over eastern Arkansas, the other over northern 
Kansas. These two shortwaves will slowly push eastward over the 
next few days. This, coupled with persistent dew points into the 
lower 70s will lead to a continued period of unsettled weather 
across the area through Saturday.

Slightly lower POPs are expected on Wednesday as area falls into 
weak ridging between first shortwave then to the east, and the 
second deepening shortave over West TN at that time. As this second 
shortwave deepens, it will merge with northern jet stream energy and 
ride NE across KY and OH through Friday. This allows for increasing 
POPs again, particularly over the northern half of the area, by 
Thursday night before the associated surface front pushes east of 
the area on Saturday. 

Some drying and less active weather is expected behind this front 
Sunday and Monday as the middle level trough axis pushes along/just 
east of the area and dew points slip back into the upper 50s to low 
60s in spots by Sunday. 

Up through Saturday, guidance is in fair agreement on timing, 
coverage and pcpn amounts. Between GFS, Canadian, and ECMWF on 
Sunday-Monday, the ECMWF is an outlier, wanting to hang onto pcpn 
across the area through Sunday. At present, trended toward the 
consensus of GFS and Canadian with a little drier fcst for Sunday 
and Monday.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
A moist environment remains across the area today, however we will
not have the forcing to aid in thunderstorm development that we
have had in the past few days. Weak instability appears fairly 
uniform across the area this afternoon, and the models differ in
their depictions of where most of the activity will be. The
forecast will favor the SREF, HRRR, and RAP depictions, which 
all generally favor the mountains and SW NC for showers and 
storms today. Will have likely PoPs in those areas, with chance
PoPs in the Valley and Plateau areas. Most activity will diminsh
with sunset, but we will have a MCV approaching from the west,
associated with the ongoing activity in AR. As a result, PoPs will
rise into the chance range again for the Plateau and southern 
Valley late tonight.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...
Persistence pays in the extended forecast, with upper ridging 
over the western states and troughing over the eastern U.S. 
keeping unsettled, warm, and humid summertime weather in place 
through the week. We are still expecting the long-advertised 
shortwave trough and surface front to impact the area Thursday 
afternoon and night, with a second frontal system driving through 
the area Saturday and scouring out the diurnal convection for 
early in the upcoming week. But we currently have an MCS over the 
southern plains whose remnant MCV is progged to move over our area
during Tuesday, which will bump up rain chances then. So in all, 
we have three weather systems roughly 48 hours apart, arriving 
Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Meaning, there is a chance that 
Mother Nature will contribute to the 4th's fireworks displays.

.AVIATION...
With the plentiful low level moisture that is in place, some 
reduction of vis and cigs seems likely, although confidence on
which flight category each TAF site will end up in is low. The
TAFs will follow a general trend of increasing low clouds at CHA
and TYS, mainly MVFR but with CHA having periods of IFR due to
earlier rainfall. Satellite shows midlevel clouds increasing in
northern Middle and East TN, which should move into TRI, making
low vis and cigs there less likely. With sunrise, all sites will
return to VFR, with scattered afternoon showers and thunderstorms
possible.

essentially dissipated. Will keep a slight chance of showers
across the southern half of the valley since a weak boundary
remains there. Main concern will be the extent of fog development
overnight. Some locally dense fog is possible.

.Aviation...Scattered convection will be near the TYS/CHA through 
03Z this evening. For tonight, IFR/MVFR conditions will once again 
redevelop at all TAF sites due to low stratus clouds and fog. Low 
clouds will lift in the morning Monday. Plenty of moisture and 
instability in the afternoon along with a weak boundary over the 
Tennessee Valley will produce scattered convection. Will continue 
including vincity TS at each TAF site.

Surface pressure gradient will remain very weak so winds will be 
weak as well, except near convection.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Monday)...
The cold front that was to the northwest Saturday has about
dissipated but a moisture boundary across middle Tennessee into
southeast Tennessee and some weak shortwave energy riding from
west to east was setting off scattered showers and thunderstorms
mainly across the southern third of east Tennessee at mid
afternoon and holding temperatures down into the 70s on the
plateau. The storms were moving very slowly southeast with parts
of Sequatchie County getting locally heavy rainfall of around one
to two inches in the last couple hours with flash flooding a 
threat through the afternoon. The same areas will see more showers
and storms through early evening possibly moving into the northern
Plateau and central valley by early evening. Storms end around
sunset about like yesterday with more scattered activity in the 
afternoon reaching farther north across central east Tennessee. 
Lows tonight and highs Monday similar to todays upper 60s to near
70 tonight and highs Monday in the mid to upper 80s.
 
.LONG TERM...(Monday Night through Sunday)...
Will remain in an unsettled weather pattern for much of the 
extended. Through Wendesday...a series of short waves will track 
through the upper flow. With decent moisture in place...expect to 
see a chance of showers and thunderstorms each day...especially 
diurnally driven convection. Models still on track to bring a 
weakening frontal boundary through around Thursday. This should 
provide us with our best chance of an organized band of 
thunderstorms. May see some lingering showers into Friday though 
much of the area should remain dry. Model differences continue to 
increase throughout the extended and by the weekend consistency is
rather poor. Though confidence low...the current model runs trend
towards bringing a secondary boundary through on Saturday for 
another chance of thunderstorms. Drier air is expected to push in 
behind this system for Sunday. May see a few lingering showers but
generally should have a shot at a dry day.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
A vort max over AR will be tracking east across northern MS/AL/GA
through the day. With abundant low level moisture in place, 
scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop ahead of the vort 
max and move east across our central and southern sections this 
afternoon. Instability is fairly weak and shear is virtually nil, 
so the chance of severe storms is low. A few of the stronger 
storms could produce wind gusts of 40-50 mph. Northern sections
may see isolated storms at best as the forecast sounding at TRI is
more stable and will not have the vort max to enhance lift.
Convection should be mainly diurnally driven, and the vort max
will be to our east after 03Z, so tonight will have no PoP after
midnight.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...
No changes of substance to the previous thinking. Upper ridging 
over the western states and troughing over the eastern U.S. will 
keep unsettled weather with mostly diurnal convection through the 
week. Still expecting a frontal system late Thursday to bring some
increase and organization to the convection. A second frontal 
system will be driven through the area Saturday, with additional 
frontal convection. This front may actually scour out the moisture
and result in some dry days early in week two, but that is beyond
our timeframe for now. Temperatures will run at or slightly 
warmer than normal, and continued humid.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...
Showers and thunderstorms are becoming widespread at mid 
afternoon across southeast Tennessee and the southern plateau with
heavy rainfall a threat for many of the stronger storms. A half 
inch per hour is likely in most of the stronger storms with one 
inch possible over the extreme southern valley and plateau late 
this afternoon and early evening. Isolated storms still expected 
to produce some strong winds of 50 to 60 mph the next few hours. A
few warnings may be needed until sunset. Will continue high rain 
chances to sunset for all except southwest Virginia. Weak 
shortwave energy ahead of the cold front combined with more 
heating today and moderate instability is contributing to the 
storms. Before the storms temperatures warmed into the mid 80s to 
near 90 which helped the storms develop. Storms will gradually 
decrease this evening and likely end around 04-06Z. The locally 
heavy rains will allow for some patchy dense fog to form. On 
Sunday the front will move into the Forecast Area and become 
nearly stationary near east central Tennessee. Will continue low 
pops north and chance pops south. Lows tonight still mild in the 
lower 70s and highs Sunday in the 80s. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday Night through Saturday)...
Will continue to transition into an active weather pattern for 
the extended. Models in reasonable agreement with the overall 
weather pattern but there remains poor consistency in details. The
basic pattern shows a series of short waves tracking through the 
region Sunday night through Wednesday. There continues to be 
differences in timing and track of each wave but this scenario 
should provide a chance of showers and thunderstorms to the area 
each day. Model consistency decreases late in the period and 
confidence is low. However... around the Thursday time 
frame...models are trending towards bringing in a weakening 
frontal boundary into the area. This should provide us with a bit 
better chance of organized convection. A few showers may linger 
into Friday. On Saturday...the trough axis moves through for a 
continued chance of convection.

.DISCUSSION...
Temperatures are heating up late this morning already into the
lower 80s with a few showers occurring during the mid to late 
morning across northeast Tennessee. Still looks like an active day
this afternoon as scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms
develop with a few storms becoming severe mid afternoon to early 
evening. Latest thinking is scattered thunderstorms will begin
developing across middle Tennessee and possibly plateau counties 
then becoming more organized and moving east late afternoon and 
early evening. MLCAPE values per SPC outlook from 500-1000 J/KG
across east Tennessee with 20-30 KT 500 MB flow and nearly 
unidirectional wind profiles. Slight risk for severe storms south 
of I-40 with isolated severe wind gusts and large hail from mid 
afternoon to shortly after sunset. The storms should be outflow 
dominant and could form into bows and possibly a few supercells 
early. Heavy rainfall is also a threat in southeast Tennessee with
an inch possible in stronger storms. Latest NAM model suggest 
storms will start about 18Z and last until about 03Z...possibly 
much longer across extreme southern Tennessee.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Showers and storms across Ern KY and the Cumberland Plateau are
associated with a shortwave trough that will cross our northern
sections early this morning. Instability is sufficient to maintain
these storms as they track east, as surface dewpoints are near 
70 ahead of the storms. Projecting its movement takes precip to 
our eastern border around 12Z. Through the rest of the morning, 
most locations will stay dry until the afternoon when the MCV 
associated with convection in AR will reignite storms in Middle TN
and Nrn AL. MLCAPE values in our southern sections will be near 
2500 J/kg according to the NAM, and midlevel dry air will support 
a threat of strong downbursts with bow segments. Time frame for a 
severe threat appears to be 4 pm to 8 pm, based on NAM and HRRR, 
with the central and southern Valley having the best chances of 
strong to severe storms. Stabilization behind the convection and 
lowering 850 mb theta-e in a NW flow should bring an end to precip
in our area by midnight.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...
Expecting a fairly persistent weather pattern with ridging over 
the western U.S. and troughing over the eastern U.S., although the
troughing will be weaker over the southeastern states as compared
to the Great Lakes region and the northeast. Much of the period 
will be characterized by humid conditions and mostly diurnal 
convection across our forecast area. However, early next week, a 
slow moving trough/weak cutoff low over the Plains will gradually 
reach the Ohio Valley late Wednesday before finally ejecting 
northeastward, helping to usher a cold front through our area that
may provide the highest POPS of the week on Thursday. The muggy 
conditions next week will be accompanied by temperatures that will
be at or a little warmer than normal.

.DISCUSSION...Satellite shows a good deal of mid-level drying
across the region allowing cloud cover to become partly
cloudy/mostly clear. Another short-wave is moving across the
Ohio/Tennessee valleys with a line of convection over central
Kentucky.

Latest meso-analysis shows air-mass remains fairly unstable over
middle Tennessee, so expect scattered storms to re-fire there this
evening/early morning. This convection will move into east
Tennessee/southwest Virginia. Will keep chance of showers and
thunderstorms through the morning.

Besides the convection, plenty of radiation cooling due to loss of
clouds, calm winds and plenty of boundary layer moisture will
allow patchy fog to develop.

are expected to develop ahead of the front with Cape values of
1000 to 2000 J/KG by late in the day. High winds will be the main
threat in the strongest storms. The GFS shows more widespread 
showers and storms developing and continuing all day with the NAM
showing more of a break early Friday with storms developing later
and becoming stronger with the potential for more heating. 
Strongest storms move in from mid afternoon to sunset. Lows 
tonight upper 60s to lower 70s. Will follow closer to warmer NAM 
with highs lower to mid 80s...possibly upper 80s at Chattanooga. 
Rainfall amounts should be around one half to one inch but 
possibly higher in strong storms.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday Night through Friday)...
Models in decent agreement early in the extended. The overall 
weather pattern brings a weakening frontal boundary through the 
area around the Saturday evening time frame. There does remain 
some differences in timing of the frontal passage...but the 
extended should begin with a band of convection ongoing over the 
general area. The air mass should be weak to moderately unstable 
and expect little upper level support but low level moisture 
should be good. As a result...a few storms may become strong to 
marginally severe. The boundary will stall generally south and 
east of the area but may still allow isolated to scattered 
convection to move in on Sunday. Model consistency decreases 
significantly for the rest of the period and confidence is low. 
The overall pattern shows a series of short waves tracking through
the region Monday through Friday but timing...track and strength 
of these features quite different model to model and run to run. 
Therefore...the basic scenario is a rather active and wet period 
with a chance of convection each day.

.DISCUSSION...
Southerly flow continues with Upper level ridging to the east and
southeast and broad upper trough over northern Great Lakes and
northern Plains States this morning. A cold front ahead of the
trough from the Central Plains southwest to west Texas was moving
slowly east southeast. Abundant Gulf moisture was being lifted
north into the eastern Tennessee Valley producing showers over 
the southern half of the area. Instability was weak so far but 
will increase in the afternoon and allow for some thunderstorms to
develop. Extreme north and northwest sections of the area will be
on the edge of the more concentrated precipitation area so will 
have lower rain chances. Best rain chances will be across the 
eastern half of the area especially the higher mountains. Heaviest
rainfall should occur across southeast Tennessee mountains and in
southwest North Carolina...possibly one half to one inch there 
today. Update already sent.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
A southerly low to mid level flow is transporting abundant Gulf 
moisture into the region this morning, while a shortwave trough sits 
across AL. Orographic lift has led to rain increasing across the 
mountains, and showers across northern AL/GA will spread into the 
southern Valley this morning. Central and northern sections will 
have just light rain initially due to downslope winds but the 850 mb 
flow shifts more SW by late morning. The eastern half of the area 
will have the highest rain chances and QPF today as the shortwave 
trough slowly moves east. Forcing with the trough is fairly weak, so 
will have just a chance of thunderstorms mentioned, but PW values 
near 2 inches could result in locally heavy rain and potentially 
minor flooding if cells train over the same locations. 

The shortwave trough will be to our east by 00Z Sat, with midlevel 
drying behind it. PoPs will drop back to a slight chance as a 
result, but the NAM shows the remnants of the MCS currently in KS/MO 
at our doorstep late tonight. Will increase PoPs late tonight in the 
Plateau into the chance range to account for this scenario.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...
At the beginning of this period, we will be in a fairly busy pattern 
with a broad upper trough over the middle parts of the U.S. while 
within this feature a shortwave trough and weak cold front will be 
washing through the area on Saturday and/or Saturday night.  The 
front is difficult to follow, due to the lee trough that forms east 
of the Appalachians that induces our winds to veer significantly on 
Saturday.  This results in a westerly direction and little focus 
along the front. We could see MLCAPE values of 1500 - 2000 J/kg 
Saturday, but timing of the shortwave will be a key factor as well. 
NAM has it racing through with much of the lift getting east of the 
area by max heating, but most models are not that fast. It looks 
like the frontal boundary will settle/stall south of the area for 
Sunday, keeping the main precip chances south of us. 

After this we will have only marginal coverage of showers and storms 
for a few days as little in the way of organized lift comes across 
the area, but it is also somewhat chaotic because of the lack of 
agreement between models on locations and timing of the northward 
lifting of the old frontal boundary, deep moisture, and organized 
lift.  Toward the end of the forecast, there is agreement that 
another shortwave will be approaching or moving through the area, so 
higher POPs are in the forecast for Thursday.

Conditions will be on a downward trend overnight as moisture
spreads into East TN from the south. MVFR cigs have already
developed at CHA, and showers will likely bring MVFR vis as well
later tonight. A southerly downslope flow will maintain VFR
conditions at TYS and TRI for most of the night, but a shift of
winds aloft to SW and showers tracking north should bring MVFR vis
and cigs to both sites in the morning hours. Scattered afternoon
showers and thunderstorms may continue, and will mention VCTS at

especially early and again late with better instability. Very 
difficult to pin down details of cigs/vis in this pattern. Expect 
to see conditions worsen, and will take all sites to MVFR levels

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...
Skies have become partly cloudy northeast and mostly cloudy south
with a few showers over the southeast part of the region. 
Temperatures have warmed into the lower to mid 80s with a few 
locations in the upper 80s. Dew points have warmed into the mid to
upper 60s south but upper 50s to lower 60s still northeast. Ridge
of high pressure over the east coast Carolinas is holding pretty 
strong for tonight and Friday with southerly flow to continue. 
However moistening up of air mass continues this evening with 
showers and a few thunderstorms southeast Tennessee and southwest 
North Carolina this evening. Shortwave energy moving north from 
the Gulf later tonight should increase shower activity after 
midnight and continue through the day Friday. Showers and storms 
will be more numerous Friday and with increased cloud cover highs 
will be several degrees cooler in the northern sections. Some 
locally heavy rainfall possible over southeast Tennessee mountains
and southwest North Carolina.

.LONG TERM...(Friday Night through Thursday)...
Overall...will remain in a rather wet weather pattern throughout
the extended. Friday night through Saturday a cold front will 
slowly push across the region. The air mass will be weakly 
unstable and with good moisture and decent lift associated with 
the frontal passage... should see one to two rounds of showers and
thunderstorms spread across the area. The boundary should slow or
stall generally south and east of the region for Sunday and allow
a continued chance of convection. Currently...Monday looks like 
our best shot at a dry day...but an approaching weak short wave 
may provide some isolated convection. Through the rest of the 
extended...will see a series of short waves move through. Models 
in poor agreement with details but overall...expect a chance of 
showers and thunderstorms each day.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Moisture will continue to slowly stream back into the forecast
area today under southerly flow, and a shortwave trough over the 
Gulf coast will move northeastward toward the area. Cloud cover
will increase from south to north ahead of this system today. Showers
and thunderstorms will develop in the daytime heating this
afternoon/evening, with the highest probabilities across southeast
Tennessee and southwest North Carolina. High temperatures today
will hold in the lower 80s across the south with more cloud cover
and rise into the mid to upper 80s further north where more
sunshine will be seen. Shower and thunderstorm chances will taper
off a bit after sunset with the loss of daytime heating as the 
atmosphere stabilizes. However, as the shortwave feature nears the
area overnight, showers and thunderstorms remain possible across 
southern and central portions of the forecast area. With more 
cloud cover, lows tonight will stay quite mild, with temperatures 
in the mid 60s to near 70. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
At the start of the period southwest flow and deep moisture (PW's
from 1.75 to 2.0) will be over the forecast area coupled with a 
shortwave translating across Alabama and Georgia. Increasing 
chances of showers and thunderstorms will spread from the southern
TN Valley northward by mid morning and persist into early Friday 
evening. There should be a window overnight Friday that will be 
drier but that will be short lived.

A broad trough over the central Plains/Ohio Valley will push a cold 
front slowly into the region Saturday. Model consistency increases 
confidence for having numerous showers and thunderstorms Saturday 
and Saturday night. Precipitation chances for Sunday will depend on 
the position of the frontal boundary but could prove wet 
particularly during the afternoon. 

Much drier on Monday due to more stable air over the region and 
southeasterly (downslope) winds. However, warm and muggy conditions 
will begin late Monday. By Independence Day, afternoon scattered 
showers and thunderstorms will be possible as the atmosphere becomes 
a little more unstable. Tuesday afternoon heat index values will 
range from near 95 in Chattanooga to near 88 degrees.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tomorrow)...
High pressure will move to the east resulting in southerly flow
and moisture return to the region tonight and Thursday. May have
some patchy fog around the usual rivers and lakes late tonight, 
but it is not expected to be widespread or dense. A shortwave 
trough over LA and MS will eject northeastward toward the region 
with cloud cover increasing ahead of this feature. Chances of 
showers and thunderstorms will increase on Thursday with the 
highest probabilities during the afternoon across southeast 
Tennessee and southwest North Carolina. The additional cloud cover
should act to keep high temperatures a couple of degrees below 
guidance across southeast Tennessee and southwest North Carolina. 
There will be less cloud cover across northeast Tennessee and 
southwest North Carolina which should allow temperatures to warm 
into the mid to upper 80s.


.LONG TERM (Thursday Night through Wednesday)...
At the beginning of this period the area will be almost in a 
zonal flow aloft, while at the surface the return flow of moisture
regime has already started. At that time the closest front will 
be a cold front well to the north and northwest stretching from 
the Great Lakes to the Central Plains. By Saturday, the upper 
trough in the Plains will be amplifying, the cold front will be 
getting closer to the area, and moisture levels will be much 
higher with PW values over in the 1.5 to 1.8 inch range across the
area. 

By Sunday the scenario gets more difficult to discern as the models 
diverge on their solutions--however, what is agreed upon is that the 
front will be very close to the region, but the overall wind field 
will be weak and with a westerly component. So although if the 
front is in the general area, it may be a focus for thunderstorm 
development, but it does not look like there will be much of a 
threat for organized strong storms or even organized flooding 
rains. 
 
For Temps and mugginess--looks like it will start feeling more like 
Summer again as we get into the weekend, but for Sun, Mon, Tue it 
looks like the warmup may be tempered somewhat 1) if the front 
passes and gets slightly cooler air into the area and/or 2) with 
more clouds and the general troughiness/lift over the area will 
suppress temps from getting really hot--populated superblend temps 
look good overall--went about 1 deg cooler for Tmax Mon and Tue. 

The best chance for organize storms looks to be Saturday and 
Saturday evening while the wind field is still more favorable, 
however, the focus for this activity may be west and north of our 
areas, but we could see the tail-end of that convection as it moves 
east. Once again, by Sunday the wind field looks much weaker.

.DISCUSSION...
High pressure remains in control today with abundant sunshine.
High temperatures today should be generally about 5 deg F warmer 
than yesterday as the trough axis moves east and ridging builds in
with warming 850mb temperatures. For these reasons, made a few 
minor adjustments to temperatures to account for forecast and 
observational trends. High pressure moves east of the region late
today and tonight resulting in southerly winds and increasing
moisture. Any rain chances should hold off until late tonight or
early Thursday across southern portions of the forecast area.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Sunny and dry today with high pressure remaining in control
overhead. With lows this morning dropping well into the 50s, some
patchy morning fog is possible along rivers, lakes, and other
bodies of water. This will quickly burn off as temperatures climb
after sunrise. The record low at TRI is 50 for today, and with 
the temperature sitting at 52 as of 3am, there's a good chance we 
will get within a degree of tying or breaking it.

Highs today will be slightly below normal for this time 
of year, ranging from the upper 70s to lower 80s with abundant
sunshine and fairly low humidity. As the center of the surface 
high shifts east overnight, moisture from the Gulf will slowly 
work its way into the area, gradually increasing cloud cover from 
the south. With more moisture present, lows tonight will remain a 
bit warmer, staying in the 60s across much of the forecast area.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...Surface high pressure off 
the North Carolina coast will lose its drying influence on the 
forecast area. Look for increasing low level moisture and higher 
humidity as southerly winds increase. Shortwave ejecting out of 
central AL picked up by GFS and SREF models bringing highest PoPs to 
the southern TN Valley by Thursday afternoon waning by mid-evening. 

Another round of showers and thunderstorms looks like a good bet by 
Friday afternoon. These will likely be scattered thunderstorms 
typical of summer-like weather given the higher moisture levels. The 
best rain chances come Saturday ahead of a deeper trough and 
associated cold front. Should briefly become drier Sunday and 
Monday...with increasing chances of showers and thunderstorms by 
Independence Day.

No changes are necessary to the forecast this evening. High

with an unseasonably dry air mass over the region. Lows will be
mostly in the 50s, and near 60 around CHA. The record low at TRI

258 PM EDT Tue Jun 27 2017

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Thursday)...Fair weather will mark
most of the short term period. Cool and dry tonight thanks to a
weak frontal passage. But abundant sunshine and fairly low 
humidity will result in warmer temperatures Wednesday afternoon. 
The Bermuda High will bring increased humidity back into the 
region for Thursday, resulting in scattered afternoon showers and
thunderstorms to east Tennessee and southwest NC.

.LONG TERM (Thursday Night through Tuesday)...Models continue to 
be in fair agreement overall, although still differ in the details
especially later in the period. Forecast confidence is near to 
slightly below average for this time of year. With the low level 
southwesterly flow early in the period, moisture will be 
increasing. Expect scattered convection on Friday especially in 
the afternoon. By Saturday a weak cold front will be sagging 
closer to the area. Most likely scenario is that this front stalls
to our north. However, with the front moving closer and some weak
short wave energy likely moving across, looks like Saturday may 
have the highest probability for showers and thunderstorms of the 
period. Will go with likely PoPs all areas Saturday. Models 
disagree on how much deep layer drying there will be for 
Sunday/Monday, but low levels at least should remain moist so will
keep scattered convection in the forecast for both days. Tuesday 
still problematic as some models hint at another short wave 
affecting the area, but features that weak are unlikely to be 
handled well that far out. For now will keep chance PoPs all areas
for Independence Day. Temperatures are forecast to not be far 
from normal for this time of year.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A weak short-wave will move
quickly across the Tennessee Valley this morning/early afternoon.
Moisture is limited with PWs generally less than 1 inch. Also,
instability is very limited. Will include sprinkles area-wide for
this morning, but feel chances of measurable rain is limited.

After wave passes early this afternoon, clouds will dissipate
giving way to clear sky this evening. For tonight, clear sky and
calm winds. Steam fog develop is expected near area lakes and 
streams.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...Surface high pressure 
shifts off the Atlantic Coast early in the extended period, opening 
up our forecast area to more moist air flowing in from the Gulf. By 
Thursday afternoon, enough moisture and instability will be overhead 
to trigger some scattered afternoon convection across the southern 
Tennessee Valley. With continued moisture flow, more coverage of 
showers and thunderstorms are expected Friday afternoon. For the 
upcoming weekend, a weak cold front will approach the forecast area. 
This front will stall out across the Ohio Valley for the weekend and 
a weak shortwave will ripple along the frontal boundary, bringing a 
continued chance for showers and thunderstorms through the weekend. 
The stalled front to our north will continue to help channel moist, 
unstable air into the MRX forecast area for early next week, 
resulting in chance-slight chance scattered showers and 
thunderstorms again on Monday afternoon. Temperatures will be near 
normal for the extended forecast period, with highs in the 80s and 
overnight lows in the 60s.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Wednesday)...A shortwave in the NW
flow aloft will drag along a weak surface cold front with it as 
it moves through the region Tuesday morning. Isolated to scattered
showers are possible mainly between 06z and 18Z, with fairly 
rapid clearing expected during Tuesday afternoon. Clear and dry 
weather is expected Tuesday night and Wednesday. The comfortable 
temperatures we have enjoyed today will repeat again on Tuesday 
before seasonably summertime temperatures return for Wednesday. 

.LONG TERM (Wednesday Night through Monday)...Models in decent 
agreement overall, although still differences in the details. 
Forecast confidence is about average for this time of year. With 
surface high pressure shifting to our east moisture will increase 
early in the period. Still some uncertainty about how quickly 
moisture/instability will increase, but for now looks like 
isolated to scattered afternoon convection can be expected all but
northeast areas Thursday afternoon. Friday looks like there 
should be a bit more coverage of mainly afternoon convection, then
a weak cold front is forecast to sag toward the area during the 
weekend. It is unclear how far south this front will make it 
before stalling, but it may not make it into our area. However, 
the combination of the approaching front and some possible short 
wave energy should bring more showers and thunderstorms for the 
weekend. Still some scattered convection expected on Monday as not
significant drying forecast. Temperatures are expected to be 
fairly close to normal for much of the period.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Westerly flow aloft will pull
periods of cloud (variable cloudiness) cover across the Tennessee
Valley/southern Appalachians. An area of mid-level clouds across 
the mid- mississippi Valley will move across the region today. 
Overall PWs remain low with dewpoints in the 50s. Will trend lower
than guidance maximum temperatures for today due to the clouds.

For tonight, periods of clouds will continue, but as a fast moving
wave approaches the area models show increasing isentropic lift.
Sprinkles/light rain will pull into the region. Measurable
rainfall chances are low since moisture and lift remains limited.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday night)...A weak 
boundary...from an upper level trough located over the Great 
Lakes...will swing through the area from late morning through the 
afternoon. With NW flow in place for several days...and continued 
NW flow through the day...moisture should be limited. GFS is most 
optimistic for rain with PW values around 1.00 to 1.25...which is 
still less than 25th percentile of the average for this time of 
year. Upper level divergence is present though...so have kept in 
chance precip chances...mainly in NE TN where the forcing is the 
greatest. Confidence is low on any rainfall accumulations of more 
than a couple of hundreths of an inch. 

High pressure then develops Wednesday over the SE states. This high 
pressure will move to the SE...transitioning low and mid level winds 
to out of the SE. Moisture and warm air advection will set up 
through the rest of the extended. Thursday and Friday...diurnal 
showers and thunderstorms are possible each day...with the greatest 
coverage on Friday. Winds will be weak with moderate instability. 
The greatest threats with these storms will be strong downburst 
winds and large hail...though no severe weather is expected. 

Saturday and Sunday...another low pressure system moving across the 
Ohio Valley will bring a front through the area. Rain chances will 
increase through the late morning and early afternoon Saturday ahead 
of this front...with scattered showers and thunderstorms expected to 
increase in coverage into the late afternoon. Sunday...widespread 
showers and thunderstorms are possible across the area as the front 
moves through. Models keep the front moving slowly...almost stalling 
out over the area...with PW values around 1.9...which is in the 90th 
percentile for climatology. Winds are expected to be parallel to the 
front...which means storms could train over the same 
area...producing high rainfall accumulation totals.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Monday)...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate a
longwave trough across the eastern 2/3rds of the CONUS with 
westerly flow aloft across the forecast area. Seeing a few echoes 
showing up currently on radar across SW NC and extreme SE TN. The 
atmosphere is relatively dry with PW values ranging from 0.8-1.0 
inches and not seeing much more than sprinkles making it to the 
ground. In addition the clouds associated with the radar echoes 
are 10-15 kft. The mid to high cloud have hung on much longer 
today than forecast thanks to a strong 100-120 kt jet across the 
Ohio River Valley that extends into New England. This jet has put 
the forecast are in the favored right entrance region with just 
enough moisture for widespread mid to high clouds. These clouds 
will continue to clear this afternoon and evening as the jet lifts
out to the northeast. 

A cool and dry airmass will settle across the region tonight. PW 
values will drop further into the 0.5-0.7 inch range. These values 
are actually near the minimum readings observed for late June. This 
drier airmass will also feature cooler than average lows with 
temperatures on Monday morning in the 50s areawide. Lows in the 
upper 40s are forecast in the higher elevations. 

Dry conditions will continue on Monday as another upper level jet 
rotates around the base of the longwave trough. Expect an increase 
in high clouds throughout the day. Highs will be below normal once 
again with temperatures in the mid 70s to low 80s. 

.LONG TERM (Monday Night through Sunday)...

Strong ridge of high pressure over the western U.S. will flatten 
mid-week, allowing some shortwaves into the northern U.S. that 
will push a frontal boundary south of the Ohio Valley late week. 
But the flattened western ridge will also allow the Bermuda High 
to reassert itself over the eastern Atlantic, which will bring 
higher dewpoints into our region by late week. The northern front 
will interact with the southern moisture to result in scattered 
convection from late week through the weekend across our area. 
Overall, temperatures will hover near normal.

.DISCUSSION...

A longwave trough extends across the eastern 2/3rds of the CONUS
with westerly flow aloft across the Southern Appalachians. A few
weak echos showing up on radar south of I-40. PW values are
currently around 0.8-1.0 inches which is around the 10th-25th
percentile for late June. The forecast area is in the entrance
region of a strong 100-120 kt jet that extends across the Ohio
River Valley into New England. With the drier air in place, this
is just leading to widespread mid and high cloud across the
region. Due to this, increased the cloud cover throughout the
remainder of the morning and into the early afternoon. Clouds
should decrease throughout the afternoon as the jet lifts out to
the northeast. Also, with the lack of moisture, expect just a few
sprinkles will be possible south of I-40 over the next couple of 
hours or so.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Dry westerly flow aloft with PWs
less than 1 inch through the period. Satellite shows a good deal
of high and some mid-level clouds moving across the Tennessee
Valley. These clouds will produce partly sunny conditions this
morning, but model soundings shows the higher level moisture
moving out this afternoon/evening.

Surface ridging will also be the main feature with low dewpoints
advecting into the region allowing temperatures to drop into the
50s Sunday night.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday night)...An upper level 
trough will move across the Ohio Valley...keeping NW flow over the
area through the middle of the work week. Sunny skies and cooler 
than normal temperatures will be present Monday through Tuesday. A
weak boundary will approach the area on Tuesday. Models are 
showing plenty of dry air throughout the sounding...but there is 
weak divergence aloft provided by the jet streak in the upper 
levels. With the lack of moisture...confidence is low on seeing 
anything other than very light scattered showers...if 
any...Tuesday afternoon. Wednesday looks dry as high pressure 
develops and begins to move eastward. 

By Wednesday evening...low and mid level flow has transitioned to 
out of the SW...bringing moisture and warm air advection to the 
area. By Thursday afternoon...diurnal showers and thunderstorms are 
possible...mainly in areas south of I40 where the best moisture and 
warm air advection will be located. Friday...the entire area will 
have a chance for diurnal showers and thunderstorms. Wind profile is 
weak...so any threats in the storms would include damaging wind and 
large hail. But for now...no severe weather is expected. A front 
approaches the area for the end of the work week...so have left in 
scattered showers and thunderstorms ahead of the front Saturday 
through Saturday night.

245 PM EDT Sat Jun 24 2017

.SHORT TERM...
A cold front moves to our east tonight with high pressure building
in. Drier air and thinning clouds will lead to overnight low
temperatures slightly below average. There could be some patchy
fog in localized sheltered valleys tonight where winds will be 
calm and soil moisture is high, but widespread fog is unlikely
with light winds and dry air keeping the boundary layer lightly mixed.
Sunshine should be prevalent on Sunday, but troughing across the 
Eastern U.S. should keep temperatures cooler than average in the 
short term.

.LONG TERM...
We will continue with calm weather with the drier northwest flow 
and slight troughing in the mid levels. ECMWF wants to show a weak
shortwave zip across the region on Tuesday bringing in 
precipitation to our northern counties, but the other long term 
models are not depicting this at this time. Will go with a slight 
chance of precipitation on Tuesday, but still expect most 
locations to not see rain for several days.

Surface high pressure will move from west to east over the area 
during the week helping to continue the clearer skies and warmer 
temperatures for the second half of the week when the high is 
situated right over us. Towards the end of the work week and into 
the weekend the high will move far enough off the eastern seaboard 
that we will start to get more moisture rich air from the Gulf of 
Mexico. This combined with temperatures right around normal for this 
time of year will allow for some diurnally driven showers and 
thunderstorms to develop. Determining exact location of these 
diurnally driven storms is a bit difficult at this time, so have 
gone with widespread precipitation chances over the area over the 
weekend even though many places might not see rain at all during 
this entire 7-day forecast.

.DISCUSSION...
Forecast is largely on track as a cold front continues to move across
the area. Should continue to see drier air filter in and 
decreasing clouds from northwest to southeast during the 
afternoon. However, lingering low-level moisture and a slight 
upslope component to low-level flow may lead to a few showers and 
clouds remaining around the mountains this afternoon. Made some 
slight adjustments to PoPs to reflect current showers and 
potential development later today across southeast Tennessee and 
southwest North Carolina. Also updated dew points to reflect 
current observations and trends through the day as the front 
slowly moves to the southeast.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Latest surface analysis and radar data shows Cindy remnants now
into southern West Virginia. Cold front currently located across
Middle TN will move into the area this morning. RAP13/HRRR models
persistent with solution of increasing showers/thunderstorms
moving across the Plateau and into East Tennessee during the
morning hours today. This is further supported with latest radar
trends which indicate increasing shower activity, and some
lightning activity, along the boundary east of Nashville at this
hour. Model consensus is for this activity to push through the
area by afternoon with high pressure building into the area this
evening. The dry air associated with this front remains well to
the west over Illinois and Missouri this morning. With the dry air
finally filtering in overnight Saturday, we can expect to see
overnight lows about 4-6 degrees below normal by Sunday morning.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...
An upper level trough will swing across the Ohio Valley Sunday 
through Tuesday night. NW flow will remain through Tuesday...with 
mostly clear skies and dry weather. Temperatures Sunday will start
off several degrees below normal. With a gradual warming trend 
each day...temperatures by Tuesday should be near normal. 

As the trough axis moves across the TN Valley...models try to 
bring in a chance for scattered light showers Tuesday afternoon 
and evening. Upper level dynamics support this trend...with 
divergence aloft...though the mid and low levels are expected to 
remain dry. Have left in slight chance precip for far NE TN and SW
VA though confidence is low. 

High pressure will then develop east of the Appalachians 
Wednesday...and slowly move eastward. The area will then be under SW 
flow...around this high pressure...with moisture and warm air 
advecting into the area Wednesday through Friday night. 
Precipitation chances increase beginning Thursday as enough moisture 
and lift will be present for diurnal light scattered showers and 
isolated thunderstorms...mainly in areas south of I40. By 
Friday...enough moisture and warm air will be present for the best 
chance for scattered showers and thunderstorms across the area.

.UPDATE...Have updated zone package to remove Tornado Watch #365 and 
severe thunderstorm wording.



.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Saturday)...
The circulation around the remnants of Cindy is producing very 
favorable hodographs/shear for rotating updrafts. Main limitation 
is instability. Mixing has lowered dewpoints some across the
region into the middle 60s to near 70, which is still quite high.
 
As mid-level dry slot continues to move into the Region this 
afternoon instability will increase with MLCAPE increasing to 
400-800 J/kg. Low CAPE and high shear environment will be 
conducive to the potential of low topped supercells. 

Latest meso-analysis data shows 0-1km shear of 30-35 and 0-6km
shear of 40-50, so very high shear values STP values of 4-5 near 
Huntsville with 1-2 across the Plateau and southeast Tennessee. 
Besides the shear, strong low-level jet of 50-60kts later today 
will increase the potential of damaging winds due to bow radar 
features.

Tornado watch has been issued for the western half of the area
through 01Z.

Circulation/low pressure will move east of the area late this
evening/early morning. Next feature of interest will be frontal
boundary that is moving across the Ohio Valley. This boundary will
move across the area Saturday. Airmass along and ahead of the
front will be unstable, so expected scattered/broken showers and
thunderstorms, mainly during the morning Saturday.

Dry air will pull into the region for Saturday afternoon with a
return of sunshine.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Thursday)...
Front will be south east of our area along with the precipitation
and moisture from Cindy as well. A surface high pressure and mid 
level zonal/weak trough will then set up over our area. The drier 
air out of the northwest will help keep the skies mostly sunny the
end of the weekend and into work week. Temperatures will remain 
below normal and winds will be light during this time frame. The 
next round of weather will hold off until the end of the work week
into next weekend. The surface high will eventually move off the 
East coast and increased moisture will be allowed in from the Gulf
of Mexico. Warmer temperatures will also be brought in and the 
combination of warm temperatures and increased moisture will lead 
to shower and thunderstorm activity over next weekend. This is 
still far enough away that the details are a bit fuzzy at this 
time for this next event.

1023 AM EDT Fri Jun 23 2017

.DISCUSSION...An active day across the Tennessee Valley/southern
Appalachians. Morning showers will end soon as water vapor shows
much drier mid-level air spreading into the Region. The drier
mid-level air will help to destabilize the airmass, but relative
warm vertical profile will keep ML CAPES between 400-800 J/kg.

Strong low-level jet will remain across the region and intensify
late today as the remains of Cindy move across the lower
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. The strong south/southwest jet (50-60kts)
and circulation around low pressure will produce a high shear
environment. Latest SPC outlook of the potential of damaging winds
and isolated weak tornadoes will be a concern late this afternoon
and evening.

Due to the strong low-level jet and Cove Mountain already showing
high winds, have issued a wind advisory for the Smoky Mountains
through 05Z. Breezy/Windy conditions can also be expected across
the rest of the area with speeds of 15 to 25 mph with gusts to 35
mph anticipated.

Current forecast highs look good overall.

327 AM EDT Fri Jun 23 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)... 
Latest surface analysis and regional radar indicates remnant of 
Cindy is currently located over south central Arkansas. This low 
is forecast to move N through this morning before turning NE and 
accelerating as it moves across KY this afternoon and into SE 
Pennsylvania by Saturday morning. 

Water vapor imagery indicates a band of tropical moisture feeding
N across Western Alabama into Middle and East TN this morning. Not
accounting for this band which is producing 1 hour rainfall 
totals of near an inch, the 12 hour rainfall totals across the 
area have been rather modest with less than a half inch total over 
much of the area. Exception to this is areas of Marion and 
Hamilton counties in SE TN which have seen radar estimates of up 
to 1.5 inches during this time.

Water vapor shows a small and well-defined dry slot siting between
Cindy remnants and the band currently affecting Middle/East TN. 
This dry slot is expected to shift NE ahead of Cindy today helping
to minimize potential for large scale heavy rains through this 
afternoon. This reduces flood threat area wide, with concern of 
localized flash flooding still possible in the training band this 
morning over the Southern Cumberland Plateau including Marion and 
Hamilton counties.

Models are in good agreement with a line a strong to possibly
severe thunderstorms pushing east across the area this evening as
Cindy accelerates northeast across KY. Forecasted SBCAPE values 
to near 1000 J/Kg, SFC-3KM shear of 40 KT, and the expected 
impressive low-level SRH of 200-300 m2/s2 during this time 
increase the risk for severe thunderstorms with the potential for 
a few tornadoes as this final band of convection pushes through 
the area. Additionally, 50-60 kt 850 MB winds SE of Cindy could 
mix down in any convective cells resulting in localized severe 
wind damage as well.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...
The remnants of Tropical Storm Cindy will be NE of the area by 
Saturday morning...with flow shifting to out of the NW. Moisture 
will remain...especially in the low levels...for a scattered light
showers and isolated thunder to continue through the 
day...tapering off from the west to east beginning mid day. By 
Saturday evening...all activity should be east of the 
Appalachians...with ample dry and cooler air continuing to filter 
in. Temperatures Saturday will be a couple of degrees below normal
due to the cloud cover expected to remain through the warming of 
the day. 

Sunday through Thursday...an upper level trough swings through 
the region. With NW flow remaining...mostly clear skies and dry 
weather is expected...with a gradual warming trend to the 
temperatures each day. Models try to bring in a few light 
scattered showers Monday evening in to Tuesday...mainly to the 
higher elevations...but due to low confidence in model 
consistency...have left mention of showers out of forecast for 
now. On Thursday...a boundary around a low pressure system moving 
across the northern Ohio Valley...is expected to swing through the
region. Scattered showers and thunderstorms can be expected 
through the afternoon if the boundary holds together by the end of
the extended.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Saturday)...

The short-term forecast will focus on the expected impacts across 
the Southern Appalachians from Tropical Depression Cindy. Widespread 
showers currently across the area along the eastern periphery of 
the tropical system. Low level southerly flow has advected the 
tropical airmass into the Southern Appalachians with PW values in 
excess of 2 inches. So far, rainfall rates have not been overly impressive 
generally around a tenth to a quarter of an inch an hour with 
radar estimates of around a quarter of an inch to three quarters 
of an inch today across most locations. Current water vapor 
imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates Cindy spinning 
northward near the TX/LA line. An area of dry air can be spotted 
just to the east of the center of circulation and will also have a
great deal of impact on the short-term forecast. 

For the remainder of the day, the widespread showers have acted to 
stabilize most of the area and have not seen any lightning. There may 
be a chance for a stronger storm or two with gusty winds being the 
main threat if there is some brief clearing but expect this is a low 
probability. Rain rates with the area of precipitation lifting 
northward are too low to expect any widespread flooding issues but 
there could be a few areas of localized flooding for areas of poor 
drainage. The latest hi-res models forecast drier conditions 
overnight into the early part of the day Friday as the drier air to 
the east of the system advects into the region. Therefore, lowered 
PoPs during the overnight period and into the day on Friday. 

A fast moving system will interact with the remnants of Cindy on 
Friday as a cold front races across the central CONUS. The remnants 
of Cindy will progress quickly to the east ahead of this boundary
across the Lower Mississippi River Valley and into the Ohio River
Valley. The airmass late Friday will feature high low level shear
with weak instability as the remnants of the tropical system 
approaches. Low level SRH values will increase into the 300-500 
m2/s2 late in the day with SBCAPE values around 250-500 J/Kg. 
Therefore, will have the potential for a few possible weak short- 
lived tornadoes across the area with any stronger updrafts. The 
system will be moving rather quickly late Friday night and into 
early Saturday and do not expect any widespread flooding issues 
and will forgo a Flood Watch at this time. Forecast rainfall 
amounts throughout the event will range from 2 to 3 inches which 
are similar to the 3-hr FFG values. Again, not expecting anything 
widespread but expect some problems in areas of poor drainage 
again late Friday into early Saturday due to localized flooding. 
Rain chances will come to an end from northwest to southeast 
throughout the day on Saturday as the front progresses across the 
region.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Wednesday)... 

By Saturday night the front will have pushed through and the 
atmosphere will dry out with winds out of the northwest. We will 
then begin a decent period of dry and quiet weather as the region 
is dominated by high pressure at the surface. Really no major 
precipitation chances are forecasted through the weekend and 
through much of the upcoming work week. In the upper levels we 
will see generally zonal flow to a weak trough in our vicinity. 
This will help lead to temperatures that are slightly average. 
Highs will top out int he upper 70's to lower 80's for most of the
region, along with light winds and mostly sunny skies. Weather 
during the upcoming work week is best described as "pleasant, but 
boring."

Deep tropical airmass is being advected into the forecast area 
along the eastern periphery of Tropical Storm Cindy. PW values 
are increasing to near to above maximum values for late June with 
readings above 2 inches. Current radar imagery indicates 
widespread showers across the southern half off the forecast area 
moving to the north. For the update, increased PoPs throughout the
remainder of the morning into the early afternoon to account for 
the ongoing activity. If there is some clearing later this 
afternoon, expect there will be the possibility for a few strong 
to marginally severe storms with damaging winds being the main 
threat.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Friday)...Will quickly transition into
a wet weather pattern today as tropical moisture surges north and
into the Southern Appalachian Region. As a result...widespread
showers and even a few thunderstorms will move across the area for
likely to categorical pops through the short term. The main
concern will be with the deep...abundant moisture in place...could
see occasional moderate to heavy rainfall with rain amounts of 1
to 3 inches possible. This may produce localized flooding and a
hydrologic outlook has been issued. Also of concern will the the
potential for strong to marginally severe thunderstorms as a 40+
850MB jet provides focus for convective development. 

.LONG TERM(Friday Night through Wednesday)...The opening of the 
extended period...Friday night...will be the most active as the 
remnants of Cindy crosses the area. Likely to categorical pops are 
in place, with a threat of locally heavy rains. There is a slight 
risk of severe thunderstorms with the passage of Cindy Friday night, 
but things should be improving quickly during Saturday, as Cindy's 
passage will basically serve as a frontal passage with mild weather 
in its wake. A second, reinforcing cool front will push through the 
area early in the new week, providing unseasonably cool temperatures 
for late June, running 5 to 8 degrees below normal on Monday and 
Tuesday. Aside from a slight chance of light rain showers from 
Sunday night through Tuesday, the weather should be generally dry 
post-Cindy.

324 PM EDT Wed Jun 21 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...Both moisture and cloud 
cover will continue to increase across our area overnight thanks to 
Tropical Storm Cindy. Increasing clouds and southerly flow will keep 
overnight lows mild, around 3 to 5 degrees above normal. With 
tropical moisture advecting northward, PWs increase overnight and 
through the day tomorrow to around 2 inches by tomorrow afternoon. 
This is near max values for this time of year. Increasing LLJ and 
PWs will lead to an increase in shower and storm activity through 
the day tomorrow. The NAM and GFS both show the first rain band of 
significance moving into the Southern Valley later tomorrow morning 
and then spreading northward into the Central and Northern Valley 
through the afternoon. With this initial band of rain we can expect 
anywhere from 0.25 to 0.5 inches of rainfall across the 
aforementioned areas. Lighter rainfall expected across NETN and 
SWVA with around 0.25 inches expected. A few embedded storms are 
possible but not expecting anything strong. Expect plenty of clouds 
tomorrow along with below normal highs. Highs will be around 80 
degrees for most areas, which is anywhere from 5 to 8 degrees below 
normal.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...A brief lull in
the heavier rainfall is anticipated Thursday night into early 
Friday. Tropical moisture will continue to surge into the area 
Friday as the remnants of TS Cindy push into west Tennessee and 
get absorbed into a slow moving cold front. For east Tennessee, 
southwest Virginia, and far western North Carolina, the period of 
heaviest rain appears to be Friday afternoon into early Saturday 
as the system crosses directly overhead. There should also be 
enough instability (CAPE values in the 500-1500 J/kg range, 
depending on the model) Friday afternoon to help trigger some 
thunderstorms along and ahead of the frontal boundary, with the 
main threat being isolated damaging wind gusts. With PWATs in the 
1.5 to 2.5" range (near climatological maxes for this time of 
year), storms will be efficient and rainfall amounts through 
Saturday afternoon will range from 2-4" across the area with 
locally higher amounts possible. There are still some model 
differences with regards to the exact track of TS Cindy and 
frontal passage timing. These small differences will impact the 
exact axis of heaviest rain, but at this point it appears to be 
across the Cumberland Plateau. Rain chances will slowly taper off 
during the second half of the weekend as the front progresses 
eastward, with just a slight chance for some lingering showers and
thunderstorms through Monday. Following this through mid next 
week, our area will be in a mainly dry, slightly cooler northwest 
flow pattern.

.DISCUSSION...Quite a few clouds across the CWA this morning as
the moisture from tropical storm Cindy continues to push 
northward. Old frontal boundary just to our south will serve as 
mechanism for potential convection this afternoon. If these 
showers and storms develop they will drift northward into the 
Southern Valley. Not expecting these storms to be strong. Have 
moved slight chance POPs further north for the afternoon hours. 
POP chances stay south of I-40 with best chances near the TN/GA 
state line, with again only slight chance in place. Will send out 
new zones for POP adjustment. Also made some tweaks to sky as 
norther areas could see some peaks of sunshine later today.

will result in low to mid level clouds and slight chance of 
convection near CHA this afternoon.  The rest of the area should

.SHORT TERM (Today through Thursday)...For today and tonight...will
see little change in the weather pattern with an old boundary 
south of the area. This will result in a slight chance of 
convection over far southern areas this afternoon and into the 
overnight. The rest of the area should remain dry with near 
seasonal temperatures. Will transition into a wetter pattern on 
Thursday as moisture from the remnants of Cindy push north and 
into the area. This will allow scattered showers and thunderstorms
to develop and move north into the MRX CWA throughout the day.

.LONG TERM (Thursday Night through Tuesday)...The main weather 
feature of the extended forecast is tropical storm Cindy. Not 
surprisingly, the models diverge in location of heavier QPF, but 
overall, rain onset is during Thursday and probably ending during 
Saturday as zonal flow beneath the base of an eastern Canada upper 
trough takes the system into the mid-Atlantic states and then 
offshore. ECMWF suggests a second batch of rain is possible Sunday 
and Monday while the GFS and Canadian are dry. Will hedge with 20 
pct pops to start the new week, then go with a dry day Tuesday.

.DISCUSSION...
Latest IR imagery shows fairly extensive cirrus shield extending 
NE out of the Gulf Of Mexico and across the Tennessee Valley this 
evening as Tropical Storm Cindy sits in the Northern Gulf. With 
forecast for a northward drift expected overnight, do not expect 
to see any end to cirrus ceilings area wide. Updated forecast to 
reflect increased cloudiness through tonight. 

Additionally, decreased POP's in SW NC for remainder of the night
as radar echoes are beginning to weaken S of the area and any pcpn
looks to remain S of the area through the overnight hours, in 
agreement with latest HiRes HRRR and RAP13.

Tweaked temperatures/dew points slightly in order to bring in 
line with latest observations. Dew points have dropped into the 
upper 50s and lower 60s across much of the area, helping to make 
it feel a little cooler and drier on this Summer Solstice...which
occurs at 12:24 AM tonight.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and tomorrow)...An upper level trough will 
continue to move east across the Great Lakes through Wednesday 
afternoon. At the same time...Tropical Storm Cindy will move 
towards the western Gulf Coast. A boundary between the two systems
currently set up SE of TN will move northward toward the southern
TN Valley and SW NC through Wednesday afternoon. 

Tonight...mostly clear skies expected...with clouds expected to 
increase in the southern Valley and SW NC through the night in 
response to the boundary moving northwards. Wednesday...flow north 
of the boundary will be from the west and northwest...while flow 
south of the boundary will be from the southwest. Can expect this 
boundary to be the trigger for a few showers...with very little 
movement expected in the showers. Have left in slight chance along 
the southern Plateau...southern Valley, and SW NC where this 
boundary will cause the greatest chance for light rainfall 
accumulations through Wednesday afternoon. 

Temperatures will be near normal tonight and Wednesday afternoon.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
Old frontal boundary just to the south of the Forecast area will 
have added convective activity early Wednesday evening and will be 
dissipating. Tropical moisture from Cindy will be streaming north to 
into the extreme southern part of the region. Will continue low rain 
chances Wednesday night. The main push northward of tropical 
moisture will be Thursday with deteriorating conditions spreading 
north during the day as the very outer moisture bands spread north 
into the Tennessee Valley. Some heavier rainfall amounts are 
possible Thursday afternoon and evening especially southern areas. 
Amounts of around 1 inch possible. More rainfall Friday with the 
highest amounts expected Saturday as the tropical system shifts east 
into the eastern Tennessee ahead of a cold front. This period of 
rainfall may cause some flooding. The chance of rain will continue 
Sunday as the front only slowly moves eastward. Monday rainfall ends 
as the front will move to the southeast. Temperatures will be cooler 
due to clouds and rain. Monday and Tuesday highs will be mainly in 
the 70s behind the front. Lows will be much cooler Monday night as 
well in the mid 50s to lower 60s.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Wednesday)...A somewhat zonal flow
pattern aloft as we find ourselves on the southern side of a broad
upper trough anchored over eastern Canada. We can expect fair 
weather to occur today through Wednesday, with the exception of
some low rain chances for Polk, Cherokee, and Clay counties today
and tonight, and then all of our southernmost counties on the GA 
border Wednesday...as these areas remain near the northern fringe 
of the moisture plume that moved southeastward through the area 
yesterday. Temperatures will be close to seasonal.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Monday)...The extended will 
start off mostly dry Wednesday night with an old frontal boundary to 
our south the main focus for convection.  We will then transition 
quickly into a wet pattern for the rest of the period. The main 
concern will be the remnants of a tropical system progged into the 
gulf states mid week.  The associated low level moisture is expected 
to surge north and into the MRX CWA Thursday and Friday. This 
pattern will allow for a good chance of widespread showers and 
thunderstorms. Then for the weekend...a cold front approaching the 
region will pull in some of the tropical moisture and expect to see 
a couple of organized bands of convection develop and move through 
the area Saturday and Sunday.  With the deep low level moisture over 
the area...expected some locally heavy rainfall at times Thursday 
through Sunday.  A few showers may linger into Monday as the system 
exits the area but at this point coverage should be limited.  As for 
temperatures...with the rainfall and cloud cover through much of the 
period...overall temperatures should be near to slightly below 
normal.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...A few lingering showers and 
perhaps even an isolated storm may still be ongoing across the 
furthest eastern portions of our CWA to start the period just ahead 
of an incoming cold front. The front should past to our east 
sometime between 01z and 04z. As the front moves east, expect 
clearing skies through the night from west to east. Low temps will 
be around 8 to 10 degrees cooler than last night with lows in the 
upper 50s to lower 60s, which is a few degrees below normal. As 
skies clear and temperatures drop, expect patchy fog to develop 
overnight across the area. Fog will clear tomorrow morning with 
clear skies and pleasant temps in store for your Tuesday. Highs will 
generally be in the lower 80s for most areas which is a few degrees 
below normal. Slight chance pop in place for southwest North 
Carolina tomorrow afternoon due to proximity of front just off to 
our east, otherwise dry and sunny.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...Cold front to the 
south and east of the forecast area Tuesday night will become 
stationary with drier air mass moving across the region. A few 
showers and storms still a possibility over the southeast corner 
but skies will be mostly clear except far south Tuesday night and 
lows in the cooler lower to mid 60s with 50s higher elevations. Near 
Chattanooga lows closer to 70 and lower clouds possible during the 
late night hours. GFS more aggressive with bringing moisture back 
north Wednesday from Gulf as potential tropical system by Wednesday 
afternoon. Prefer the slower NAM and EMWCF and will keep all but 
southeast corner dry Wednesday and Wednesday night. Thursday models 
bring surge of moisture north towards and into the Tennessee Valley 
which follows current forecast. Will have good chance for showers 
and storms Thursday and becoming likely Friday. For the weekend high 
rain chances continue Saturday and Sunday. Best chance for heavy 
rainfall is Saturday but this will depend on track of system in 
Gulf. Five day totals through early Saturday are forecast to be two 
to three inches and then about an inch more for the next 2 day 
period. Temperatures will be near normal to slightly below normal 
during the day Thursday through Monday. Lows at night will be above 
normal due to clouds and rain with a more tropical airmass.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast on track for the most part today with just
a few minor adjustments. Though the radar is fairly quiet across 
our area at the current hour, hi-res models still show an 
increase in showers and storms early this afternoon as the front
pushes through. It looks like the main timeframe for showers and 
storms will be from 18z through about 22z. A few storms could 
become strong and an isolated severe isn't out of the question but
thinking that things should stay fairly tame. Biggest threat with
these showers and storms moving through will be brief periods of 
moderate to heavy rainfall. The main adjustment to the forecast 
was to change some wording. Will send out new zones for wording 
adjustment.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Tuesday Night)...Heavy rainfall that 
was expected to occur from Sunday afternoon to the present moment 
over the Plateau did not materialize, and so the Flood Watch has 
been cancelled. Still expecting showers and scattered 
thunderstorms to impact the area through the day as a cold front 
moves through the area. Marginal risk of severe for downbursts
covers the eastern two thirds of the CWA, with a slight risk just
making it into far northeast TN. Much of the precip should be 
done by 21Z with only the easternmost areas still being impacted. 
Models show that the cold front will push the moisture field and 
the associated precip chances to the east and south of our CWA, 
with slight-chance pops confined to the southern and eastern 
fringes of the area for Tuesday/eve. The lower dewpoints will 
allow nighttime temps to cool into the upper 50s to mid 60s north 
to south along the Tennessee Valley tonight and Tuesday night. 

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Sunday)...Confidence somewhat reduced 
for this particular long term period in a weakening early summer 
pressure pattern across the Southeastern U.S. Utilizing the 
superblending blend, it appears pops may be a tad too high 
approaching the weekend with the models trying to pick up on a weak 
little short wave riding east across the Mid South on Friday. 
Perhaps pops are very slightly better aligned over the weekend with 
the possibility of another long wave trough gradually amplifying 
into the Eastern U.S. Still, uncertainty abounds in the weekend 
forecast with the GFS strengthening the feature a little faster than 
the ECMWF and then, correspondingly moving a synoptic boundary 
through the region ahead of the European model. So, the long term 
starts out quiet on Wednesday with just a slight increase in 
probability for convection on Thursday followed by a more unsettled 
look to the weekend forecast. The temperature forecast is quite 
close to normal for late June.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Monday night)...
A line of storms moving east across Middle TN will present a 
marginal threat of damaging winds to the Cumberland Plateau in the 
next few hours. Some weakening of the line is expected to occur as 
it moves into the TN Valley, but the HRRR is likely too quick to 
dissipate it completely.

As a cold front and upper trough move into the Ohio Valley region 
tonight, the SW low to midlevel flow increases and begins to advect 
deep moisture into the area. PW values increase to near 2 inches 
(over 90% of climatology) with deep, skinny CAPE profiles shown in 
NAM and GFS soundings. Near saturation through the column continues 
through Monday, for 12+ hours, and the slow-moving surface front 
will be moving into our NW sections in the afternoon. Flooding will 
be a concern with this pattern, particularly for SW VA and the 
northern Cumberland Plateau where locally heavy rain may occur 
today. The passage of the cold front and upper trough to our east 
occurs Monday evening, but the NAM hangs the front across the NC 
mountains and N GA through Monday night, so a chance PoP will be 
maintained overnight for that area. 

A Flash Flood Watch will be issued for the northern Cumberland 
Plateau counties and SW VA counties that border KY. QPF amounts in 
this area today through Monday will be in the 2-2.5 inch range.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)... 
Much quieter start to the period with the cold front now to our 
east. However, the front washes out just to our east and models 
show a remnant boundary hanging in across the Carolinas through 
the day on Tuesday. Due to the proximity of the boundary to our 
area will have slight chance POPs across portions of the Southern 
Valley and chance POPs into Southwest North Carolina. Elsewhere, 
plenty of sunshine and dry conditions expected with highs in the 
low to mid 80s, with highs only in the mid to upper 70s across 
Southwest Virginia. Tuesday night lows will range from the upper 
50s to lower 60s. 

Wednesday looks like another dry and nice day with highs in the mid 
80s but at this time our focus turns to tropical moisture coming 
northward out of the gulf. Models haven't been handling this feature 
too well but latest model runs show this system spreading moisture 
northward into our are Wednesday night and moreso on Thursday. Will 
reintroduce POPs areawide by Thursday afternoon with chance POPs 
across southern areas and slight chance elsewhere. Thursday night 
through Friday night is when models show this system moving through 
our area as an incoming longwave trough helps to pull it further 
northward. The upper-level longwave trough swinging through, behind 
the Thu/Fri system, will keep high-end chance POPs in the forecast 
for both Saturday and Sunday. Thursday through Sunday highs will 
generally be in the 80s with lows in the 60s. So overall, dry start 
to the period but increasing chances for showers and storms as the 
period progresses. If the tropical moisture takes a different track 
it will change our POPs quite a bit for late in the period, will 
continue watching.

.DISCUSSION...
Moisture and instability are quite a bit higher in the 12Z OHX
sounding compared to yesterday, thanks to a deep SW flow ahead of
an approaching trough. Showers are already developing in southern
Middle TN and northern AL. The HRRR has not picked up on this
development. Some adjustments to PoP/Wx grids will be needed to
favor higher rain chances in southern sections over the next few 
hours, and lower chances in northern sections where mesoanalysis 
shows less instability. Severe threat looks low/marginal until 
greater shear and upper level diffluence develops tonight as the 
trough gets closer.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Heights will begin falling as an 
upper trough approaches, and a cold front will be nearing our 
western border by the end of the short term period.  More available 
convective energy today as moisture starts to increase, so while 
will still carry highest PoPs in the terrain areas again will have 
chance PoPs even into valley areas.  Tonight as the front approaches 
should see showers and thunderstorms begin to increase from west to 
east. Appears timing on this activity will be mainly after midnight 
which will help to limit instability.  Low level shear will increase 
a bit during the period although still not overly impressive. Storms 
this afternoon and perhaps again late tonight may be strong to 
severe with damaging winds the primary threat. Also PW values 
expected to be quite high and localized flooding will be a concern. 
Will mention these threats in the HWO. 
 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...Categorical pops for 
convection still in the works for Monday as showers and 
thunderstorms continue to shift very slowly to the south and east 
across the forecast area. Continued decreasing probability is in 
store for Monday night from northwest through southeast as the cold 
front slips into the Western Carolinas. Higher pressure with 
subsidence and drier air should allow for pleasant weather on 
Tuesday and Wednesday across the Southern Appalachians. However, 
another upper trough appears to build southeast out of the Canadian 
prairies and into the Upper Midwest by the first half of the weekend. 
This configuration would lead to a gradually moistening and 
destabilizing atmosphere across the Southeastern United States with 
another cold front possibly entering the Southern Appalachian region 
by Sunday. Therefore, probability of precipitation for the 
development of showers and thunderstorms cranks up again heading 
into the weekend. A nice drop in temperature due to frontal clouds 
and rain cooled air keeps Monday pleasant followed by returning 
sunshine but lower humidity on Tuesday behind the front. The summer 
heat and humidity gradually returns through the remainder of the 
extended period due to a shift in the low level wind pattern to 
a southerly direction.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...
Like yesterday, most precip has remained along the mountains today, 
with a few isolated showers along the Cumberland Plateau. These 
showers and storms will dissipate with sunset, leaving mostly clear 
skies overnight and a little fog near water and in valleys. 
Tomorrow, we should continue to see the terrain areas favored for 
afternoon convection, but perhaps with greater activity in the 
Plateau as convergence with a surface pre-frontal trough moves 
across Middle TN and 500 mb heights fall ahead of an upper level 
trough. Will have chance PoPs for the entire area tomorrow 
afternoon, with the highest chances on the eastern and western 
borders. Temps will likely be a bit warmer tomorrow compared to
today with a stronger low level SW flow developing.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)...
An active start to the period followed by quieter weather...then 
chances for showers and storms return late in the period.

Large upper level trough will be swinging through the Mid-West/Ohio 
River Valley to start the period along with associated cold front. 
Expect showers and storms to be ongoing well in advance of the front 
with likely and categorical POPs in place across our area by late 
Monday night as showers and storms roll through. The potential for a 
few strong to severe storms exist overnight Sunday as we will be 
under the influence of a moderately unstable environment with 
increasing lift and weak shear but more concerned with the heavy 
rainfall threat. Both the NAM and GFS generally show PW values 
around the 2 inch mark for our area from Sunday night through 
Monday, which is near the max value for this time of year. The 
combination of very high PWs, weak shear, moderate instability, 
along with high freezing levels and low LCLs (deep warm layer) will 
allow for an efficient rainfall process. The NAM is more bullish 
with the higher rainfall totals compared to the GFS so confidence on 
totals is still a little shaky, but will lean more toward the NAM 
solution as it is closer to WPC's QPF forecast. At this time, it 
generally appears that the Southern Valley will see anywhere between 
0.75 inches and 1.25 inches of rain from Sunday night through 
Monday. All other areas, between 1.25 inches and 1.75 inches, with 
isolated higher totals of around 2 inches. Areas that see repeated 
rounds of heavy rain could see some flooding problems. The cold 
front looks to push through Monday evening with drier air slowly 
filtering in through the night. 

Slight chance for a light shower still in place early Tuesday 
morning across our eastern mountains but that will quickly end as 
the front pushes further east. Most areas will see plenty of sun on 
Tuesday with cooler highs in the low to mid 80s and lower dewpoints. 
A weak wave moves through the flow on Wednesday and will have a 
slight chance POP for NETN and SWVA but otherwise dry. Disturbance 
out of the Gulf of Mexico moves northward into the Southeast United 
States late Thursday into Friday, thus increasing moisture across 
our area. Moisture increase will allow for chances for showers and 
storms to return on Friday and Saturday.

The 12Z OHX sounding shows a dry and stable column to our west,
while soundings from RNK and GSO show much deeper moisture with
weak instability to our east. GOES-16 WV shows a strip of dry air

west stability gradient across the area. So much like yesterday, 
the majority of convective activity will be along the TN/NC 
border, with very little if any precip in our western half. This 
is supported by the latest HRRR and RAP. The current forecast is 
on track with this pattern, and temps are on track, so no changes

chance elsewhere.  Tonight expect any lingering convection to 
diminish fairly quickly once again. Should be very warm/hot this 
afternoon as expect quite a bit of sunshine.  MAV temps generally 
look reasonable so will stay close.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...An upper trough is forecast 
to build into the Eastern United States through the early part of 
the week and exit by Wednesday. A cold front will accompany the 
upper feature generating a large area of showers and thunderstorms 
across the Ohio Valley into the Mid South during the day Sunday. The 
associated outflow boundary will build further south into the 
Southern Appalachians Sunday night into Monday. Strong to severe 
convection is possible during this period in a moderately to 
strongly unstable, albeit weakly sheared environment. The action 
moves out of most of the forecast area by Tuesday morning, but held 
onto a small chance for a few showers at this time step due to 
uncertainty in system departure. The forecast area should be able to 
enjoy a quieter Wednesday and Thursday. However another, less 
amplified trough moves across the Great Lakes and into New England 
at the end of the long term forecast bringing a small chance for 
convection on Friday. Temperatures moderate briefly due to the 
precipitation on Monday and the weak cool air advection in the 
northerly flow behind the front on Tuesday. Then its back to 
gradually increasing heat and humidity later in the period.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...
Lower surface dewpoints and greater stability today has kept 
convection anchored to the mountains so far, and mainly along the 
Blue Ridge. This should continue through the late afternoon and 
evening, with any remaining storms dissipating after sunset. Lower 
dewpoints and less precip today suggest less fog/low cloud potential 
than we have seen the past mornings. Tomorrow, the models agree that 
afternoon convection will once again favor the higher terrain along 
the NC border, thanks to a lack of forcing under a weak 700 mb ridge 
and a midlevel dry layer. Chance PoPs will be forecast for the 
mountains and SW VA/NE TN, with a slight chance into the central and 
southern Valley. With less morning cloud cover expected, highs 
should reach the upper 80s for most of the TN Valley tomorrow.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...
A couple of stray showers and thunderstorms may be ongoing across 
the high terrain to start the period but other than that we should 
be dry. Lows on Saturday night will be around 5 degrees above 
normal. Saturday night into Sunday morning a large upper level 
trough will be approaching our area from the Mid-West/Ohio River 
Valley region. Chances for showers and storms increase through the 
day on Sunday as the trough and associated cold front move in 
closer, though the actual frontal passage won't occur until Monday 
evening/night. Highs on Sunday will be in the upper 80s. 

By Sunday night into Monday morning the base of the trough and 
associated 300mb jet energy begins to move into our area increasing 
the chances for showers and storms. During this time PW values begin 
to ramp up as moisture increases. By 12z Monday morning we see PW 
values approaching 2.00 inches across portions of our area, which is 
nearing max values for this time of year based off BNA sounding 
climatology. PW values max out Monday afternoon with CHA showing 
2.16 inches at 18Z Monday according to latest run of the NAM, TYS 
shows 2.22 inches. These very high values along with tall skinny 
CAPE profiles indicate the potential for heavy rainfall with the 
possibility of flooding. Besides flooding, there will also be the 
threat of strong to severe storms during the day on Monday due to 
plenty of lift, moisture, instability, and shear as the trough 
swings through. Models try to push the front through and to our east 
by Monday evening/night. 

Tuesday and Wednesday look much nicer with the front to the east 
along with some briefly lower dewpoints thanks to drier air behind 
the front. Next chances of rain don't occur until Thursday night 
into Friday as a very weak front sags southward out of the Ohio 
River Valley. The biggest focus through the long term period is 
during the Sunday through Monday timeframe.

Confidence about the details of vis and cigs overnight is low as a

a mix of low vis and low cigs at the TAF sites, but that was
preceded by afternoon showers at TYS and CHA. Today, rain is much
less likely at those locations, but more likely at TRI. So the 18Z
TAFs will hit fog and low cigs harder at TRI, in the LIFR range,
but have just MVFR cigs at TYS and CHA.

few days. Precipitable water remains high to our east as a 
shortwave trough axis is positioned over the area, which will be

the mountains and SW VA for the higher rain chances today, but the
update will sharpen the E-W PoP gradient by lowering chances in 
the Valley and Plateau. Cloud cover this morning is holding 
temperatures below hourly forecast values, but we should see some 
partial clearing that will bring afternoon temps close to forecast
highs in the mid to upper 80s.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Considerable moisture will 
linger over the area through the period.  Best instability is 
forecast to be across northern areas today.  Appears convection may 
initate across the higher terrain first, but expect scattered 
convection to spill over into the valley as well so will include 
chance PoPs all areas with exception of likely in the eastern 
mountains.  Will carry low PoPs into evening hours, but convection 
is likely to be short lived most areas once the sun sets. With the
slow movement of expected storms, localized flooding will be
possible and some storms may strengthen to at least near severe,
so will mention in HWO. MAV temps look reasonable so only some 
minor adjustments.


.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...Through much of the 
forecast period, there will be just a slight or small chance of 
showers and thunderstorms generally linked to the higher terrain 
features. However, the period Sunday through Monday night could be 
rather active forecast area wide as a cold front builds south 
through the Southern Appalachian region. The best chance for showers 
and thunderstorms would be Sunday night into Monday as the boundary 
advances into the area. There will be more than enough instability 
with sufficient wind energy for the development of strong to possible 
severe thunderstorms during this period. The front continues 
southeast out of the region later Monday night into Tuesday with 
drier and cooler air building in for a brief period of relief from 
the higher heat and humidity.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...
Models have had a difficult time accurately depicting how 
convection has developed today and how it will evolve tonight. The
short term part of the forecast will mainly follow radar and 
satellite trends for the evening as a vort max crosses the area, 
and generally follow persistence for late tonight and tomorrow 
with a weak ridge over the area. 

A SW storm motion suggests that the central and southern sections of 
the area will have the highest precip chances through the evening, 
with locally heavy rain and possible minor flooding issues. Most 
storms should stay below severe levels, with an isolated gust to 50 
mph possible. Northern sections have been slow to destabilize behind 
an outflow boundary, but storms are beginning pop in the Plateau and 
eastern KY and are moving east. Activity should begin to wane a few 
hours after sunset with loss of heating and the exit of the vort 
max, with patchy fog developing late if clouds can clear out. 
Tomorrow should have less activity as a weak ridge will be over the
area behind the exiting trough. Most convection should be focused
on the higher terrain, and mainly diurnally-driven. The NAM wants
to bring a MCV from today's convection over KS to our door step 
late tomorrow, but confidence in its depiction of this is low.

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Thursday)...
At the start of this period any daytime thunderstorms will likely
dissipate after sunset with longer lived activity likely near the
mountains and in southwestern North Carolina. 

By Saturday typical daytime thunderstorms will occur in the
favored areas of the plateau and higher terrain of E TN and
southwest VA/NC. A deep upper low over the Great Lakes region will
bring a cold front closer to the region on Sunday through Monday
night. Look for the best chances of showers and thunderstorms to
occur Sunday night into Monday. Cooler daytime temperatures will
occur while it is raining, however, wish we could say the 
temperatures would be much cooler by mid-week but that won't be 
the case. Look for temperatures to bounce back into the mid and 
upper 80s by Wednesday. Will watch for return moisture into the 
area by Thursday and into Friday bringing rain chances back into 
the region by the end of next week.

likely depend on preceding rainfall amounts and how quickly clouds
clear out. Clearing seems most likely at TRI so a TEMPO for MVFR

.DISCUSSION...
The evolution of convection across the area this afternoon will
depend on the position of an outflow boundary that is currently
across SW VA and the northern Cumberland Plateau, moving SE.
Projecting it forward, it should be near Knoxville and past TRI by
noon. The favored areas for storms today will be near and south of
the boundary, as the lack of cu and slightly lower dewpoints
behind it suggest a slightly more stable environment for northern
sections this afternoon. A vort max associated with convection in
s-cntrl KY and West TN will bring additional scattered to 
numerous storms this evening for the entire area, as depicted by
the RAP and NAM. The forecast update will adjust PoPs based on
these trends through this evening.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Another round of patchy fog will be possible this morning with 
temperature/dew point spreads very close to each other.. Once 
again the fog should burn off pretty quickly after sunrise. 
Another round of diurnally driven showers and thunderstorms looks 
likely today with continued warm temperatures and elevated dew 
points across the area. Biggest concerns with storms that form 
today will be strong winds, heavy rain, and hail. Mid level dry 
air will help reinforce the potential to see strong downdrafts out
of storms that form later today. Drier air is around the 
700-500mb layer and forecast soundings have DCAPE values hovering 
around 1,000 J/kg later today. These conditions point to a 
potential for some of the bigger storms to produce strong winds. 
In addition precipitable water values of 1.5-2.0 inches look 
likely across the forecast area. This is above normal and some 
locations could be approaching the 90th percentile for this time 
of year. This combined with very weak steering flow in the 
atmosphere could lead to slow moving storms that produce a lot of 
precipitation. Once again fog will be possible in the typical low 
lying locations, and places that get good rainfall and cooling, 
tonight into tomorrow morning.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...Models show a series of weak 
short-waves/shear axis moving across the Tennessee Valley Friday 
through Sunday. Main forcing will remain terrain features and left 
over outflow boundaries. Model soundings continue to show a very 
moist and unstable air-mass so scattered thunderstorm development 
expected each day, mainly during the afternoon and evening.  Main 
concern with these storms will be torrential rains (due to high PWs) 
and strong gusty winds up to 40-50 mph.

For Monday, a strong upper trough will move across the Great 
Lakes/Ohio Valley. A frontal boundary will move across the Tennessee 
Valley during the afternoon and evening. Due to stronger wind flow, 
more organized convection is expected. Some strong to possibly 
severe storms are possible.

For Tuesday and Wednesday, surface ridging builds into the Tennessee 
valley with drier air-mass with PWs dropping below 1 inch.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Thursday)...
The main threat with ongoing thunderstorms through the afternoon 
will be heavy rain and localized flooding due to slow moving and 
training storms. Wind gusts of 40-50 mph may also occur with some 
stronger storms. With a lack of shear, organized severe storms are
not likely, though an isolated gust above 50 mph could bring down
some trees. Storms are primarily diurnally-driven and should
dissipate after sunset as a mid/upper level ridge will remain 
over the area tonight. As we saw this morning, patchy dense fog 
will likely develop in some areas, but pinpointing those areas at 
this time will be difficult. Will mention patchy fog everywhere
tonight.

Tomorrow should be another active convective day, perhaps moreso
than today as a shortwave trough across Missouri approaches. The 
MET and MAV guidance have big differences in their PoPs tomorrow, 
but will favor the higher chances of the MAV, which are in the 
50-70% range across the area. Timing of the shortwave trough and 
daytime heating favor the mid afternoon to evening hours for 
storms. Like today and yesterday, instability will support strong 
storms and maybe a couple marginal severe storms, but the lack of 
deep shear should limit an organized severe threat. Storm motion 
should be a little faster and better definied tomorrow with SW 
850-700 mb winds of 10-20 kts.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...
The upper ridge will continue to weaken over the next several days 
and through the weekend as heights slowly fall. With an unstable 
airmass, a chance of showers and thunderstorms will remain with the 
highest probabilities across the higher elevations of the eastern 
Tennessee mountains along the TN/NC border.

Late Sunday and into Monday, a strong upper trough will move across 
the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley with a cold front moving through the 
Southern Appalachians region. More widespread showers and 
thunderstorms will be likely ahead of and along the front on Monday. 
Ridging is expected to build back in through the middle of next week 
meaning any cool down would be short lived.

.AVIATION...
Showers and thunderstorms have at least at 50% chance of hitting
the TAF sites through the rest of the afternoon, so a TEMPO will
be included at all sites. MVFR conditions will be forecast with
the storms, but IFR vis may be likely if the storm cores pass
directly over the terminals. Storms should dissipate with sunset,
and fog may develop late tonight with clear/calm conditions and
wet ground. Fog was expected last night but didn't develop at any
of the TAF sites, so confidence is a little low about fog, but the
chance of at least MVFR conditions seems greater than 50%.
Tomorrow looks mostly similar to today, with storms expected 
after the end of the current forecast period.

.DISCUSSION...
The forecast appears to be on track this morning, so no update is
needed. Northern areas will be favored for shower and
thunderstorm coverage through the afternoon as ongoing storms
produce outlow boundaries that will initiate addtional storms.
PoPs of likely north to high chance central and south looks good. 
Satellite shows towering cu developing in the plateau, where the 
HRRR shows new developing occuring in the next few hours. A few
strong storms with gusty winds may be possible with some marginal
instability noted in the 12Z OHX sounding, but very weak shear 
should limit the threat of severe storm development.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Overnight storms have mostly died down very early this morning,
and should stay away until later today. With the storms from
yesterday we will likely see some patchy fog develop, but the
scattered nature of the storms along with some lingering cloud
coverage will limit widespread dense fog. Conditions today will be
relatively similar compared to yesterday so am expecting to see
more diurnally driven thunderstorms with a few being strong enough
to cause gusty winds and maybe some small hail, but widespread
severe weather is not anticipated at this time. Difficult to
pinpoint where exactly storms will fire later today, but we could
see decent coverage if there are any lingering outflow boundaries
from yesterday's convection. Depending on the coverage of the
storms later today we could see another round of fog overnight
tonight.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...
The transition from upper ridge over the southern Appalachians to
trough continues. For Thursday, models show a short-wave moving 
across the Tennessee Valley enhancing the convection over the 
area. This shear axis will move slowly east and be near the spine 
of the Appalachians for Friday. Airmass each day will be 
moderately unstable. Main concern will be isolated/multi-cell 
convection with strong storms possible producing torrential rains,
strong gusty winds up to 50 mph and possibly hail up to dime 
size.

For Saturday, another wave comes through the Tennessee valley 
Saturday. For Sunday and Monday, a strong upper trough will move 
across the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley with a cold front moving through 
on Monday. More widespread strong/severe thunderstorms are possible 
for Monday afternoon and frontal boundary moves through the area.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...This past weekend's ridge 
has broken down to some degree on its eastern edge as an upper 
trough shifts east across Southeastern Canada. The weakening ridge
has allowed for a corridor of weak short wave energy to ride 
southeast out of the Ohio Valley into the Central Appalachians. 
Some of this action is spilling over into northern parts of the 
forecast area at mid afternoon. Still, most of the development 
appears to be anchored mainly to higher terrain features. Expect 
convection to gradually taper off through the evening with the 
stabilizing atmosphere. Wednesday should be similar to today with 
convection developing mainly over the major terrain areas. 
However, the corridor around the top of the upper ridge will 
remain in place allowing for a little better chance for showers 
and thunderstorms across Southwest Virginia and Northeast 
Tennessee. Much of the thunderstorm development will not be 
severe, but a few storms may become quite strong; especially in 
this northern part of the forecast area. High temperatures on 
Wednesday could be limited to the upper 70s through middle 80s in 
this area but much of the remainder of the region should warm into
the middle and upper 80s to around 90 degrees.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...At the beginning of 
this period the upper ridge is breaking down as a large upper trough 
starts to encroach on the area.  At the surface we are still in a 
very weak return flow from the Gulf.  By late Thursday and into 
Thursday night a weak upper shortwave trough will be moving into the 
area and it is expected to show slow strengthening as it moves into 
the area. Then this shortwave starts the transition for the rest of 
the forecast period, where we will be under the influence of the 
upper trough to the north.  So, this will result in an unsettled 
period with better chances for precip, and several shortwaves within 
the flow to give more organized lift and more widespread rain 
chances. By early next week, the cold front should be moving into 
the area, with better chances for organize storms along and ahead of 
the front.  The timing of the front is questionable with it slowly 
washing through the area, but some time around Monday it should be 
pretty close to us, and possibly south of us by Tuesday.  There will 
be some opportunities for heavy rains, with precipitable water 
values at or above 1.5" over much of the area now until the front 
passes next week, except for a slight temporary drying of the 
moisture depth around Friday in the wake of the weak shortwave.

drift into the Great Valley. Weak ripples of energy continue to
drop southeast out of the Upper Ohio Valley around the top of the
upper ridge today. The slightly higher probability forecast for 
showers and thunderstorms across Southwest Virginia and Northeast
Tennessee appears to be on track with possible outflow boundaries
building south out of the Ohio Valley action. Will stay the course
on max temps which are on track to top out in a range from the mid

convection near/at the TAF sites and low clouds/fog. Water vapor 
shows a shear axis across southwest Virginia/northeast Tennessee 
early this morning. An isolated storm has developed near this axis 
already early this morning. Besides the convection, patchy fog is 
occuring at TRI early this morning.

This axis will remain across the far northeast sections for today,
otherwise, plenty of moisture/unstable air across the Tennessee

forcing will be terrain features. Will call for vicinity thunder for 
this afternoon/evening at all TAF sites.

Main concern will be local torrential rains, gusty winds and 
frequent lightning with the stronger convection.

Convection will slowly dissipate this evening after loss of
daytime heating. Also models do not show another weak wave over
the area tonight which may effect TRI/TYS.

.SHORT TERM (Early this morning through Tonight)...water vapor
shows a shear axis across southwest Virginia/northeast Tennessee
early this morning. An isolated storm has developed near this axis
already early this morning. Besides the convection, patchy fog is
possible.

This axis will remain across the far northeast sections for today,
otherwise, plenty of moisture/unstable air across the Tennessee
Valley and southern Appalachians. Besides the shear axis, main
forcing will be terrain features. Will call for the highest PoPs
across the northeast and Plateau/Mountains for today. Main concern
will be local torrential rains, gusty winds and frequent lightning
with the stronger convection.

Convection will slowly dissipate this evening after loss of
daytime heating. Also models do not show another weak wave over
the area tonight.

Besides the scattered showers/thunderstorms, a very warm and muggy
day is in store across the region today.

.LONG TERM (Tomorrow through Monday)...
Ridge above us will continue through the middle of the week 
leading to slightly above average temperatures most days during 
this forecast. At the lower levels very weak flow from the 
south/southwest will keep moisture in the area leading to muggy 
conditions as well. The moisture and heat will also combine to 
give us several days of diurnally driven showers and 
thunderstorms. Ridge starts to break down at the end of the work 
week and into the weekend, but it won't do much to cool down 
temperatures or drive away the elevated dew points. During this 
work week and into the weekend there is really no major forcing to
focus diurnally driven showers and thunderstorms so it's a bit 
difficult to pin down what locations have the best chances to see 
storms until the mesoscale models come into play. Quasi/zonal flow
over the weekend will lead into a weak trough ahead of an 
approaching frontal boundary. This will start to cool us down ever
so slightly and eventually could be the focus for more organized 
convection. But the frontal boundary is not forecasted to move 
into our area until Monday night/Tuesday morning.

.SHORT TERM...The orographic convection should gradually fade 
with the setting sun tonight. Low temperatures will be similar to 
this morning's lows in the 60s and lower 70s. Adequate moisture 
and instability will be available again on Tuesday for the 
formation of showers and thunderstorms. In such a weak flow 
pattern due to the Eastern U.S. ridge, there will continue to be 
little in the way of focusing mechanisms for widespread 
convection. Thunderstorm development would be mainly limited to 
the Cumberland Plateau geologic formation in Tennessee extending 
north into Southwest Virginia as well as the mountains along the 
Tennessee and North Carolina border. However, a few of these 
storms could drift into the Great Valley at times. Will keep the 
probability in the chance category for Tuesday. Temperatures 
should be similar to the past 24 hours with lows in the 60s and 
lower 70s tonight with highs in the 80s tomorrow.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Monday)...At the beginning of 
this period the weak upper ridge will still be in place over the 
area, while at the surface we will be in a very weak return flow 
from the Gulf. This pattern continues through Wednesday. By 
Thursday the upper ridge is breaking down as an upper trough moves
toward the area from the Plains--resulting in an almost zonal 
flow. This trend continues into next weekend, then the trough 
looks like it may settle a little deeper into the area by early 
next week, and bring a weak cold front into the area. For most of 
this period, we will see mainly a summer regime of diurnal 
convection. Toward the end of the forecast as the cold front gets 
closer, the wind field starts to increase that would tend to start
supporting storms deeper into the evenings as well as more 
organized storms.

warm...tropical air mass will be more unstable than Sunday and as 
uneven heating takes place today showers and thunderstorms will 
break out first over the higher elevation southern areas then 
develop farther north during the day. High temperatures will reach
the mid to upper 80s again. A few storms will linger into the 
evening mainly higher elevations...then decrease around sunset. 
Mild temperatures again tonight in the mid 60s to around 70 due to
left over cloud cover and the moist near tropical air mass.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...
Upper level ridging will remain in control through midweek with 
lower level southerly flow advecting moist Gulf air into the 
region. Instability will increase along with moisture throughout 
the extended period. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will pop 
each day, with the best chances across the higher terrain where 
orographic lift will help provide some forcing to aid in 
convective development. With no real boundary or other focus 
present, none of these storms are expected to be significant. By 
late Thursday, upper level ridge will begin to break down and push
east with zonal westerly flow replacing it for the upcoming 
weekend. Better coverage of showers/thunderstorms is expected for 
Thursday/Friday in this slower flow regime with a weak boundary to
our north. A weak upper level trough will push through for the 
weekend, continuing precip chances. Under the warm, moist flow, 
highs each day will be slightly above seasonal averages, ranging 
from the mid to upper 80s in most locations. Lows will stay mild 
throughout the extended period, holding in the mid to upper 60s 
across the area.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Monday)...Ridge will continue
weaken across the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians.
GOES-16 water vapor bands show the increasing Gulf moisture
streaming into the area. NSEA application also shows increasing
instability with MU CAPE values up to 2500 over southeast
Tennessee.

Radar already show isolated showers/storms developing over Georgia
spreading north/northwest. Will include a slight chance of showers
and thunderstorms for southeast Tennessee and southern Plateau
through early this evening.

For Monday, tropical-like moisture will continue to pull into the
area with instability increasing. Main forcing will be orographic
features. Will have highest chances over southeast Tennessee and
Plateau with moisture/instability the greatest. Main concern from
these storms will be localized heavy rain.

.LONG TERM (Monday night through Sunday)...During this forecast 
period I tried to pull back a little off the superblend which feels 
inflated in the pop department. The big ridge still expected to hang 
around through about mid week with a moistening lower level flow 
developing. Difficult to grasp onto any significant features to 
apply to increased pops through mid week other than increasing 
instability and orographic lift on the terrain. The models have 
tried to maintain a little higher pop across The Central 
Appalachians about Wednesday as a weak perturbation supposedly drops 
southeast out of the Ohio Valley over the top of the ridge. It still 
looks like the best chance for greater coverage of showers and 
thunderstorms would be Thursday and Friday with some bleed into 
Saturday, in a slower westerly flow regime. During this period, a 
slightly more amplified upper trough drifts east through the 
Appalachians with a weak boundary slipping across the mountains by 
Friday night or Saturday. High and low temperatures will be a little 
ahead of normal for mid June.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Strong high pressure ridge over the southeastern part of the 
country will hold on for another 24 hours with very warm and dry 
conditions through tonight. Temperatures early this morning are in
the 60s to around 70 about 5 to 10 degrees warmer than Saturday 
morning. Dewpoints have also risen from the 50s Saturday to the 
lower 60s this morning. Light south to southwest flow will help to
increase dew points and humidity especially across southern 
sections by tonight. Highs today should be a couple degrees warmer
than Saturday with lows tonight a few degrees warmer in the 60s.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...
Strong upper level ridging continues to remain in control across
the eastern US through much of the extended period, lending to an
above average forecast confidence through the week. With the 
associated surface high centered over the Atlantic, low level 
southerly flow will advect warm Gulf moisture up into the MRX 
forecast area, pushing dewpoints to near 70 by midweek. This 
moisture combined with morning sunshine helping to destabilize the
atmosphere will help trigger scattered convection every afternoon
this week. Upper level ridging becomes more zonal by Thursday, 
allowing a weak boundary to push across the area Thursday into 
Friday, bringing a better chance for more widespread coverage of 
showers and thunderstorms. A shortwave will follow for next 
weekend, bringing another focus for more shower and thunderstorm 
activity. Under the strong ridge, high temperatures through 
Thursday will be slightly above seasonal normals, reaching the mid
to upper 80s in most locations. Temperatures will be a few 
degrees cooler (generally in the low to mid 80s) behind the weak 
boundary as we head into next weekend. Overnight lows will stay 
quite mild, holding in the mid to upper 60s.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...
Latest water vapor and RAP upper air analysis indicate weak 
ridging over the Tennessee Valley that is expected to persist 
through Sunday. At the surface, broad area of high pressure 
dominates much of the SE US. Locally, light southerly return flow 
is beginning to re-introduce low-level moisture to the area with 
dew points about 2-5 degrees higher than yesterday afternoon. 
Expect overnight lows tonight near June normals and very near to 
last night. For Sunday, highs in some Valley locations will start 
to reach into the lower 90s under continued mostly clear skies and
low-level warm air advection. This is very near to a consensus of
GFS and NAM MOS which both give very similar temperature 
solutions for the fcst period.

.LONG TERM (Sunday Night through Saturday)...
The first major upper level ridge of the warm season still 
progged to form over the most of the Eastern U.S. in the extended 
period. The ridge initially suppresses convection across 
northeastern parts of the forecast area on Monday with a chance 
for a few storms over the remainder of the MRX CWA. However, the 
probability for showers and thunderstorms gradually increases into
Thursday as a weakness develops within the broader ridge pattern.
Additionally, the low level southerly flow will be increasing 
through this time frame leading to the better opportunity for 
briefly cooling thunderstorms. The highest chance for convection 
should be on Thursday as a slightly stronger upper trough builds 
into the region in the faster westerly flow across the northern 
states. Pops gradually drop off Friday into Saturday as this 
feature shifts slowly east leading to slightly drier air. The 
advertised mini heat wave is still in the works, but the heat may 
be tempered a bit later in the week with greater thunderstorm 
coverage and a little "cooler" air arriving in a weak westerly 
flow behind a boundary slipping east of the Appalachians.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
An upper-level ridge of high pressure becomes much more
established across the Tennessee Valley and Southern Appalachian
region later today (roughly centered across Central Georgia). This
will put the area under strong subsidence and result in a mostly
clear, sunny, dry day again. The abundant sunshine, southerly 
surface flow, and increased thickness values will result in a 
warmer day than yesterday. Highs will run 5-6 degrees warmer for 
the second day in row, peaking in the low to mid 80s in most spots
across the Valley by the late afternoon. Radiational cooling will
take place after sunset thanks to the clear sky, light winds, and
the dry air in place. Do not think fog will become widespread 
come Sunday morning thanks to this dry air, but soundings did show
the potential near lakes/rivers and thus have made a mention of 
this in the zones. 

.LONG TERM /Sunday through Friday/...
A strong upper ridge will remain in control of the weather 
pattern through much of the extended period, bringing a prolonged 
period mainly sunny, warm temperatures. Sunday and Monday look 
mainly dry with just a slight chance of a shower or thunderstorm 
across the terrain on Monday. Surface high pressure will be 
centered off the east coast, resulting in gradually deepening 
southerly flow off the Gulf and into our forecast area. This will 
result in steadily increasing moisture through the end of the 
week. With ample sunshine, this also means increasing instability 
and a better chance for convection to fire across the area for the
remainder of the workweek. A weak boundary will push through in 
the Thursday/Friday timeframe, acting as a focus for steadier 
showers and thunderstorms. High temperatures throughout the 
forecast period will be slightly above seasonal normals, reaching 
the mid to upper 80s in most locations. With the humid airmass in 
place, overnight lows will only dip into the mid to upper 60s.

After a slightly cooler than normal night tonight, the combination
of weak ridging aloft, low-level SW flow, and increasing humidity
will bring temperatures, and conditions in general, back toward
typical June norms for Saturday.

.LONG TERM (Saturday Night Through Friday)...
The heat's on the way and here to stay through much of the 
extended period forecast as an amplified upper ridge builds slowly
east to cover most of the Eastern half of the nation. This will 
be a period of mostly sunny skies within the beautiful ridge and a
gradually deepening southerly flow off the Gulf. Therefore, the 
weekend into Monday still looks basically dry with just a slight 
chance of a shower or thunderstorm on the terrain; mainly across 
the southern half of the forecast area. The heat will continue to 
build into the remainder of the long term with quite a bit of 
sunshine and steadily increasing moisture which will lead to 
increasing instability for convection. Probability of 
precipitation increases from about 20-40 percent Tuesday to 60 
percent by Thursday as a weak boundary slips through the Southern 
Appalachian region. The boundary may be east of the forecast by 
Friday with a corresponding decrease in the chance for convection.
Highs will move upward into the middle and upper 80s through much
of the long term with lows in the 60s.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
A ridge of high pressure at the surface will control the weather
across the eastern Tennessee Valley over the next 24 hours. This
will promote a mostly sunny and dry for Friday, helping to warm
high temperatures a bit warmer than yesterday by about 5-8 
degrees. Still, the prevailing upper-level NW flow aloft (thanks 
to a departing upper-trough to the east) will help to keep
temperatures below the climatological norm by a degree or two. 
The drier air will keep RH values in the 40-50 percent range in 
the afternoon, making it feel quite comfortable outside. Good 
radiational cooling will take place after sunset, with lows on the
cool side in the mid 50s to lower 60s -- pleasant for this time 
of year. The drier boundary layer will also help to limit the fog 
formation from becoming too widespread, so have kept out of the 
zones for now. 

.LONG TERM /Saturday through Thursday/...
Upper level ridging will remain in control this weekend, 
resulting in sunny, dry conditions through Monday. Surface high 
pressure will gradually slide east on Monday, allowing more moist 
air to slowly creep back into the area under light southerly flow.
With ample sunshine helping to create some instability by the 
afternoon hours, the chance for showers and thunderstorms will 
gradually increase across higher terrain features Monday into 
Tuesday. As the center of the surface high shifts further east for
Wednesday and Thursday, even more humid air will advect north 
from the Gulf of Mexico. Instability will increase along with the 
moisture, triggering more widespread showers and thunderstorms for
Wednesday and Thursday. With southerly flow and mostly sunny 
days, temperatures will remain quite summerlike for the extended 
period. High temperatures will climb into the mid to upper 80s 
most afternoons, while lows dip only into the 60s most night.

Showers have just about ended in northern parts of our area with
stabilization after sunset and the departure of a midlevel trough
to the east. Clouds have been decreasing as well, which will
likely lead to fog development in areas that received rain earlier
today. The central and southern Valley still have some light wind
causing some mixing, so northern sections will be favored for fog
tonight. Dense fog may be more isolated in coverage so no Dense
Fog Advisory seems warranted at this point, but this will need to
be monitored overnight. The update will speed up the end of precip
chances to midnight and adjust cloud cover and temps to match the

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...This afternoon skies across 
the eastern Tennessee Valley were partly to mostly cloudy with 
isolated showers over southeast Tennessee and scattered showers 
and a few thunderstorms northeast sections. The most concentrated 
area over southwest Virginia and northeast Tennessee north and 
east of Morristown will affect the northeast corner the next few 
hours before weakening. Short range models show the showers and 
storms with best coverage next couple hours before decreasing 
after 6 pm. Upper low across mid Atlantic moves northeast tonight 
with weak high pressure building in Friday. Skies will gradually 
clear this evening and then become mostly after some patchy areas 
of fog. The fog may be locally dense in the northeast where some 
rain falls this evening. Lows will be below normal again tonight 
in the 50s with highs Friday several degrees warmer due to more 
sunshine. 

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Thursday)...The Eastern states 
upper trough finally departs by the weekend with a quiet Friday in 
store due to drier air building in across the Southern Appalachians 
in the prevailing northerly flow. An upper level ridge replaces the 
trough and hangs around well into next week. Subsidence in the ridge 
pattern should keep most of the region dry Saturday through Monday. 
Probability of precipitation in showers and thunderstorms gradually 
increases on the higher terrain features Monday into Tuesday as the 
subsidence inversion weakens. The southerly flow on the back side of 
the low level ridge over the Southeastern United States, otherwise 
known as the Bermuda high; brings increasingly humid air north from 
the Gulf of Mexico into Thursday. Instability will correspondingly 
increase leading to greater coverage of convection across the 
forecast area Wednesday and Thursday. The lengthy period of mostly 
sunny skies, under the influence of the ridge and a return to 
southerly flow in the low levels, will bring a good taste of Summer 
to the region. High temperatures will warm into the middle and upper 
80s while lows cool only to the middle and upper 60s.

A few more showers have developed this morning but area radars
still not showing much activity as of late morning. Temperatures
this morning were warming slightly warmer than forecast so have
adjusted upward. Also lowered rain chances slightly for the late
morning and early afternoon. Short range models still develop
widely scattered to scattered afternoon showers and a few storms.
Instability still looks minimal so no strong storms expected. MU
CAPE values less than 500 J/Kg and precipitable water values
around 0.9 inches. At the surface an inverted trough continues
over northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia. Also an upper 
low was located over the Mid Atlantic states and will move very 
slowly northeast through this evening. Shortwave energy rotating 
around it this afternoon to early evening will enhance shower and 
thunderstorm activity especially across the higher elevations of
the eastern mountains...northeast Tennessee and southwest
Virginia. Updated forecast sent.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

A few showers were present earlier this morning across portions of 
SW NC but have come to an end. The dry airmass in place across the 
Southern Appalachians should prevent any widespread fog issues this 
morning but could see some patchy fog around area lakes and rivers. 
Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a 
closed low spinning across the Ohio River Valley. At the surface, 
there is an inverted trough across the forecast area with easterly 
winds in NE TN and SW VA and northeasterly winds further to the 
south across the Central and Southern Valley. The atmosphere remains 
relatively dry for early June with PW values in the 0.7-0.8 range. 
These values are near the 10th-25th percentile for early June and 
are the main culprit for the lack of precipitation. 

For today, PW values will increase slightly across the area into 
the 0.9-1.0 inch range as another spoke of vorticity rotates 
around the closed low. The synoptic lift will be enough to over 
come the drier than normal conditions with scattered 
showers/storms forecast throughout much of the day. It appears the
best chances will be across the higher elevations where the 
terrain will add additional lift. Model soundings are not overly 
impressive with the MLCAPE values with the more aggressive values 
still under 500 J/Kg. Therefore, expect there will be a few 
isolated to scattered storms especially during the afternoon but 
do not anticipate any strong to severe storms at this time. The 
lower heights aloft, scattered showers/storms, and increased cloud
cover will lead to high temperatures well below average. Expect 
highs will top out 5-10 degrees below normal in the 70s across 
most Valley locations. The closed low will lift to the northeast 
late in the day into early Friday with northwesterly flow aloft 
and high pressure at the surface. Expect precip. chances will 
greatly decrease during the overnight hours. Clearing skies, light
winds, and lower than normal dewpoint values will allow for 
radiational cooling conditions overnight with lows dropping into 
the 50s across most Valley locations.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...

This period begins with the upper shortwave trough now east of 
the area, but the longwave trough still lingering. At the surface,
a ridge of high pressure will be settled into the area. By 
Saturday, the longwave trough gets east of here and an upper 
ridges builds in from the west. The ridge keeps a lock on the area
through Sunday. These factors should keep the area dry Friday 
through Sunday. 

Low level moisture will start to build into the area and the heart 
of the upper ridge slides to the east, and the models start to show 
some chances of precip.  However, there is good agreement that we 
will still be more under the influence of the upper ridge...now just 
to our east...through the end of this forecast period.  Will go 
slightly below guidance POPs for the Monday through Wednesday 
timeframe.  With hot surface temps and relatively warm upper level 
temps, would expect only marginal instability, so would expect 
thunderstorms, but non-severe storms.

Starting Sunday both Max and Min Temps should be above seasonal 
averages, and I've gone above guidance generally by about a degree 
or so each day.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Thursday)...Upper low continues to move 
slowly southward toward the area.  Deep convection very slow to get 
going, but will continue to have some low POPs in the northern and 
eastern sections this evening, but only for showers.

As the upper low and associated trough move through on Thursday, 
better low level moisture will be in place and there should be much 
better chances of showers and non-severe thunderstorms Thursday 
afternoon.  Might be some light fog, but not worth mentioning in 
grids and zones--just will keep that in the TAFS.  Went close to 
guidance temps.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...May have a few 
lingering rain showers across the far eastern mountains and 
southwest Virginia between 00z-03z Friday behind an exiting 
trough and vort max, but the sky is expected to clear overnight as
we see mid-level dry air advect into the region. With lingering 
low- level moisture, dry air aloft with clearing conditions, and 
light boundary layer winds, expect fog formation late Thursday 
night and early Friday morning. There may be some locally dense 
fog in the usual areas such as sheltered valleys and near lakes 
and rivers.

GFS and ECMWF are in fairly good agreement through the weekend and 
into next week. As the upper trough moves further east of the 
Appalachians on Friday, drier and warmer air advecting into the 
region should cap convection. Ridging at the surface and aloft 
continues to build on Saturday and Sunday resulting in warm, above 
normal temperatures. Warm mid-level air will limit convective 
development this weekend.

Ridging moves east early next week bringing return flow of Gulf 
moisture and cooling mid-levels. This will enhance instability and 
weaken capping producing scattered showers and thunderstorms during 
the afternoon and evening. With weak shear and weak synoptic 
forcing, expect ordinary pulse convection with highest concentration 
across the higher terrain of the mountains, plateau, and southwest 
Virginia.

Upper low pressure is sagging southward across the Ohio River into
northern Kentucky and continuing southward toward the area. There
is expected to be enough moisture and instability to get some 
diurnal showers maybe isolated thunder in our northern areas as 
the cooling continues aloft. Also looks like we will have some 
showers/storms developing in our eastern higher terrain from the 
Smokies northward. Interesting movement is forecast for this 
convection in NE TN / SW VA mountains, with light west winds aloft
and boundary layer winds from the north, looks like it will 
induce a slow west or northwest propagation. With this convection 
being diurnal, it should fade quickly this evening. Keeping Max

especially for areas in sheltered valleys and near local lakes and 
rivers. The higher dewpoint depressions across the region should 
prevent any widespread issues from fog like yesterday morning. 
Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a
closed low to the north that stretches from the Northeastern U.S.
westward into the Ohio River Valley. A second trough is to the 
south along the Northern Gulf. The trough to the north will sweep 
southward across the area late today and tonight. PW values will 
range from around 0.7-0.9 inches during this timeframe. These 
values are near the 10th-25th percentile for early June. The 
forecast area will be in the right entrance region of a 80-90 kt 
jet that will develop along the southern periphery of the closed 
low later today. The vort max will also pass through the region. 
With this, expect there will be a few showers or storms possible 
later today into the overnight hours mainly along the higher 
elevations where the terrain will provide additional lift. 
However, expect most areas will remain dry with too much dry air 
in place. Pleasant temperatures are forecast today with highs
below average in the 70s and lows in the 50s tonight across most 
valley locations.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...

An upper level trough centered across the central Appalachians 
will swing a vorticity axis through the southern Appalachians 
Thursday. This wave will help produce an inverted surface trough 
over the area.

GFS and NAM show the airmass becoming unstable during the afternoon 
with MLCAPES of 500-1000 J/kg. Expect scattered showers and 
thunderstorms to develop along the inverted trough and terrain 
features. Greatest coverage will be across the far eastern Tennessee 
Mountains and southwest Virginia. Main concern with these storms 
will be strong gusty winds due to dry air in the mid-levels and 
below cloud base. Hail CAPES will be large enough and Wet Bulb 
Zeros low, so the stronger storms could produce small hail.

Upper trough moves east of the Appalachians for Friday with drier 
air advecting into the region as well as mid-level warming capping 
any convection. For Saturday and Sunday, ridging both surface and 
aloft and continued mid-level warming will produce dry and warmer 
conditions.

Ridging moves east for Monday and Tuesday with return flow of Gulf 
moisture producing scattered showers and storms. Main forcing 
will be the terrain features, so greatest coverage anticipated 
there.

High clouds associated with a passing upper-level trough will
continue to thin out as they spread further to the south and east
overnight. A light rogue shower may linger until midnight or so
over the far southern Plateau and Valley, but otherwise, a dry 
night is expected. The residual boundary layer moisture in place,
however -- and the combination of a sky becoming mostly clear
later tonight (with decoupling winds), will lead to some localized
patchy fog. This fog is not expected to be as dense as last night,
but it still could become locally dense along rivers and lakes --
especially areas along and north of I-40. The cooler air mass in
place will also result in some very comfortable low temperatures
in the lower to upper 50s by daybreak Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Not seeing much on the radar early this morning with patchy fog 
currently developing across the Southern Appalachians. The cold front 
that will bring in a shot of cooler air is still to the north and 
stretches E-W near the Ohio River. Dewpoints across the area are 
still in the 60s and expect some patchy dense fog will be possible 
but not anticipating anything widespread enough for an advisory at 
this time. Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis 
indicates a closed low across the eastern Great Lakes into the Ohio 
River Valley. A shortwave trough will rotate around the western side 
of the closed low later this morning and push the surface boundary 
through the forecast area. Based on the current radar imagery and hi-
res model guidance, greatly reduced PoPs this morning with just 
slight chance to chance PoPs for the southern tier of counties or
so. Due to the lower PoPs will go ahead and drop the Flood Watch 
this morning. Drier air will advect in behind the boundary with PW
values in the 0.5-0.7 inch range by the end of the day across NE 
TN and SW VA. High temperatures today will generally be in the 70s
to low 80s. Clearing skies and light winds are forecast behind 
the surface boundary tonight with lows dropping down into the mid 
50s to low 60s with upper 40s expected in the higher elevations.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...

An upper level trough will swing southeast across the 
central/southern Appalachians for Wednesday and Thursday. An 
inverted surface trough will develop in response to the upper 
trough over the spine of the Appalachians. Models show this 
feature moving into east Tennessee for Thursday.

Models show airmass becoming unstable for Thursday afternoon with 
CAPES of 500-1000 J/kg. Expect scattered storms to develop with the 
main focus being the convergence along the inverted trough and 
terrain features. Main concern with these storms will be strong
gusty winds due to dry air in the mid-levels and below cloud 
base. Hail CAPES will be large enough and WBZ are low, so the 
stronger storms could have small hail.

Upper trough moves east of the Appalachians for Friday with drier 
air advecting into the region. For Saturday and Sunday, ridging both 
surface and aloft will produce dry and warmer conditions.

Ridging moves east for Monday with return flow of Gulf moisture 
producing scattered showers and storms, mainly along and south of
interstate 40.

.DISCUSSION...Models don't seem to be handling the meteorology too
well at mid evening. Precipitation has faded a bit across the
hills and valleys of East Tennessee. However, the cold front to
the north means business and remains associated with scattered  
convection. Nice northerly flow regime will continue to drive this
boundary south into the forecast area. Convergence along the 
feature in a still rather moist atmosphere present across the 
Southern Appalachians would lead to development of more showers 
and possibly some thunder through the night. That rainfall would 
argue for keeping the flood watch in place across the soaked 
landscape of Southeast Tennessee and Southwest North Carolina. 
Temperature forecast looks on track for the overnight.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Tomorrow)...
Showers with embedded thunderstorms will continue across the 
forecast area through the overnight hours as an upper level trough
swings through and a cold front approaches. Most storms should 
stay below severe limits, but with 500-1000 J/kg of MLCAPE and 
0-6kt shear values reaching 40kts, a few isolated wind or small 
hail reports can't be ruled out. In fact, SPC has upgraded SW VA 
and NE TN to a marginal risk of severe storms this afternoon and 
evening. The biggest threat today and tonight will be localized 
heavy rainfall, which may cause some localized flooding. With PWAT
values in the 1.75-2" range (near the maximum values observed for
early June), there definitely is enough moisture overhead. RFC 
flash flood guidance is around 2-2.5" in 3 hours, so if 
showers/thunderstorms train over the same area, the flood 
potential will increase. It looks like the most rain has fallen 
over the southernmost eastern TN and western NC counties today, 
where amounts up to 2.5" are common. Additionally, this area looks
like it will see the heaviest rain this afternoon, with some 
higher rainfall rates possible in thunderstorms. We're already 
seeing some rises on smaller creeks and streams, so we've gone 
ahead and issued a Flash Flood Watch through Tuesday morning to 
highlight the potential for flooding of urban areas, creeks, 
streams, roadways, and other poor drainage areas. Showers will 
taper off from north to south on Tuesday and skies will gradually 
begin to clear as the boundary pushes south of the forecast area. 
By Tuesday afternoon, the entire area should be dry.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...
H5 troughing over the eastern third of the U.S. will keep our 
area under mostly dry and mild weather for the middle and latter 
portions of the week. Some disturbances in the NW flow will 
squeeze out some rain showers mainly Wednesday and Thursday across
the northern third of the area as well as the spine of the 
mountains. High pressure will then build in from the west, 
bringing above normal temperatures for Saturday through Monday. 
Increasing dewpoints Sunday and Monday will help touch off mainly 
afternoon showers and thunderstorms by Monday.

Rain showers will continue across the area this morning. With very

However, a break around midday will allow instability to increase
a bit by the second round of precip this afternoon. Along with a 
bit better forcing later this afternoon ahead of an approaching
cold front and 0-6kt bulk shear values in the 20-30kt range, we 
could see a few thunderstorms develop. It still will not be a very
favorable environment and widespread severe storms are not 
expected today, but a few stronger storms are possible, and a few gusty
wind or small hail reports can't be ruled out. The biggest threat
today will be localized heavy rainfall, which may cause some

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

A wet start early this morning to start the work week. Widespread 
showers currently showing up on radar across the Southern 
Appalachians. There are a couple of different systems to discuss in 
the short-term forecast. Current water vapor imagery and RAP 
upper air analysis indicate a closed low near Texarkana that is 
beginning to transition into more of an open wave. The second 
system is to the north diving south out the Great Lakes region. At
the surface, there is a E-W front to the north stretching across 
the Great Lakes with a weak surface low under the closed low to 
the west. Southwesterly winds ahead of these systems continue to 
pump in high PW air into the region. PW values currently range 
from around 1.8-2.0 inches. These values are near the maximum 
values observed for early June. With this deep saturated profile, 
lapse rates are near moist adiabatic and haven't seen much in the 
way of lightning early this morning but there could still be a 
couple of rumbles of thunder early today. Additionally, there 
could be some areas of localized flooding this morning especially 
in areas of poor drainage.

For today, expect there could be a brief break in the precipitation 
mid to late morning as one shortwave trough progresses to the east 
before the next system arrives from the northwest. This break will 
allow for instability values to begin to creep up with SBCAPE values 
in the 1000-2000 J/Kg range this afternoon. As the trough currently 
across the Great Lakes moves into the Ohio River Valley later today, 
0-6 Km Bulk Shear Values will increase into the 30-40 kt range. 
Therefore, could see a few stronger to potentially marginally severe 
storms this afternoon with gusty winds and small hail being the main 
threats. Additionally, locally heavy rainfall will continue to be a 
possibility with PW values remaining near 1.8-2.0 inches. Although 
localized flooding will still be an issue do not anticipate things 
will be widespread enough for a flood watch. As of now, 3-hr FFG 
values are around 2-2.5 inches. Additionally, expect a brief break in 
the precipitation later this morning that will allow some time for 
things to recover. The upper low to the north will close off across 
the Eastern Great Lakes with several shortwave troughs rotating 
around the system. This upper level flow will push a cold front 
through the area tonight with drier and cooler conditions expected 
to begin late tonight into Tuesday. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...

A few showers may linger over the area into Tuesday with 
improving conditions expected from northwest to southeast 
throughout the day. Behind the exiting system...surface high 
pressure and dry northwest flow aloft will develop over the 
region. This will bring in cooler air for much of the extended. An
upper low dropping into the Ohio Valley mid week will pull in a 
few isolated light showers over normally favored northwest flow 
locations Wednesday through Thursday. The rest of the area will 
remain dry. By Friday the upper low will move off and no longer 
effect the Southern Appalachian Region. Model confidence becomes 
quite low by the end of the extended. Do expect to see a warming 
trend for Saturday and Sunday with temperatures warming to near 
normal levels. Also...may see some isolated to scattered 
convection during the weekend as a weakening frontal boundary 
moves through.

.AVIATION...

Widespread showers and storms expected throughout the TAF cycle.
Current batch of precipitation near CHA will continue to move NE
effecting TYS and TRI during the overnight hours. Removed VCTS
from the overnight period with little in the way of lightning
being observed. A brief break is possible in the precipitation
later this morning before the next system arrives this afternoon.
Included VCTS in the terminals after 18z with the possibility of
drier conditions late in the TAF cycle. Should be a challenging
period with MVFR to IFR visibilities possible in the heavier
downpours.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...The upper low to our west will 
drift east as an upper level trough digs into the region from the 
northwest.  Models depict rather high PW values across the area, 
although after this afternoon/early evening, available convective
energy during the overnight into tomorrow period looks less 
impressive. Given the abundant moisture, localized flooding will 
be possible in areas with persistent/multiple heavier 
showers/thunderstorms. Will mention in HWO, but threat does not 
appear to be widespread enough to warrant a flood watch at this 
point. MAV temps generally look reasonable for the short term 
period.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Saturday)...widespread showers will 
decrease through Monday night...with drier and cooler air filtered 
in along with the northwest flow. Tuesday morning...could see some 
isolated light showers...especially in the higher elevations where 
the northwest flow will keep lift possible...but any activity should 
be out of the area by mid day. Skies will clear quickly through the 
afternoon...with mostly clear skies expected through the week. 
Wednesday and Thursday afternoon...a low pressure moving through the 
Ohio Valley will bring wrap around moisture and lift for scattered 
showers possible in far NE TN and SW VA. 

Temperatures will slowly cool after the northwest flow sets up 
Tuesday...with low temperatures Tuesday night well below normal in 
the low to mid 50's. After Wednesday evening...high pressure settles 
in...with a gradual warming trend each day. High temperatures on 
Saturday will be near normal.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Another quiet night so far across the Southern Appalachians. The 
upper level ridge is barely holding on and will see things become 
more active today and tonight. Current water vapor imagery and RAP 
upper air analysis indicates a closed low to the west across the 
Southern Plains with another trough to the north diving out of 
Canada into the Northern Plains. At the surface, high pressure 
continues along the Eastern Seaboard with a front stretching across 
the Midwest into the Southern Plains. 

For today, the closed upper low to the west will make slow progress 
eastward. Concurrently, the trough to the north will dive quickly 
into the Great Lakes region. Both of these systems will weaken the 
ridge and height falls are forecast over the area today. 
Southwesterly winds will develop in the upper and mid-levels as the 
ridge weakens and will help bring in higher moisture values across 
the area. PW values will increase from south to north today with 
readings in the 1.7-1.9 inch range expected areawide by the end of 
the day. These values are over the 90th percentile for early June 
and expect widespread showers and storms across the area this 
afternoon. Due to this, increased PoPs to 70-90 percent this 
afternoon. SBCAPE values will range from around 1000-2000 J/Kg today 
with 0-6 km Bulk Shear less than 20 kts. Overall, there could be 
some stronger storms that briefly pulse up that could produce gusty 
winds and small hail but do not anticipate any severe weather. Due 
to the widespread precipitation and cloud cover, adjusted high 
temperatures down by a couple of degrees with forecast highs 
generally in the upper 70s and low 80s. Numerous to widespread 
showers and storms are forecast to persist into the overnight hours 
as multiple weak shortwaves continue to traverse the region. 
Additionally, the trough to the north will quickly race into the 
Ohio River Valley by Monday morning. Rainfall amounts over the short-
term forecast will generally be around 0.5-1.0 inches with higher 
amounts of 2-3 inches possible in some of the heavier downpours. 

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...

Will see a wet beginning to the extended. On Monday...an upper 
trough with an area of low pressure...that some model runs 
occasionally shows cut off...will track into the gulf states and 
increase low level moisture across the MRX CWA. Also...a weakening
cold front associated with the upper trough will push into the 
area as well. All this will provide good moisture...focus and lift
across the region for widespread showers and thunderstorms. The 
air mass should be marginally unstable and may see a stray strong 
storm. Also...with the deep moisture in place...minor localized 
flood is possible. The convection should slowly pull out of the 
area Monday night with a few lingering showers into Tuesday. For 
mid week...an upper low will drop into the Ohio Valley and may 
rotate in occasional light showers over far northern locations for
both Wednesday and Thursday. The rest of the area should be dry 
and cool with surface high pressure in place. Confidence on models
becomes quite low by the end of the period...but the upper low 
should have moved out and the next system still to our west for a 
dry day on Friday. The current model trends show a weakening 
system moving in around Saturday for a slight chance of showers 
and thunderstorms.

will breakdown today as a trough approaches from the west.
Southwesterly to southerly flow aloft will advect in deeper
moisture to the region. The main aviation challenge is timing the

.AVIATION...Much of the first half of the forecast period should
remain vfr as pressure remains high across the region. However,
deeper moisture and corresponding instability will be building
north out of the Central Gulf Coast in association with a weak
disturbance. This should lead to the development of scattered
showers and thunderstorms across the Great Valley. Development
would likely occur around 12z at cha with northward drift through
the day Sunday. Used prevailing thunder groups for Sunday but kept

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...The upper ridge over 
the region will break down as an upper level trough starts to move 
in. Moisture will increase across the area as the nearly stationary 
front to our south begins moving north. Expect showers and perhaps 
some thunder to affect mainly southern areas tonight, with more 
numerous showers and thunderstorms across the area on Sunday.  At 
this point chances for severe storms look to be on the low side for 
the short term period given unimpressive convective energy and wind 
shear. Mav temps look good overall so will stay close.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Friday)...The upper level trough 
will continue to move SE towards the Gulf Sunday night through 
Tuesday morning. Mid and low level winds will remain out of the SW. 
With CAPE values generally below 2000 J/kg and light winds 
throughout the atmosphere...would expected widespread showers and 
thunderstorms. No severe weather is expected...although with the PW 
values over the area...and the rainfall received the past several 
months...would expect a threat for localized flooding through the 
day on Monday.  

As the upper level trough continues to the SE...mid and low level 
winds will transition from a SW direction to a more W to NW 
direction...slowly decreasing moisture and warm air advection to the 
area. By Monday night...PW values drop from around 1.95 to just over 
1.00...with only light scattered showers expected Monday night 
through Tuesday morning...with these showers decreasing in coverage 
through the night.  

Tuesday through Friday...a low pressure system over the Great Lakes 
will move through the Ohio Valley...further influencing the winds to 
out of the NW. Drier and cooler air will advect in to the area. The 
rest of the long term is expected to be dry...with temperatures by 
Wednesday several degrees below normal. A ridge will settle over the 
area with flow largely from the north. Temperatures will warm each 
day...with high temperatures near normal expected by Friday. Models 
try to bring enough moisture and lift in to the area for isolated 
showers in the higher elevations each afternoon...though only 
included a slight chance in far NE TN and SW VA Wednesday
afternoon.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Quiet weather across the area early this morning. The stalled 
surface boundary is now just to the south and west of the forecast 
area. There may be a couple of areas of patchy fog this morning but 
visibilities are not expected to be as low as yesterday morning. 
Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate a 
ridge just to the west extending northward from the Lower 
Mississippi River Valley into Canada. This upper level ridge will be 
the main weather feature for today's forecast. 

Upper level heights will rise today as the ridge axis progresses to 
the east. These higher heights will lead to high temperatures in the 
80s across most valley locations and is the warmest day forecast 
over the next 7 days. The stalled boundary will linger around 
southern portions of the forecast area. PW values will vary a good 
deal from 0.4-0.6 inches in SW VA and NE TN to 1.3-1.5 inches across 
portions of the Southern Valley and Plateau. Due to this, have 
continued with low end PoPs for the southern row or two of 
counties. Not expecting anything widespread with the lack of lift.


The upper level ridge will breakdown tonight as an upper level 
trough dives quickly out of Canada and into the Great Lakes. 
Concurrently, a closed low to the west across Texas will slowly 
transition into an open wave. Southwesterly flow aloft will develop 
late tonight with the stationary boundary lifting to the north and 
deeper moisture beginning to advect into the region. Models are 
still struggling with the timing of the moisture return. The GFS is 
the quickest with widespread showers and storms expected in the 
Southern Valley and Plateau by 12z. The ECMWF, CMC, NAM and most 
other models are a little bit slower with higher PoPs holding off 
until after 12z. For now, have continued with 20-30 PoPs for the 
Southern Valley and Plateau from 06-12z. Overnight lows will range 
from mid 50s in SW VA north of the boundary to mid 60s In the 
Southern Valley south of the boundary.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...

Will be in an active weather pattern for the early part of the 
extended. Sunday and Monday will be the most unsettled...with an 
upper low developing and moving into the Mississippi Valley which 
will initially bring an old boundary north into our area and also 
pull in additional low level moisture. The track of the upper low 
remains uncertain but generally expected it to move east across 
the gulf or gulf states with an upper trough. moving in from the 
northwest. So with good moisture in place and focus and lift from 
the old boundary and an approaching low...will see high chance to 
likely thunderstorms occasionally develop and move across the MRX 
CWA for Sunday and Monday. Monday night...the upper low and a 
weakening frontal boundary approaching from the north will begin 
to push through and move south of the area for decreasing chance 
of convection. A few showers may linger into Tuesday...mainly over
the eastern portion of the area. An upper low from the departing 
weakening front will drop into the Ohio Valley and may rotate a 
few scattered light showers across far northern and possible some 
normal upslope areas on Wednesday. Dry northerly flow will filter 
in for a quiet and mild Thursday and Friday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...Some isolated convection 
has tried to get going across the south, but has had limited 
success so far. Still will keep the very low PoPs south for 
remainder of the afternoon. Weak surface high pressure centered to
our north will continue to extend into our area, and a relatively
dry air mass will remain through the period with just a bit more 
moisture south near what remains of the stalled frontal boundary. 
Tonight should be precip free, but some isolated convection may 
form Saturday afternoon across southern parts of the area near the
stalled front. MAV temps generally look reasonable, so will not 
stray far.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...Low pressure will 
track across the southeast on Sunday, helping to channel moist air
from the Gulf into our area. Combined with a weak boundary, this 
will help trigger showers and thunderstorms across the area by 
Sunday afternoon. A closed low will track across the mid-Atlantic 
Sunday into Monday, dragging a cold front through our area by 
Monday afternoon. This will provide a focus for more organized 
showers and thunderstorms. The cold front pushes east of the area 
overnight Monday and surface high pressure will build overhead for
the rest of the workweek. Overall, it should be mainly dry with 
just some light wrap around showers possible Tuesday and Wednesday
as the low pressure system slowly moves into the Atlantic. Upper 
level northwest flow behind the system will result in cooler 
temperatures for midweek as well, with highs generally in the 70s 
and lows in the 50s.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

A lone storm has developed over the last hour or so across the 
northern Plateau in Scott County. A stalled surface boundary bisects 
the forecast area and this storm formed along the boundary. Current 
water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a closed 
low across the Northeastern U.S. and Southeastern Canada. Closer to 
home, a weak shortwave can be noted across NE TN and SE KY rotating 
around the base of the longwave trough. Therefore, expect a few 
isolated showers/storms will be possible throughout much of the 
remainder of the morning. The stalled boundary is also leading to a 
plentiful supply of low level moisture across the area with light 
winds and dewpoints in the upper 50s to mid 60s. Already seeing 
several observations of visibility below a mile. The fog is patchy 
and do not anticipate a dense fog advisory at this time. 

For today, upper level heights will increase as an upper level ridge 
pushes in from the west. The stalled boundary will slowly sag 
southward with an isolated shower/storm possible across the Southern 
Valley and Plateau this afternoon. PW values are not overly 
impressive. Models are forecasting readings in the 1.3-1.4 inch 
range across the Southern Valley. These values are slightly above 
normal for early June. To the north of the boundary PW values will 
be in the 0.7-0.9 inch range in NE TN and SW VA. These values are 
near the 25th percentile for early June. Additionally, there will be 
a lack of forcing aloft with the upper level ridge beginning to move 
in across the region. Any convection that forms during the day will 
quickly diminish after sunset. 

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...

An old frontal boundary stretched south of the area will continue
to act as a focus for afternoon convection. A few of these 
showers and thunderstorms are expected to move north and reach 
into southern areas of the MRX CWA Saturday afternoon and evening.
The boundary will lift north...into the area as an area of low 
pressure tracks across the southeastern U.S. This will increase 
the chance of thunderstorm activity and expect to see scattered 
convection develop and move through the region Sunday into Monday.
A few showers and even some afternoon thunderstorms will linger 
over the region into Tuesday as the system pulls away from the 
area. Confidence decreases late in the period as model consistency
diminishes. Overall...the Wednesday/Thursday time frame is 
trending dry with northwest flow and cooler temperatures...through
could see weak wrap around showers reach into far northern areas 
on Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...Convection associated with some 
weak short wave energy has developed, especially around the northern 
plateau where best instability is located. Expect this to generally 
be gone by sunset. Models disagree a bit on available moisture for 
the short term, with the NAM more moist. However, given the NAM's 
recent overdoing of moisture/instability, will lean toward drier 
solution and keep PoPs below 15 and precipitation out for Friday 
despite not being highly confident that some isolated weak 
convection will not develop. Otherwise, quite a few high clouds 
overnight especially south, and plenty of sunshine expected for 
Friday. Will not stray far from MAV temps.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)... Latest model runs continue 
to trend drier for this weekend, especially Saturday with surface 
ridging holding on a bit longer. Greatly reduced PoPs for Saturday 
because of this, and kept Sunday PoPs in the chance category. High 
pressure gives way to a closed low moving in from the northwest on 
Sunday into Monday as moisture funnels into the area from the Gulf. 
Cold front should pull through the area Monday afternoon/night, 
bringing a better chance for more organized showers and 
thunderstorms. Temperatures will moderate back below normal for 
midweek as cooler air is pulled down from Canada behind this system. 
Surface high pressure will build over the central US for midweek as 
well, bringing dry conditions to much of the area. The only 
exception will be SW VA/far NE TN where lingering wrap around 
moisture from the slow-moving low over the Mid-Atlantic may produce 
a few showers for Tue/Wed.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...The deeper moisture and best
instability have been displaced south of the Southern Appalachian
region this morning. In the drier regime, there will only be a
slight chance for convection this afternoon, and it will be
limited mainly to the higher Cumberland Plateau terrain. The
lengthy period of uninhibited insolation will result in high 
temperatures around normal or slightly above this afternoon.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...The latest model runs 
have trended drier for the weekend, with the predominant flow 
through the column being NW with a ridge located near West TN and 
an upper low over Quebec. The forecast will trend PoPs downward as
well, with Friday being dry and just a slight chance on Saturday.
More summer-like temperatures will be coming on Friday and 
Saturday, with mid to upper 80s for most of the TN Valley. 

On Sunday the ridge gives way as a closed low drops SE across the 
Great Lakes region. The GFS and ECMWF have big differences in the 
strength and timing of this low, with the ECMWF being more bullish 
on precip as it has a stronger low. Will keep PoPs in the chance 
range for Sunday with confidence being low, which will continue into 
Monday as the low continues a slow SE motion. Passage of the cold 
front appears to be sometime in the Monday night/Tuesday time frame, 
after which time we should have a dry northerly flow with 
temperatures cooling beck below normal with the closed low being 
positioned in the vicinity of the Mid Atlantic coast.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...Weak frontal boundary to our 
northwest is forecast to sag south into our area tonight, but 
limited forcing and diminishing convective energy so other than 
some possible isolated convection early, much of the night should be 
precip free. Exactly where frontal boundary will stall is 
problematic, but again little forcing is expected near the boundary 
and convective energy looks very limited, so while cannot rule out a 
stray shower or storm especially southern areas tomorrow afternoon 
near what is left of the boundary, will continue to keep the 
forecast for Thursday precip free for now. MAV temps generally look 
to be reasonable, so only minor tweaks for the short term.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday Night through Wednesday)...
Thursday night looks relatively dry with a low chance of convection 
with surface high pressure nearly centered over the region. Should 
any storms develop earlier in the afternoon it would quickly 
dissipate after sunset Thursday night.

The closed upper low over SE Canada will cause northwest flow over 
the forecast area on Friday. Light westerly winds and stable air 
will preclude any thunderstorms from developing through Friday 
night.  

By Saturday afternoon, a quick moving shortwave will translate 
across SE Kentucky. Also, instability increases over the area as 
high pressure weakens over E TN. Chances for rain increase 
dramatically Saturday afternoon into Sunday. A strong shortwave will 
dive out of the Dakotas Sunday afternoon. The associated surface low 
over the Great Lakes region causes winds as far south as the Gulf to 
shift southwest pulling up abundant moisture to area. Forecast 
soundings indicate PW just over 1.75 inches for Sunday. Thankfully 
this system appears to bring some rain...possibly heavy at times. 
However, the severe threat looks minimal at this time.

Some timing differences in the ECMWF and GFS in regards to system 
placement but both models agree on a deep trough developing over the 
eastern US early next week. This would bring much cooler than normal 
temperatures and chances of rain showers through the middle of next 
week.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Maintained a medium chance
probability for convection today with adequate moisture and more
than sufficient cape expected across the Southern Appalachian
region. Additionally, there should be some convergence in the
vicinity of a stationary boundary over the Great Valley. Kept a
slight chance for a shower going this evening despite a gradually
stabilizing atmosphere due to the arrival of a midwest cool front
during the second period. Max temps should be tempered a bit today
with a few clouds around at times. 

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...Uncertainty remains high 
through the long term period due to large discrepancies between 
the models on the finer details. The general pattern through the 
rest of the week will be a weak front to our south with a W-NW 
flow aloft as a midlevel ridge axis will extend from GA across 
West and Middle TN. Forcing will be weak and any precip chances 
will depend on small disturbances in the flow aloft, which the 
models are not resolving well. The forecast will not change much 
from previous issuances, and will favor slight to low precip 
chances through Saturday. 

The pattern aloft will shift on Sunday as the ridge axis shifts east 
and low pressure tracks into the Great Lakes region. With the low to 
midlevel flow shifting to the SW, we will see increasing moisture 
across the region. Forcing ahead of a shortwave trough axis will 
bring higher rain chances Sunday, but will keep PoPs in the chance 
range due to model disagreements on timing with the frontal passage 
and the exit of precip. For Monday and Tuesday, the models indicate 
a closed low near the Great Lakes/OH Valley. Will have slight chance 
PoPs in northern sections due to uncertainties about its position 
this far out.

.AVIATION...The moist environment across the Great Valley should
allow for the formation of some mvfr fog this morning and possibly
ifr or lower ceilings. Tri would be the most likely spot for the
worst flight weather early this morning. The saturated low level
conditions will improve with heating around 12-14z. There could be
a couple showers and a thunderstorm or two around today in the
vicinity of a weak frontal boundary. Probability still too low to
include at any of the terminals in the valley.

.DISCUSSION...

A couple of surface boundaries to discuss this evening. The first
is a stationary boundary that stretches from near Memphis to the
northeast to Knoxville. This boundary is where the convection has
been limited to for the most part as seen on current radar
imagery. As expected, the convection is coming to an and across
the area and slowly decreased PoPs over the next couple of hours.
The second cold front is still well to the north and stretches
from Kansas City to near Chicago. This boundary will stay to the
northwest overnight and will be the main focus for scattered 
showers and storms tomorrow. The only other major change to the 
forecast was to add fog in for early this morning. Dewpoint 
depressions have dropped rapidly this evening and there is even 
some clearing to the north of the stationary boundary. Otherwise, 
just made some minor tweaks to the hourly temperature and 
dewpoint grids.

VFR conditions currently across the terminals with a few scattered
showers and storms. Kept VCTS in at KTYS through 01z. Showers and
storms are forecast to decrease in coverage and intensity over the
next hour or so as the sunsets. A few showers/storms will be
possible overnight but the coverage will not be enough to include
in the TAFs. MVFR to IFR fog will be possible near sunrise at
KTRI. A few showers and storms will be possible once again
tomorrow afternoon ahead of the surface boundary. However,
confidence is low on coverage and will leave the TAFs dry for now.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...Isolated to scattered
convection developing this afternoon...mainly along a boundary
stretched across the area. This activity will continue into the
evening hours. However..the convection is primarily diurnally
driven and expect it to dissipate close to sunset. For the rest of
the night into Wednesday...a weak frontal boundary will be
approaching the area. In advance of the boundary...scattered
convection will develop. A few isolated showers may push into the
area late tonight with a chance of shower and thunderstorm
activity increasing throughout the day on Wednesday. With little
upper level support and weak forcing...do not anticipate strong
thunderstorm development.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday Night through Tuesday)...At the beginning of 
this period we will be in an almost zonal flow aloft with the trough 
to the north and ridge to our south, while at the surface a very 
weak cold front will be washing through the area here.  The lee 
trough east of the mountains will make the wind field a little more 
organized over there, whereas the front will be hard to identify 
over here with such a weak wind field.  Will have some low POPs in 
the mountains Wed evening, otherwise dry.  By Thursday morning the 
front will be through the area as weak surface high pressure builds 
into the region.  By Friday the return flow should bring in some 
moisture and instability--best chances for thunder will be in the 
western half of the area. Then for the weekend it looks like an 
unsettled pattern with chances for thunderstorms each day with a 
very moist air mass making for the possibility of heavy rains. 
Finally by early next week, this system should be moving out of the 
area as high pressure builds in again.

.AVIATION...A weak frontal boundary will slowly approach the region 
this TAF period.  Ahead of the front...expect scattered convection 
to develop and move across East TN during the afternoon.  Coverage 
should be limited and will continue with VCTS at TAF sites for the 
mid afternoon hours.  If a showers or thunderstorm does move over a 
TAF site...be prepared for MVFR to IFR conditions with lowering CIGs 
and reduced VIS.  Some isolated convection is expected to remain 
over the region through the night...but coverage expected to be 
quite limited and will not mention in TAFs at this point. 
However...with recent rains...main see patchy fog develop towards 
morning.  This is mainly expected to effect the TRI area for local 
MVFR conditions.  A few lingering showers are possible into 
Wednesday morning but again coverage expected to be light enough to 
not impact TAF sites.

.Discussion...Model confidence remains quite low even for today's 
forecast...as they have not had a good handle on recent convection. 
Main concern for today is isolated to scattered convection 
developing over the area this afternoon.  There is little upper 
level support or forcing...so afternoon convection should be mainly 
diurnally driven.  As for temperatures...expect near to slightly 
above seasonal norms with high generally in the mid 70s to mid 80s. 
Current forecast on track and should only need to tweak any morning 
or early afternoon wording.

.AVIATION...A moist environment is in place across the Southern
Appalachian region early this morning slowing warming and drying
to some degree at the surface. Therefore, some ifr and even lifr
category flight conditions will remain in place for another hour.
Of course would expect vfr weather by 14z at each terminal. Most
of the remainder of the forecast period will be vfr. However,
there should be some convection around; especially late this
afternoon into the evening hours as a frontal boundary slips
slowly south out of the Ohio Valley. If a thunderstorm moves
across a terminal, flight weather could drop into the mvfr
category.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Thursday night)...
Confidence in the models is low through the short term period as
precip chances and QPF amounts have not panned out as they had
projected. Thus the short term forecast will undercut their PoPs,
and generally favor the drier SREF solution to the NAM and GFS. 

Today, a line of showers near the TN/KY border is expected to
continue to weaken as it tracks east, with little left of it by
the time it reaches our area. Lingering boundaries with it may
help focus storm development this afternoon, so will have PoPs
that favor northern areas today. With little forcing aloft, any
storms should be diurnally driven. Not buying into the NAM's high
QPF amounts tonight but will have slight chance PoPs late tonight,
rising to chance PoPs Wednesday when we will have a broad trough
axis and a weak surface trough/front crossing the region. Thursday
looks dry as the surface boundary settles to our south and the
850-700 mb flow turns to NW behind the exiting trough. 

Temperatures for the period will lean toward the warm side of MOS
guidance for high temps and on the cool side for lows, with the 
expectation that models are overdone on precip and cloud cover.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Monday)...
Some forecast uncertainty noted in the models through the period.
The superblend raises probability of precipitation into the first
half of the weekend with some unstable air in place with some 
short wave lift riding east across the Mid South. Stayed with high
chance pops for showers and thunderstorms through the second half
of the weekend as a cool frontal boundary shifts into the 
Southern Appalachian Region. At the end of the long term on Monday
held onto a little lower chance pops due to uncertainty in the 
timing of the departure of the Eastern United States long wave 
trough and possible shorter wavelength features rotating through 
the pressure trough's base.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...As a weakening frontal
boundary slides south and east of the area...it will continue to
act as a focus for evening convection. The air mass is only
minimally unstable with only a slight chance of strong to
marginally severe storms...and mainly along our southern border.
This activity will move out of the area during the evening for
mostly dry and quiet conditions later night. A secondary frontal
boundary will be approaching the area from the northwest on
Tuesday. This feature will then be the main focus of afternoon
convection. As a result...expect scattered showers/thunderstorms
to form over the region ahead of the approaching front on Tuesday
afternoon. With little upper level support and limited CAPE...do
not expect to see more than a stray storm become strong to
marginally severe.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday Night through Monday)...The long term period 
looks rather unsettled with a stalled boundary setting up across 
the area as a few reinforcing fronts push into the SE US 
throughout the week before they too become nearly stationary. 
Preponderance of guidance suggests that the boundary will set up 
along the TN/GA border. Unfortunately, the reinforcing boundaries 
will continue to elevate pcpn chances area wide as they progress 
southward to merge with stationary front. Exception to unsettled 
weather looks to be Thursday when weak surface high coupled with 
broad and weak ridging aloft act to somewhat stabilize and dry 
things out for a brief 18-24 hour period. 

By Friday morning, the surface high has shifted east and return flow 
from the Gulf begins to pump ample low level moisture back into the 
area. With dewpoints approaching 70 deg by Saturday and deep layer 
moisture, with PWs in excess of 1.5 inches across the area, as 
indicated in both ECMWF and GFS, moisture will not be an issue in 
any storms that may develop. At present, both ECMWF and GFS are 
indicating enough CAPE/shear to help any storms that do develop to 
become organized. However, the devil is in the details, and timing 
of frontal boundary looks to be overnight Saturday into Sunday, 
which would help to limit prospect for strong storms. However, both 
models also indicate some pre-frontal activity Saturday and Saturday 
evening, which could result in more instability to work with. Bottom 
line, it is a bit too soon to have too much confidence in a strong 
storm threat over the weekend. At present, certainty will be 
increasing POPs over the weekend with the potential for some 
localized flooding issues in heavy downpours or training cells.

By Monday, cold front expected to push east of the area. However 
with upper level trough still lingering over Middle TN, as indicated 
in both GFS and ECMWF, chance POPs across much of the area are held 
over through the end of the fcst.

.Discussion...Models continue to have rather poor consistancy and

However...the best trend is for afternooon convection to develop 
along a weakening boundary dropping southest across the region. This 
should keep late afternoon/evening convection generally south of I-
40 with best chance along the TN and GA border and into our NC 
counties. This is in good agreement with the current forecast so 
will make minimal changes to the forecast but will remove morning 
wording in the morning update.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Models differ on the location and timing of convective activity
across the area today. The NAM keeps storms across southern
sections, while the HRRR spreads storms north all the way to VA.
The RAP, GFS, and SREF support the general idea of the southern 
sections having most of the precip today, and given the W-NW flow
at 850 mb and lack of instability that is expected in the northern
half, this solution seems realistic. So the forecast will have
likely PoPs in southern sections but take chance PoPs into NE TN.
A weak cold front and a midlevel shortwave trough will move 
through in the evening and take precip out of the area around
midnight. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...
Frontal boundary should be stalled out along the TN/GA border on 
Tuesday. This will be the focus for shower and thunderstorm 
development, so most of our forecast area will stay dry, but 
locations south of Interstate 40 could see some activity on Tuesday. 
Secondary frontal system will move through overnight and will bring 
increasing clouds and maybe even some light precipitation chances. 
Sunnier weather moves in on Wednesday/Thursday as we get drier air 
moving in from the west/northwest. This will only last for a brier 
period of time before winds start to swing out of the south and 
bring in increasing moisture. This increase in moisture will combine 
with a shortwave moving over us and lead to increasing precipitation 
chances at the end of the work week and into the weekend. These days 
look to see scattered thunderstorms and forecast soundings are 
hinting that we could have enough CAPE available to cause some 
storms to be strong over the weekend. But am not too confident on 
this yet as the models are handling the moisture and available CAPE 
differently at this point.

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Memorial Day/...
Clouds still hanging around this afternoon, creating partly to
mostly cloudy and cooler conditions. However, some partial
clearing has allowed temperatures to sneak into the mid to upper
70s as of 3 PM EDT -- and could top out a degree or two higher 
before sunset. A few weak boundaries in place across the area
could serve as a focus for an isolated storm or two through early
evening, though there is not hardly an instability to work with,
so a strong to severe storm threat is quite low. Models want to
keep things relatively dry overnight, but the remnant
outflow/front across northern Alabama is progged to get going late
tonight. This activity may eventually work it's way into areas
south of I-40 late tonight into Memorial day (Monday) morning.
This activity will be scattered in nature, with showers and
thunderstorms possible. A few isolated to perhaps widely 
scattered strong storms are possible through the afternoon, but 
the best chances for anything severe will be well to the south 
along/near the boundary. 

.LONG TERM /Monday Night through Sunday/...
The front moving through the region today and Monday will begin to 
stall out near the TN/GA border early this week. Another cold front 
will move south from the Ohio Valley late Tuesday and Tuesday night. 
This system does not appear to have as much moisture with it and 
should be drier with just a few showers or thunderstorms directly 
along the frontal boundary. This front will also become stationary 
near northern Georgia and provide a focus for shower and 
thunderstorm development, especially in the afternoon and evening 
hours. At this point, it appears that most of the convection 
potential around the middle of the week should be focused generally 
south of I-40 closer to the stationary front. Just a slight change 
in the location of this boundary would result in a shift in 
precipitation coverage. Later in the week, southwesterly flow is 
expected to develop as the lingering frontal boundary moves 
northward and ushers in a tropical-like airmass for Friday through 
the weekend. Model solutions begin to diverge on how to handle an 
expected system next weekend with the ECMWF showing a stronger low 
pressure system across the Great Lakes with a quick moving cold 
front and the GFS showing a weaker and slower system.

Any lingering showers have dissipated this morning for the most
part, except for an area of light showers across middle TN that
will be weakening as it moves into the Cumberland Plateau around
midday. Clouds will hang round for most of the day, helping to 
keep temperatures cooler by a few degrees. Still, am expecting 
some breaks to develop by the mid to late afternoon -- which will 
help warm us up into the upper 70s to lower 80s across the Valley.
Some modest instability may also develop in the afternoon to 
warrant a few scattered thunderstorms that will likely develop on 
any lingering boundaries from last night's storms. A localized 
strong to perhaps marginally severe storm is possible, but not 
expecting anything widespread or organized like the activity last 
night.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Latest HRRR depictions of convection in the region do not appear to 
be placing it accurately, as storms have moved farther south than 
the HRRR shows. Earlier storms in our area have had a stabilizing 
effect, so no severe threat is expected through the morning as 
previously forecast. Once the trailing stratiform precip exits later 
this morning, we should have a stable and mostly dry day with only 
low/slight precip chances through the afternoon. Breaks in the 
mid/high cloud cover should bring temps into the upper 70s/lower 80s 
this afternoon. Tonight, the approach of a shortwave trough and 
surface cold front should bring another round of storms, but weak 
instability and forcing should result in a low/marginal severe 
threat. 

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...
The front that moved into our area at the end of the weekend is 
forecasted to stall out by Monday morning. Wherever this boundary 
ends up will be the focus for additional showers and thunderstorms 
in the early part of the week. Current models forecast it to stall 
out somewhere north of the TN/GA border. So the highest 
precipitation chances on Monday/Tuesday will be in Southwest TN/far 
SW North Carolina in our area. Boundaries continue to slowly move 
around the area leading to shower and thunderstorms chances most 
afternoons this work week. Unfortunately the models are having 
difficulty in handling where/when the storms will form. Better 
confidence in the forecast will come when the mesoscale models are 
able to have a crack at the systems, but until then will keep 
widespread precipitation chances throughout the week. More 
widespread rain chances move in over the weekend ahead of an 
approaching cold front at the end of the next weekend.

315 PM EDT Sat May 27 2017

.SHORT TERM /This Afternoon through Sunday/...
Complex 12 to 24 hours across the eastern Tennessee Valley and
Southern Appalachian region due to the threat for scattered to
potentially widespread strong to severe thunderstorms. 

Morning cloud cover continues to break up as heating is rapidly 
breaking the capping inversion in place. Earlier convection 
across NW TN dissipated as it tracked into the Plateau, but has 
laid a couple of outflow boundaries along the I-40 corridor and 
across the Northern Plateau back into southern KY. Additionally, a
weak front will be in the vicinity later on this evening across 
SW VA and southern KY. These boundaries will serve as a source 
and focus for convection later on by the late afternoon and 
evening as shown all of the mesoscale models. The peak timing of 
this activity will be 4 PM to 10 PM EDT, with coverage being 
scattered in nature at around 40-60 percent. In addition, an 
upper-level perturbation/shortwave that will drop of the mid- 
Mississippi Valley toward the Southern Appalachians later this 
afternoon and evening. This may provide enough forcing to overcome
the lingering inhibition currently in place by around 20-22z 
later this afternoon.

As noted in the morning discussion though, a favorable 
environment exist for any of this activity to quickly become 
strong to severe. The main threats will be large hail and 
downbursts. MLCAPE values are progged to be in the 2000-2500 J/kg 
range, with MUCAPEs over 3000 J/kg at times. Hail CAPEs (1500 J/kg
and DCAPEs over 1000 J/kg) will create a very favorable 
thermodynamic environment for strong updrafts, capable of 
supporting the aforementioned threats. Bulk shear values are quite
high in the 40-50 kt range across the area, though unidirectional
in nature -- thus an ESE storm motion is expected. Straight 
hodographs in this shear environment would favor organized, 
multicell clusters and supercells (as well as numerous splitting 
cells). A low-end tornado threat will exist thanks to the presence
of these boundaries -- though a less favorable 0-1 km shear
profile limits this. Still, areas to watch will be supercells 
that can form along boundaries with a localized backed wind 
profile.

The forecast for tonight into Sunday is less certain. Mesoscale
models do, however, continue to show a much faster progressing MCS
pushing out of NW and Middle TN into northern AL and the
Central/southern Valleys of East Tennessee late tonight. The main
question will be the exact timing and strength. Lower res models
are slower, but may be underestimating the higher forward
propagation that can occur in higher CAPE environments. Thus,
favored the mesoscale models (HRRR/NSSL-WRF/3-km NAM) over the
GFS/NAM-12 solutions. Damaging straight-line winds would be the
main threat with this activity.

Storms will weaken as they push across the area Sunday morning and
may leave a lull in precipitation (thanks to a more stable air
mass) for most of the morning and afternoon. If some heating can
occur during the late morning thru mid afternoon, a third round of
severe storms is possible late Sunday afternoon, evening and
overnight -- along/near where the front stalls out. This part of
the forecast remains fairly uncertain at this time. 

.LONG TERM /Sunday Night through Saturday/...
Will remain in an active weather pattern early in the extended as
a weakening cold front moves through the Southern Appalachian 
Region. A line of convection is expected to develop along/ahead of
this frontal boundary...effecting the MRX CWA overnight Sunday 
into Monday morning. With recent convection...the air mass in 
place should be only weakly unstable and the chance of strong to 
severe storms is limited. The frontal boundary is expected to 
stall just south of the TN/GA boarder Monday night and could see 
scattered convection continue along our southern boarder Monday 
night and Tuesday. Models begin to diverge Wednesday through the 
end of the extended and confidence is low. Current trend is to 
remain in a wet...unsettle pattern with the boundary remaining in 
the vicinity Wednesday and Thursday and the next system moving in 
around the Friday/Saturday time frame. All of this will keep 20 to
40 POPs in place over our area through the last half of the 
extended.

.DISCUSSION...
Complex weather situation unfolding today, with the **potential**
for some strong to severe thunderstorms from early this afternoon
through late this evening **if** the current capping inversion in
place now, weakens. As might be expected in this situation, there
have been plenty of fluctuations within the models (particularly 
the mesoscale ones) on if this will occur and how this day will 
play out. The NAM-3/NAM-12 and NSSL-WRF have been most consistent 
showing the current activity over NW TN weakening this morning 
(due to the cap) and then redeveloping late this afternoon across 
the region once the cap breaks. The HRRR (as is sometimes the 
case) has been much more inconsistent with this afternoon's
activity. Some runs have shown the CAP holding, while others have
shown robust convective signals in the 21-02z time period. 

In addition to gradual boundary layer heating, a feature that 
will aid in overcoming any inhibition will be a an upper- level 
perturbation/shortwave that will drop of the mid-Mississippi 
Valley toward the Southern Appalachians later this afternoon and 
evening. This may provide enough forcing to overcome any lingering
inhibition in the early to mid afternoon and getting things going
later today. The upstream convection will weaken (as mentioned) 
as it moves into the area by midday. However, it still may lay out
a outflow boundary or two somewhere -- which could also help to 
initiate/focus convection later on. 

If/when the cap does break, several environmental parameters are 
in place that will allow storms to quickly go severe. Particularly,
with respect to large hail and downbursts. MLCAPE values are 
progged to be in the 2000-2500 J/kg range, with MUCAPEs over 3000 
J/kg at times. Hail CAPEs (1500 J/kg and DCAPEs over 1000 J/kg) 
will create a very favorable thermodynamic environment for strong 
updrafts, capable of supporting the aforementioned threats.

Bulk shear values are quite high in the 50-60 kt range across the
area -- though generally unidirectional in nature (ESE). Straight
hodographs in this shear environment would favor organized,
multicell clusters and supercells (as well as numerous splitting 
cells). The 0-1 km shear is not as favorable for tornadoes as
other days, but the presence of a couple boundaries may enhance
that some -- especially if a localized backed wind profile is
realized. 

A surface cold front may approach SW Virginia around 00z, also
serving as a source for severe weather in and around the northeast
zones around sunset (00-03z). 

One final note (though this is outside of the today period).
Mesoscale models are showing an earlier arrival time for the MCS
overnight. This is something to watch very closely as we head 
into the afternoon forecast package. MCS features can tend to
propagate faster in higher CAPE environments than the lower res 
models sometimes realize.

325 AM EDT Sat May 27 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Advection of warm/moist air around the 850 mb level is bringing 
broken to overcast cloud cover to our area early this morning.
Forecast soundings show a strong capping inversion above this
moist layer, with an elevated mixed layer above that. The cloud
cover and cap should keep the area dry through the morning and
early afternoon as convection will be hard to develop in such
conditions without forcing. This will change in the late
afternoon, around 20Z according to the HRRR and RAP, when the MCV
associated with convection in the Ozarks begins to provide the
forcing needed to break the cap over Middle TN. A 35 kt 850 mb 
jet over N AL begins to nose into our SW sections around this 
time, and an upper jet streak entrance region will aid divergence 
aloft as they move E-SE into the Cumberland Plateau. Large hail 
will be the main threat with storms with the steep midlevel lapse 
rates, and high DCAPE values suggest as wind threat as well. 
Tornado parameters suggest some TOR potential for southern parts 
of the area where the RAP shows SRH values of 150-200 m2/s2 and 
southerly inflow will be undisturbed. Localized flooding may be
possible where training storms occur. The most likely timing of 
storms appears to be 21Z- 03Z, and will have PoPs in the likely 
and categorical range during this time.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...
On Sunday, with another day of warm temperatures, we will see 
another chance for showers and thunderstorms ahead of the 
approaching frontal boundary. Better forcing mechanisms will be 
closer to the front off to our west, but we could still see some 
strong to severe storms in our area. Unfortunately confidence is 
low with regards to strength and timing of the storms. Will have 
to monitor how much of a cap we have in place as some of the 
forecast soundings are suggesting, which would lead to a delay in 
convective initiation and less storms across our area. Another 
factor which will complicate things is how much the environment 
gets worked over from storms on Saturday, or if these storms last 
longer into the night or leave outflow boundaries in the area for 
storms to initiate on Sunday. Again, confidence is low, but the 
Cumberland Plateau looks to have the best chance to see storms in 
our forecast area.

Frontal boundary very weakly moves through as we start the work 
week, but depending on how slow it moves and how far southeast it 
traverses, we could see some extended precipitation activity near 
the Southern Appalachian mountains on Monday. As we get to the 
middle of the work week confidence in the models decreases even 
further as they start to diverge with their solutions. Secondary 
front will make it's way into our area by the middle of the week. 
Ahead of the frontal boundary we could see an increase in moisture 
over the area and as the front passes through more showers and 
storms develop along it. However the long range models disagree with 
the timing of the systems and how much moisture will be associated 
with them (and therefore how much precipitation we might see). Have 
gone ahead with maintaining low end precipitation chances until the 
models have better resolution with this system. After this secondary 
front moves through models continue to diverge. The GFS wants to 
keep the front to our southeast and keep us mostly dry through the 
end of the work week and into the weekend. The ECMWF, however, wants 
to stall the boundary out near us and keeps nearly continuous rain 
over the area through the work week, the weekend, and into next 
week. Have gone ahead and kept slight chance for precipitation 
through the extended part of the forecast, but these will definitely 
be changed as the models (hopefully) come into better agreement over 
the next few days.

Scattered to broken VFR clouds will be increasing overnight and
through the morning, becoming broken to overcast by mid day.
Clouds bases will lower during this time but should remain VFR.
Storms are expected to move into the area from the west this
evening, likely around 00Z, give or take two hours either way, 
and the storms will bring TS with MVFR vis and cigs to all TAF 
sites. Gusty winds and large hail may be possible with the
strongest storms.

.DISCUSSION...
Forecast remains on track for tonight with only minor tweaks made
to temps and sky cover based on current obs and model timing.

Clouds will increase from the northwest tonight. An ongoing MCS
over the Ohio Valley tonight still looks like it could push an 
outflow boundary into the northern part of the forecast area
Saturday morning. This boundary combined with a weak front should
provide enough of a focus for convection to fire along during the
afternoon and evening hours. By tomorrow afternoon, models are
showing a moist, highly unstable airmass overhead. If the 
boundaries provide enough forcing to overcome the weak cap, some 
strong to severe storms should quickly develop with large hail 
and damaging winds the primary threats.

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Saturday/...
High pressure ridge will still be in control overnight, promoting
a mostly clear sky with some light winds across the region. The
clear sky will allow for good radiational cooling after sunset,
with temperatures quickly dropping into the 70s to upper 60s. Some
higher dewpoints across the area, however, will help keep lows 
from dropping as low as the previous night -- only bottoming out 
into the upper 50s to mid 60s by early Saturday morning.

The potential for an active severe weather day will exist on
Saturday, though it will be dependent on a number of factors.
Moist, Gulf air will continue to stream into the area from the
southwest as the aforementioned upper-ridge over the Gulf scoots
off to the southeast. This will allow a weak front to drift from
the Ohio River closer to the Tennessee Valley into Southern 
Kentucky. Some of the latest guidance does suggest that 
convection overnight along the front may sent a outflow 
boundary(ies) into the region (perhaps along the I-40 corridor) by
the late morning. This feature could serve as a focus for 
convection later on in the afternoon -- along with the front 
itself. Given the highly unstable airmass (with MLCAPEs at around 
2500-3000 J/kg), this feature(s), may be enough to overcome the 
inhibition that is also progged to be in place. Should this occur,
any storm that does develop will quickly become strong to severe,
with large hail and damaging downburst winds possible (thanks to 
drier air near the surface). However, exact timing and the 
scope/coverage is uncertain at this time. The greatest threat will
likely favor areas across southwest Virginia and other locations 
north of the I-40 corridor. 

Overall, do think there is a good chance for at least a few
scattered severe storms during the afternoon and evening, but the
chances may not be as high as those later on Saturday night and on
Sunday. Still, those with outdoor plans on Saturday should 
closely monitor the weather. 


.LONG TERM /Saturday Night through Friday/...
Any ongoing convection Saturday afternoon will linger into 
Saturday evening for a continued chance of thunderstorm activity. 
The air mass will remain unstable overnight with low level 
moisture increasing. Additional convection could move in towards 
morning with the remnants of a convective complex approaching the 
area. A cold front will push towards the area on Sunday with a 
line of organized showers and thunderstorms is expected to move 
across the area for the afternoon. Throughout the Saturday night 
and Sunday time frame...with the instability in place and an 
approaching 850MB jet...we could see a few storms become strong to
severe. The main threat is expected to be strong...gusty 
thunderstorm winds and large hail. A second line of convection may
form Sunday night into Monday for an additional round. A few 
showers may linger into Monday evening as the front exits the 
area. Should briefly be between systems for Tuesday. 
Wednesday...models trending towards bring in a weak/dissipating 
frontal boundary. Little moisture or energy associated with the 
feature and will only put in low POPs. Confidence becomes quite 
low by the end of the extended but should see the next system 
approach the area around the Thursday/Friday time frame for our 
next chance of convection

A ridge of high pressure is in place across the region today,
resulting in a complete 180-degree change from yesterday. A mostly
sunny and dry day is expected, with only some few to scattered Cu
fields builds by the afternoon. The dry, southerly flow and 
strong capping inversion will prohibit rain chances and low 
temperatures to climb into the upper 70s to mid 80s across the

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)... 
Clouds over SW VA and NE TN will continue to decrease early this 
morning as the upper trough over the Mid Atlantic states tracks 
offshore. Through today, we will have a dry NW flow across the area 
as a mid/upper ridge moves across TN/KY, allowing for mostly sunny 
skies and highs climbing closer to normal levels, in the upper 70s 
north to mid 80s south. Tonight, the ridge will be to our east and 
models show a shortwave trough crossing KY. Moisture and lift with 
this disturbance stays north of our area near the OH River and WV, 
so the forecast will keep dry conditions for tonight with increasing 
cloud cover.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...
Saturday will be the most active day of this forecast as we sit 
under a ridge with a warm front just north of the area. 
Temperatures look to warm up enough that we could see some 
convection in the afternoon/evening. Forecast soundings show that 
there will be a good amount of CAPE (approximately 1000-2000 J/Kg)
and enough shear (20- 30 kt) to sustain thunderstorm activity. 
The environment suggests that any storms that do become strong or 
severe will be capable of strong straight line winds and even some
large hail. The NAM is currently forecasting for there to be a 
decent cap in place, which it forecasts to hinder thunderstorm 
development. If the NAM does end up being the correct solution 
then thunderstorms would still develop, but be much more 
scattered. In our forecast area locations north of Interstate 40 
have the highest chances to see strong to severe storms on 
Saturday. 

A frontal boundary should move through on Sunday night/Monday 
morning and will continue the rain chances on Sunday/Monday. Timing 
of the front means that it will only impact temperatures a bit on 
Monday (only about 5 degrees cooler). After the front moves through 
we should see a break in precipitation chances... However models are 
hinting at a secondary frontal boundary moving through on 
Tuesday/Wednesday but with the drier air behind the initial front 
precipitation chances look pretty meager for this second system. Low 
level moisture begins to build back in at the end of next week 
leading to another possible round of showers and thunderstorms at 
the tail end of this forecast.

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Friday/...
An upper-level low pressure system centered across eastern
Kentucky will slowly depart the this evening and overnight. A
shortwave trough associated with this feature has brought some
widespread cloud cover to the central Valley and points north and 
east, along with a broad area of light rain showers. This cool, NW
flow and the clouds/precipitation will keep temperatures peaking 
in the upper 50s to lower 60s this afternoon. Elsewhere to the 
south, breaks will allow highs to peak in the low to mid 70s. This
NW flow and cloud cover to the north will linger overnight, 
resulting in some gusty winds along the Blue Ridge and Cumberland 
Mtns along the KY/VA and TN/NC border across upper east Tennessee.
However, precipitation should generally wane late this evening to
around midnight.

Clouds will quickly break up by late tonight into early Friday
morning as high pressure and drier air builds into the region. A
wind shift to the south and ample sunshine will allow highs to
climb back into the 80s areawide -- allowing the soils to begin to
dry out a bit. 

.LONG TERM /Friday Night through Thursday/...
Will be in an active weather pattern throughout the extended. 
Friday night into Saturday...flow aloft becomes zonal with a 
couple of weak short waves tracking along the upper flow. Could 
see isolated convection develop over northern locations late 
Friday night with the initial weak wave. Saturday...with diurnal 
heating and increased low level moisture...the air mass will 
destabilize. With another wave moving in...expect scattered 
thunderstorms to form over the region. A few storms may become 
strong to marginally severe for Saturday afternoon and evening. A 
frontal boundary will then move in and become the main weather 
feature for Sunday and Monday. The atmosphere will remain unstable
and with the added energy from an 850MB jet and stronger lift 
from the boundary...expect widespread organized convection for 
Sunday afternoon. A few storms may become strong to severe. The 
boundary will remain in the vicinity on Monday and additional 
scattered convection is expected. Flow along again become zonal 
from Tuesday through Thursday and expect isolated to scattered 
convection each day.

.DISCUSSION...
A weak shortwave trough is bringing another shot of cool air and a
weak cold front -- with some rain showers to most of the region
today. The highest chances for rain will favor upper East
Tennessee and Southwest Virginia which will be closest to the
center of the low (located over eastern Kentucky). These showers
there will peak in coverage and intensity between 18-00z, with
tapering off occurring later this evening. The clouds and rain 
will keep high temperatures on the cool side and only in the low 
to mid 60s. 

Elsewhere to the south and west (across the southern 
Plateau and Valley), some breaks in the cloud cover will result in
some better heating. Rain showers should taper off by the early 
afternoon there as well -- allowing highs to reach the low to mid
70s. 

As a result, have a strong PoP gradient for the afternoon. 
Have slight chance to below mentionable PoPs for areas south and 
west and Likely to categorical for areas to the north and far 
east.

VFR flight conditions across the TAF sites early this morning will 
give way to MVFR at TRI/TYS between 14-16Z, and continue through 20-
22Z. At that time, last wave of jet energy will produce showers 
across TRI, and to a lesser extent at TYS, reducing visibility and 
lowering ceilings.

This wave will move east of the area this evening with return to VFR 
conditions.

Besides the showers, tightening pressure gradient with incoming jet 
energy will produce strong westerly winds, especially at TYS and TRI.
Gusts over 25kts are expected today.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...An upper low will move across
the eastern Ohio Valley Today. Associated short-wave will swing
across eastern Kentucky into southwest Virginia and northeast
Tennessee. Divergence along with this wave will produce an area
of showers, mainly along and north of interstate 40. The
tightening pressure gradient associated with this wave will
produce a 850mb jet of 35-45kts. Breezy conditions are expected
with gusts up to 35kts, especially across the higher elevations of
southwest Virginia and northeast Tennessee. Wind speeds are close
to advisory criteria.

Plenty of rain/clouds will produce unseasonably cool conditions
across southwest Virginia/northeast Tennessee today.

For this evening, the upper trough axis will move east of the
Appalachians ending the rain chances with sky cover clearing.
Winds decouple, but remain breezy enough to help keep fog
development limited.

.Long Term (Friday through Wednesday)...
A dry day on Friday as upper low lifts NE toward New England and 
broad ridge axis begins to build in across the area. A series of 
shortwaves begin moving across the ridge Friday night that will 
increase POPs, particularly over the northern half of the area by 
Saturday. With low level return flow beginning in earnest on 
Saturday, temperatures will climb back into the middle to upper 
80s across much of the area as dewpoints climb back into the 
middle to upper 60's by Sunday. With plenty of instability area 
wide Saturday, afternoon and evening showers/tstms will be 
possible. Greatest chances will be found over the northern half of
the area where expected CAP is weakest. Ridge axis shifts east by
Sunday in advance of deepening Great Lakes low. Continued strong 
instability and eroding CAP will bring likely tstm POPs back into 
the fcst. Approaching upper level jet by late Sunday could help in
making some of those tstms strong to marginally severe mainly 
over the northern half of the area where the instability and jet 
dynamics are best combined. By Monday upper level flow is becoming
parallel to the surface front, slowing it's progression as it 
moves across the area and prolonging the period of chance POPs 
through the holiday. Beyond Monday, much of the area remains in 
slight chance POPs through Wednesday as broad troughing aloft 
persists with a few weak spokes of shortwave energy rotate across 
the area.

One more round of showers and/or storms to move through KTRI, then

Clouds look like they will hang in. For Thursday, models in very
good agreement that small area of good lift and moisture will push
into KTYS and KTRI area during the day. Right now would expect
period of light to moderate rain at those two sites. Will keep
conditions on the pessemistic side at KTRI. Also good agreement 
that it probably will not extend as far south as KCHA. Winds will
likely get gusty again on Thursday.

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Thursday/...
First wave of storms has cleared the area into Virginia and North
Carolina, leaving a fairly stable environment in it's wake. Some
clearing has occurred across the area, which may help to create
some additional instablity between the 20-23z time period ahead of
the surface cold front currently moving into the Cumberland 
Plateau. With progged CAPE values of 500-1200 J/kg, and some
increased lift/shear from a northward surging LLJ, a strong to 
locally severe thunderstorm is possible within the tornado watch 
area. This watch is in effect mainly for the isoalted potential
for a brief, weak tornado that could occur along/near the boundary
along the Plateau. Latest runs of the HRRR/NAM show most of this
activity remaining below severe limits, with the best threat to
the northeast in KY. Still, given the good shear profile and some
limited CAPE, a severe threat with an isolated tornado risk will
exist for most of the area until sunset. 

The asociated thunderstorm and shower activity with the front will
wane overnight as it pushes east, through cloud cover and some
locally patchy fog will exist late tonight into Thursday morning.
As the base of the trough swings through the area on Thursday, an
additional shortwave trough will rotate down from KY, bringing an
another round of showers for most of the area on Thursday. Also,
most of the region will stay overnight (safe for the far southern
zones) under a cool NW flow. Highs on Thursday will be lucky to
hit 70 degrees across the northern half of the area due to this
cloud cover -- while some clearing late near Chattanooga will help
warm things up a bit more. 

.LONG TERM /Thursday Night through Wednesday/...
Had to keep a few pops around across the northeastern corner of 
the viewing area on Thursday night as the deep upper low edges 
very slowly east toward the northeastern states. There will 
finally be a twenty four hour period of pops less than 10 percent 
on Friday as drier air builds in behind the departing trough with 
a brief period of ridging. Had to bring the pops back over the 
weekend as a the ridge gets knocked down by a few waves of weak 
short wave energy. The first builds across the Mid South on 
Saturday with a gradually strengthening southerly component to the
flow with increasingly warmer and more humid air on the return. 
By Sunday, the probability of precip remains in the likely 
category as a deepening long wave trough builds into the Great 
Lakes and Mississippi Valley. Showers and thunderstorms will form 
ahead of an associated cold front Sunday into Sunday night. Pops 
were broadbrushed back through the medium chance range on Monday 
as the upper flow becomes generally parallel to the surface front.
Had to continue with low to slight chance pops for some 
convection Tuesday into Wednesday as more Great Lakes/Upper 
Midwest troughing is indicated in the medium range models. It 
appears another surface cold front could build southeast into the 
Southern Appalachians Tuesday night into Wednesday in this flow 
regime.

pressure system tracks across the region. Most of the thunder
activity should wane by late evening with the setting sun, but a

.DISCUSSION...
An active day across the region as a surface cold front tracks
toward the region from the west. Areas of showers and
thunderstorms will continue to move across the region along and
ahead of this boundary. The first wave of energy will continue to
track across East Tennessee into Southwest Virginia over the next
2-3 hours. A few strong to severe storms are possible with this 
wave -- especially for areas along the NC/GA border where a
Tornado Watch is in effect and with some of the stronger line 
segments. 

The second wave will move across the region from midday 
through the rush hour/late afternoon time period. Should we begin
to see some clearing/breaks develop back toward the west, another
round of strong, more organized storms are possible. This is due
to a strengthening 30-40 kt LLJ, which will create a more 
favorable shear profile for organized line segments and perhaps a
few supercells. The big question as mentioned is instability and 
how storms this morning will impact the environment late this 
afternoon. Earlier runs of the NAM and HRRR supported some 
stronger storms in the afternoon. Latest trends are weaker given 
some lower progged instability values behind this initial wave. 
However, as mentioned, the favorable shear profile will make it 
necessary  for watching everything closely as all three modes of 
severe weather are possible: damaging winds, hail, and isolated 
tornadoes. Main threat will last until 5 PM EDT until this 
activity generally shifts east of the mountains as the front 
sweeps in.

.Short Term (Today and Tonight)...An active day across the
Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians. A deep upper trough
will dig southeast into the Tennessee Valley with jet dynamics
moving across the Region. First wave of energy is currently moving
across northern Alabama. This wave will move northeast across the
area this morning with showers and embedded thunderstorms. As
another jet streaks moves across the Region late this morning and
afternoon, pressure falls are expected across the lower
Ohio/northern Tennessee Valleys with a surface low moving
northeast into east Kentucky/southern Ohio. 

The pressure falls will help induce a boundary layer jet of 35kts
across the Region improving the shear profile. A surface boundary
will move across the area late this morning and afternoon with
moist and unstable air ahead of the frontal boundary. Main
question is if there will be enough breaks in the cloud cover
today allowing the low-level airmass to destabilize. Latest high
resolution models, such as the HRRR model do show individual
strong convection developing. Due to the expected shear, low-
topped supercell structures are anticipated later today with the
SPC HRRR Browser depicting good updraft helicity for the storms
across the eastern/northern counties between 16-20Z. 

Given the above isolated tornadoes are a concern Today for areas
mainly along and east of interstate 75. Besides the tornado
threat, cold air aloft and low-level jet may produce hail and
damaging winds with the stronger storms.

Frontal boundary will move east of the area by early evening with
shower coverage diminishing for tonight. A cool night is in store.

.Long Term (Thursday through Tuesday)...
Confidence in forecast through Saturday is fairly high with models 
in good agreement on a largely amplified wave pattern aloft. 
GFS Ensemble as well as GFS and ECMWF begin to diverge slightly 
Sunday through Tuesday as next fairly broad 500 mb low begins to 
drive SE across the Great Lakes area.

By Thursday morning, 500 mb low over central Ohio extends trough 
axis south over East TN. As trough axis swings eastward through 
Friday morning expect to see some showers and thunderstorms 
particularly over the northern half of the area that will diminish 
with sunset Thursday night as a broad ridge builds over the area on 
Friday.

Shortwave trough is fcst to move across the broad ridge on Saturday. 
With it, expect chance for some showers and thunderstorms Saturday 
afternoon. Greatest threat for strong storms on Saturday will likely 
lie in SW Virginia and NE Tennessee where nose of 300 mb jet pushes 
across the ridge axis late Saturday. 

Next front approaches the area Sunday before moving through on 
Monday. Digging 500 MB trough coupled with surface dewpoint climbing 
back into the upper 60s across a large portion of the area, will 
result in greater coverage of showers and thunderstorms on Sunday 
with potential for more strong to severe storms by afternoon.

Broad trough aloft dominates the eastern third of the US on Monday 
into Tuesday with instability on Monday holding up chance POPs into 
Tuesday before significant dry air aloft lowers chances on 
Tuesday.

Thursday's temperatures expected to be on the cool side with cloudy 
skies and the upper trough swinging over the area. However, 
temperatures will rebound nicely on Friday to near seasonal norms 
through the remainder of the forecast.

.SHORT TERM (Today through tomorrow)...
Majority of the precipitation is continuing to exit northeast
through NE Tennessee and SW Virginia. A few very scattered showers
could move through this evening, so will maintain low end
precipitation chances through tonight. Mid to low level clouds
will stick around tonight which will help keep temperatures
similar to last night even though today's daytime highs are 
several degrees colder. These mid and low level clouds should also
help keep dense fog away overnight. Although if clouds do clear 
out a bit in a specific location visibilities could quickly drop,
but widespread dense fog is not expected at this time. The lull 
in rainfall will only last till tomorrow morning before our next 
system starts to bring increased rain chances to the area again. 
Low pressure system will begin to move in and ahead of it a 
frontal boundary push through our area. Surface low will begin to 
increase in strength as it exits just to our north and this should
cause locations in NE Tennessee and SW Virginia to see the 
highest precipitation chances and rainfall amounts in our forecast
area. 

.LONG TERM (Wednesday Night through Tuesday)...
Primary weather maker will be an H5 closed low digging southward 
down the upper Mississippi Valley through Wednesday before 
ejecting eastward across the Tennessee Valley through Thursday. 
This will bring periods of showers and isolated thunderstorms 
Tuesday night through Thursday evening, followed by a fair and 
warmer day Friday. But the progressive weather pattern will 
persist, with a new storm system moving through the Rockies into 
the Plains this weekend, tapping Gulf Moisture and bringing into 
east TN and vicinity waves of scattered convection Saturday and 
Sunday. A new deep upper low will move into the northern Plains 
and Great Lakes during the opening days of the new week, and the 
associated westerly flow across our region should reduce our rain 
chances next week while keeping temperatures close to normal.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Latest water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates  
shortwave trough over northern Alabama/Georgia that will continue 
to move NE into central NC by this afternoon. Stalled surface 
front is along the SE TN border extending NE into SW NC this 
morning. 

Combination of this shortwave and the surface boundary is helping  
to enhance rainfall out ahead of it, mainly over NE Georgia and 
Western Carolina this morning. As steady rain is beginning to wind
down across the southern Valley and Plateau, expect this pcpn 
shield to continue to move NE through today with greatest pcpn 
potential in our area continuing along the western slopes of the 
Appalachian Mtns in East TN through mid day. POPs decrease to 
chance area wide by this evening ahead of an approaching front 
that will once again bring another round of pcpn by Wednesday 
morning.

Latest 12 hour MRMS pcpn total indicates greatest rainfall 
amounts of 0.5 to 1.0 inches over portions of Polk and Monroe 
counties in SE TN with radar indicating more spotty areas of pcpn 
moving into those areas for this morning. With models indicating
some middle level drying behind the shortwave this afternoon, PWs
dropping to near 1.0 inch, additional rainfall potential for this
area over the next 24 hours should be limited to 0.5 inches or 
less. With expected 24 hour totals well below current flash flood
guidance, do not expect to see any flooding issues through the 
period.

Continued cloud cover and pcpn will keep temperatures slightly
below or about 4-6 degrees cooler than late May normals and in 
very close agreement with NAM/GFS MOS as well as the Super Blend.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...
Main feature will be a deep upper trough digging southeast into 
the Tennessee Valley for Wednesday. Strong upper jet will rotate 
out of the trough across the east Tennessee Valley during the day 
Wednesday producing strong upper divergence. The strong forcing 
along with marginal instability will produce widespread showers 
and thunderstorms. Main concern in the morning will be locally 
heavy rainfall. Depending if enough breaks occur behind this 
initial wave, scattered storms will likely develop later in the 
day. Given the cold air aloft associated with upper trough 
producing low WBZ, some of these storms could produce hail from 
the mid-afternoon through early evening.

For Thursday, upper trough axis will be moving east of the area, but 
cold air aloft remains across southwest Virginia/northeast 
Tennessee. Scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected to 
redevelop there with small hail once again possible given the low 
WBZ.

For Thursday night and Friday, upper trough moves east of the area 
with weak ridging developing across the region. Mostly dry 
conditions are expected with warmer temperatures.

For Saturday, southerly flow returns pulling a moist/unstable air 
back into the region. Isentropic lift along with jet energy will 
focus the instability to produce scattered thunderstorms. Some of 
these storms could be strong to severe with the main concern being 
downbursts damaging winds and hail.

For Sunday and Monday, confidence is low on timing of convection. 
GFS wants to develop a MCS over the mid-Mississippi Valley Saturday 
night, then move across the Tennessee Valley. Concerned for active 
severe storms for Sunday and Monday due to favorable jet dynamics. 
Later shifts will need to watch closely for this 
development/evolution.

Rain shield moving NE this morning expected to bring MVFR vsby to
all terminals as pcpn already at KCHA/KTYS will reach into KTRI 
by 8Z. Conditions may briefly drop to IFR for vsby in any locally 
heavy rain and fog by morning, but confidence in timing and extent
is too low to include at this time. Conditions should improve to 
VFR with 4-6 kft cigs at KCHA/KTYS by afternoon, however with pcpn
expected to continue, brief pds of MVFR/IFR conditions are still 
possible in any heavy showers/tstms reaching TAF sites. General 
improvement with pcpn ending by evening, although all terminals 
hold onto 4-6 kft VFR cigs through end of TAF cycle.

along a surface stationary front. Expect most of the rain to be
across southeast Tennessee, southwest North Carolina, and across
the mountains along the TN/NC border near the stationary front 
and strongest surface lift. May have an isolated thunderstorm 
mixed in across southeast Tennessee and southwest North Carolina 
where some limited instability exists. Made a few minor

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...Overall, a brief break in the 
precip overnight before rain showers and thunderstorms spread back 
in from the south overnight and through tomorrow.

Patches of clear skies will be in place to begin the tonight period 
but cloud cover will begin to build back in overnight as the next 
wave of moisture surges in from the southwest. This wave of moisture 
is associated with a shortwave that will be riding along a stalled 
frontal boundary just to our southeast. The shortwave is currently 
across Louisiana/Mississippi and will track northeast overnight into 
tomorrow along the front. As the shortwave approaches our area 
chances for showers and storms increase. The best chances for precip 
look to occur across our southern areas and along our eastern 
mountains, closer to the frontal boundary and shortwave. The lowest 
POPs will be up across the Northern Plateau. Higher rainfall amounts 
expected across the higher POP areas, anywhere from 0.50 inches to 
0.75 inches is possible. A few tenths of an inch are possible 
elsewhere. Due to the location of the boundary, the heaviest precip 
will stay off to our south and east so no concerns of any flooding 
as of now. Lows overnight will be mild due to the incoming cloud 
cover. Temps will be in the upper 50s to lower 60s for most places, 
which is a few degrees above normal. Tomorrow highs will be in the 
low to mid 70s due to increased cloud cover and precip, which is a 
few degrees below normal.



.LONG TERM...(Tuesday Night through Monday)... Primary weather 
maker will be an H5 closed low digging southward down the upper 
Mississippi Valley through Wednesday before ejecting eastward 
across the Tennessee Valley through Thursday. This will bring 
periods of showers and isolated thunderstorms Tuesday night 
through Thursday evening, followed by a fair and warmer day 
Friday. But the progressive weather pattern will persist, with a 
new storm system moving through the Rockies into the Plains this 
weekend, tapping Gulf Moisture and bringing into east TN and 
vicinity waves of scattered convection Saturday through Monday.

within the next hour or two. Most other areas should see sunshine 
at some point this afternoon as drier air continues to slowly
filter in. However, our far eastern areas will take the longest 
to clear out as low-level moisture is pooled up against the 
foothills. Will send out new zones to account for POP changes for

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Latest water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a
broad upper low over the western Great Lakes continuing to lift NE
this morning. Further S over the SE US, broad area of uni- 
directional SW flow extends from the NW Gulf into the Middle 
Atlantic states. A well defined shortwave over SE Texas this 
morning is expected to lift NE across Central Alabama by Tuesday 
morning. At the surface, cold front currently extending SW across 
the Plateau into central Alabama will become nearly stationary 
along the spine of the Appalachians later today. 

As the shortwave moves NE out of Texas, a wave low will develop
along the surface boundary south of the area late today and track
NE through tonight. Models are in fairly good agreement that most
of the pcpn associated with this wave will be focused south of 
the area reaching only into our SW NC counties and the higher 
elevations of the Southern Appalachians in TN. On the back side of
the front a very sharp line delineating PWs of 1 inch or less 
extends SW along the western slopes of the Appalachians today. 
This should help to keep thing dry and comfortable before moisture
begins to creep back into the Southern and Central Valley 
tonight.

Seasonal temperatures with noticeably drier air filtering into 
the area through tonight as dewpoints dip from the middle 60s this
morning into the middle 50s later today and tonight across Valley
and Plateau locations.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...
Models coming into better agreement that surface low moving along 
frontal boundary to the southeast will bring rainfall up and over 
the boundary into east Tennessee and adjacent areas Tuesday with 
best chance of showers along the Georgia border and along the 
Appalachians. As the surface low moves along the front to the east 
rainfall amounts will be highest over southwest North Carolina. 
Followed the cooler NAM model guidance for highs and chance pops. 
The low moves quickly northeast but next upper trough develops over 
the central states and form a closed low over the northern plains. 
Lower pressure out ahead of the closed low will move southeast into 
the Ohio Valley Tuesday night with a new cold front moving into the 
Tennessee Valley and more showers will develop in western Tennessee 
and Kentucky then spread east into the forecast area late Tuesday 
night and Wednesday. Another one half to one inch of rain is 
expected. The NAM and GFS models develop a deepening surface low 
across middle Tennessee and central Kentucky Wednesday morning with 
the front which could enhance wind speeds and shower and 
thunderstorm development Wednesday morning and early afternoon with 
the front. A few strong storms are possible. Behind this front 
temperatures will stay cool as upper low moves slowly across Ohio 
and Tennessee Valleys Wednesday night and Thursday. More shortwave 
energy spinning through the upper low will keep showers going 
through Thursday evening. Weak ridging moves into Tennessee Valley 
Friday for a dry and warmer day. New weather system approaches later 
Saturday into Sunday from the northwest. Southwest windflow ahead of 
the system will warm temperatures back to above normal readings for 
the weekend.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Monday)...

Widespread showers continue this afternoon across NE TN and SW VA as 
a shortwave trough moves through the Southern Appalachians. 
Rainfall totals today were a little lighter than forecast with 
amounts generally under an inch with radar estimates of up to 1.5 
inches in portions of Clay and Cherokee counties in North 
Carolina. So far, there have been no reports of flooding and do 
not anticipate any issues at this time. The cold front is still 
back to the west of Nashville and there are some showers 
developing along the Plateau ahead of the front. Expect this 
activity will be more scattered and have chance PoPs for much of 
the evening and overnight hours. SBCAPE values are currently up 
into the 1000-1500 J/Kg range across middle TN with more stable 
values to the east from the widespread cloud cover today. Expect a
few rumbles of thunder will be possible this afternoon and into 
the overnight but expect any chance for a strong to marginally 
severe storm is low. Due to this, went ahead and updated the HWO 
to include no hazards. Even with the recent rainfall, 3-hr FFG 
values are still in excess of 2 inches across most of the area. 
The cold front will make swift progress to the east tonight as 
shortwave trough rotates around the broader low across the Great 
Lakes and Ohio River Valley. PoPs will decrease from west to east 
late tonight. The front looks to get held up along the mountains 
tomorrow with lingering showers in the higher elevations on 
Monday. Noticeably cooler and drier air is forecast on Monday. 
Dewpoints will drop down into the upper 40s to mid 50s with highs 
in the mid to upper 70s across most valley locations.

.LONG TERM (Monday night through Saturday)...

Unfortunately models are still not in great agreement with how to 
handle the weather systems in the early to middle parts of the work 
week. They do agree that a surface low will slide up the stalled out 
frontal boundary and will bring precipitation wherever that low 
decides to traverse. However there is some discrepancy on the 
strength and especially the timing of the low as it moves through. 
GFS wants to move a quick moving low through that brings rain to the 
Southern Appalachian Mountains and the Eastern Tennessee Valley, the 
NAM wants to move the same low through but spread precipitation all 
the way west into Middle Tennessee, while the ECMWF has a very weak 
low but keeps the boundary closer to us so we see a longer period of 
sustained rainfall. So at this point confidence is very low with how 
much rain and how long rain will last through the middle of the 
week. Have gone with at least low end precipitation chances through 
the middle of the week, but will hopefully be able to trim chances 
as the models come into better agreement.

After taking a break from precipitation another system will move 
through the second half of the work week. Depending on the track of 
the upper level low in this system we could get wrap around 
precipitation all the way into Thursday night, although it would 
likely be pretty light QPF-wise. Temperatures will then begin to 
rebound at the end of the week before a shortwave zips through and 
looks to bring precipitation chances to the region over the weekend.

.DISCUSSION...

Widespread showers across the forecast area this morning as a
shortwave tough progresses across the Southern Appalachians. So
far, have not seen any lightning with the activity with the 
closes lightning currently along the Gulf Coast. At the surface, 
the cold front is still back to the west of Nashville and could 
still see some storms fire along this boundary later this 
afternoon. For the update, increased PoPs across NE TN and SW VA 
where it looks to rain throughout the remainder of the day. Due to
this, also reduced the high temperatures in these locations where
rein is expected to persist. Rainfall rates have not been overly 
impressive and 3 hr FFG values remain in excess of 2 inches across
most of the area, therefore, do not anticipate issuing a flash 
flood watch at this time. There will be some ponding of water in 
areas of poor drainage but no widespread flooding issues are 
anticipated.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Latest water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis shows
continued eastward progression of the upper level ridge that we 
have enjoyed for the past few days. In it's place, closed upper 
low over SW Minnesota extends trough axis SE into the Mississippi 
Gulf Coast. The persistent deep layer SW flow ahead of the trough 
axis continues to pump unseasonably moist air into the area with 
model generated PW values of 1.5 - 1.7 inches remaining at or 
above the 90th percentile through much of the period. So far in 
this current pcpn event, areas south of I-40 and west of I-75 have
generally seen about 0.75 inches of pcpn with some localized 
radar estimates in excess of 2.0 inches for Saturday. Expect these
types of pcpn amounts to shift NE through today ahead of the 
approaching front by Monday morning. With flash flood guidance of 
2.0 - 4.0 inches in the SE portion of the area to 1.5 - 3.0 inches
in SW Virginia, the potential for localized flash flooding, 
particularly in NE TN and SW VA is something to monitor.

Forecast for the first half of today is a bit difficult, given the
poor comparison of model pcpn to actual radar this morning. The 
HRRR, which had been doing fairly well for the past few days, 
seems to be overdoing pcpn this morning. Similarly, NAM12, GFS, 
and SREF are struggling with the diurnal waning of pcpn. Given 
this situation, have decided to back off on morning POPs slightly 
as it looks like guidance is overplaying it for now. However, this
lack of pcpn to start the day will likely allow for more 
afternoon showers and tstms area wide ahead of the front and as 
indicated in most of the models as well. Therefore did trend the 
afternoon and evening POPs upward a little bit to reflect greater 
rain chances and in fair agreement with NAM MOS guidance for later
today. 

Pcpn begins to wind down tonight with frontal passage just beyond
the end of the period. Expect temperatures near normal today under
mostly cloudy skies area wide with overnight lows tonight also
dropping to near seasonal values ahead of the front on Monday.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...
Monday morning cold front will be along or near the Southern 
Appalachians so expect western areas to be out of the 
precipitation and skies become mostly sunny. Eastern areas may 
have a few showers and a possible thunderstorm linger into the 
afternoon. A low pressure area is expected to form along the front
late in the day over AL which may keep some clouds and 
precipitation along the Appalachians. As this low develops and 
moves northeast clouds will return quickly overnight Monday night 
and continue Tuesday. NAM model is most aggressive developing the 
low farther southwest and bringing more precipitation into the 
region Monday night and Tuesday with surface low moving up through
the southern Appalachians. GFS farther south and slower with low 
and moves it east of the mountains late Monday night into Tuesday.
This would be much drier for forecast area. Have gone with 
overall drier solution but have higher rain chances south and east
Monday night and Tuesday. From Tuesday night through Thursday 
upper level trough digs south over the Eastern states bringing in 
more showers and isolated thunderstorms and much cooler 
temperatures as short wave energy rotates through. Highs Monday be
mostly mid 70s to lower 80s near normal but fall to the mid 60s 
to lower 70s Wednesday and Thursday. The upper trough begins to 
lift out Thursday night which will end showers. A warming trend 
Friday and Saturday as higher pressure rebuilds.

Overnight expect mainly showers and light rain for KCHA that could
also creep into KTYS and KTRI by sunrise. Although VFR conditions
expected to prevail, brief periods of MVFR for vsby in showers
will be possible. For Sunday, all terminals expected to remain VFR
with cigs around 3500 ft. Increasing afternoon chance for tstms
could again lower terminals to MVFR for cigs and possible brief 
IFR for vsby in any developing activity at terminals. Conditions 
should begin to slowly clear very late in the TAF cycle and 
beyond.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Sunday)...

The upper level ridge has held strong across the forecast area today 
with only a couple of isolated showers/storms so far. Expect this 
will continue to be the story throughout the remainder of the 
afternoon with the main surge of moisture expected after sunset tonight. 
Over the last hour or so, storms have pulsed up to severe limits 
at times across NE TN and SW VA and expect this will be possible 
over the next couple of hours. Current water vapor imagery and RAP
upper air analysis indicates a closed low spinning across the 
Central Plains with a ridge stretching northward from the Carolina
coast into the Great Lakes. Another shortwave trough can be noted
moving northward across Mississippi. The surge of moisture will 
occur with this wave with PW values increasing into the 1.6-1.8 
inch range later tonight into early Sunday morning. These values 
are near the maximum value observed for mid-May and have increased
the PoPs and QPF values during the overnight timeframe. Due to 
highly saturated nature of the atmosphere, mid-level and upper 
level lapse rates are not overly impressive and are near moist 
adiabatic. Therefore, expect the chance for any strong to 
marginally severe storms overnight is very low at this time but 
there could still be a stronger storm or two with gusty winds 
being the main threat. The high PW values and persistent moisture 
advection ahead of the front will lead to QPF values in excess of 
2 inches in a few locations and expect localized flooding will be 
possible. Currently 3-hr FFG is over 3 inches for most locations 
and will forgo issuing a Flash Flood Watch but will continue to 
monitor things throughout the overnight hours and into the day on 
Sunday.

The cold front will remain to the west of the area throughout the 
day on Sunday with showers and storms continuing. PW values remain 
elevated in the 1.5-1.7 inch range. Therefore, have continued with 
70-90 PoPs. Once again, SBCAPE values should remain below 1000 J/Kg 
during the day on Sunday with 0-6 km Bulk Shear values around 20-30 
Kts. Overall, this would suggest maybe a stronger storm or two again 
but no severe weather is anticipated. Widespread cloud cover and 
precipitation will lead to cooler temperatures on Sunday and have 
reduced highs by a couple of degrees with highs generally in the mid 
to upper 70s for most valley locations.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Thursday)...

Cold front will be sweeping through the area overnight Sunday 
night into Monday morning and as it moves through precipitation 
will come to an end Monday from the west to the east. We will get 
a quick peak of sunshine on Monday as drier air comes in behind 
the front, but this will not last for too long before out next 
system. Unfortunately the long term models diverge on how to 
handle this next system. They all forecast a surface low to slide 
northward along the stalled frontal boundary, but they disagree on
the strength/timing of the low. This leads to discrepancies with 
how much precipitation might move into our area. Best chances look
to be in the Southern Appalachian Mountains and to their 
southeast, but we can't rule out widespread precipitation moving 
into the Tennessee Valley. If this system does bring widespread 
rain to our area we could get flooding depending on how much 
precipitation falls this weekend. At this time went with lower end
precipitation chances since models haven't really been consistent
with this system, and will adjust as we get closer. 

A secondary front will move through Wednesday/Thursday and bring 
another round of rain to the area. This system looks to move through 
quickly and dosen't look to bring much in the way of widespread 
thunderstorms. After continuously cooler temperatures with these few 
systems we will see our "coldest" day on Thursday with 
temperatures expected to be about 10 degrees below normal. A quick
warmup will begin at the end of the work week and into the 
weekend getting us back above normal.

.DISCUSSION...

The mid-level ridge stretches from the Southeastern U.S. 
northward into the Great Lakes region. Anti-cyclonic flow aloft 
and higher heights should limit the coverage of afternoon showers 
and storms. In addition, there is a PW values minimum across the 
area with values around 0.8-1.0 inches. For the update, pulled 
back PoPs some based on the lack of lift and current observation 
trends. Still have around a 20-40 percent chance for afternoon 
showers and storms but do expect most locations will remain dry. 
The strong moisture advection moves into the area during the 00z-
06z timeframe as a shortwave trough advects out of the Northern 
Gulf of Mexico. PW values increase into the 1.6-1.8 inch range 
with widespread showers and storms forecast during the overnight 
hours. A few of these storms could be strong with gusty winds 
being the main threat. Additionally, locally heavy rainfall will 
be possible tonight into Sunday with some areas of localized 
flooding possible.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Latest water vapor and RAP upper air analysis indicate broad
shortwave trough in the NW Gulf of Mexico this morning with a 
well defined upper level low over NE Colorado. Meanwhile, the 
upper level ridge axis extends N from Florida across Michigan. 

The Gulf shortwave will ride NE along the western edge of the
ridge today where it looks to merge with an impulse ejecting from
the base of the Colorado upper low as they move into SE TN late 
today. Although best dynamics and instability lies west of the 
area through today, deep moisture, coupled with modest MLCAPE on 
the order of 1000 J/kg and a surface trough lifting NE out of 
Alabama and Mississippi late today should help to ignite some late
afternoon and evening convection primarily over the southern 
third of the area. This surface trough is then expected to 
continue to push NE across the area overnight tonight with showers
and thunderstorms spreading NE into the central and northern 
Valley by Sunday morning.

The ECMWF, GFS, and NAM are all indicating a deep layer moisture
surge into the southern valley by this evening which reaches into
the central valley by morning. With PWs reaching above 1.5 inches,
which is above the 90th percentile for this time of year, much of
the central and southern areas could get a fairly decent rainfall
through tonight with 24 hour totals as high as 0.75 inches fcst
with some guidance even higher (SREF Plumes as high as 1.0
inches). Additionally, locally higher totals to over an inch in
thunderstorms across the southern valleys are possible by Sunday
morning. Areas in the northern Valley and SW Virginia will likely
see minimal totals of around 0.25 inches by Sunday morning.

.LONG TERM (Sunday Through Friday)... 
Precipitation chances really start to ramp up as we move into 
Saturday night/Sunday. As the front approaches the wind fields 
start to turn more southerly and increase in speed, bringing in in
more moisture to our area. On Saturday evening/night there is 
moderate CAPE available for storms to work with, but not much in 
the way of mid/low level shear. So we could see a few storms pulse
up quickly and threaten to produce strong gusty winds or some 
hail, but widespread severe weather is not anticipated on Saturday
(nor Sunday). As the front actually gets closer the precipitation
should become more widespread with the best chances for rain all 
week coming on Sunday/Sunday night. Will have to monitor 
precipitation amounts on Sunday as PWAT values of around 1.5" or 
higher, putting us into the 90th percentile for this time of year.
Some places could see several rounds of thunderstorms run over 
them leading to localized flooding.

Once we get into the work week things quiet down as the 
precipitation will exit off to the east throughout the day and 
temperatures are expected to be around normal. There will only be a 
brief lull in precipitation before a second system zips through the 
area. This one should move through quickly and only bring a round of 
rain on Tuesday night/Wednesday. It will also cool temperatures 
down, with highs on Thursday struggling to make it to the 70's. 
Quiet weather is then expected through the rest of the work week.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Saturday)...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate that 
the shortwave trough from earlier is now pushing eastward into 
Virginia. Current radar imagery indicates that most of the 
convection is on the east side of the Appalachian mountains in 
Virginia and North Carolina. For the remainder of the afternoon, 
expect a few isolated to scattered diurnally driven showers and 
storms will be possible and have continued with 20-40 PoPs across 
most of the area. As for the bigger picture, a closed low is 
spinning across Colorado with an enhanced risk for severe storms 
across portions of the Southern Plains. At the surface, a stationary 
boundary stretches from a surface low in Oklahoma to the Ohio River 
Valley. For tonight, expect most of the convection will begin to 
decrease due to the lack of diurnal heating with mild overnight lows 
in the 60s.

The upper level trough currently across Colorado will eject to the 
northeast on Saturday across the Central Plains. Closer to home, a 
ridge will amplify across the Southeastern U.S. The ridge axis will 
be across the area throughout much of the day with PW values 
dropping down into the 1.0-1.2 inches. These values are around the 
50th-75th percentile for mid-May. Due to the anticyclonic flow 
aloft, decreased PoPs during the day on Saturday with highs in the 
mid to upper 80s. The ridge does begin to break down later in the 
day as a shortwave trough rotates around the periphery of the ridge. 
Therefore, increased PoPs late in the day with best chances across 
the Southern Plateau counties.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Thursday)...

Precipitation chances really start to ramp up as we move into 
Saturday night/Sunday. As the front approaches the wind fields start 
to turn more southerly and increase in speed, bringing in in more 
moisture to our area. On Saturday evening/night there is moderate 
CAPE available for storms to work with, but not much in the way of

.DISCUSSION...

Widespread showers and storms to the north across Kentucky
currently as a weak shortwave trough moves through. Based on the
current radar and shortwave position, it appears the best precip.
chances late this morning and into the early afternoon will be
across SW VA. Models indicate that the shortwave trough will pass
to the northeast of the area around 18-20z. After this, expect 
the highest precip. chances will be across the higher elevations 
of the Southern Appalachians. SBCAPE values range from around 
1000-2000 J/Kg with 0-6 km bulk shear values of 20-30 kts. 
Overall, expect there is still a small chance for a strong to 
marginally severe storm with gusty winds and small hail being the 
main threats. For the update, made some adjustments to the PoP and
wx grids based on the current radar and made some minor tweaks to
the hourly temperature and dewpoint grids.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Latest water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate a  
shortwave trough riding NE across middle TN into NE TN along the 
western periphery of the longwave ridge this morning. NAM12, HRRR,
and RAP13 all indicate increasing shower and thunderstorm 
activity early this morning into the afternoon as this shortwave 
progresses NE across the area before exiting the region this 
afternoon. 

Behind this shortwave, NAM12 model soundings indicate fairly sharp  
drying of the middle levels by afternoon. PW values in the 
northern TN Valley reaching as high as 1.5 inches in the morning 
hours, drop to near 1.1 inches by late afternoon across this area.
This results in DCAPE values up to 1300 J/Kg by afternoon across 
the northern third of the area. Given similar GFS soln for the 
shortwave, it is much less aggressive in the middle level drying.
However, late afternoon DCAPE values still approach 1000 J/Kg in 
some areas north of I-40 as well. 

Then later this afternoon and evening, NAM12, GFS, and SREF 
further indicate diurnal convection to develop mainly across 
higher terrain in the wake of the shortwave. Although HiRes 
guidance is much less eager with this activity, forecast leans 
towards higher POPS in the mountains and plateau areas for the 
afternoon and evening hours, hedging toward slightly lower POPs 
in the valley during that time. 

Regardless of shortwave or terrain induced convection today,
MLCAPE approaching 2000 J/Kg along with 0-6KM shear values on the
order of 20 kts, and DCAPE in excess of 1000 J/kg could lead to an
isolated storm or two becoming strong to severe. Although the 
overall threat is very marginal, main concern would likely come 
from strong gusty winds and hail in the area mainly north of I-40 
having the greatest likelihood of stronger storms. Threat 
diminishes some as we move further south across the area.

Any showers and thunderstorms should rapidly end after sunset with
a quiet night expected. Both max and min temps fcst are about 6-9
degrees above normal, and in agreement with the SuperBlend which 
has been performing fairly well of late. This is generally about a
degree or two below MET/MAV guidance for the maximum and about a 
degree above guidance for the minimum. 


.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...
Upper level ridge tries to build back north Saturday so decreased
pops some south with only chance pops north. Also should be last 
hot day with temperatures near to above 90 lowest elevations. Low 
pressure area over northern Missouri and cold front to the south 
will move east during the day. Best instability and lift will be 
to the Northwest of the forecast area over the lower Ohio Valley 
and western Tennessee Valley. Isolated to scattered storms will 
still be possible with more showers and storms occurring across 
the north. As cold front approaches Saturday night and Sunday 
there will be more significant coverage of precipitation. The 
front will move slowly across the area Sunday and Sunday night 
into Monday. Some locally heavy rainfall amounts across southern 
sections Sunday and Sunday night over 2 inches possible. A few 
stronger storms are possible Sunday but the main threat will be 
heavy rainfall. Behind the front Monday night there will be a dry 
night but Tuesday into Thursday another front will move through 
with continued rain chances. Temperatures will be much cooler 
Wednesday and Thursday as A cool upper level trough moves into the
eastern states. Lows Wednesday night will drop into the 40s to 
lower 50s.

.DISCUSSION...
Convection that developed along the spine of the mountains earlier
this afternoon has waned quickly with the setting sun. Additional,
isolated, showers and storms are trying to continue along a 
convergence zone/weak boundary in place along the western edge of 
the Plateau. High pressure at the surface is slipping off to the 
east and a weak shortwave trough will slip into the area late 
tonight. Models continue to hint that this feature will trigger 
some additional isolated to scattered clusters of showers and 
thunderstorms. The area most favored will be along the Plateau of 
East Tennessee and the Cumberland Mountains of southwest Virginia.
The greatest coverage won't be until the predawn hours on early 
friday morning. Clouds quickly increasing after dark -- along with
a SW flow will keep lows quite mild in the 60s areawide once 
again.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Friday)...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates 
that the ridge is now out over the Atlantic with a shortwave trough 
passing well to the north across the Great Lakes. A more robust 
closed low is located across the Rockies and has lead to a high 
risk being issued by SPC for portions of the Southern Plains. 

Another hot afternoon across the Southern Appalachians with most 
temperatures as of 3 pm in the 80s. Most of the precipitation 
activity so far has been limited to isolated to scattered showers 
along the Plateau. Recent visible satellite imagery indicates some 
towering cu along the Appalachians and expect isolated to scattered 
precip. to begin there shortly. SBCAPE values are currently around 
1500-2000 J/Kg with 0-6 km bulk shear of 20-30 kts. expect there 
could still be a few strong to marginally severe storms this 
afternoon with gusty winds and marginally severe sized hail being 
the main threats. So far, convection has remained in check early 
this afternoon. A boundary can be noted on visible satellite imagery 
stretching from SW Mississippi northeastward to SE Kentucky and this 
has been where most of the convective activity has been. Therefore, 
the highest PoPs this afternoon continue to be along the Plateau. 

Timing of the highest PoPs remains a challenge. The NAM, GFS, and 
ECMWF indicate a weak shortwave trough moving through the area late 
tonight into early tomorrow morning. With this solution, widespread 
showers and storms will be possible throughout much of the morning 
on Friday. PW values are forecast to increase during this timeframe 
to 1.4-1.5 inch range, which is around the 90th percentile for mid-
May. The Hi-Res models show less activity in the morning with more 
diurnal showers and storms during the afternoon. Based on the latest 
guidance, have slightly higher PoPs during the morning, but have at 
least some mention of showers and storms throughout the day. 
Regardless of the timing, it looks like there will still be the 
chance for a few strong to marginally severe storms on Friday with 
gusty winds and small hail being the main threats. In addition, 
lowered high temperatures by 2-3 degrees to account for the higher 
PoPs and cloud cover. Although, highs will still top out int he low 
to mid 80s on Friday.

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Wednesday)...

Still under the influence of the ridge as we head into the weekend, 
leading to one more day of hot temperatures reaching near or above 
90 in many locations on Saturday. Could see some precipitation this 
day due to the warm temperatures with the best chances being in our 
northern counties near a mostly stationary boundary. Ridge will 
begin to be shoved off to our east by the next system (low 
pressure/cold front). This system will bring the best chances of 
rain to our area, with Sunday looking to be the wettest. We could 
see showers and thunderstorms in the afternoons over this weekend, 
with strong winds and hail being the main concerns...But at this 
point the forecast model soundings aren't supportive of a widespread 
severe weather outbreak. 

The front should push through on Monday and we will finally cool 
down with temperatures expected to be much closer to normal for this 
time of year. We take a bit of a break from precipitation behind the 
front as well, but not for long as another system will be knocking 
on our door by the middle of the work week. This system looks to 
move through much quicker with the best chances of showers to be 
Tuesday night/Wednesday. This round of precipitation looks to be 
mostly just rain as there will be very little CAPE available to help 
produce thunderstorms in our area. We will be dry at the end of next 
week with temperatures behind this second system expected to be 
several degrees below normal.

PW values are increasing across the area with southwesterly flow
throughout the atmosphere. Current radar imagery indicates a few
showers already developing across the Plateau. Due to this, went
ahead and adjusted the PoPs up throughout the remainder of the
morning and into the early afternoon. Model soundings indicate 
SBCAPE values of around 1500-2500 J/Kg later this afternoon with 
0-6 km bulk shear around 20-30 kts. Therefore, expect there will 
be some strong to marginally severe storms later this afternoon. 
The main threats with any of these storms would be gusty winds and
hail potentially up to quarter size.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...The overall weather pattern
shows the upper ridge of high pressure that have been positioned
over the Southern Appalachian Region has shifted east of the
area...allowing the approach of a weak frontal boundary. The
boundary will move in late today and accompanying this feature
will be increasing clouds and isolated to scattered convection.
With the warm air mass in place and increasing low level
moisture...the atmosphere will become weakly unstable with CAPE
values of 1000 to 1500 J/kg. This may allow for a stray strong
storm to develop. The increased cloud cover should put afternoon
temperatures a degrees or two lower than Wedndesday's highs but
will see quite a warm day. With the boundary remaining over the
region tonight...isolated convection will continue into the
overnight hours.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...Models in decent agreement 
for the most part, although more differences crop up late in the 
period.  Forecast confidence is about average for this time of year. 
The upper ridge over the region will shift east Friday and Saturday. 
Will be some isolated to scattered convection around both days, 
especially north closer to a weak frontal boundary. By Sunday a cold 
front will be approaching, and this front will push through by late 
Monday night.  Expect widespread showers and thunderstorms with this 
system. Some drier and cooler air will move in behind the front 
Monday/Monday night, then another cold front is forecast to be 
moving in late in the period although timing is still fairly 
uncertain that far out.  Will carry slight chance PoPs Tuesday and 
chance PoPs Wednesday.  Will keep mention of possible strong to 
severe storms in the HWO for the Friday through Sunday time frame.

.DISCUSSION...
A very quiet night across the eastern Tennessee Valley and
Southern Appalachian region with high pressure at the surface
still in control. An area of convergence along the I-65 corridor
in Alabama triggered some showers and storms earlier this
afternoon -- but they have quickly died with the setting sun. To 
to the west, a weak cold front along the Mississippi River has
also triggered some showers and storms. This activity will weaken
as it moves east overnight, through some high clouds from this
activity may move into the area late tonight and early Thursday
morning. Overall though, it should be a mostly clear night and
dry. Lows tonight will be mild, thanks to a light southerly
breeze, bottoming out in the 60s areawide.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Thursday)...

A hot afternoon across the Southern Appalachians with temperatures 
at 3 pm in the mid to upper 80s at most locations. Current water 
vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates an upper level 
ridge along the Eastern Seaboard with a closed low moving to the 
northeast across the Central Plains. At the surface, high pressure
is currently in place over the Atlantic with a surface low near 
Kansas City. Another mild night is forecast tonight with weak 
southwesterly flow throughout the atmosphere with lows generally 
in the 60s. 

The upper level trough will pass well to the north across the Great 
Lakes on Thursday. Continued weak southwesterly flow will aid in 
advecting in slightly higher moisture values with PW values 
increasing into the 1.2-1.4 inch range, which is around the 75th 
percentile for mid-May. Additionally, the forecast area will be in 
the left exit region of a 50-60 kt 300 mb jet. This will help in 
providing some weak synoptic lift for isolated to scattered showers 
and storms during the day on Thursday. Increased PoPs slightly from 
the previous forecast with best chances across the higher 
elevations. Expect there could be a stronger storm or two with 
SBCAPE around 1000-1500 J/Kg and 0-6 km Bulk Shear of 20-30 kts. The 
main threats from any strong storm would be small hail and gusty 
winds. Temperatures on Thursday will be a couple of degrees cooler 
than today with increased cloud cover forecast. However, 
temperatures will still top out well above normal with highs 
generally in the mid to upper 80s.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...

To start the extended period, a weak boundary to our north will 
help trigger showers and thunderstorms for Thursday through 
Saturday. With plenty of moisture, marginal instability, and a bit
of shear, SPC has placed our forecast area in a marginal risk for
severe storms. A cold front will approach the area on Sunday. 
With with better forcing and a bit of instability and shear, we 
should see a better chance for thunderstorms on Sunday. Behind the
frontal passage, surface high pressure will build in for early 
next week. This is also the point where models begin to vary 
significantly. The GFS keeps us mainly dry through early Wednesday
with a cold front hung up across the Plains and the associated 
low almost into Canada. In contrast, the ECMWF is much wetter 
across our area, with the low centered further south and more 
progressive, resulting in a chance of showers and storms as early 
as Tuesday. To account for these differences, I have included low 
end PoPs for the timeframe.

The upper level ridge axis is now to the east of the area with a

High heights aloft and mostly sunny skies will lead to high 
temperatures around 8-12 degrees above normal. The atmosphere 
remains dry with PW values near 0.75 inches. These values are 
around the 25th percentile for mid-May. There is also a weak cap 
at 700-800 mb. Due to these factors, expect conditions will

Afternoon highs should reach into the upper 80s to low 90s across

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...At the beginning of this 
period, the upper ridge is being leaned on by the shortwave moving 
toward and then over the Great Lakes, resulting in the axis of the 
ridge being pushed southeast of us. During this time, Gulf moisture 
will be flowing into the area. Looks like Thursday afternoon we will 
have MLCAPE values between 1000-1500 J/Kg with marginal shear, while 
Friday looks to have 1500-2000 J/Kg but weak shear as the upper 
ridge builds in again. A weak frontal boundary may sag into the area 
Friday afternoon and still be lingering in the area Saturday 
afternoon.  This boundary could help focus storm development both 
Friday and Saturday, but the overall wind field is pretty weak, so 
this boundary will not be a strong focus.  The cold front in the 
Plains is supposed to be very active over the next couple of days, 
but by the time it passes through here on Sunday, the whole system 
will be weaker and the surface low will have trekked northward into 
the northern Great Lakes.  After the front passes, surface high 
pressure will build into the area.  We should have at least 24-36 
hours dry weather, but the timing of all this is a little iffy now, 
so some low POPs linger in these later periods.

.DISCUSSION...
Current forecast is on track this evening. Aside from updating 
temperature grid to align with latest observations, no other
changes needed. Strong ridge over the area continues to produce 
clear skies tonight which will allow for radiational cooling to
drop East TN Valley temperatures into the upper 50's for areas 
north, and into the middle 60's elsewhere in the valley by 
morning. 

Another nearly cloud free, warm, and dry day is on tap for 
tomorrow with afternoon RH values dipping into the 35 percent 
range in winds that could gust upward of 15-20 mph during the
afternoon hours.

305 PM EDT Tue May 16 2017

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...Isolated early evening
showers and thunderstorms possible across the far eastern
mountains. For early Wednesday morning, models show low-level
moisture remaining high enough to warrant patchy fog across the
northern and central valley, and southwest North Carolina, mainly
near area lakes and streams.

For Wednesday, ridge of high pressure will remain in control
keeping. Model soundings show little moisture and CAPE available,
so will keep forecast dry and hot.

.Long Term /Wednesday Night through Tuesday/...
A gradual pattern change coming to the eastern Tennessee Valley and
Southern Appalachian region. The upper-level ridge that has brought 
us this very warm and dry weather will gradually slide east of the 
area off the Carolina coast. This will allow for a return of Gulf 
moisture into the region thanks to a SW flow that will increase 
ahead of the storm system approaching this weekend from the west. 
Additionally, a weaker cap will allow  for diurnally driven storms to 
develop in the mid afternoon through the evening beginning on 
Thursday -- with coverage increasing each day. Given some 30-40 kts 
of bulk shear and some high CAPE amounts (MLCAPE 3000 j/kg and 
MUCAPE 4000 J/kg), the risk for strong to severe storms with 
damaging winds and hail will exist each day. This activity will 
initiate on and favor the high terrain of the Mountains and Plateau, 
but could easily drift into the Valley later in the day. 

As mentioned, a strong upper-level storm system will shift into the 
Mississippi and Tennessee Valley from the Plains Saturday Night into 
Sunday. The cold front itself will push into the region on Sunday 
afternoon/evening, bringing a chance for stronger and more organized 
thunderstorms. Given the progged shear and instability, some more 
widespread strong to severe storms are possible depending on the 
exact timing of the front. In addition, locally heavy rainfall will 
be possible given the abundant moisture and potential for training 
of this activity. The front and base of the trough will push east 
out of the area on Monday, resulting in a cool down early next week -
- with highs returning to the mid to upper 70s and lows in the 50s.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...The mid/upper level ridge will 
continue over the region. Still some question as to whether any 
convection will be able to get going over the far eastern mountains 
this afternoon , but moisture will be quite limited and appears 
there may be enough weak capping to inhibit convection from forming, 
so will leave forecast dry for now.  It will be on the hot side 
today. Only minor tweaks to MAV temps. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...High pressure will 
continue to dominate area weather into Wednesday for a quiet and dry 
day with above normal temperatures. Highs Wednesday afternoon should 
average in the mid to upper 80s across most valley locations. Will 
see a pattern change Thursday into Thursday night as a weak cold 
front approaches from the west. As the high shifts east of the 
area...southerly flow will develop and increase low level moisture 
across the region.  As the front approaches...expect isolated to 
scattered convection to develop and spread west to east Thursday 
into Thursday night.  Will remain in an active pattern through the 
end of the extended with diurnal heating...a warm front/weak frontal 
boundary lifting across the area Friday...then a stronger cold front 
moving in around the Sunday/Monday time frame. Deep moisture and 
decent lift associated with this second cold front should provide 
our best chance of organized convection for the extended period.

With ridging aloft and surface high pressure in place, it is 
another clear night with calm winds across the region making it 
another night for very efficient radiational cooling. Made a few 
minor adjustments based on current observations. The biggest 
change to the forecast was adding patchy fog to sheltered valleys 
and around rivers and lakes between about 08z-12z Tuesday morning.
Otherwise, forecast is on track with no other changes planned.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...Clear skies and calm 
winds expected tonight as we are under the influence of a mid/upper 
level ridge. Only question about tonight's forecast will be whether 
any isolated fog can develop. For now, will leave fog out as there
is little moisture at the surface to work with. Tomorrow looks 
like another beautiful day and even warmer temperatures with 
highs around 10 degrees above normal. Only question about 
tomorrow's forecast is whether any afternoon showers and storms 
can develop across the highest peaks of our eastern mountains. 
Soundings reveal very little moisture, lift, and weak capping in 
place. For these reasons, will leave out slight chance pop for 
mountains for now.


.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...The warm and dry 
pattern will continue for most of the work week ahead with an 
upper-level subtropical ridge of high pressure along the SE United
States in control. This will promote mostly sunny conditions for
Wednesday and Thursday, with highs near the 85 to 90 degree mark 
each day. Friday and into the weekend, this ridge will breakdown 
as it shifts to the east and a broad upper-level storm system 
drags a cold front toward the Mississippi and Tennessee River 
valleys. Ahead of the front, SW return flow from the gulf will 
increase moisture -- and allow for some good chances for diurnal 
convection each day (favoring the high terrain of the Plateau and 
Mountains). The cold front itself will push into the region on 
Sunday, bringing a chance for stronger and more organized 
thunderstorms. Given the progged shear and instability, some 
strong to severe storms could be possible depending on the timing 
of the front. In addition, locally heavy rainfall will be possible
given the abundant moisture and potential for training of this 
activity. The front and base of the trough will push east out of 
the area on Monday, resulting in a cool down early next week -- 
with highs returning to the mid to upper 70s and lows in the 50s.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...The mid/upper level ridge will 
continue to build east over the area, keeping our weather tranquil 
through the short term period.  Will see a clear to mostly clear 
sky, with the warming trend continuing.  MAV temps generally look 
reasonable, so only minor tweaks.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...The first part of the 
extended forecast should remain basically dry as the amplified 
eastern states ridge shifts slowly east. The ridge weakens a bit by 
Friday as an upper trough drops southeast out of Canada across the 
Northeastern U.S. There will be a gradual increase in the 
probability of convection Friday into Saturday as an associated 
frontal boundary shifts south through the Central Appalachians. 
However, the best chance of showers and thunderstorms will be at the 
end of the long term on Sunday, as a moderately strong cold front 
approaches the region through the Ohio valley. Above normal warmth 
is expected through the entire forecast period.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Monday)... 
Quiet weather will continue through tomorrow as a mid/upper level 
ridge builds into the area from the west, and surface high pressure 
will sit over the Southern Appalachians. A dry backdoor front is 
expected to drop into the upper OH Valley and WV tomorrow, but it 
should stay to our north and have little impact. Based on afternoon 
dewpoints, low temps tonight will be forecast a little lower than 
suggested by MOS guidance. Tomorrow will see the warming trend 
continue, with highs in the lower to mid 80s for most spots.

.LONG TERM (Monday night through Sunday)...
Once again, little to no change through the long term. The only 
real thing of interest is the new day 7 (Sunday) has the highest 
POPs of the period.

Ridge of high pressure in place Monday night through Wednesday. 
During this time we will see dry conditions and above normal 
temperatures. Wednesday night into Thursday an upper level short 
wave moves up into the Great Lakes, forcing our ridge of high 
pressure to our east. Trailing moisture with this wave will enter 
our area on Thursday and allow for a slight chance of afternoon 
showers and storms across portions of the high terrain. On Friday 
POP chances increase to low-end chance across the CWA as an upper 
level trough moves into the plains and forces our ridge of high 
pressure further east and out to sea. High pressure further east 
should get rid of enough subsidence to warrant the low end chance 
across the area for afternoon showers and storms. Saturday looks 
very similar to Friday as the trough doesn't advance very much 
eastward. Sunday, however, the trough moves into the Ohio River 
Valley allowing some upper level divergence to move in. Increased 
moisture and lift gives us our best shot of precip through the 
period. Have high-end chance POPs in place for showers and storms 
on Sunday. 

Overall, fairly dry week with precip chances increasing by next 
weekend and above normal temps as we experience summer-like weather 
in mid-May.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Surface high pressure will 
remain over the region with the axis of the upper ridge to our west 
edging slowly east.  Some weak short wave energy will brush mainly 
northern areas, but moisture looks quite limited so precipitation 
not expected.  Will generally see a clear to mostly clear sky for 
the period.  MAV temps generally look reasonable so will not stray 
far. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...This period of the forecast 
remains basically unchanged with dry weather expected through most 
of the week as an amplified upper ridge takes up residence across 
the Eastern U.S. By the end of the week, an increasing southerly 
flow will lead to a gradual increase in low level moisture and 
instability. In this regime, there will be a slight chance for 
showers and thunderstorms on Friday and Saturday; mainly over the 
higher terrain. It will be a very warm week with max and min 
temperatures several degrees above normal for late Spring.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)... 
High pressure at the surface and a ridge aloft will be building into 
the area through tonight and tomorrow. With clear skies, calm winds, 
and moist ground from yesterday's rainfall, there appears to be a 
decent chance for at least some patchy fog across parts of the 
area. The fog should lift quickly with scattered cu developing in 
the early afternoon, mainly across elevated terrain. Highs 
tomorrow will be mainly in the upper 70s to lower 80s.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)...
Not much to talk about during this long term forecast period. 
Previous forecast still looks to be on track. general theme of the
period is a return to summer-like weather with warm and dry 
conditions, then increasing rain chances toward the end of the 
forecast period.

Sunday night through Tuesday night we will be under the influence of 
an upper level ridge. During this time, subsidence wins the battle 
allowing for dry conditions and above normal temps. By Wednesday the 
ridge begins to shift east, allowing for a slight chance of diurnal 
showers and storms across the higher elevations. Moisture continues 
to ever so slightly increase on Thursday and will allow for another 
day where diurnal showers and storms are possible across the higher 
elevations, mainly during the afternoon. By Friday an upper level 
trough is swinging through the plains while high pressure is centered 
off to our east. Friday is the first day where POPs are in for all 
areas, but only with slight chance and chance in place for the 
afternoon hours. More of the same on Saturday as the trough moves 
closer. Expect showers and thunderstorms possible through the day. 
Even with POPs in place for Friday and Saturday temps remain well 
into the 80s. The only temperature relief during this long term 
period would be from a passing shower or storm. Highs will generally 
be around 10 degrees above normal.

Water vapor imagery shows a sharp moisture gradient across our

possible in the Smokies and SW NC until around 1630Z when drier
air aloft will push through that area. Cloud cover is already
eroding from NW to SE across the northern Plateau, and low
ceilings in the Valley will be lifting through the late morning
and early afternoon. Although current temps are a bit below
forecast, temps should rise close to forecast highs with
increasing sunshine. The forecast generally reflects these trends

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...The upper trough over the region 
will pull out as the ridge to our west edges east. Drier air will
move in during the period. Will start with clouds, and perhaps a 
shower far eastern areas, then expect clearing during the day. 
Expect a clear to mostly clear sky tonight. MAV temps generally 
look reasonable, with seasonable temperatures for the short term 
period. 

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...The long term forecast 
remains on track with an extended period of mainly dry weather and 
above normal temperatures. Some differences were noted between the 
more benign ECMWF which basically keeps an amplified upper level 
ridge in place with the possibility of a weak short wave pressing 
northeast through the Ohio Valley on Thursday. The GFS depicts a 
stronger short wave passage on Thursday with another, weaker 
trailing feature moving across the Mid South on Friday. At any rate, 
there should be a gradual increase in low level moisture along with 
a corresponding increase in instability at the end of the work week. 
Therefore, maintained continuity with the previous forecast which 
keeps slight and low chance pops for convection mainly over the 
higher terrain. Subsiding air within the ridge pattern and limited 
cloud cover will result in very warm temperatures in the upcoming 
week with highs rising well into the middle and upper 80s over much 
of the forecast area.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)... 
Radar shows a circulation centered over south central KY that will 
be tracking east along the TN border through the evening. Showers 
and thunderstorms should continue to increase ahead of this low and 
its associated cold front just northwest of Nashville. MLCAPE has 
increased to 500-1000 J/kg in the TN Valley, with 0-6 km shear 
around 40 kts. So an isolated severe threat will exist, but locally 
heavy rainfall may be a bigger threat, especially in SW VA where FFG 
values are lowest and around 1 inch rain has already fallen today.

Passage of the cold front is expected to occur in the 06Z to 09Z 
window, followed by the upper trough passage around 12Z, at which 
time most precip should end. However, as satellite imagery shows, a 
lot of low level moisture will linger behind the front. Overcast 
clouds will likely persist through most of tomorrow morning, with 
clearing skies through the afternoon from west to east. High temps 
will be forecast on the cool side of guidance as models often erode 
clouds too quickly.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
Skies will be mostly clear Saturday evening as weak high pressure
at the surface builds in from the NW. Temperatures will drop to
cooler than normal upper 40s to lower 50s early Sunday. Upper
level ridging will then take over Sunday and continue through mid
week. This will keep skies mostly sunny and above normal. After
deep low off the Northeast Coast moves away Monday Short wave 
activity will drop over the ridge into the mid Atlantic Tuesday. A
little moisture return on the east side of the Appalachians will
help set off a few showers and storms in northeast Tennessee
Wednesday. As ridge shifts east Thursday and Friday moisture
increases and diurnal showers and storms will be more numerous.
Above average temperatures Tuesday through Friday with highs
possibly reaching 90 in the southern valley about 10 degrees above
normal.

A moisture-rich environment and a low pressure system tracking

likely timing for storms at all sites is between 20Z and 00Z. IFR
vis with heavy rain will be possible, although brief, with mainly
MVFR vis/cigs expected. Most rain should exit around midnight, but
as cooler air builds in behind a cold front, low cigs are expected
through the night and tomorrow morning. MVFR cigs are the most
likely scenario, although IFR at times cannot be ruled out.

A few changes to PoP/Wx grids will be needed this morning as
coverage of showers has not been as extensive as advertised so
far. PoPs will be lowered through 18Z, but we will see increasing
coverage after that time as all short term models point toward
convection developing near the Plateau in the next few hours and 
tracking east through the afternoon ahead of a cold front
currently across KY. The amount of thunderstorms will be lowered 
to a chance today as lightning may not be extensive in this moist 
and weakly unstable environment as seen in regional 12Z soundings.
Locally heavy rain will be the main concern with stronger storms,
with virtually no severe threat.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...A upper level trough will move 
in during the period, with the trough axis near our eastern border 
by the end of the short term period.  A weak cold front will push 
through as well.  With plenty of moisture available, expect showers 
and thunderstorms today, with showers and perhaps a bit of thunder 
lingering into tonight before diminishing.  While a few strong 
storms cannot be ruled out today, appears heavy rain with possible 
flooding will be the main threat.  At this point threat of flooding 
looks too localized to warrant a watch, so will just keep mention in 
HWO. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...End of the week upper 
trough will be gradually exiting toward the Eastern Seaboard on 
Saturday. Therefore, there could be a few showers continuing during 
the morning but would expect a drying trend into the afternoon. The 
remainder of the long term forecast is looking rather decent with an 
extended period of upper level ridging over the Eastern United 
States. In this regime, the forecast area will remain in the warm 
sector right through the end of next week. A gradually strengthening 
southerly flow will lead to increasing moisture and instability by 
Wednesday and Thursday. Much of the region should remain capped with 
subsidence warming aloft. However, a couple showers and a 
thunderstorm may develop over the higher terrain features in this 
environment. Temperatures will start off a little below normal on 
Saturday but a warming trend will end up with temperatures a good 
five to ten degrees above normal during the work week.

Area of showers and storms is progressing a little bit further to
the south than previously forecast and adjusted the forecast to

decrease around I-40 and southward. A few of the storms have 
pulsed up at times and will continue to over the next hour or so 
with a couple of strong to severe storms possible with gusty winds
and small hail being the main threats. The loss of daytime 
heating will lead to storms beginning to dissipate after 02-03z.

VFR conditions currently across the terminals with a line of
showers and storms to the north in Kentucky. Models indicate that
these showers and storms will begin to dissipate this evening with
a chance for a few rumbles of thunder at KTRI from 02-04z. The
main challenge for the aviation forecast is the timing of the
precipitation. Looks as though there will be two rounds with some
showers in the early morning hours and a break late in the 
morning. Then a round of showers and storms in the afternoon as 
the cold front moves through. Thunderstorms late in the TAF cycle 
will lead to MVFR ceilings and visibilities.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)... 
Propagation of convection in central KY will be toward the E-SE, and 
will likely reach our SW VA counties between 6 and 8 pm. Convective 
parameters favor a threat of severe storms heavy rain to our 
north, with a decreasing threat southward into TN. The NAM, RAP, 
and HRRR all depict storms decreasing in coverage and intensity 
near or after midnight, dissipating before reaching Knoxville. 
This trend will generally be followed for the forecast tonight. 
The NAM puts out way more QPF in SW VA tonight than any other 
model by far. While locally heavy rain may be possible with 
training storms, widespread flooding problems are not expected in 
our area at this time.

For Friday morning, we will have a residual boundary from earlier 
convection near the central parts of our area, while a shortwave 
trough is expected to cross Middle TN, with its associated 
convection moving into the Plateau counties around sunrise. 
Categorical PoPs with a chance of thunderstorms will be forecast 
through the morning as a surface low tracks along the boundary. A 
second round with greater tstm coverage may come in the afternoon as 
the surface cold front moves into the area from the west ahead of 
the main upper trough axis. With only weak instability from overcast 
clouds and morning precip, the severe threat looks marginal at best 
for our southern sections. Locally heavy rain could produce minor 
flooding where training occurs, but no flood watch appears necessary.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...
Cold Front sags farther south and southeast overnight taking the 
significant showers and a few storms south and east. Heaviest 
rainfall will occur along the Appalachians where a half inch or more 
could fall. A few strong storms may still be ongoing over extreme 
southern Tennessee and southwest North Carolina closer to the front 
early in the evening but these should decrease quickly. Low 
pressure over AL will move east along the front overnight into GA 
by Saturday morning. Saturday morning expect lingering showers in 
the east and cooler temperatures behind the front. Clouds will 
decrease in the afternoon all areas. Weak high pressure will 
build down from the NW...and upper trough with Fridays front will 
shift off the east coast Saturday night and Sunday. Ridging over 
the Gulf and south central states will expand north once again 
with a slow warming trend that will continue the above normal 
temperatures through Thursday. Upper ridge will again retreat 
south Wednesday. A slight chance of showers and storms will occur
Wednesday east and northeastern mountains. The ridge will be a 
little farther east and south Thursday so better moisture return 
and chance of showers and storms. Temperatures mostly in the 80s 
from Tuesday through Thursday.

.AVIATION...
The chance of showers and thunderstorms will be increasing this
evening at TRI as a front approaches from the north. The most
likely time for TS at TRI appears to be 2-6Z. Storms will spread
southward but gradually weaken, so little to no impact is expected
at TYS overnight. Additional showers/storms are expected to 
spread in from the west on Friday morning, which will likely have
greater impact at CHA and TYS. Will mention MVFR conditions and
-TSRA at all sites late in the TAF period for these storms.

1054 AM EDT Thu May 11 2017

.DISCUSSION...
Light rain showing up on radar has not been reaching the ground in
most spots in our area, and where it has been observed, it has not
been enough to measure. The 12Z OHX sounding shows a very dry and
stable layer between 850 and 700 mb that will build into the 
area today. Thus the focus for convection this afternoon will be
to our north, near a boundary located just north of the OH River.
This boundary will begin to drop southward today, and storms along
it may reach our SW VA counties this evening, with just a small
chance of storms during the daylight hours. PoPs will be trimmed
back slightly with the update. Current cloud cover will be
diminishing this afternoon, but will lower high temps slightly as
well.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Another warm day is expected today as we remain south of the front
through most of the daytime hours. However, increasing cloud 
coverage should keep temperatures a few degrees cooler than
yesterday. As a low pressure system approaches from the west the
frontal boundary that has lingered north of our area should get
shoved out of the region. Precipitation chances will begin to
increase overnight tonight from the west. Could see a few
marginally strong storms near the Cumberland Plateau if storms can
move in early enough and stay organized from further northwest, 
but most locations will likely just see rain or regular
thunderstorms.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...
A change in the pattern is coming to the region as an upper-level
trough and it's associated cold front sweep into the area -- 
bringing widespread showers and thunderstorms and a cooler air 
mass to start Mother's Day weekend. 

The high pressure ridge that has brought us the very warm and dry 
weather quickly breaks down by Friday morning as the aforementioned 
upper-trough over the central Plains quickly pushes a strong cold 
front into the lower Mississippi River and eventually the Tennessee 
Valley by the afternoon. This front will serve as a focus for 
lines/areas of showers and thunderstorms. Progged instability will 
be limited, but a window of 1000+ J/kg MLCAPE values seems possible 
in the mid to late afternoon coinciding with some 60+ kts of bulk 
shear values from this strong frontal system. As a result, a few 
strong to marginally severe storms will be possible, with damaging 
straight-line winds and locally heavy rainfall being the main 
threats. The cold front should clear the area by late early Saturday 
morning, resulting in clearing conditions from west to east by early 
to mid Saturday afternoon. Northerly winds behind the front will 
maintain a cool/dry air mass in place for the weekend. Then, another 
upper-level ridge axis will build in early next week. This will 
result in a warming trend back into the 80s by Monday and Tuesday, 
along with plenty of sunshine to close out the forecast period. A 
few spots across SE Tennessee could potentially hit 90 degrees by 
Tuesday.

.DISCUSSION...

Upper level ridging has kept the forecast area dry today but will
begin to see this ridge break down late tonight as a trough digs
into the Southern Plains. Additionally, a cold front from the
north will begin to push to the south during this timeframe. The
combination of a weak shortwave moving through the periphery of 
the weaker ridge will lead to a small chance for an isolated 
shower/storm in SW VA. For the update, pushed back PoPs until 
after 09z for SW VA and made some minor adjustments to the ongoing
temperature and dewpoint trends.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Thursday)... 
A stable environment under a mid/upper level ridge has controled 
our area today, but the ridge will start to give way tonight. The 
drier depiction of the NAM today appears to be the most accurate, 
and thus it will be followed for the short term forecast. The 
passage of the mid/upper ridge axis to our east will allow for 
some increasing moisture aloft through tonight, mainly in northern
sections, but any precip should stay north of our area near a 
front along the OH River. Will bring chance PoPs into SW VA 
tomorrow afternoon as surface heating will be aided by an upper 
level trough and a southward drift of the front. Upstream MCS
activity will likely stay to our north near the front, but 
outflow from convection could spark scattered to isolated storms 
in our northern sections. The central and southern TN Valley will 
remain capped tomorrow, and with a continued SW flow at 10-15 mph,
highs will reach the mid to upper 80s.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)... 
Will quickly move into an active weather pattern Thursday night 
into Friday. An old boundary do our north Thursday night will 
allow scattered convection to continue over northern areas during 
the evening. Then...during the overnight hours...the boundary will
lift and a cold front will approach from the west. This will 
bring a series of convective bands across the MRX CWA. 
Precipitation chance will increase Friday into Friday night with 
POPs becoming likely to categorical. The atmosphere should become 
weakly unstable Friday afternoon with CAPE nearing 1500+ J/kg in 
some locations. A few storms may become strong and potentially 
severe. The overall model trend is for a bit slower movement of 
the front which should bring the main band of thunderstorms 
through Friday evening into overnight hours. Some shower activity 
is expected to continue over the area into Saturday with improving
conditions from west to east late Saturday into Saturday night. 
Behind the system...a ridge of high pressure will build in for a 
generally quiet weather pattern through at least Tuesday. This 
should allow for mainly dry conditions with above normal 
temperatures Sunday through Tuesday. Model consistency poor by the
end of the period but diurnal heating and the approach of the 
next system around the Wednesday time frame may allow for low pops
along higher elevations.

.DISCUSSION...
The 12Z OHX sounding shows a strong midlevel stable layer that
will prevent convective development today, and forecast soundings
indicate that the stability will continue through the afternoon.
The boundary that is across the OH River and central WV will be
the focus of showers today, well to our north. So the forecast
update will remove the mention of isolated showers in SW VA.
Adjustments to hourly temp grids will also be made, but high temps
should be pretty close to the current forecast of mid/upper 80s
central and south to lower 80s north.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Generally quiet weather and another warm day will be the main
story today. Some storms are off to our northeast across a quasi-
stationary boundary early this morning. Expect showers and
thunderstorms to stick close to this boundary if/when they do form
later today. High resolution models depict most of the
precipitation to stay out of our forecast area, but have gone
ahead and left low-end precipitation chances in Southwest Virginia
in case any stray storms travels a bit further south. Mostly sunny
skies further south of the boundary will allow temperatures to
reach a few degrees warmer than they were yesterday (about 10
degrees above normal for this time of year). 

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)... Upper-level subtropical 
ridge will continue to remain centered over the Northern Gulf 
Coast on Thursday, helping to keep a front and any associated 
convection generally to the north and east of the forecast area 
once again. However, a few scattered strong storms may drift into 
the northern Plateau, upper east TN, and far southwest VA during 
the afternoon and evening. Breezy SW winds and abundant sunshine 
over much of the area will result in the warmest day so far in 
over a week with highs reaching to mid to upper 80s across parts 
of the Central/Southern Valley. 

The aforementioned ridge quickly breaks down late Thursday night 
into Friday as quick-moving upper-trough over the central Plains 
pushes a strong cold front into the lower Mississippi River and 
eventually the Tennessee Valley by the afternoon. This front will 
serve as a focus for lines/areas of showers and thunderstorms. 
Progged instability will be limited, but a window of 1000+ J/kg 
MLCAPE values seems possible in the mid to late afternoon coinciding 
with some 60+ kts of bulk shear values from this strong frontal 
system. As a result, a few strong to marginally severe storms will 
be possible, with damaging straight-line winds and locally heavy 
rainfall being the main threats. The cold front should clear the 
area by late Friday night, resulting in a clearing trend by Saturday 
morning. NW flow will keep temperatures quite cool in the upper 60s 
to lower 70s in most spots -- before dry air and surface ridge 
builds in for early next week. This will result in a warming trend 
back into the 80s by Monday and Tuesday, along with plenty of 
sunshine to close out the forecast period.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...It's nice to be on the warm
side of the stationary front holding over the northeastern corner
of the viewing area. In this vicinity there could be a shower and
possibly an isolated thunderstorm in the short term period.
However, subsidence within the high pressure regime should keep
the remainder of the forecast area dry with another sunny day in
store tomorrow. In this warm pattern tonight's mins and 
Wednesday's maxes should remain a few degrees above normal.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...An upper level 
ridge Wednesday night into Thursday should keep most of the 
forecast area dry. At the surface, a stalled boundary will be 
present just to the north of the forecast area. Models indicate a 
weak shortwave trough that will rotate around the periphery of the
ridge during this timeframe. With this, there could be a few 
shower/storms closer to the stalled boundary in SW VA and NE TN. 
Model soundings suggest that the remainder of the area will be 
capped. A few of these storms could become strong Thursday 
afternoon with SBCAPE values around 1000-1500 J/Kg and 0-6 km Bulk
Shear around 40 kts. Overall, gusty winds and small hail would be
the main threat. 

The pattern begins to shift Thursday night into Friday as a trough 
moves out of the Southern Plains into the Tennessee River Valley. 
Mild conditions are forecast Thursday night into Friday morning with 
increasing clouds and a persistent light southerly breeze. Increased 
lows by 2-3 degrees from the previous forecast. The cap will erode 
on Friday with PW values increasing into the 1.1-1.3 inch range. 
These values are around the 75th percentile for mid-May. Showers and 
storms will move across the area on Friday as the upper level trough 
and associated cold front move into the area. Model soundings show 
around 1000-2000 J/Kg of SBCAPE with 0-6 km Bulk Shear values in the 
30-40 kt range. Again, there could be a few strong storms but the 
threat for widespread severe weather looks to be low. Post-frontal 
showers will continue into the overnight hours Friday into Saturday 
with some weak synoptic lift behind the exiting system. Temperatures 
will be about 5-10 degrees cooler than normal on Saturday with highs 
in the upper 60s to mid 70s. Cooler temperatures will not last long 
as a ridge builds into the region early next week with above normal 
temperatures by Monday.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
A warm/stationary front will remain in place across far upper east
TN and SW VA today. This boundary will serve as a focus for areas
of showers and isolated thunderstorms through much of the period.
The morning hours will see the greatest coverage in rainfall, but
good chances for an additional round of scattered showers and 
thunderstorms will exist again in the afternoon. Given the 
orientation of the boundary and the mean flow, this activity will 
move from NW to SE and be generally confined to areas along and NE
of Morristown, TN -- though a few rogue storms are not out of the
question across the region late in the day.

As a result, cloud cover will stay confined to the areas along 
and near the front, allowing for a sunny day across most of the 
central and southern valleys. These sunny conditions, along with a
building high -- and breezy/gusty gradient SW winds will push the
mercury well into the 80s across most of the region. Some modest 
instabilty, shear, and the orientation of the front will allow 
for a strong storm or two in the afternoon as well -- mainly along
and NE of the I-26 corridor. Clouds and precipitation will then 
dissipate for the overnight hours -- but a mild night is expected 
with lows in the mid 50s to lower 60s. 

.LONG TERM /Wednesday through Monday/...
Generally quiet weather to start the long term portion of the 
forecast with a quasi-stationary frontal boundary expected to 
still be draped across (or just north of) our forecast area. The 
positioning of the boundary will be important to follow as it will
be the concentration point for shower and thunderstorm chances 
through the second half of the work week. Latest model trends are 
showing the boundary to be in our northern areas, and if they 
continue to push the boundary a bit further north the 
precipitation will slowly move north as well. 

Low will finally sweep through Friday into Saturday bringing the 
best chances for precipitation and thunderstorms. The passing system 
will also usher in cooler temperatures with highs on Friday expected 
to be about 10 degrees cooler than they were on Thursday. Some 
lingering precipitation and clouds will be possible through 
Saturday but the second half of the weekend should be dry. A slow 
warming trend will begin with temperatures expected to be near 
normal for the start of the next work week.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tomorrow)...Some clouds will be on the 
increase tonight as the battle of the seasons continues with 
cooler, late winter type weather across the Northeastern United 
States and warmer, mid Spring style weather in place over much of 
the center of the nation. The boundary between these two differing
parts of the atmosphere will end up generating a few showers 
across Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee beginning later 
tonight with continuation into the day on Tuesday. The airmass may
become unstable enough for a slight chance of thunderstorms 
within the area of showers. The good news is temperatures will be 
a good ten to fifteen degrees warmer than today; concerning both 
lows tonight and highs on Tuesday.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday Night through Monday)...Tuesday night and 
Wednesday an upper ridge will be in place over the region. A 
series of weak short waves riding along the upper flow will bring 
a chance of convection to mainly the northern third of the 
forecast area. The ridge begins to weaken on Wednesday night into 
Thursday allowing additional short waves and associated convection
to effect areas possibly as far south as I-40. With daytime 
heating...the atmosphere may become weakly unstable and could see 
a stray afternoon strong storm. By Thursday night...flow aloft 
becomes zonal with a low pressure system moving in for Friday into
Friday night. Decent moisture and lift will accompany the system 
and expect this to provide our best chance of thunderstorms across
the area through the extended. A few showers may linger into 
Saturday as the front exits the area. Model consistency quite poor
by the end of the period but could see a secondary weak front 
move in on Sunday. Little moisture or energy expected with this 
feature but may see some isolated showers develop over northern 
locations. Current model trends indicate a dry day for Monday.

.AVIATION...Flight weather looks great for an extended period
today into tonight; especially at tys and cha as a weak little
wave drops southeast out of the Lower Ohio Valley. It appears the
worst conditions with this feature at tys would be a bkn-ovc alto
cu ceiling developing early this evening and hanging around 
through much of the rest of the valid forecast period. Cha may not
even see a ceiling form below ten thousand feet. Tri will 
probably see a mid deck ceiling form this evening and lower to 
just above mvfr category just before daybreak. There could even be
a little bit of light rain, but it shouldn't reduce visibility 
below mvfr category. There should be gradual improvement in 
aviation weather by early afternoon.

start building onto the Cumberland Plateau later this afternoon in
association with a frontal wave over the Upper Midwest. There
should be quite a gradient in temperature across the forecast area
this afternoon as a warm front builds into southern and western

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
Very quiet weather across the eastern Tennessee Valley and
Southern Appalachian region early this morning, with a surface
high in place across the region. The clear and calm conditions
have allowed temperatures to drop into the 40s across the area as
of 4 AM EDT -- and into the upper 30s across portions of SW
Virginia. As a result, will leave the frost advisory in place 
there through 8 AM to account for the potential for frost in the 
usual sheltered valleys and frost pockets. 

Abundant sunshine will prevail today, with just some passing to 
mid to high clouds at times. The region will remain under some NW 
flow, which could become gusty at times. These northerly winds 
will help to reinforce the some cooler air across SW VA and far NE
TN -- keeping highs in the low to mid 60s. Elsewhere, readings in
the 70s will be common. By sunset, clouds will be on the increase
ahead of the next shortwave trough feature that will rotate 
around the upper-low in the NE US. This feature will drop into 
the region between 06-12z, bringing another round of showers for 
late tonight into early Tuesday morning. 

.LONG TERM /Tuesday through Sunday/...
Models continue to indicate an unsettled midweek with a frontal 
boundary stretched near to slightly north of the forecast area. A 
few waves will ride along this boundary and produce a chance for 
showers and thunderstorms both Tuesday and Wednesday, mainly north
of I-40. The latest model runs keep the boundary a little further
north than previous solutions, and the updated forecast reflects 
this. There will be decent shear along and north of the boundary 
and with some instability available, a few strong storms can't be 
ruled out, mainly for isolated wind gusts or some hail. Southern 
areas will see a more pleasant week with partly to mostly sunny 
skies and minimal rain chances. High temperatures will rebound 
back to near or slightly above seasonal normals by Tuesday. 
Another low pressure system will move in from the Plains for 
Thursday into Friday, bringing showers and thunderstorms for the 
entire forecast area and the return of slightly cooler 
temperatures. This system will push east of the area on Saturday, 
with decreasing rain chances and clearing skies for the remainder 
of the weekend.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Tuesday)...East Coast troughing and 
Great Plains ridging will keep our area under NW flow aloft
through Tuesday. This will keep the northeastern half of the
forecast area, and particularly the northeastern third, under the
threat of showers Monday night and Tuesday, with isolated thunder
possible Tuesday. The trough will slowly lift northeastward into
New England and the ridge will slowly build into the Mississippi
Valley, such that Monday will be noticeably warmer and more humid
than today, and Tuesday moreso than Monday. But before the showers
return Monday night, Monday itself should be mostly dry.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday Night through Sunday)...Model forecasts not 
too dissimilar through much of the long term in the depiction of a
frontal boundary that oscillates back and forth across the 
northern half of the forecast area early in the period as a couple
waves ride southeast out of the Upper Midwest across the Southern
Appalachian region. Generally speaking, the best probability of 
precip will be north of Interstate 40 through about mid week but 
moving from Thursday into Friday the chance for convection 
increases across the entire area as another long wave trough 
builds into the area from the Plains. The ECMWF and GFS diverge 
quite a bit over the weekend with the European generating another 
deep, slow moving upper level low over the Eastern third of the 
country keeping unsettled weather around the forecast area, while 
the GFS is more progressive with a Northeastern U.S. upper low and
trailing weak short. Trended much closer to the progressive GFS 
solution here.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
The combination of a moist boundary layer from earlier rainfall, a
clearing sky and weakening winds has allowed widespread patchy 
fog development across the region early this morning. This fog is 
favoring sheltered valleys and locations near lakes/rivers (where 
some locally dense fog may be possible). Will continue monitor 
trends over the next couple of hours to see if an SPS or advisory 
is warranted early this morning. 

High pressure will quickly build in from the west today at the
surface, though the area will remain under NW flow aloft (which
will help to reinforce the cooler air mass). Still, thanks to
ample sunshine, drier air, and some increased heights, highs will
climb back into the 60s to around 70 degrees in most areas. A
welcome change to the very cool and damp conditions observed
yesterday. A tight pressure gradient may result in some breezy
conditions as well -- particularly along the mountains in the
afternoon/evening. 

Overnight, the combination of an unseasonably cool air mass, a 
mostly clear sky, and light winds will allow temperatures to dip 
into the mid 30s across the sheltered valleys of Southwest 
Virginia. Frost development is expected late tonight into the 
predawn hours Monday morning, before dissipating after sunrise.
Thus, a Frost Advisory was needed for that area between 2 AM to 8
AM early Monday morning. Elsewhere, a cool night is still expected
with lows in the 40s.  

.LONG TERM /Monday through Saturday/...
It will be dry and clear to start the extended forecast period; 
however, we will still be under northwest flow, which will help 
keep highs relatively cool on Monday, in the 60s and 70s across 
the area. A nearly stationary boundary will stretch across the 
northern part of the forecast area and remain there through 
midweek. This front will provide the focus for some weak clipper 
systems to cycle through, bringing a chance for showers and a few 
rumbles of thunder at times through Wednesday night. For the most 
part, the best chance for rain during this timeframe will be 
across the north (closer to the boundary), with areas further 
south staying sunnier with a much lower chance for rain. 
Temperatures will also rebound, moderating back to near to 
slightly above normal for this time of year. A more organized 
system will approach the area Thursday into Friday, bringing a 
better chance for rain and thunderstorms for the entire forecast 
area. This system will push east of the forecast area Friday night
into Saturday, with some lingering rain and clouds possible 
Saturday morning. Temperatures will drop a bit again behind this 
system, with highs in the 70s for Friday into the weekend.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...

Will include a pre-first period in the forecast for late afternoon 
adjustments. It looks like any thunderstorm chances should be 
limited to only the Southern Valley. Took thunder out of forecast 
for Central Valley as well as adjusted temperatures. It's been a 
crazy weather day. At the current hour it's 73 at Chattanooga and 
only 45 at Knoxville and it's still snowing on Mt. LeConte.

Our active weather should be winding down to begin the short term 
period, with nothing but improvements through the end of the period. 
A few showers and storms may still be lingering across the Southern 
Valley but POP chances decrease through the night as the shortwave 
dives off to our southeast. Snow will continue at elevations above 
5K feet tonight while the precip lasts. Only trace amounts expected 
as the bulk of the precip will be out of the area. Clouds will begin 
to slowly clear tonight behind the precip allowing for one of the 
coldest nights we've had in quite some time. Lows will range from 
the mid to upper 30s across the northern areas, to near 40 Central 
Valley, and lower 40s southern Valley. This will lead to low temps 
that are anywhere from 10 to 15 degrees below normal. There is the 
possibility of some patchy frost and fog early tomorrow morning but 
thinking the winds will stay up enough tonight to prevent formation. 
Will not include those elements in the forecast at this time but the 
evening shift may have to reevaluate. Chilly to start tomorrow 
morning but plenty of sunshine will allow temps to climb into the 
lower to mid 60s for most, and upper 60s across the Southern Valley. 
Tomorrow, although still below normal for max temps, will be a much 
nicer day.




.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...At the first of 
this period, the upper trough will still be close to the area, but
its axis will be east of us, so most of the active weather will 
be east of us. However, we will still be in a NW flow, subject to 
weak clipper type systems racing toward us the through the area. 
By Monday night we have our next chances of precip moving into the
area from the NW. By mid-week the pattern has pickup pace to the 
east and the weak ridge, previously to our west moves over us. 
This progressive pattern continues and toward the end of the week 
the next storm system is headed our way around Friday, and it 
looks progressive enough to be out of the area by next Saturday. 
Have left some low POPs in the eastern and northeastern zones for 
next Sat, but cleared out straggling lower POPs over the rest of 
the area for that day. 

Back to storm chances...on Tuesday, looks like the warm front will 
be lifting into the area. Will plan to add thunder to the showers 
for Tuesday afternoon and evening--could be some fairly organized 
storms with frontal boundary and shear in the area, but instability 
will be marginal. For Wed and Thu will keep in some chance of 
thunder.  Then for Friday we should see better chances of organized 
storms again ahead of the cold front.

.AVIATION...Rain showers currently moving through much of the
area. Thunderstorms look to develop later this afternoon across
the Central and Southern Valley. Have included VCTS at both TYS
and CHA but better chances exist at CHA. Keeping VFR conditions in
at CHA through the period but any passing thunderstorm could bring
flight conditions down to brief MVFR conditions. Have TYS going
MVFR this evening and TRI this afternoon. Both sites return to 
VFR later in the period as clouds clear behind a departing 
shortwave. Some fog indications showing up in models early
tomorrow morning but current thinking is winds stay up enough 
overnight. Will have to keep an eye on fog potential during next

overnight and it is currently still snowing. Based on latest data
it doesn't look like temps will rise much above freezing above 5k
feet for the rest of the day. Based on new temp data and radar

.DISCUSSION...Overall forecast on track for today but with some
changes here and there. Shortwave currently in KY still set to
move down into our area this afternoon. Rain showers already
moving across the Northern Plateau with showers now moving into
portions of the Northern and Central Valley. POPs will continue to
increase through the day as the shortwave moves closer and
eventually into our area. Best chance for thunderstorms still
appears to be along and south of I-40, with better chances down 
across the Southern Valley where more heating will occur thus
leading to better CAPE values for this afternoon. Isolated
damaging winds and small hail still look to be the main threats. 
Based on current temp trends and cloud cover decided to lower 
temps across the board by a few degrees. Will send out new zones 
to account for aforementioned changes.

Decreasing cloud cover be the trend for the morning hours with an
upper-trough passing to the east. However, a return to VFR 
conditions may be short-lived as another front will drop south 
into the region in the afternoon, increasing clouds and generating
some -TSRA/VCTS at each terminal from 18-00z. In addition, winds 
will increase thanks to the pressure gradient before weakening 
after sunset. Clearing will occur after midnight, with a return to

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
Slow moving upper-low continues to dominate the weather across the
region -- and will promote a cool, wet, and windy day across the
Southern Appalachian region. Early this morning, areas of light 
rain showers will gradually shift off to the east as the initial
trough shifts east of the mountains. However, clouds will linger
through the day -- and winds will increase as well thanks to the
very strong pressure gradient. After 18z, a secondary shortwave
will rotate south from the parent low (located over the upper Ohio
Valley). This feature will serve to kick of another round of
widespread showers and scattered thunderstorms during the
afternoon and evening. South of I-40 there will be some decent
shear to work with -- thanks to a 40 kt 850 LLJ and some modest
instabilty with MLCAPE values around 500-700 J/kg in the 
afternoon (if some breaks in the clouds can occur). As a result, 
strong to marginally severe storms will be possible in this area 
late this evening and evening. 

The remaining activity will taper off after sunset and over time
clouds will dissipate and push east as dry air moves in after 06z.
This may allow for some partial clearing and perhaps mostly clear
to clear sky for most areas after 09z. This will result in
temperatures dropping into the upper 30s to mid 40s -- a some
localized patchy frost in the usual frost pocket areas where 
winds decouple and colder air drains to. 

.LONG TERM /Sunday through Friday/...
Conditions improve on Sunday as dry, chilly northwest flow moves 
in behind the departing low. Skies should be mostly sunny, but 
highs will be in the upper 50s to upper 60s. Clear skies overnight
will help temperatures drop into the mid 30s to lower 40s. The 
same pattern continues on Monday with highs just a few degrees 
warmer, but still well below normal for early May. Lows will again
be cool Monday night, in the mid 40s to lower 50s at most 
locations. Upper flow becomes more zonal for the remainder of the 
week as a weak upper ridge builds in, and temperatures will 
moderate back to near normal values in the 70s and lower 80s. 
However, a stationary boundary will remain parked overhead or just
to our north from Tuesday through Thursday, bringing a bit more 
cloud cover and the chance for showers and scattered thunderstorms
along the boundary. Another upper trough will build into the 
eastern US for late Thursday into Friday, bringing the best chance
for showers and thunderstorms on Friday as a shortwave ripples 
through the base of the trough. The rain and clouds for Friday 
will keep temperatures a few degrees cooler -- topping out in the 
low to mid 70s in most locations.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...Another active short term
as a deep area of low pressure rotates through and moves out of 
the forecast area, followed by another incoming shortwave for 
tomorrow.


Area of low pressure currently centered over the forecast area will 
continue to slowly move off to our northeast overnight. Bands of 
light showers will continue to pass through the area into the 
overnight hours before finally pulling out by mid-morning. Colder 
temperatures advect into the region on the back-side of the low 
overnight. Freezing levels will come down to around 5k feet by 11PM 
and down to around 3k feet by the early AM hours. Soundings show the 
column to be saturated well into the dendritic growth zone so areas 
above 3k feet will see some snow. No accumulation is expected except 
for possible trace amounts above 5k feet. Winds will shift behind 
the low and be gusty at times overnight. Lows will range from the 
low to mid 40s across the lower elevations with mid to lower 30s 
across the highest peaks.

Clouds begin to clear late in the night across the Southern Valley 
as the low pulls off to our NE. Clouds continue to clear from SW to 
NE through early morning. Brief sunshine early tomorrow morning 
before the next shortwave comes barreling through the trough by 
afternoon. Central valley and southward sees the most sunshine 
tomorrow. Colder air continues to push into the Southern 
Appalachians behind the departed low and lapse rates will steepen 
into the afternoon hours. Soundings show enough CAPE by mid-late 
afternoon to support a few strong thunderstorms. Small hail and 
isolated damaging winds appear to be the main threats. 2PM to 8PM 
looks to be the main time-frame for these showers and thunderstorms 
to occur across our area. Gusty winds also likely during the 
afternoon hours due to the gradient winds across the area. Winds will 
gust from 15 to 25 mph at times. Highs tomorrow will be warmer across 
the Central and Southern Valley due to more sunshine with temps 
ranging from the low 60s to upper 60s. Northern Valley, NETN, and 
SWVA will remain in the mid to upper 50s due to denser cloud cover.


.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...A short wave continues 
on its path southeast around the back side of the slowly departing 
Eastern Lakes upper low on Saturday night. So, a few more showers 
and even a flake of snow possibly above 5500 feet in the highest 
reaches of the Smoky Mountains as the precip fades away. Dry chilly 
air spills in behind the offending system for a sunny Sunday. The 
dry northwesterly prevailing flow continues into Monday, and with 
the help of more sunshine, temperatures may be a few degrees warmer; 
but still quite a bit below normal for early May. The moderation 
continues into mid week as warmer tries to build in aloft. Moist air 
will be lifted in this warm air advection pattern and there could be 
a couple showers on Tuesday. However, a better chance of rain will 
arrive in the form of showers and a few thunderstorms on Wednesday 
as the surface boundary separating cooler air just to the north of 
the forecast area from milder air further south gets shoved back 
into the Southern Appalachian region. Perhaps the best chance of 
showers and thunderstorms occurs at the end of the extended period 
on Thursday and Friday, as another relatively strong upper level 
trough builds into the Eastern United States. The additional clouds 
and periods of rain at the end of the work week will trim a degree 
or two off the most pleasant warming trend.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
A deepening upper-level low pressure system will bring big changes
to the eastern Tennessee Valley and Southern Appalachian region
today -- as rain, cloud cover, and colder air will promote 
temperatures in the low to mid 50s! These high temperatures may be
the lowest ever recorded for a few spots on May 5th and highs 
will be 20 or so degrees below normal in many areas. This upper- 
low will slowly spread across the region, bringing with it some 
light rain showers that will increase throughout the day. Thus, a 
cold gloomly, rain will persist through the afternoon and into the
evening as this feature tracks toward the mountains. As a result,
have gone with some high likely to categorical PoPs, especially 
in the afternoon. Thereafter, PoPs will taper off from west to 
east as the front shifts east overnight. The northerly wind will 
keep temperatures from falling off too much -- though a few 
snowflakes are possible along the highest terrain. 


.LONG TERM /Saturday through Thursday/...
Cooler than normal conditions will continue for the majority of 
the extended forecast period. A shortwave and cold front will push
through the area on Saturday, resulting in a continued chance for
showers and maybe a thunderstorm or two during the afternoon. 
With minimal instability but decent shear and a low freezing level
for this time of year, it looks like a few of these storms may 
produce some small hail or breezy conditions. 

With such a low freezing level, despite it being the beginning of 
May, there's a chance for some light snow to mix in at the higher 
elevations both Saturday and Sunday morning. No accumulation is 
expected, but the highest peaks could see some flakes flying.

This system should exit the area by Sunday morning, resulting in a 
few dry but cool days with upper level troughing remaining overhead. 
Highs Sunday and Monday will be below 70 in most locations. 
Temperatures will warm gradually from here, with the upper trough 
finally lifting and a weak upper ridge building for the second half 
of the week. It will become more unsettled by Wednesday as well with 
a couple rounds of showers and isolated thunderstorms moving through.

The main concern from the showers moving through this evening will

winds tonight will continue a little while longer than what was 
previously forecast. Have extended the high wind warning until 2 AM 
EDT. Broke up the wind advisory into two different segments to try 
and capture the event better. Have the Southern Valley in a wind 
advisory that will expire at 10 PM EDT and the rest of the forecast 
area in an advisory that will expire at 2 AM EDT, the same time as 
the high wind warning expiration. We haven't seen too much precip 
thus far today but that will change tonight when heavier bands of 
precip enter the area from out of Middle TN. There could even be a 
few isolated thunderstorms with the best chances being from the 
Central Valley and southward. These heavier showers move in between 
6 and 8 PM across the Plateau and into the East TN Valley between 8 
and 10 pm and NETN and SWVA between 10 PM and midnight. Generally, 
looking like rainfall amounts from half an inch to one inch will be 
possible with the one inch amounts more likely across our eastern 
mountains. Lows overnight will be in the lower to mid 50s.

Tomorrow expect more of the same as the center of the low rotates 
across the area. Winds won't be nearly as high but it will still be 
a cloudy and breezy day across the forecast area with wind gusts 
between 15 and 20 mph. Expecting on and off showers through the day 
but the amounts will be very light with rainfall amounts of a few 
tenths of an inch expected. Highs tomorrow will be around 15 to 20 
degrees below normal with highs in the mid to upper 50s.



.LONG TERM...(Tomorrow night through Wednesday)...

Low pressure system will still be slowly spinning through northeast 
of us. Wrap around precipitation will continue to be in the area 
through much of the weekend before this system exits the region. 
With the cloudy conditions and the winds coming out of the northwest 
we will see well below normal temperatures through the weekend and 
into next week. Weekend temperatures are forecasted to be roughly 5-
10 degrees below normal for this time of year. As this system moves 
out a shortwave trough and a cold front will dive out of the north 
on Saturday, this could help spark a round of thunderstorms. 
Forecast soundings show that there will be very little CAPE to work 
with (generally less than 500 J/Kg) but quite a bit of shear in the 
atmosphere (over 50 knots of 0-6 km). With how cold the temperatures 
are expected to be the freezing level will be pretty low, especially 
for this time of year (maybe 4-6 kft). This means that any small 
hail that is created in these storms could possibly make it to the 
ground before melting. While this is possible am currently not 
expecting widespread hail or any type of severe weather with these 
storms, but some small hail and breezy conditions can't be ruled out.

Along with these very cold temperatures comes the possibility to see 
some light snow in the tops of the mountains over the weekend. 
Saturday morning has the better chance of precipitation (compared to 
Sunday morning) and the freezing level will be hovering around 5,000 
feet, so the very highest elevations could see a brief switchover to 
the white stuff. 

After this system finally exits the area we should have a pretty 
quite first half of the work week as temperatures slowly rebound 
back to near normal.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast on track for the most part with just a few
changes. Winds already quite gusty across the area this morning
with gusts in the 30 to 40 mph range showing up in several of the
obs. Cove Mountain and Camp Creek sites gusting between 50 and 60
mph. Damage has already been reported this morning in the 
Gatlinburg area where there are some trees down and damage to 
roofs due to the strong winds. Downsloping winds are evident 
across the foothills and can easily be seen in the GOES 16 test 
SAT imagery. Clearing has occurred in these areas along with the 
associated warmer temps and drier air. These areas will have the
warmest temps of the day with temps climbing into the mid to upper
70s in a few spots. TYS and GKT are being effected by the
downsloping winds and are quite warm at this hour. TYS is 74
degrees with a dewpoint of 40 and GKT is 75 over 36, which is
warmer and drier than surrounding sites. Raised max temps in a few
spots to account for downslope warming. Other changes were to 
slow progression of POPs through the day due to the downsloping 
winds. Will send out new zones to account for aforementioned 
changes.

414 AM EDT Thu May 4 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
A deepening low pressure area over the lower Mississippi Valley 
with associated front will move east northeast across the 
Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians later today and 
tonight. South to southeast winds will increase this morning with 
winds gusting to 45 mph in most locations and as high as 65 to 70 
mph in the foothills of the Appalachians. Showers were moving into
southeast Tennessee this morning with isolated thunderstorms 
occurring earlier across southern middle Tennessee. A large 
complex of storms along the Louisiana coast to Florida panhandle 
is expected to move east across Florida and southern Georgia 
through the morning. An upper low over southern MO...northern AR 
will help to enhance lift and increase instability as it moves 
into the Tennessee Valley this afternoon. The clouds associated 
with the complex of storms to the south will move out of the area 
by this afternoon and some partial clearing should develop with 
the surface low and ahead of the upper low. This should allow for 
enough destabilization for convection to develop. With the strong 
low level winds and shear a few strong storms with damaging winds 
are possible during the late afternoon and early evening hours. 
Rain chances will be highest in the south and lowest northeast 
where down sloping will allow for warmer temperatures into the mid
70s and fewer clouds until late in the day. Tonight there will be
a slight chance of thunderstorms until surface low moves east and
winds will shift to the southwest. Lows tonight will be cooler in
the upper 40s to lower 50s. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
The 544-546 dm upper level closed low will be overhead on Friday.
These lower heights aloft, cloudy and rainy conditions will lead 
to a much cooler than average day on Friday. Light showers will be
widespread throughout the day. Based on the latest raw guidance 
cut back highs by 3-4 degrees compared to the previous forecast 
with highs in the upper 40s to mid 50s. The closed low will lift 
to the northeast Friday night but the cool and rainy conditions 
will persist into the overnight hours with lows in the mid 30s to 
mid 40s by Saturday morning. There is also a small chance for some
light snow in the mountains above 4500-5000 feet early Saturday. 
No accumulations are expected at this time.

A shortwave trough embedded in the northwesterly flow will rotate 
around the backside of the departing longwave trough. A cold front 
will dive southward out of the Great Lakes region into the Southern 
Appalachians on Saturday. Models do indicate some marginal 
instability with values in the 250-500 J/Kg range. PW values are 
only around 0.6-0.8 inches which is below normal for early May. The 
deep layer shear is impressive with over 60 kts of 0-6 km bulk 
shear. The freezing level is fairly low for early May in the 5-8
thousand foot range. Therefore, any storm that forms could 
quickly develop small hail. For now, it appears that any storm 
that forms could become strong with small hail and gusty winds but
the threat for severe weather is too low at this time to mention 
in the HWO. The cold front will move through late Saturday 
bringing in a reinforcing shot of colder air. There will once 
again be a small chance of light snow for elevations above 
4500-5000 feet early Sunday morning. Lighter winds Sunday night 
into Monday morning will lead to ideal radiational cooling 
conditions and there could be some patchy frost across the cooler 
locations in SW VA and NE TN. For now, confidence is not high 
enough to mention in the HWO.

The upper level pattern remains relatively stagnant moving into next 
week. The closed low will remain located across the Northeastern 
U.S. with a ridge across the Central U.S. Heights will slowly 
increase throughout the week as the ridge slowly builds to the east. 
Highs on Monday will be in the 60s and 70s with 80s forecast by 
Wednesday. The northwesterly flow throughout the extended will 
feature a few weak upper level shortwave troughs but the lack of 
moisture should keep the forecast dry.

National Weather Service Morristown TN
331 PM EDT Wed May 3 2017

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Thursday)...
Latest water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis beginning 
to show a well defined upper level trough over the northern plains
that will continue to drive southeast before becoming closed-off 
over West TN by tomorrow afternoon, then drifting eastward over 
Middle TN through tomorrow evening.

Current surface analysis indicates surface high centered over
southern Michigan with ridge axis south across east TN this 
afternoon. Surface low and associated frontal boundary across 
Arkansas and North Texas this afternoon will begin to push 
eastward overnight with surface low becoming located over Middle 
TN by tomorrow afternoon as cold front trails southward into 
Alabama. Ahead of the frontal boundary, models are indicating a 
pre-frontal band of convection that will reach into our area 
overnight with greatest pcpn chances over Plateau and southern 
tier counties through tomorrow morning. Following this, frontal 
pcpn through the day on Thursday will elevate pcpn chances over 
much of the area. However, strong downslope flow over the East TN 
mountains will help to hold off best pcpn from the northern third 
of the area east of I-75 and north of I-40 until late morning to 
early afternoon.

Biggest concern with this system is the very strong winds expected
ahead of the front on Thursday. Last few NAM runs has been 
trending upward with respect to 850 mb wind speeds. Latest run 
shows a very solid area of 70+ kts winds extending across the East
TN mtns from Monroe to Greene counties by late morning. Moderate 
negative omega on the lee side of the mountains in East TN, 
coupled with a very favorable ducting layer both present by 
Thursday afternoon, lead to the potential for a very strong 
mountain wave event for the area. Therefore a High Wind Warning 
was issued for those areas beginning overnight tonight.

.LONG TERM (Thursday Night through Wednesday)...
An active weather pattern through the extended.

For Thursday night and Friday, a deep upper trough will move across 
the Tennessee valley and southern Appalachians. Strong dynamics will 
continue to move across the area Thursday evening with limited 
instability. Will call for widespread showers with only a chance of 
thunder. These showers will be capable of bringing the stronger 
boundary layer winds down to the surface.

The strong low-level jet will also produce windy conditions, 
especially across the mountains. Later shifts may need to extend 
wind advisory and warning into the early morning hours Friday.

For Friday and Friday night, unusually cold upper low will be across 
the southern Appalachians producing chilly conditions with scattered 
to widespread showers. Across the highest elevations of the Smoky 
Mountains, temperature profile will be cold enough to mix with and 
change the precipitation to snow at elevations at or above 4 kft.
Minor snow accumulations are possible at Mount Leconte.

For Saturday, another short-wave short-wave will dig into the Ohio 
Valley and central/southern Appalachians. Feel enough daytime 
heating and boundary layer moisture to produce enough instability 
for scattered/broken showers and thunderstorms. Freezing level will 
be quite low and enough hail CAPE to warrant the potential of hail. 
Also, plenty of mid-level dry air to produce strong gusty winds, 
possibly damaging. Will include in the HWO the potential of strong 
to possibly severe storms during the afternoon/early evening.

For Sunday through Tuesday, upper trough moves east allowing upper 
and surface ridging to develop. Mostly dry conditions and a warm-up 
is expected.

.DISCUSSION...
Current forecast is on track. Tweaked temperatures a degree or two
in order to bring in line with observations. Otherwise, decreased
cloud cover slightly through the afternoon under clear skies
currently area wide.

Latest NAM12 guidance suggesting a fairly significant
wind/mountain wave event for the mountains of East Tennessee
tomorrow. Latest NAM12 850 mb winds across the mountain and 
foothill counties indicate speeds as high as 80 KTS over eastern 
portions of Blount county by late morning. As such, high wind 
warning has been issued for mountains and foothills of East TN for
tomorrow.

401 AM EDT Wed May 3 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Skies are clear across the forecast area early this morning. Winds
are light and temperatures were in the mid 40s to mid 50s. High 
pressure will slowly shift to the east today as low pressure over 
west Texas moves into the Mississippi Valley. Skies will be mostly
sunny most of the day with temperatures warming into the mid 70s 
to lower 80s. Clouds will increase tonight as a warm front moves 
north across the eastern Tennessee valley. Moisture and instability
will increase with showers and a few thunderstorms developing to 
the south and moving into southern Tennessee later tonight and 
spreading north. Winds will also increase from the south to 
southeast with gusts over 30 mph over the southern plateau and 
eastern Tennessee mountains after midnight.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...
A deep closed low will be approaching the forecast area from the 
west to start the day on Thursday. Models indicate that the 
surface low will be sub 1000 mb. In response low-level southerly 
to southeasterly winds will increase. The wind direction and 
synoptic setup will favor a mountain wave event along the TN/NC 
line and into the foothills. Wind gusts of 60 mph can be expected 
in these locations. For the remainder of the forecast area, winds 
will increase thanks to the deepening system. Therefore, went 
ahead and issued a wind advisory for all of the forecast area. 
Confidence is fairly high at this point for sustained winds in the
20-30 mph range with gusts up to 45 mph during the day on 
Thursday. 

The strong low level and upper level flow will create a favorable 
shear profile for strong to severe storms to form. However, there 
will be several limiting factors. Cloud cover and showers will be 
present Thursday morning as isentropic lift increases ahead of an 
approaching warm front. The downsloping winds will delay these 
showers in the valley until later in the day. In addition, the 
SBCAPE values are forecast to be below 300 J/Kg across the area. The 
latest SREF guidance only suggest around a 20-30 % chance of SBCAPE 
values of 500 J/Kg or greater across the Southern Valley with lower 
values elsewhere. Model soundings also indicate mid-level and upper 
level lapse rates closer to moist adiabatic. Overall, the chances 
for any strong or severe storms appears to be low but will continue 
with a low end mention of strong storms in the HWO. Again, the main 
impact will be the gradient winds. These winds will be strong enough 
to bring down a few trees and cause some sporadic power outages, 
especially across the higher elevations and the foothills. 

The focus will then shift to the much cooler temperatures forecast 
late in the week and over the weekend. The cold front will race to 
the east Thursday night into Friday morning as strong cold air 
advection, for early May, wraps around the system. The closed low 
will be directly overhead on Friday. For the forecast, expect 
numerous light showers across the region and widespread cloud cover. 
Some raw model guidance indicates that highs will not make it to 50. 
For now, have not gone that cold but did bump down highs by 2-3 
degrees from the previous forecast. The column will be cold enough 
for some snow showers late Friday night into early Saturday morning 
for locations above 4500-5000 feet. No accumulations are expected at 
this time. The upper level low will begin to lift out on Saturday. 

The pattern becomes stagnant late in the weekend and into early next 
week with the closed low located over the Great Lakes and a ridge 
along the Rocky Mountains and Northern Plains. Several northwesterly 
shortwave troughs will rotate around the backside of the trough. One 
of these will bring a reinforcing shot of cold air late Saturday 
into early Sunday. Rain chances will come to an end behind this 
front. Despite the cold air advection, temperatures will warm into 
the upper 50s to low 70s due to the plentiful supply of insolation 
Sunday afternoon. Sunday and Monday mornings will be the coldest 
during the forecast period with lows ranging from the mid 30s to 
upper 40s. 

The upper level pattern remains relatively unchanged going into next 
week. The closed low will remain quasi-stationary across the Eastern 
CONUS with a ridge across the Central CONUS. The forecast area will 
remain under northwesterly flow aloft with mostly dry and cooler 
than normal conditions forecast for the extended portion of the 
forecast. Lows next week will generally be in the 40s/50s with highs 
in the 60s/70s.

.DISCUSSION...
A quiet night across the eastern Tennessee Valley and southern
Appalachians with high pressure in place across the region. Dry
air has filtered into the region in wake of the frontal passage
yesterday. The clear sky and dry air has allowed temperatures to
fall off quickly with the setting sun. A light surface wind and 
perhaps a few mid-level clouds may help keep lows higher by degree
or so. Still, it will be notably chilly come Wednesday morning --
especially across SW VA, upper east TN, and the N. Plateau, with 
lows in the low to mid 40s. The rest of the Valley should be a 
little warmer, generally in the lower 50s.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...
High pressure remains in control through 00Z Thursday. Breezy 
conditions today will subside after sunset. Tonight will be clear 
and cool with lows in the upper 40s/lower 50s in the Tennessee 
Valley and in the low to mid 40s at higher elevations. Some of the
very highest locations may drop into the upper 30s. Under mostly 
sunny skies, temperatures will rebound nicely tomorrow, rising 
into the lower 80s near Chattanooga and the mid to upper 70s 
elsewhere in the valley. Locations further north and in the 
mountains will stay a bit cooler, with temperatures topping out in
the mid to upper 60s. Clouds will slowly begin to work back into 
the region from the northwest late Wednesday as high pressure 
pushes off the coast and the next weather system approaches from 
the Plains.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
At the beginning of 
this period things will be ramping up with the approach of the next 
storm system from the west. Looks like we will have a high wind 
event in the Appalachian and foothills from Wednesday night through 
Thursday.  On Thursday if instability can work far enough north we 
might have a chance of severe storms--best chances south of our 
area, but could spread into our area--plenty of dynamics; 
instability is still questionable.  Best moisture might be aloft as 
low level jet brings moisture into the area, while surface warm 
front stays to our south. Will see how that develops as it gets 
closer.

After the cold front passes Thursday night much colder air will rush 
into the area, with enough moisture for precipitation through 
Saturday night and possibly some light, wet snow at times in the 
higher elevations--mainly Friday night through Saturday night.  At 
this time, looks too warm for measurable snow, but will keep 
watching. After this area clears out it will be turning drier, but 
the eastern trough looks like it will be slow to move out, so we 
will stay with below average temps through the end of the forecast 
next Tuesday.

417 AM EDT Tue May 2 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

The cold front is now to the east and near the Atlantic Seaboard.
Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate a
deep closed low slowly progressing northeastward across the Great
Lakes. A broad area of low pressure exists at the surface under 
this low. Southwesterly to westerly winds are still gusty at times
with a strong pressure gradient across the region. This continued
mixing and wrap around cloud cover will keep temperatures a few 
degrees warmer than previously thought this morning. Regardless, 
temperatures are still noticeably cooler than the last couple of 
mornings.

Wrap around cloud cover will begin to lift out to the north and east 
shortly after sunrise with mostly sunny skies expected throughout 
much of the day. Deep mixing and the strong pressure gradient will 
lead to gusty westerly winds today. Expect gusts will be around 
advisory criteria and issued a wind advisory for NE TN, SW VA, and 
the mountains for late this morning into the afternoon. The heart of 
the cold air advection will pass to the north today. Therefore, with 
mostly sunny skies and gusty westerly winds temperatures will warm 
into the 70s across most locations. Winds will begin to diminish 
this evening into the overnight hours as a surface ridge builds in 
from the west. Light winds and clear skies will allow for 
radiational cooling with temperatures dropping down into the mid 40s 
to low 50s tonight.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...

High pressure early Wednesday will give way to increasing clouds 
late and Wednesday evening as lower pressure moves across the 
Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and an upper low develops in its wake. 
Increasing rain chances south and west Wednesday night then reaching 
eastern areas by Thursday. Moderate instability will trigger some 
thunderstorms Thursday. With strong pressure gradient and slow 
movement of the system strong south to southeast winds will develop 
late Wednesday night and continue Thursday. A wind advisory may be 
necessary especially in the eastern mountains and foothills. With 
any thunderstorm development the stronger winds may reach the 
surface so a strong storm or two could occur. Warm temperatures 
Wednesday and mild lows Wednesday night will be followed by much 
cooler temperatures Thursday with increased clouds and precipitation 
as low pressure moves slowly east. Friday and Saturday much colder 
conditions as Upper low moves slowly from Tennessee and Ohio Valleys 
northeast toward the mid Atlantic and northeast states. There will 
be a chance of a few snow showers in the highest elevations late 
Friday night as lows reach into the 30s. Highs Friday will be in the 
mid 40s higher mountains to 50s lower elevations and then 50s and 
60s Saturday. Showers will continue with the upper low through 
Saturday night. Sunday and Monday Skies will clear with warming 
temperatures.

ridging building into the southern Appalachians. Dry airmass,
except for some wrap-around moisture around 5kft with scattered-
broken clouds moving into the northern half of the area overnight.

Wind speeds continue to diminish due to decoupling and building
surface ridge. Wind Advisory has expired.

.SHORT TERM (tonight and Tuesday)...

Drier and cooler air will filter in behind the cold front that is
exiting the area. Skies will slowly clear behind the scattered 
showers...and overnight temperatures will be several degrees below
normal. The low level jet causing gusty winds over the area will 
move to the NE after sunset. Will keep the wind advisory expiring 
at 8 pm tonight. 

High pressure...clear skies...and dry weather will move in for 
Monday. High temperatures will be near normal for this time of
year.

.LONG TERM (Tomorrow night through Sunday)...

Colder and drier weather will continue behind the front with 
temperatures expected to be generally around normal for this time of 
year across the area. Our next system that looks to provide 
precipitation will be a low expected to slowly spin just north of 
our area. This low will bring along with it a warm front over the 
area ahead of the main low and the cold front it drags along. The 
weak warm front ahead of the system could bring precipitation as 
early as Wednesday evening/night, but the majority of the 
precipitation will hold off until Thursday. The highest 
precipitation chances with this system will come on Thursday evening 
as the low spins to our north. Models show the track of the upper 
low expected to move through eastern Kentucky which would put us in 
good position to get some wrap around moisture as this system heads 
out. After this system moves out the models hint at a ripple of 
energy moving in from the northwest over the weekend, so will 
mention low end precipitation chances into the weekend even though 
most locations might remain dry. After that we start to see drier 
northwest flow for the end of the weekend and into next week.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates 
an amplified pattern across the CONUS with a closed low across 
the Central PLains and a ridge along both the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts. At the surface, a low pressure center can be seen across 
Illinois with a cold front stretching southward to near New 
Orleans. Widespread showers and a few embedded thunderstorms are 
present ahead of the boundary stretching all the way from the 
Great Lakes southward to the northern Gulf of Mexico. Closer to 
home, most of the precipitation has come in the form of scattered 
showers with limited instability. This will change throughout the 
day today with the chance for a few strong to severe storms across
NE TN and SW VA. 

For the morning, expect numerous showers with a few embedded 
thunderstorms across western portions of the area as the front 
slowly progresses to the east. Expect precipitation will come to an 
end for the western half off the area by noon. Models vary a good
bit on the amount of instability across NE TN and SW VA later 
this morning into early this afternoon. The NAM is by far the most
aggressive with SBCAPE values around 1500 J/KG at Tri- Cities 
around 18z. The GFS is much more conservative around 400-500 J/Kg 
or so with the RAP around 1000 J/Kg. The one thing not in question
is the low-level wind field and deep layer shear overall will be 
favorable for strong to severe storms. The main question is how 
much will the ongoing precipitation, cloud cover and timing of the
system hinder or help the amount of instability available later 
today. Cooler temperatures aloft will move in as the closed tracks
into the Great Lakes with height falls across the region. 
Additionally, the window of time for any strong to severe storms 
should be fairly small from around 10 am-4 pm today. The threat 
area will also be small and limited to locations along and east of
a Gatlinburg to Morristown to Jonesville line. The main threat 
from these storms will be damaging straight line winds. The threat
for a tornado appears very low with the winds veering around to 
the southwest as the instability values begin to increase. 

The pressure gradient along the boundary will be strong throughout 
the day and extended the wind advisory through 00z. The winds are 
not overly strong now but should see some stronger winds begin to 
mix down to the surface later this morning and into the afternoon. 

Much drier and cooler air will push in behind the front this 
afternoon and into the overnight hours. This can be seen currently 
on water vapor imagery across the Lower Mississippi River Valley. PW 
values will drop down to around 0.5 inches as drier air advects in 
behind the system. Temperatures will be noticeably cooler late 
tonight into Tuesday morning with lows dropping down into the mid 
40s and low 50s across most locations.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...

Cooler and drier air will be moving in on Tuesday behind a 
departing cold front. Afternoon temperatures will be near seasonal
norms. Only concern on Tuesday will be continued breezy...gusty 
winds over the region. The winds will slowly decrease over the 
area throughout the day as the 850MB jet pulls out. This quiet 
weather pattern will not be around long as the next system 
approaches the area late Wednesday into Wednesday night. A weak 
warm front will lift across the area on Wednesday and could see a 
few isolated showers or storms develop late in the afternoon. A 
cold front will soon follow and bring the main band of convection 
across the area Wednesday night into Thursday. Behind the 
front...we will remain in an unsettle weather pattern as the upper
low push in for continue chance of showers and thunderstorms 
Thursday night into Friday. Precip chances will decrease for the 
weekend as the upper low moves northeast and out of the area with 
only minor wrap around showers to deal with.

.SHORT TERM (tonight through Monday)...A boundary will continue 
to approach the area from the west. Short term models seem to have
a better handle on this system...with rain beginning between 4 
and 6 pm for southern plateau and southern TN...and moving SW to 
NE through the night and early Monday morning. Instability is weak
with this system...but winds throughout the lower and mid levels 
are around 40 kts or stronger. If any storm cores can access these
winds and pull them to the surface...damaging winds will cause 
possible downed trees and powerlines across the area. PW values in
the southern Plateau and southern valley are around 1.2 to 1.4 
which is around the 90th percentile for this time of year. This 
system could produce locally heavy rainfall...with localized 
flooding possible in the slower areas of this line.

Overnight temperatures will be several degrees above normal due 
to the cloud cover and S to SW warm air and moisture advection 
that remains. 

A strong low level jet will move through the area overnight through 
tomorrow afternoon. Winds with this system could gust to around 40 
mph...with gusts of around 50 mph possible in the higher elevations. 
Have issued a wind advisory for the entire area. With the recent 
rainfall...could expect the possibility of a couple of trees 
down...especially with the higher wind gusts. The system should move 
east of the area by afternoon on Monday...with a few lingering light 
scattered showers possible through the early evening. Temperatures 
Monday will be a degree or two below normal with W to NW flow behind 
the departing boundary.

.LONG TERM (Monday Night through Sunday)...By Monday night, the 
cold front will be pushing east of the area, and dry, more 
seasonable weather will be returning. It may still be a bit breezy
on Tuesday behind the frontal passage, especially across the 
higher terrain along the mountains. By Wednesday, our next weather
system will be strengthening over the central US and will bring 
rain and thunderstorm chances to our forecast area for Wednesday 
night in Thursday. The system will continue to strengthen on 
Thursday as it drags a cold front across our area, and the upper 
low will take its time exiting the Mid-South. Wraparound moisture 
on the back side of the low will result in a continuing 
shower/isolated tstorm chances for the area on Friday and Friday 
night. Conditions should gradually improve on Saturday with the 
low finally lifting out of the area. The second half of the 
weekend looks pleasant with sunny skies and seasonable 
temperatures.

VFR conditions currently across the terminals. A strong cap and 
drier air across region should keep showers and storms at a 
minimum during the day today. The main story will be the strong 
southerly winds with gusts to 25-30 kts at times beyond 16z. A 
line of weakening showers and storms will move in late in the TAF 
cycle with best chances for reduced visibilities and ceilings

.SHORT TERM (Today through Monday)...

Another summer-like day forecast across the area. Temperatures at
3 am are still in the upper 60s to mid 70s across the area. 
Current water vapor and RAP upper air analysis indicates a closed 
low spinning across the Southern Plains with a ridge just off the 
Carolina coast. At the surface, a low pressure center is currently
near Tulsa, Oklahoma with a warm front stretch to the east along 
the Ohio River Valley and a cold front extending southward into S 
Texas. IR satellite imagery shows a large area of showers and 
storms ahead of the cold front across Arkansas and stretching 
southwards into SE Texas. 

Expect a few areas of patchy fog to start off the day that will 
quickly mix out shortly after sunrise. Model soundings suggest that 
the CAP will be stronger today and a bit more elevated in the 750-
650 mb range. Therefore, not expecting any shower or storms outside 
of the higher elevations. Winds will begin to increase as the 
pressure gradient tightens from the approaching front. Winds in 
the mountains late in the day could approach wind advisory 
criteria but have decided to hold off on an advisory for now. 
Temperatures will once again top out well above normal for late 
April with highs in the 80s for most locations. 

Models have come into pretty good agreement with the timing of the 
system overnight tonight into Monday morning. Expect the line of 
shower/storms will be weakening as they move into a more stable and 
capped environment. Model soundings indicate the atmosphere will 
saturate late tonight but SBCAPE values are generally less than 500 
J/Kg with some weak capping continuing throughout the overnight 
hours. The low level wind field is very impressive with an 850 mb 
jet of around 55-60 kts. Expect a couple of storms will be strong 
enough to transport these winds down to the ground despite the 
limiting factors. Therefore, the main threat with these storms will 
be damaging straight line winds. The low-level shear profile is 
generally uni-directional and the storms will be weakening as they 
move into the forecast area and think the chance for a tornado is 
very low. Flooding should not be an issue with the line of showers 
and storms moving through the area rather quickly. The main 
timeframe for strong to severe storms will be from around 
midnight to 8 am Monday morning.

Clearing conditions are expected by Monday afternoon with cooler 
temperatures behind the front. Highs on Monday will be much more 
pleasant in the upper 60s to mid 70s as cold air advects in behind 
the departing system.

.LONG TERM (Monday Night through Saturday)...

A cold front and associated shower and thunderstorm activity will
be pulling away from the area Monday night for generally dry 
conditions. However...850MB winds will remain elevated and 
breezy...gusty winds will continue over the region through the 
night. These breezy winds will bring in cooler near normal 
temperatures. Surface high pressure and zonal flow aloft on 
Tuesday will provide a quiet and dry weather day. Then...we will 
quickly move into an active weather pattern Wednesday through the 
end of the period. Model consistency isn't great but there is some
general agreement. The basic pattern appears to be a weak warm 
front lifting through around Wednesday... followed quickly by a 
cold front Thursday and the upper low slowly moving across the 
area around the Friday/Saturday time frame. This general scenario 
will keep at least chance pops in place through the end of the 
extended with the best chance of convection expected on around 
Thursday.

LIFR conditions currently at KCHA with VFR conditions at KTYS and
KTRI. Rainfall late yesterday near KCHA coupled with light winds
and mostly clear skies has lead to LIFR fog. Expect these
conditions will continue through around 13-14z with rapid
improvements beyond this timeframe. The main story for the 
aviation forecast will be strong southerly winds. Gusty winds are 
expected beyond 14-16z with gusts into the 25-30 kt range possible
at times. Showers and storms along the frontal boundary will move
in near the end of the TAF cycle and have just added VCTS for 
KCHA at this time after 04z. Expect the coverage of showers and 
storms this afternoon will be limited by a strong cap.

.Short term (tonight through Sunday)...High pressure will slowly 
move towards the east coast through the short term...with a 
frontal boundary approaching late in the period. 
Today...atmosphere has decent instability...but forcing mechanisms
limited. Expecting isolated showers and thunderstorms
possible...mainly along the higher elevations...through the early
evening...with activity decreasing after sunset.

Patchy fog is possible overnight...especially in areas north of I40
...as some areas will have enough low level moisture and light winds 
for development. Sunday...low level moisture will continue to 
increase with the S to SW flow...with clouds increasing through 
the morning. The cloud cover should help keep temperatures a 
degree or two cooler than today. Isolated showers and
thunderstorms are possible Sunday afternoon...but mainly along the
higher elevations. 

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)...We will see a 
pattern change on Sunday night into Monday as a cold front 
approaches from the west. A line of showers and thunderstorms is 
expected to develop and move through the region ahead of the 
front. With this line moving through during the overnight hours, 
instability will be limited, and a large severe weather threat is 
not expected to develop. However, a strong 55 to 65 KT low level 
jet will accompany the front and will provide widespread breezy 
and gusty conditions. This jet may also allow for a few 
thunderstorms to generate strong to severe winds. Winds along the 
Smoky Mountains will approach advisory criteria overnight into 
Monday morning, and future shifts may have to evaluate whether or 
not an advisory is needed. The frontal boundary will push east by 
late Monday, resulting in dry conditions on Tuesday with near 
normal temperatures. Model consistency begins to degrade after 
Tuesday, but another system will approach the area Wednesday night
into Thursday. This system will bring additional rainfall to the 
area for Thursday and will take its time exiting, with both the 
GFS and the ECMWF keeping precip in the area through Thursday 
night. Another system appears to follow right on its heels with a 
closed upper low moving out of the Ark-LA-Tex area and into the 
southeast for the weekend, bringing even more rain and 
thunderstorms to the area.

.SHORT TERM(Today and Tonight)...

Current IR satellite imagery indicates an elongated E-W area of 
showers and storms stretching along a stalled frontal boundary from 
Oklahoma to Maryland. Fortunately this activity is forecast to 
remain to the north of the area. IR imagery does indicate the cirrus 
shield is expanding southward from the showers/storms and expect 
some high clouds to start the day. Current water vapor imagery also 
notes strong moisture convergence near the Ozarks stretching to the 
Ohio River Valley. Closer to home, an upper level ridge sits just to 
the east of the Florida peninsula. This upper level feature will be 
the main focus throughout the short-term forecast for the Southern 
Appalachians. 

This morning should not start out as foggy as yesterday. High clouds 
and slightly higher winds will hinder fog formation. The main 
challenge once again will be PoPs. The cap will remain in place 
around 700-800 mb but is forecast to be a bit weaker today. There is 
not much to speak of in the way of lift with the ridge being the 
main weather influence. In addition, the surface front will remain 
to the north of the forecast area as well. The weaker cap should 
allow for a few isolated to scattered summer-like afternoon 
shower/storms with the better chances in the higher elevations. The 
main story will be the record breaking high temperatures forecast 
today. The higher heights aloft and insolation will push 
temperatures up into the upper 80a and low 90s for most valley 
locations. The record for Knoxville is 88 degrees set back in 
1872 during the Grant Administration. The records for CHA and TRI 
are a bit more recent. See the data below for more information.

Knoxville    88 set in 1872     Forecast High 90
Chattanooga  88 set in 1942     Forecast High 90
Tri-Cities   86 set in 1996     Forecast High 90

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...

An upper ridge of high pressure will shift eastward on 
Sunday...allowing for slightly cooler but still well above normal 
temperatures. Limited diurnal convection is possible late in the 
afternoon but this activity should remain confined to higher 
elevations. Will see a pattern change Sunday night into Monday as 
a cold front approaches from the west. A line of showers and 
thunderstorms is expected to develop and move through the region 
ahead of the front. A strong 60 to 70 KT jet will accompany the 
front and will provide widespread breezy and gusty 
conditions...and also may allow for a stray thunderstorms to 
generate significant winds. By Tuesday...the frontal boundary will
be well to our east for a dry day with near normal temperatures. 
Model consistency becomes poor and confidence is low Wednesday 
through the end of the extended. Overall...the pattern looks 
unsettled with an area of low pressure moving through and the 
approach of an upper trough. The best chance for precip through 
this period currently looks like Thursday and will keep likely 
pops in place with decreasing chances into Friday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...Quite capped this afternoon 
so far, but some convection might be able to break the cap mainly 
over and near the plateau this afternoon/evening.  Will have slight 
chance PoPs Northern Plateau this evening.  We will continue to be 
on the west side of the upper ridge tomorrow with the front well to 
our west and north.  Model soundings for tomorrow look rather dry, 
and it is unclear if low levels will mix out too much for the 
model's significant instability to be realized and convection to 
form. However, given uncertainty will carry a slight chance PoP all 
areas for the afternoon. It will be quite hot tomorrow, with records 
being threatened. Will make only minor adjustments to MAV temps.  


.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...The surface ridge 
of high pressure moves east on Sunday resulting in slightly 
cooler, but still much above normal, temperatures on Sunday. A 
strong surface low will trek towards the Great Lakes region 
tightening the pressure gradient across the area resulting in 
periods of breezy conditions Sunday afternoon through Monday 
morning. There is the potential for a few isolated showers or 
thunderstorms Sunday afternoon and evening, but due to lack of any
substantial forcing across the warm sector, any convection should
be isolated and generally across the higher terrain. A trailing 
cold front will move east across the forecast area late Sunday 
night and Monday morning resulting in likely showers and 
thunderstorms. Because of the late night/early morning timing of 
frontal passage, instability appears low limiting the overall 
severe weather threat. However, there will be a marginal wind risk
because of a strong southerly 850mb jet with winds of 50- 60kt.

Cooler and more seasonable temperatures are expected early in the 
week as zonal flow returns. A quick shortwave will provide a focus 
for lift and a chance of rain showers on Wednesday. A stronger 
trough deepens across the region on Thursday bringing a chance of 
more widespread precipitation along with a brief cool down. 
Confidence is lower late in the week with differing solutions in 
how to handle the evolution of the trough.

.AVIATION...

The main aviation challenge will be timing the improving 
conditions at KTRI this morning. The fog appears to be shallow and
should see quick improvement to VFR by 14z. Additionally, there 
is an area of IFR/MVFR ceilings advecting northward across Georgia
and Alabama. Confidence is not high these conditions will reach 
CHA but did include a tempo group for MVFR ceilings from 13-15z. 
Southerly to southwesterly winds will be gusty this afternoon with
some gusts up to 20-25 kts possible at times.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

The surface boundary has become stationary across the area as the 
upper level flow is generally parallel to the front. Rainfall 
throughout the day yesterday coupled with clearing skies and light
wind is leading to fog this morning. The main locations impacted 
are along the TN/NC line and in SW VA. Observations have been 
below a mile at most of these locations. For now, it is patchy 
enough to continue without an advisory but will monitor 
conditions and will issue an advisory if it becomes necessary. 

The stationary boundary will lift to the north as a warm front today 
as an upper level ridge takes hold along the Atlantic Seaboard. 
Temperatures will run around 5-10 degree warmer than yesterday with 
the higher heights aloft and decent mixing. The main challenge for 
the forecast today will be with the PoPs. Model soundings indicate a 
strong capping inversion around 750-800 mb. The mid and upper level 
lapse rates are actually quite impressive. A few of the Hi-Res 
models indicate isolated shower/storms and have kept slight chance 
PoPs this afternoon for the western half of the area. Could see a 
stronger storm or two if this happens but forecasting that the cap 
should hold with most locations remaining dry. High temperatures 
today will top out well above normal in the 80s across most 
locations.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)... 

Strong high pressure will dominate area weather through the 
weekend. Saturday will be an especially hot day with temperatures 
reaching into the upper 80s and low 90s across most valley 
locations. The upper ridge shifts a bit eastward on Sunday and 
temperatures should be slightly cooler with highs generally 
reaching the mid 80s across the Tn Valley. With the strong daytime
heating...diurnal convection will be possible... though this 
activity should be mainly confined to higher elevations. The first
system of the extended will be a cold front moving in Sunday 
night into Monday...bringing showers and thunderstorms to the 
region. A strong 850MB jet accompanying the front could allow for 
a stray strong storm. Will briefly be between systems on Tuesday. 
Model consistency and confidence diminishes late in the period but
the next system is progged into the area around the 
Wednesday/Thursday time frame for another chance of shower and 
thunderstorm activity.

.AVIATION...

The main forecast challenge during the overnight period will be
fog. LIFR fog is ongoing at KTRI and expect this to continue
through at least 12z possibly longer. The dewpoint depression is a
bit higher at KTYS and KCHA and the rain ended earlier in the day
at both of these locations. Therefore, have just gone with MVFR 
conditions for fog tonight but will monitor visibilites 
throughout the overnight hours. Starting to see some IFR ceiling 
in N GA and model soundings indicate these ceilings will move into
CHA around 12-15z. VFR conditions are expected beyond this 
timeframe with gusty southerly to southwesterly winds during the 
day tomorrow.

Front has moved east of the area with associated pcpn finally out
of SW VA. Latest HRRR indicates end of pcpn chances for tonight,
so removed POPs for SW VA for remainder of tonight, but have
added in patchy fog there as some places are already reporting

low lying areas beginning after midnight and persisting to sunrise
in the morning. Otherwise, tweaked temperatures in line with

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...
Behind the cold front this evening, we will continue to see
clearing skies from west to east as dry air filters in. The 
combination of dry air aloft, light winds, and recent rainfall 
will result in the potential for patchy fog late tonight and early
Friday morning. Ridging begins to build back in on Friday with a 
southerly flow and temperatures about 10 degrees warmer than 
Thursday. At the surface, a warm front will also move north across
the area with weak isentropic lift leading to some mid-level 
clouds on Friday afternoon.

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Thursday)...
High pressure will maintain control through much of 
the weekend, resulting in a summer- like pattern with very warm 
temperatures. Highs on Saturday will be in the mid to upper 80s, 
potentially breaking some records. For reference, record highs for
Saturday are 88 at TYS and CHA, and 86 for TRI. Despite balmy 
surface dewpoints in the mid 60s, a capping inversion will likely 
suppress most afternoon convection outside the mountains. 
Temperatures will be slightly cooler on Sunday as the high begins 
to lose its grip on the area, but should again be well into the 
80s at most locations. A strong low pressure system will track 
northwest of the forecast area Sunday/Sunday night, bringing a 
chance for some thunderstorms for our area Sunday night into 
Monday as the associated cold front pushes through. Frontal 
passage timing should limit instability and does not appear 
favorable for a large severe threat. However, a marginal wind 
threat appears possible with a low level jet overhead maxing out 
around 65kts.

The frontal passage on Monday will bring temperatures back into the 
70s for the first half of the workweek. Upper level flow becomes 
more zonal as well, with a fast moving weak shortwave bringing a 
brief chance of showers to the far northern part of the forecast 
area on Tuesday night/Wednesday. Another trough will approach the 
area Wednesday into Thursday, bringing the next chance for 
widespread precipitation to the region.

Made a few adjustments to hourly and max temperatures, PoPs, and

embedded thunderstorms continues to move northeast across the 
region ahead of a cold front to our west. This activity will 
continue to shift eastward through the afternoon. With warmer

may be available for a few strong thunderstorms capable of gusty 
winds across northeast Tennessee and parts of southwest Virginia 
this afternoon.

.AVIATION...Pre-frontal showers along with a possible clap of
thunder will affect the terminals mainly this morning with some
mvfr category weather in reduced visibility in showers and fog;
along with a few ceilings below three thousand feet. Applied a
lower probability of precipitation for later morning into the
afternoon as the actual cool front shifts east across the valley.
There is the possibility that enough surface heating occurs across
Northeast Tennessee for the development of widely scattered
thunderstorms in this area so included this at tri through the
afternoon hours. Would expect some lower vfr ceilings to build in
behind the front at each terminal for several hours with clearing
late today into the overnight hours from west to east. There may
be a bit of mvfr fog as skies clear and the surface saturates from
today's rainfall.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A cool front will move across
the region today bringing some showers and thunderstorms to the
forecast area. Moderate levels of shear and instability could
allow for the formation of strong to severe storms in a few spots
today as cold air builds in aloft. The chance for rain will 
gradually end from west to east through the afternoon hours as the
boundary slips closer to the Appalachian Spine. Highs will be 
limited to the middle and upper 70s today due to clouds and rain. 
Skies will be clear to partly cloudy tonight as drier air moves in
behind the departing front.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...A summer-like pattern 
will be establishing itself as a large high pressure ridge off the
SE coast will provide a very warm SW flow across the TN Valley 
region. Highs on Friday will be in the mid 80s for most of the 
area, with record highs in the upper 80s expected on Saturday. 
While surface dewpoints will be rising into the mid 60s on 
Saturday, a capping inversion will likely suppress most afternoon 
convection outside the mountains. Will have just a slight chance 
PoP Saturday in the higher elevations. Record highs for Saturday 
are 88 at TYS and CHA, and 86 for TRI.

A strong low pressure system will track from the Missouri Valley 
region to the northern MS Valley on Sunday/Sunday night. This will 
bring a severe threat to our west that will be diminishing in 
intensity as storms track east and reach our area Sunday night. 
Dynamic forcing will be lifting NE into the OH Valley, and overnight 
timing will favor weak instability at best. A marginal wind threat 
appears possible with a LJJ of 50-60 kts. 

Cold frontal passage on Monday will bring temperatures back to near 
normal levels for Tuesday. However the pattern across the CONUS 
remains very progressive, and another approaching trough shown by 
the GFS and ECMWF will bring another chance of rain for Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tomorrow)...
A strengthening southerly flow and increasing clouds late tonight
will keep temperatures about 10 degrees above seasonal averages. 
A shortwave trough to our west will initiate a line of showers and
thunderstorms across the Mississippi River Valley this evening,
but with lower instability across our area, these thunderstorms 
should weaken as they approach the Southern Appalachians late 
tonight and Thursday morning. More scattered showers and 
thunderstorms may develop along the cold front on Thursday 
afternoon, but coverage is highly dependent on the amount of 
forcing and instability. Overall, the severe threat looks low with
only marginal instability of 500-1000 J/kg and modest mid-level 
lapse rates combined with relatively weak forcing. Drier mid- 
levels and strong deep layer shear may support some strong to 
marginally severe thunderstorms on Thursday afternoon with 
damaging winds being the primary threat.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...
Cold front will be over the mountains at the beginning of the period 
with a few lingering showers and thunderstorms over extreme 
northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia and along the eastern 
Tennessee and southwest North Carolina mountains. Weak high pressure 
later Thursday night and Friday as Atlantic ridge retrogrades some. 
Friday looks to be mostly dry but lingering moisture along the 
mountains could trigger a few showers and storms over southwest 
North Carolina and southeast Tennessee mountains. With strong 
heating and highs in the 80s expect isolated showers and storms in 
the evening. Another low pressure area over the plains and front 
develops and moves into the Ohio Valley and Kentucky Friday night 
and early Saturday. Models are in disagreement of the placement of 
this feature if far enough south it would increase moisture across 
northern plateau and southwest Virginia and cause some showers and 
storms there. Other models have it farther north. So will have low 
pops in above mentioned area. Then Saturday as boundary shifts north 
and ridging shifts north from Atlantic there will be late chance 
showers and storms along northeast Tennessee mountains and southwest 
North Carolina. Sunday deep low pressure over Mississippi Valley and 
front moves into Tennessee Valley. Surge of moisture from south will 
bring in likely chance of showers and storms over the region by 
Sunday night and continue Monday. The front shifts east Monday with 
drying Monday night and Tuesday. Another front and chance of showers 
and storms approaches Wednesday. Temperatures will be very warm 
Friday through Sunday ahead of frontal system Sunday night. Northern 
and western sections of the forecast area could have some strong to 
possibly severe storms overnight Friday night. Also stronger storms 
possible Sunday night into Monday. Much cooler temperatures Monday 
and Tuesday with highs around 70 to the mid 70s then gradually 
rising through next week back to near 80 by Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Much of the forecast area was
covered by low clouds on Tuesday which limited warming. However,
subsiding air within a ridge of high pressure over the Eastern
U.S. should keep skies full of sunshine forecast area wide today.
The insolation and a strengthening southerly flow will boost
temperatures a good ten degrees or more above highs reached on
Tuesday. The Ozarks short wave and associated cool front will
make its way east toward the Cumberland Plateau tonight and may 
move far enough east for a few showers and possibly a thunderstorm
mainly over the plateau around sunrise.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...Timing of storms 
associated with a cold front appears to be slightly faster in the 
latest model runs. Both the NAM and GFS bring precip into our 
western sections by 12Z Thursday. The morning timing of the 
storm's arrival and the NE track of the system should result in a 
weakening trend of storms as they move into East TN. Likely PoPs 
will be maintained in the forecast, but QPF should be relatively 
light with just a marginal threat of severe storms.

A drier trend has developed in the models for Friday as the Atlantic 
ridge builds westward and disturbances in the SW flow aloft will 
stay to our northwest. Will lower PoPs Friday to just a slight 
chance as a few isolated afternoon storms cannot be ruled out yet. 
Temperatures will be well above normal in the deep SW flow, with 
highs reaching the upper 80s by Saturday. 

A closed low is shown by the models to track NE across the Plains 
states on Sunday, with storms ahead of the cold front affecting our 
area Late in the day. As with the previous system, its northeast 
motion will result in a weakening trend for us as the best forcing 
passes to our north. With good model agreement, will have likely 
PoPs for Sunday night. A cooler air mass finally builds in behind 
this system for Tuesday, bringing highs closer to normal.

.DISCUSSION...

The main forecast challenge tonight will be fog formation. The 
surface high is currently located over the area with light winds 
and mostly clear skies. Clouds are holding in across SW VA and NE 
TN but are slowly eroding. Temperatures are cooling elsewhere a 
bit quicker than forecast with clear skies. For the update, 
dropped low temperatures by a couple of degrees. Patchy fog is 
expected after midnight with plentiful low level moisture, light 
winds and mostly clear skies. Do not anticipate fog will become 
dense enough to issue an advisory but will continue to monitor 
conditions during the overnight hours.

Atlantic Coastal low to bring some clouds to the Southern
Appalachian Region. A few of these are holding flight conditions
in the mvfr category. Additionally, there is a little light fog at
cha that shouldn't be a problem too long after 13z. Would expect

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Ridging aloft will build into the area today from the west as the
closed low to our east continues to move away. Northeast sections
will have some clouds through the morning, but by the afternoon we
should have mostly sunny to partly cloudy skies. The ridge axis
will be over the Appalachians on Wednesday, with a SW low level
flow in the TN Valley. This will provide temperatures well above
normal, with highs in the mid 80s for most Valley locations. 

A deep trough over the Plains on Wednesday will be lifting NE and
become negatively tilted as it tracks into the TN and OH Valley
region. The NAM and GFS agree pretty well on the timing of storms
ahead of the cold front, reaching the Plateau around 12Z Thursday.
The severe threat with this system will be mostly to our west as
the timing is not favorable for instability from surface heating,
and the NE track of the surface low and upper trough should mean 
a general weakening trend as storms approach our area. Likely PoPs
will be continued for Thursday, tapering off through the evening
as the front as the cold front exits to the south and east.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Monday)...
Relatively active Spring weather pattern continues with a short 
wave building northeast across the Upper Midwest. The wave and 
some warm and moist advection could allow for a few showers and a 
thunderstorm or two at the end of the work week. That warm front 
will advance well north of the forecast area later Friday night 
into Saturday as an amplifying long wave trough presses slowly 
northeast out of the Mountain West through the Great Lakes Sunday 
into Monday. As this occurs, a deepening mid latitude cyclone will
drag a significant cold front through the Southern Appalachian 
Region with an increasing probability of showers and thunderstorms
Sunday night into Monday. Beautiful above normal warmth is in 
store through most of the extended period with a return to more 
typical early Spring temperatures by Monday.

vfr right now. The question is will a low level northeasterly
component bring some lower ceilings southwest into the Great

to ceiling and fog while forecasting a deteriorating situation at

.DISCUSSION...
Forecast remains on track with only minor changes made with this
update. Did scale back PoPs a bit more across NE Tennessee and SW
Virginia tonight -- doesn't seem like much is going to make it
over the mountains and if anything does, it won't accumulate more
than a trace. Areal flood warning has been allowed to expire. At
this point, the only warnings in effect for the forecast area are
river flood warnings for points currently still above flood stage.
The good news is all points have crested and will continue to fall
overnight. Some patchy fog is possible early tomorrow morning, but
widespread fog is not anticipated with consistent cloud cover
expected overnight. High pressure moves in for tomorrow with
clearing skies and rebounding temperatures.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...As an upper low slowly tracks
northeast across the Carolinas tonight...a few isolated light
showers may rotate into far northern and eastern areas.
Otherwise...high pressure building in will provide a quiet night
with dry conditions. The area flooding and river levels will
continue to recede over the next several hours but will see a few
locations with ongoing areal flooding and river flooding through
at least the evening hours. With recent rainfall...expect patchy
fog to develop across the region late tonight. Improved conditions
are expected on Tuesday with the high pressure in control for a
dry day with decreasing clouds and warmer temperatures.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday Night through Monday)...
Upper level ridge is finally allowed to build in across the area for 
Tuesday night and Wednesday before being forced east by approaching 
shortwave trough which drops SE out of Colorado and into lower 
Mississippi Valley by Thursday morning before lifting NE across 
middle TN Thursday night. Flow aloft remains predominately SW 
through the weekend, before the next, stronger shortwave drops SE 
out of the Rockies by Monday.

Models are in fair agreement on the timing of the frontal system on 
Thursday with best rain chances expected in the afternoon and early 
evening before this boundary quickly washes out by Friday morning. 
Both GFS and NAM now indicating enough instability/shear Thursday 
afternoon that strong to isolated severe storms could be possible. 
MLCAPE values range from 800-1400 J/kg by afternoon with bulk shear 
on the order 30-35 kt which will allow for some organization of any 
storms that develop. As with most severe weather in East TN, timing 
is everything, slightly earlier/later and enough instability may not 
be available. At this point, it certainly bears watching over the 
next few days.

Friday will see a warm front push NE through the area that will 
increase POPs through Friday night, before some drying in advance of 
our next cold front on Monday which, at present, looks like it is 
being handled consistently in the GFS, ECMWF, and the GFS Ensemble. 
This system is expected to once again bring a widespread round of 
pcpn to the area.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Precip in our area has shown a diminishing trend overnight, and this 
is expected to continue through the morning as the stronger lift 
with the upper jet streak shifts east and low level moisture 
advection stays mainly on the east side of the mountains. A 
downslope flow in the northern half of the area should also help 
keep QPF amounts relatively modest today, which will help improve 
the ongoing flooding situation (or at least not make it much worse). 
With the threat of flash flooding ending, the Flash Flood Watch will 
be canceled. 

The closed low over northern AL will drift SE across GA today and
be located near the SC coast tonight. Moisture wrapping around 
the low will maintain overcast cloud cover for most of the area 
today. Forecast soundings show deep saturation remains into this 
evening at TRI, but the aforementioned downslope flow and lack of 
synoptic QG forcing should produce just scattered coverage of 
light showers this afternoon and evening. A few breaks in the 
clouds may develop near CHA late today, and may help temps get 
into the upper 60s.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...
With the low pressure system off to our east and the skies clearing 
out, we will finally start to dry out from this weekends rainfall. 
With the ridge building in and the sun shinning we will quickly warm 
up the first half of the work week, with highs expected to be in the 
80's for most people by Wednesday. Warm and dry conditions will 
continue for several days before our next system brings a bit of a 
cool down and another chance for showers and thunderstorms. After the 
initial front moves through on Thursday night/Friday morning the 
models start to diverge. The GFS shows that the area remains mostly 
dry through the rest of the 7-day forecast with ridging building 
leading to warmer temperatures and clearer skies. The ECMWF wants to 
stretch the front out over us and have it linger over the area for a 
while. This would lead to continuous shower/thunderstorm chances 
into the weekend before drying out. Will keep low end precipitation 
chances in the forecast until better model consistency begins to take 
shape. Another frontal system will be knocking on our doorstep at 
the very end of this forecast, which should bring another round of 
widespread showers and thunderstorms to the area early next week.

Uncertainty is high in the details of vis and cigs through the
rest of the night. At TRI, a downslope wind appears to be
maintaining VFR conditions, which are expected to continue through
much of Monday. At TYS and CHA where downslope winds will not be a
factor, cigs will be lower with a moisture-rich environment. Cigs
should be predominantly in the MVFR range through Monday, and

.DISCUSSION...
Only minor changes made to the forecast with this update. Tried to
time out PoPs as rain slowly pivots out of the area.
Unfortunately, it's moving very slowly and at least a couple more
hours of decent rainfall rates are expected across SW Virginia and
NE Tennessee. Elsewhere, lighter showers remain possible 
overnight. With widespread flooding already occurring, the
flash flood watch has been continued until 8AM Eastern/7AM 
Central for the entire forecast area. For portions of SW Virginia 
and NE Tennessee where rain will linger the longest, the watch 
continues until 2PM Eastern/1PM Central. Areas across the south
may get enough breaks in the clouds for some patchy fog to form
overnight -- there will certainly be more than enough boundary 
layer moisture to work with.

307 PM EDT Sun Apr 23 2017

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Monday/...
A widespread flooding areal flood event is underway across the
eastern Tennessee Valley and Southern Appalachian region this
afternoon. Abundant moisture is combining with a slow moving cold
front and strong upper-level storm system to generate several 
rounds of light to moderate, steady precipitation. Over the last 
24 to 36 hours, the region has seen 2 to 4 inches of rain, with a 
few localized amounts of 5 to 6 inches. The hardest hit areas have
been along the Cumberland Plateau, the Cumberland Mountains of 
Southwest Virginia, and much of Southeast Tennessee. However, all 
areas are experiencing rampant flooding along creeks/streams, low 
water crossings, poor drainage areas -- which has resulted in 
numerous road closures. As a result, a Flood Warning is in effect 
for the entire CWA until 6:30 PM. This will need to be reassessed 
by the evening shift at that time. 

Latest runs of the HRRR/RAP indicate this activity beginning to
wane across the southern areas between 21-00z as a dry slot moves
in. However, locations across the Northern Plateau,
Central/Northern Valleys and the NC/VA/TN mountains may see
several more hours of light to moderate rainfall. This could
result in an additional 1 to 2 inches in some spots where heavy
training occurs. Eventually, some tapering off will occur --
roughly from 03-09z west to east. However, this may be a slow
process, so have expanded the watch for eastern areas until 12z
Monday. Some significant flooding issues may occur in these areas,
so travel is discouraged unless necessary. 

Clouds and light rain will linger into the morning hours --
especially over upper East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia. Any 
flooding issues may linger as well -- so use caution on the 
morning rush hour commute. Temperatures will be slow to climb 
given the cloud cover, so highs in the low to mid 60s will be 
common. 

.LONG TERM /Monday Night through Sunday/...
A few lingering showers are expected to slowly exit the area on 
Monday as a upper low tracks along the east coast. High pressure 
will build in late Monday into Monday night for a quite weather 
pattern for mid week. The high will dominate area weather through 
Wednesday for dry conditions and warmer temperatures. Models 
beginning to show better consistency with a cold front moving in 
around Thursday...bringing our next chance of showers and 
thunderstorms. Model consistency deteriorates after Thursday...but
models do indicate a weak boundary moving through the region 
around the Friday time frame providing a chance for additional 
convective activity. Then...current model runs build a ridge of 
high pressure over the area for Saturday and the next system 
beginning to approach the area on Sunday.

1112 AM EDT Sun Apr 23 2017

.DISCUSSION...
A large area of a light to moderate, steady rain continue to over
spread the region ahead of an approaching upper-level low pressure
system. Latest model progs, including the HRRR, RAP, and NAM show
this precipitation regenerating again this after as upper-level
lift increases and the true cold front pushes in. As a result, an
additional 2 to 3 inches of rainfall will be common across most of
the region, particularly for areas along and east of I-75 across
upper east Tennessee and southwest Virginia. This rain has lead to
quite a bit of urban and stream flooding across our region,
particularly across the Cumberland Plateau, Cumberland Mtns of SW
Virginia -- and much of the central and southern Valley. While not
necessarily  "flashy" in nature, this steady rain of about 1/4 to
1/3 of an inch per hour is adding up and causing issues for the
aforementioned creeks and streams -- and poor drainage/runoff
areas in towns/cities. have handled the immediate concern with a
Flood Advisory through 3 PM and will handle higher concerns with a
warning as needed, reevaluating things in the afternoon. A watch
will remain in effect for the entire daytime period -- and into
the night across parts of our area.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Sunday night)...An upper level trough
over the mid-mississippi valley will move into the Tennessee
Valley Today and Tonight. A series of jet streaks moving around
the trough will enhance strong divergence aloft over the southern
Appalachians. An inverted trough will also develop across the area
today due the jet dynamics producing low level forcing as well
with isentropic lift developing. Given continued very high PW
climatology values over the Tennessee Valley/southern

Training along the surface trough and elevated instability
producing locally heavy rains, flash flooding will continue to be
a concern over the already saturated ground. Have continued the
flash flood watch through 00Z, except until 08Z over the southwest
Virginia/northeast Tennessee and Smoky Mountains. Also concerned
with the burn scar across Sevier County.

The closed upper low will move slowly across the southeast United
States through Monday with a chance of showers over the far
eastern Counties.

Due to plenty of clouds and showers, temperatures will remain on
the cool side today.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...
Low pressure system will be spinning slowly through central Georgia 
by early Monday. We could continue to see some wrap around 
precipitation in Southwest Virginia and along the Southern 
Appalachian Mountains through Monday and into Monday evening, but 
for the majority of people in our forecast area the heavy 
precipitation from over the weekend will be over before the work 
week starts. As the low spins up the east coast we will get a decent 
ridge to quickly build in behind it, ahead of our next system. 
Daytime high temperatures will quickly warm up into the 80's for 
most people by the middle of the week. At this time our next system 
will be knocking on our door, a frontal boundary moving in from the 
west. In the previous several runs of the forecast models there has 
been disagreement with how much strength and moisture this system 
will have as it moves through. Current model runs suggest that it 
maintains it's strength and moves through Thursday bringing 
widespread showers and thunderstorms. After this system moves 
through we will quickly dry out and ridging will once again start to 
take place leading to another warm up in temperatures.

322 PM EDT Sat Apr 22 2017

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Sunday/...
Another round of showers and thunderstorms have begun to fire west
of the MRX CWA across Middle TN and into portions of the northern
Plateau. This activity is firing along the remnant boundary/front
in place roughly along the I-40 corridor. North of I-40, which has
remained overcast and wet for most of the day, a capped, more 
stable environment remains in place. However, places along and 
south of the I-40/I-81 corridor have seen some sunshine over the 
last 2-3 hours. This has helped destabilize things, with MLCAPE 
values in the 1000-1500 J/kg range across the Southern Plateau and
Valley -- and in the 500-1000 J/kg across the central Valley and 
along the Great Smoky Mountains. 

As a result, am expecting the potential for some strong to
marginally severe storms - particularly in Slight Risk area
between 4 to 9 PM EDT this afternoon and evening. The main threats
with this activity will be straight-line damaging winds, along
with some marginally severe hail. However, the primary impact from
this activity will be the threat for locally heavy rainfall and 
flash flooding -- along with a risk for lightning for the folks 
with outdoor plans.

As mentioned, there is a favorable set-up for flash flooding
tonight into Sunday, particularly across the northern Plateau and
portions of southwest Virginia and far northeast Tennessee which
has already seen heavy rain today and last night (1-2 inches), 
and could see an additional 2-3 inches through Sunday evening.
Adding to the threat are high PWAT values up to 1.5 inches, a deep
warm cloud layer with some CAPE to work with, and the potential
for training for the mean flow potentially moving parallel to the
boundary overnight. Then, another round(s) of locally heavy 
showers will re-develop and move across portions of East Tennessee
and Southwest Virginia tomorrow ahead of the upper-low passage as
it moves across the state on Sunday. There is really not a
specific time more favored for rainfall Sunday, though things
should begin to die down as the feature moves east after 21z.

As a result, have maintained the Flash Flood Watch for the entire
region until 21z on Sunday. May have to look at extending this in
time based on model and radar trends this evening and overnight. 


.LONG TERM /Sunday Night through Saturday/...
Residual showers will slowly exit the Southern Appalachian Region
Sunday night into Monday as an upper level low pulls away from 
the area. High pressure builds in late Monday into Tuesday for dry
conditions and a warming trended for mid week. Model consistency 
quite poor Thursday through the rest of the period...but overall 
trend is for an unsettled end of the period with a weakening 
frontal boundary progged to move through on Thursday and another 
system approaching the area around the Friday/Saturday time frame.

Scattered -TSRA/SHRA will redevelop this afternoon and move into
the region, impacting each terminal within a 20-03z timeframe.
This activity will produce MVFR to localized IFR conditions with
the heaviest downpours, before lifting to the NE late this
evening. A break in the precipitation should occur before another
round of rain will move in tonight and into the day on Sunday,
promoting low IFR to perhaps LIFR ceilings, along with MVFR to IFR
visibilities -- especially at KTYS and KTRI. This precipitation 
and low clouds should linger through the period.

.DISCUSSION...
Broad area of showers and weak thunderstorms continue to march
into the Cumberland Plateau and eventually into portions of the
central and southern Valley. This activity should continue to wane
over the next few hours as the associated 850 mb LLJ weakens as 
it lifts north into KY between 15-18z. Still, with a stationary 
boundary in place over the northern half of the area and a deep 
warm cloud layer, the potential for localized flooding/flash 
flooding is possible along the northern Cumberland Plateau and 
Mtns area of SE KY/SW VA through 17-18z. 

As this activity fades by early afternoon, some partial clearing 
may allow the boundary layer to once again destabilize -- 
particularly across areas along and south of I-40. As a result, 
some strong to marginally severe thunderstorms will be possible 
late this afternoon and evening, with the best window being 
21-01z. Uncertainty exists with just how unstable the environment 
can get, but with better shear profiles, and progged MLCAPE values
between 500-1500 j/kg, some organized convection with damaging 
winds and marginally severe hail is possible. Folks with outdoor 
plans this afternoon should pay close attention to the weather 
given the potential for lightning and locally heavy rainfall with 
this activity as well.

.Aviation...An area of convection across middle Tennessee will 
continue to move toward the TAF sites this morning. Models depict a 
general weakening trend so coverage/intensity should dissipate, but 
will include vicinity thunder CHA/TYS and shower for TRI.

Main concern is redevelopment this afternoon and continue through 
the evening. Due to the strength of upper forcing and moist/unstable
airmass, some of these storms may be strong to possibly severe.
MLCAPES of 1500 J/kg and PWs around 1.4 inches (which is near the 
daily max) will produce very heavy rains with the storms. Enough 
hail CAPE and mid-level dry air/850mb jet of 35kts to produce hail 
up to quarter size and potential of damaging winds with the stronger 
storms.

Upper forcing will keep chance showers overnight tonight. Plenty of 
boundary layer moisture so ceilings will lower to MVFR conditions.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Sunday)...For early this morning, areas
of convection is moving northeast across the Tennessee valley due
a series of waves moving along a frontal boundary over the area.
The HRRR model shows these area of convection slowly weakening
this morning and mainly staying over the northern half of the
area.

Active weather next 48 hours with a series of jet streaks 
enhancing the divergence aloft over the area. A frontal boundary 
across the Tennessee valley will be strengthen by the circulation 
around these jets. Fronto-genetic forcing along with increasing 
moisture/instability this afternoon will produce widespread 
showers and thunderstorms. MLCAPES of 1500 J/kg and PWs around 1.4
inches (which is near the daily max) will produce very heavy rains
with the storms. Enough hail CAPE and mid-level dry air/850mb jet
of 35kts to produce hail up to quarter size and potential of
damaging winds with the stronger storms.

For tonight, approaching and deepening upper trough over the mid-
section of the nation will once again enhance the divergence aloft
over the Tennessee Valley. Even though the frontal boundary will
move south of the area, the pressure falls associated with the jet
dynamics will produce an inverted surface trough across the
southern Appalachians late Saturday night and Sunday. This
boundary will focus around round of showers with heavy rains.

Due to the persistent heavy rains, training of cells along these
boundaries and climatology very high PWs, there is a potential of
flash flooding. Have issued a Flash Flood Watch for flash flooding
for the entire area from mid-afternoon through Sunday afternoon.
Later shifts will need to especially watch the burn scar area in
Sevier county.

Warm today, but plenty of clouds and rain showers Sunday will keep
temperatures cooler.

.LONG TERM (Sunday Night through Friday)...
Low pressure system will be slowly moving south and east of us as
we head into the last portion of the weekend. We could see some 
wrap around showers Sunday night into Monday, with the best 
chances being along the Southern Appalachian Mountains. As the low
continues to move to the east a ridge will start to build in from
the west. This ridge will dry us out and help along a warming 
trend that will continue through the work week. Another frontal 
system will make a run at our area in the second half of the work 
week, but recent model runs suggest that this may fizzle out 
before it can bring any widespread precipitation to our area. By 
the end of the work week, models suggest that temperatures across 
the area will be in the 80's with some locations possibly flirting
with 90 degrees.

.AVIATION...
Main concern thoughtout the forecast period is timing and intensity 
of convection. Periods of showers and especially afternoon and 
evening thunderstorms will be the rule at all TAF sites. Heavy rains 
will reduce visibilities to LIFR/IFR conditions. The afternoon 
convection will be strong across TYS and CHA with strong gusty 
winds, frequent lightning and possibly small hail.

By 00-02Z, nearly saturated boundary layer airmass and periods of 
rain, some heavy, will reduce visibility and ceilings to nearly IFR 
conditions.

.DISCUSSION...
Tweaked overnight temperature/dewpoint trends a bit based on
current obs. Otherwise, only major chance with this update was
bringing PoPs and cloud cover a bit further south for Saturday and
upping QPFs to match WPC guidance. Still some major differences 
in short term models with regards to precip timing tomorrow, and 
confidence is below normal. The latest NAM wants to keep areas 
south of I40 dry Saturday morning (with some lighter showers 
north), and just slowly nudges the precip into the Cumberland 
Plateau by early evening. From there, precip slowly works into a 
TRI-TYS-CHA line by 00-03Z. In contrast, latest HRRR run (which 
currently goes through 18Z Saturday) is much faster bringing the 
line in, having it across much of the TN valley by 16Z.
To further complicate matters, there is not much model 
consistency from run to run either. Regardless, looks like a
decent potential for some severe storms tomorrow as the cold front
pushes through with decent instability, shear, and plenty of
moisture.

We will continue to monitor the heavy rainfall potential across
the area this weekend. Current WPC forecasts indicate rainfall
totals maxing out around 3-4" across SW Virginia and NE 
Tennessee.

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Saturday/...
Scattered strong to marginally severe thunderstorms will be
possible across the region this afternoon and into the evening,
before weakening with the setting sunset and generally dissipating
by the late evening and midnight hours. An active pattern is 
expected to continue overnight and into the day on Saturday as a
cold front will march from western Tennessee into Middle Tennessee 
throughout the day -- and into portions of east Tennessee by the 
late afternoon and evening hours. Ahead of this front, a few areas
of light showers will be possible along the weak, remnant 
boundary from today. However, by midday and into the early 
afternoon, the atmosphere will continue to destabilize, with 
MLCAPE values approaching 1000-1500 J/kg by the afternoon, 
especially south of I-40. This, combined with some increased shear
profiles will yield a threat for organized, severe thunderstorms.
Damaging winds, marginally severe hail, and locally heavy 
rainfall and possible flooding is possible with this activity. 
However, the main window for severe weather may be after 00z when 
the front pushes into the region. 

.LONG TERM /Saturday Night through Friday/...
The Southern Appalachian Region will remain in an active weather 
pattern Saturday night and Sunday as a frontal boundary that has 
been over the area slowly exits the region. Model consistency has 
been quiet poor with the evolution of this system but current 
trend is for the main band of convection to move through Saturday 
night into early Sunday. With deep moisture in place...flooding is
expected to the main threat. A few showers may linger into Monday
across far northern and eastern locations as the system pulls 
away from the area. High pressure builds in late Monday into 
Tuesday for a return to dry and warm conditions for mid week. 
Model consistency becomes poor and confidence is low by the end of
the extended but the trend is for the next system to move in 
around Thursday/Friday time frame.

Area of light to moderate showers still moving across upper east
Tennessee into southwest Virginia. This activity should move out
over the next couple of hours -- though the potential for
additional showers and isolated storms will exist throughout the
remainder of the day. Elsewhere across the region, a mostly clear
sky is prevailing over the central and southern valley, helping 
to destabilize the environment somewhat for the afternoon. MLCAPE
values may reach the 500-1000 j/kg range by the afternoon in these
spots, with a weak front helping to focus this activity. Therefore,
there will be an opportunity for scattered storms -- some strong 
to marginally severe to develop in the 18-00z window later today. 
The main threats will be locally heavy rainfall and damaging gusty
winds.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A weak wave is moving across the
northern half of the area producing scattered showers and isolated
thunder. This wave will exit the area early this morning.

A frontal boundary will move into the northern half of Tennessee
and southwest Virginia by this afternoon. Airmass along and ahead
of the boundary will become unstable with MLCAPES of 1000-1300
J/Kg. Due to dry air in the mid-levels and below cloud base,
isolated strong to damaging winds are possible with the stronger
storms. Hail CAPE will be enough to support isolated hail up to
quarter size. PWs will increase to 1.35 inches which is near the
90th percentile of climatology. Since storm motions will be nearly
parallel with the frontal boundary, training of thunderstorms with
heavy rain is possible. Localized flash flooding is a concern.

The convection will weaken by sunset, but given frontal boundary
across the area, scattered convection will remain through the
night.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...
Frontal boundary will still be stalled out in our vicinity as we 
start the weekend. Current forecasts have it draped across the 
Kentucky/Tennessee border by Saturday morning. Along this boundary
(especially south of it) there will be good chances to see 
thunderstorms on Saturday. High PWAT values of over 1.25 inches 
will combine with CAPE values of over 1000 J/Kg and decent shear 
through the atmosphere. This combination will lend itself to 
possibly seeing some strong to possibly severe storms Saturday. 
The biggest threat with a few storms would be strong winds.. 
Additionally winds in the mid to upper levels of the atmosphere 
will be moving generally west to east, parallel to the boundary at
the surface. This will increase the chances of training storms 
and we could see some flooding problems if several storms move 
over the same area. 

Precipitation chances will stick around through the weekend as the 
low pressure system slowly swings south of us before moving off the 
Atlantic seaboard. As this system slides along the stationary 
boundary near us rain wrapped up with the low will continue through 
Monday night. Another frontal system will make a run at us from the 
northwest but a strengthening high pressure system will build in 
from off the East Coast. This high pressure system will win out and 
we will see several days of clear skies and very warm temperatures. 
Towards the end of the work week high temperatures are expected to 
be around the mid 80's for most of our forecast area.

.Short term (Tonight and Friday)...
Scattered convection firing along the Plateau and Mountains will 
continue to develop this afternoon in an increasingly moist and
less unstable environment. SBCAPE values are progged to be around
1000-1500 J/kg this afternoon, with MLCAPE values progged to be 
as high as 700-800 J/kg by 21-22z timeframe. There is very little 
shear to work with, so am not expecting very much organization 
with this activity (which will favor the high terrain thanks to 
some added orrographic lift). However, a localized strong storm is
possible - with gusty winds and small hail being the main 
threats. PWATs are progged to be around 1.2", so a quick heavy 
downpous will also accompany any activity that develops.

These storms should die quickly with the loss of heating, resulting
in a mostly/partly clear evening. However, clouds will quickly be
on the increase after midnight as a weak front drops south out of
KY late tonight into Friday morning. This will generate another 
round of slower moving showers and storms progged to move into the
northern half of the region between 09-15z. The main threats with
this activty will be localized flooding due to the slow-moving 
nature of these storms -- as well as gusty winds and some small 
hail. A better threat for scattered severe storms may evolve south
of I-40 south (which will be precip free longer) as the 
atmosphere destablizes in the afternoon thanks to some better 
heating. The front will sag south providing a focus for more 
organized convection there between 18-00z. 


.Long term (Friday night through Thursday)...Friday night...the 
boundary that remains over the area through Friday moves north...
with a low pressure system and associated front approaching the 
southern Appalachians from the west. Scattered rain showers will 
continue through Friday night in to early Saturday morning with 
just enough instability to include a slight chance of thunder 
in the forecast.

Saturday...rain chances begin increasing through the morning 
with enough lift...instability...and moisture for scattered 
showers and thunderstorms to become more widespread through 
the early afternoon. With minimal wind shear...high PW values 
and weak lift...strong storms will be possible with a low chance 
for isolated severe. By Saturday evening...the low level winds 
shift from SW to W...with low level warm air advection and moisture 
decreasing. As cooler drier air moves in to the area through 
Saturday night...thunder becomes limited...with only scattered 
light showers remaining through the night.

Sunday...cooler and drier air will continue to advect in to the 
area behind the low pressure with enough wrap around moisture to 
keep light scattered showers in the forecast through the afternoon. 
Temperatures will be several degrees below normal as opposed to 
several degrees above normal that has been occurring for several 
days. By Sunday late afternoon...the low pressure will be well 
east of the Appalachians...with rain chances quickly diminishing.

Sunday night through Thursday...a weak ridge moves over the area. 
The NW flow slowly shifts to the W and then SW through the 
beginning of the work week...with a gradual warming trend to 
temperatures through the rest of the extended. Mostly clear 
skies and dry weather will be present.

.DISCUSSION...
Lingering morning showers across upper east Tennessee and
southwest Virginia are quickly dissipating late in the morning. In
their wake, the cloud cover over that area should continue to 
erode, resulting in at least partly sunny conditions there by the 
early afternoon. Elsewhere to the south and west, mostly clear 
conditions have allowed temperatures to warm quickly into the 
lower to mid 70s as of 15z. This area over the Plateau and 
Central/Southern Valleys may be the focus for some locally 
stronger storms later on this afternoon (thanks to a more
destabilized environment there). Model progs continue to hint at 
MLCAPE values around 700-800 J/kg in a low shear environment. Due 
to the lack of forcing, am not expecting much storm organization 
-- though some orographic lift along the Plateau and Mountains may
help concentrate the stronger activity. Lightning, small hail and
brief gusty winds will be the main threat, with this activity 
dying off around 00-01z.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Patchy fog/low stratus is possible early this morning due to
partly clear skies and residual ground moisture from this week's
rain. Some isolated showers are possible this morning, but most
areas should stay dry into this afternoon. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms are expected to develop this afternoon with winds
out of the south-southwest advecting Gulf moisture into the area
(PWATS near 1") and a bit of instability (MLCAPE values generally
under 800 J/kg). With very little shear to work with and the only
forcing being orographic lift, we're not expecting many strong
storms, but there is the potential for an isolated strong to
severe storm producing some strong winds or small hail. Again, 
with the orographic lift being pretty much the only forcing, the 
best chance for storms will be over the higher elevations. 
Convection will fizzle out after sunset. Tonight should be mainly 
dry, but northern portions of the forecast area will begin seeing 
increased cloud cover and potentially a shower/thunderstorm as a 
frontal boundary slowly approaches the area. Temperatures will be 
quite warm today, reaching the lower 80s in many locations. Lows 
tonight will hover near 60 degrees.


.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
Zonal flow aloft dominates Friday and Saturday ahead of a digging
Plains trough that swings through the area Sunday with weak 
ridging behind it through Wednesday. At the surface, frontal 
boundary approaches the area Friday morning becoming nearly 
stationary across the area Friday night. Boundary then begins to 
lift north Saturday ahead of a well defined low pressure system 
that will finally kick east of the area on Sunday afternoon and 
allow for high pressure and an extended period of drier conditions
through Wednesday.

Frontal boundary on Friday will serve as a focusing mechanism for 
showers and thunderstorms once again. With model indicated PWs of 
1.4 inches, MLCAPE values nearing 1000 J/kg and sufficient deep 
layer shear, some of these storms could become organized enough to 
produce an isolated strong to locally severe threat across the area. 
Additionally, orientation of sfc boundary parallel to the deep layer 
flow could cause training cells and the possibility of heavy 
rainfall in training cells. 

Rain threat will persist overnight Friday before diminishing some 
over the southern half of the area early Saturday as warm front 
ahead of the approaching low Saturday night, shifts north of the 
area. This is followed by another potential bout with severe 
thunderstorms Saturday night as a 30-40 kt low level jet develops 
ahead of the approaching front. As the upper level trough begins to 
rotate through the area, some shortwave energy and sufficient deep 
layer shear could once again act to support a primary threat of 
large hail and damaging winds. Although, latest consensus of models 
indicates that greatest threat for severe will likely lie further 
west over NW Mississippi and the southern third of Middle TN, low 
level forcing of the associated front could act as a focal point 
for severe weather as it moves through East TN Saturday night.

Forecast then sees a prolonged period of clearer skies and drier 
conditions Monday through Wednesday. With a surface ridge nosing 
southeast from New England and an upper level ridge finally able to 
establish itself over the area, we can expect seasonal temperatures 
gradually warming about 4-8 degrees above normal by Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM (This Evening through Thursday)...clouds have broken
out across much of the area this afternoon allowing for airmass to
destabilize. Scattered thunderstorms are expected through early
evening with localized strong storms possible. Dry air aloft will
allow for strong downbursts, and low Wet Bulb Zeros (WBZ) and
enough hail CAPE for small hail with the stronger thunderstorms.

Convection will dissipate soon after sunset. There is a difference
between the models on how much fog and low cloud development. Have
included patchy fog, but localized dense fog possible.

For Thursday, airmass destabilizes allowing for scattered
thunderstorms to once again develop. Only forcing will be terrain
orographic lift, so best coverage over the higher elevations.
Isolated strong storms possible.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...Deep northern tier 
upper trough will build east across the Great Lakes into 
Southeastern Canada Thursday night through Friday. The mean flow in 
this pattern will be westerly as another relatively strong short 
wave presses east into the Central Plains. A cool frontal boundary 
will move slowly south into the northern half of the forecast area 
and serve as a focus for showers and thunderstorms with model 
indication of weak to moderate instability available for convection. 
Because the upper flow will be nearly parallel to the surface front, 
rainfall could be rather heavy with some training; especially north 
of interstate 40. Some of the storms could become strong during the 
afternoon into the evening hours. The chance for rain will remain 
high through the overnight period Friday night into Saturday morning 
but would likely decrease through the daylight hours Saturday 
morning as the surface boundary moves north as a warm front in 
advance of the trailing Midwest upper trough. Convection could 
become severe later in the day Saturday into the evening hours as a 
strengthening low level jet pulls higher dewpoint air north into the 
Southern Appalachian Region. At this time, model depiction indicates 
sufficient instability for storms; however, shear should be rather 
strong with the 35 to 40 kt low level jet building into the area 
Saturday evening. The convective precipitation wraps up later 
Saturday night with a decent chance of showers on Sunday as a 
healthy amount of short wave energy rotates through the base of the 
Eastern U.S. long wave trough. The forecast area finally gets a 
chance to dry out Monday through Wednesday with some upper level 
ridging building into the region.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Patchy fog is possible this morning as a soupy airmass remains in
place overhead, but clouds should limit radiative cooling and 
dense fog development. 

Scattered showers will continue tomorrow with the stationary
boundary remaining nearby and moisture remaining in place. With
the shortwave disturbance pushing east, shower activity should
be less widespread than the past few days. Precipitation will
taper off from southwest to northeast throughout the day and into
tonight, and we could see some breaks in the clouds by late 
afternoon. Skies will clear a bit overnight and with a moist 
boundary layer, patchy fog will again be possible.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...
Zonal flow aloft looks to continue across the area through the 
early portion of the weekend. An approaching front during the 
latter part of Thursday will once again stall as it moves across 
our area on Friday. A stronger shortwave moving out of the Rockies
Friday and into West TN on Saturday will finally begin to dig a 
trough over the SE US that will drive the front east of our area 
late Sunday. With this, we can expect to see a continued unsettled
weather pattern persisting into the weekend before we dry out on 
Monday and Tuesday. 

The nearly stationary boundary that has been effecting our weather 
over the last several days finally lifts N of the area Thursday. 
This should allow for lower POPs across much of the area, excluding 
SW VA and NE TN, for most of the day. Thursday night sees next front 
approaching from the W with increasing deep layer moisture moving 
into the area overnight into Friday. POPs once again increase across 
much of the area Friday through Saturday as this next front begins 
to stall out across the area. The digging trough finally pushes the 
boundary east of the area by Sunday afternoon with a drying trend 
expected for Monday and Tuesday. 

Models look to be in very good agreement on upcoming large scale 
evolution of the stalling front Friday and Saturday and the digging 
SE trough on Sunday. Unfortunately, as has been the case over the 
last few days, the devil is in the details. With a nearly stationary 
boundary draped over the area Friday through Saturday, we could once 
again expect periods of rain, rainshowers, and even thunderstorms 
dependent upon exact frontal location and the timing of any 
shortwave features propagating through the area. Currently there is 
not enough fine detailed agreement between the models to more 
precise with weekend POPs which may be more reasonable to believe 
will see periods of active wx followed by some lulls prior to the 
frontal passage on Sunday.

Round of showers is slowly continuing to move northeastward and
decrease in coverage as the day continues. Another round of
thunderstorms is developing to our west and south. This activity
will continue into our forecast area this afternoon/evening, and
like yesterday, not expecting much (if any) in the way of 
strong/severe weather. Biggest threats with any storms will be be 
brief heavy rain. These are relatively slow moving storms, and 
combined with decent rainfall over the past few days we could see 
some isolated flooding today. As the sun sets the energy in the 
atmosphere will diminish and we will transition to just rain 
showers. We could once again see fog overnight, but am not 
expecting widespread dense fog since the overcast skies will 
dampen the radiative cooling. Precipitation chances will continue
into tomorrow and slowly end from southwest to northeast. 
Southerly winds will lead to another warm day even with the mostly
cloudy skies.

Models continue to be in decent agreement with the overall 
pattern, although differ in the details. Overall forecast 
confidence in the details of timing, etc. is a bit below normal 
for this time of year in this active pattern, although confidence 
is high that there will be showers and thunderstorms at times 
through the weekend. Quite a bit of moisture will linger over the 
area Wed night and Thu even though we will be between systems, so 
will keep slight chance to chance PoPs both periods. By Friday a 
cold front is forecast to drift into the area, but models have 
been inconsistent with timing. This front will likely stall over 
the region although exactly where is uncertain, then a closed 
upper low is forecast to move through during the weekend, along 
with a front Saturday night/early sunday. This will keep things 
unsettled through the weekend. Saturday night/early Sunday may be 
the most active given the expected frontal passage. Cooler air 
will push in Sunday behind the front with some drying by Monday 
and especially Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Latest water vapor and RAP upper air analysis indicate a few
upstream shortwave troughs...one along the TN-AL border...and a 
second over northeast AR...and yet a third over eastern TX this 
morning. At the surface, nearly stationary frontal boundary south 
of the area over northern GA, AL, MS will begin to lift northward 
back across the area through tonight. 

Combination of the northward progressing front along with the
three successive shortwaves lifting northeast across the area 
will serve to produce continued unsettled weather area wide 
through tonight. NAM seems to have the best handle on the current 
situation given that it initializes with little to no pcpn 
anywhere across the area, a fact supported by current radars 
across the SE US. Other guidance including SREF and GFS initialize
with fairly widespread pcpn across much of TN and northern GA, 
AL, MS this morning and in an area dominated by clear air returns 
on the radar. Based on this, forecast tends toward the NAM 
solution through tonight.

One thing that NAM, GFS, and SREF are in very good agreement on is
the amount of QPF across the area through tonight. With both
NAM/GFS indicating PWs on the order of 1.2-1.4 inches across the
area, we are very close to the maximum average values for this
time of year. As such, we can expect to once again see some very
heavy localized rainfall, similar to yesterday where portions of
our Plateau counties saw rainfall amounts on the order of 2 inches
or more in spots. Given already rain soaked ground and current 3
hour flash flood guidance on the order of 2-3 inches across much
of the area, localized flooding may once again become an issue
later today and tonight for some areas. 

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...
Unsettled weather pattern continues into the extended period with
a frontal boundary lingering near our area for Wednesday. This 
boundary will provide a focus for showers and thunderstorms with 
decent moisture and instability remaining overhead. Things should 
briefly dry out a bit for Wednesday night, but clouds and rain 
chances increase again on Thursday ahead of another approaching 
cold front as moisture surges back into the area. Models have 
slowed down frontal passage timing quite a bit, bringing it 
through midday Friday into Friday evening along with a better 
chance of showers and thunderstorms. A closed upper low is 
forecast to affect the region over the weekend, bringing continued
unsettled weather and perhaps the chance for some stronger 
showers and thunderstorms and heavy rain as the system pushes 
through. There's still some differences on exact timing and low 
track from model to model, but the general consensus at this point
is the front blowing through early to midday Sunday. For now, 
this is where I've placed the highest PoPs and best chance for 
thunderstorms, but this will become better refined as the event 
nears and timing may change. Behind the frontal passage, some 
wraparound moisture on the back side of the low may trigger some 
scattered showers and cloudy skies for Monday. Temperatures will 
be warm this week, with highs in the upper 70s to lower 80s. 
Behind this weekend's system, temperatures will drop down into the
upper 60s/lower 70s range for Sunday and Monday.

.SHORT TERM (Today through tomorrow)...
Showers from this morning have nearly exited our northern counties
in Southwest Virginia and new storms are moving in from Middle
Tennessee. Most of these storms are just isolated heavy showers,
but the strongest of them do have a bit of lightning as well. Not
expecting anything in the form of severe weather this afternoon or
tonight. Thunderstorms will generally stay in the middle/southern
half of the Tennessee, generally south of the boundary that is 
set up over us. More widespread precipitation could move over the
area late tonight once the thunderstorms have dissipated. Could
see some patchy fog overnight as well with the showers today, but
widespread fog is not expected since mostly cloudy skies overnight
should keep dense fog away. Similar temperatures can be expected
tomorrow along with another round of showers and thunderstorms.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Monday)...
Models in decent agreement early on, although differences 
increase during the period. Forecast confidence is a bit below 
normal for this time of year in this active pattern. Numerous 
showers and thunderstorms will continue into Tuesday night with 
the exiting short wave energy, but should diminish overnight. 
Looks like there will be enough moisture and instability lingering
over the area Wed and Thu for some isolated to scattered 
convection, then a cold front is forecast to push through Thursday
night/early Friday for a better chance of showers and 
thunderstorms. A stronger upper trough/perhaps closed upper low is
forecast to affect the region over the weekend, bringing more 
unsettled weather both days. Will carry highest chance for showers
and thunderstorms Saturday night into Sunday for right now, but 
timing of this system still rather uncertain. Cooler and drier air
should be moving in for Monday, although there still may be a 
lingering shower.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Latest water vapor imagery continues to indicate zonal flow across
the Ohio Valley and Mid-South this morning. Surface front 
currently analyzed across the Ohio Valley with shower activity SE 
of the boundary across Middle TN and Central/Western KY. These 
showers are diminishing in coverage and intensity as they drift 
eastward toward the northern Plateau.

Front is expected to drop very slowly SE across the East TN Valley  
today bringing with it a period of unsettled weather with showers 
likely and thunderstorms possible throughout the day. Although 
there is sufficient instability for strong thunderstorm activity, 
the shear/helicity are weak to non-existent and should eliminate 
any potential for severe storms this afternoon. The threat of 
localized heavy rainfall is possible with this event. Model PWs, 
particularly over the southern valley approach the seasonal 
maximum values for middle April at around 1.2 to 1.3 inches. 
Couple this with a boundary becoming nearly stationary by tonight,
and some isolated portions of the southern valley could see 
rainfall totals approaching nearly 1 inch over the next 24 hours. 
More generally however, expect much of the area south of I-40 to 
see on the order of 0.6 inches of pcpn while elsewhere pcpn 
amounts should be on the order of 0.4 inches. The good news, is 
that with much of the area now falling about 1-2 inches behind in 
total rainfall for this year, this event should bring some much 
needed help in order to cut into the deficit.

Main axis of pcpn should continue to push further S by this
evening  with areas of SW VA and extreme NE TN likely beginning 
to dry out by early tonight. Meanwhile portions of SE TN could 
continue to see periods of showers and maybe a thunderstorm all 
the way into Tuesday morning as the front struggles to make much 
southward progress and gets hung up across the southern TN Valley 
tonight. 


.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...
Stationary front will lie across the southern part of the forecast 
area early Tuesday with shortwave energy moving from west to east 
across the area during the day and overnight. Both NAM and GFS have 
best chance of showers and thunderstorms across the southern part of 
the area. Will keep likely pops across this area decreasing at night 
after loss of heating. Temperatures only 60s mountains and across 
southwest Virginia but lower to mid 70s elsewhere. Wednesday higher 
pressure to the east strengthens and the front will slowly shift 
east of the forecast area and weaken. Still with heating of the day 
scattered showers and thunderstorms will occur. Highs are expected 
to be a few degrees warmer too. Thursday will see more sun and only 
a 20 to 30 percent chance of showers/storms ahead of another front 
moving into the Tennessee Valley from the northwest. Temperatures 
mostly lower to mid 80s. The front will move through Thursday night 
and Friday. Cooling temperatures back down to the upper 60s to upper 
70s. A stronger front will approach late Saturday into Sunday from 
the southwest. A surface low should move just to the northwest into 
Kentucky Sunday. This system may bring a threat for severe 
thunderstorms but the timing is still difficult to predict this many 
days out.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Monday)...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates 
mostly zonal flow across the Southern Appalachians with a trough to 
the northwest across the Northern Plains. At the surface, a cold 
front stretches from near Chicago to the southwest near Amarillo, 
TX. Seeing a few showers and storms breaking out to the south of 
this boundary on regional radar imagery. Closer to home, there have 
a been a few showers across the Northern Plateau and SW VA but 
coverage has been limited. PW values are currently around an inch 
and not seeing much in the way of substantial lift. Therefore, 
expect coverage will remain limited the remainder of the afternoon 
and into the evening.

The front will make some decent progress to the south during the 
overnight hours as the trough currently across the Northern Plains 
moves into the Great Lakes Region. PoPs will increase late tonight 
into Monday morning from northwest to southeast. Models do indicate 
that the front will slow tomorrow and may remain just to the north 
of the forecast area throughout the day. Regardless, wide spread 
showers and storms are forecast tomorrow with PoPs in the likely 
category during the afternoon. Lapse rates are not very impressive 
but model soundings do show some skinny SBCAPE values up to 1500 
J/Kg. The main lift will be well to the north but there could be a 
stronger storm or two with some gusty winds possible. PW values 
ahead of the front will also increase into the 1.5 inch range near 
the maximum value observed for mid-April. Due to this increased PoPs 
during the day on Monday. With the widespread cloud cover and 
precipitation, temperatures will be a bit cooler and range from the 
upper 60s to mid 70s.

.LONG TERM (Monday night through Saturday)...

Shower and thunderstorm activity will continue as the nearly 
stationary boundary sits over us. A few ripples of energy will make 
their way eastwards across this feature and will help to bring more 
widespread shower and thunderstorm activity to the area. Atmosphere 
looks to support thunderstorms, especially during the 
afternoon/evening hours, but forecast soundings don't show that 
there should be enough CAPE/shear for widespread severe weather. 
Generally expect most locations will see a few rumbles of thunder 
and some garden variety thunderstorms through most of the work week. 
As we move into the middle/late part of the work week the moisture 
becomes more limited and the shower/thunderstorm activity should 
weaken and decrease in coverage. Chances for more storms pick back 
up as a weak front moves in at the end of the week. This front also 
looks to stall out over us and will likely remain over us for a 
brief period of time before yet another system quickly sweeps 
through over the weekend. Right now this weekend system looks to 
bring the best chances for widespread precipitation, but the timing 
is difficult to pin down as models are still in disagreement with 
the strength and speed of this system.

.AVIATION...

VFR conditions currently across the terminals and are expected to
continue throughout the TAF cycle. Southwesterly winds are strong
this afternoon with gusts in the 25-30 kt range possible at times
as a front approaches from the northwest. A few showers are
showing up on radar but confidence in coverage and intensity is
too low to include in the TAFs at this time. Showers will develop
to the northwest tonight ahead of the approaching front with VCSH
starting at KTRI around 09z and KTYS around 12z. Widespread
showers and storms from the front are forecast just beyond the end
of the TAF cycle.

.DISCUSSION...

Main update to the forecast was to adjust PoPs upward across the
northern Plateau to account for the ongoing radar trends. Latest 
Hi-Res models continue to show that precip. will weaken as it 
progresses eastward. Based on the current trends, it seems as 
though isolated to scattered shower/storms will persist further to
the east than forecast. Therefore, increased PoPs slightly for 
the remainder of the day. Any precipitation should be light with
amounts under a tenth of an inch. Highs today will once again top
out in the upper 70s to mid 80s in most locations.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A flattening upper ridge across
the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians, but moisture and
instability is marginal. Only forcing will remain the higher
terrain so only expect isolated/widely scattered afternoon/evening
showers and thunderstorms today. Temperatures will remain 
unseasonably warm.

For tonight, convection that develops along southern Ohio Valley
cold front may move into the northern Plateau and southwest
Virginia. Most locations will remain dry. Moisture and instabilty
remain marginal, so mainly showers anticipated.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...
Cold front moving into the forecast area Monday with chance of 
showers and thunderstorms increasing then continued likely showers 
Monday night into Tuesday. Wednesday front should finally shift east 
of the region. There will be decreasing rain chances Wednesday 
night...but new front to approach Thursday from the northwest and 
move into the region by early Friday. The next front will then stall 
over the region like the earlier front...on Saturday. Rainfall 
amounts will be around 0.50 inches in the day 2 and day 3 period. 
Instability will be enough for thunderstorms each day but right now 
not expected to be severe. Cooler days Monday and Tuesday due to 
more clouds and precipitation but still above normal. Highs Wednesday 
through Saturday will reach the mid 70s to mid 80s during the day 
and lows at night in the 50s to lower 60s.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Sunday)...

The upper level ridge is beginning to shift to the east. Radar
imagery indicates a few showers across SW VA and NE TN but
coverage and intensity remains limited. For the remainder of the
afternoon expect isolated to scattered showers will continue in NE
TN and SW VA and quickly come to end near sunset. Despite the
ridge moving to the east, temperatures will remain mild overnight
with lows generally in the 50s. 

A cold front will slowly move across the Central Plains into the
Mid-Mississippi River Valley on Sunday. Upper level flow will
generally be zonal with a weak trough progressing through the
Southern Appalachians. PW values will range from 1.0-1.2 inches. 
These values are around the 75th percentile for mid-April. 
Therefore, have continued with slight chance to chance PoPs for 
Sunday afternoon. Instability is weak around 250-750 J/Kg so 
there could be a few isolated to scattered thunderstorms. Warm 
temperatures are forecast again on Sunday with highs in the upper 
70s to low 80s for most locations.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Friday)...

No dramatic changes in the long term portion of the forecast with 
the approaching front. Front will slowly meander into our area and 
set up shop sometime overnight Sunday night/Monday morning. While 
the boundary is in the area we will see continuous shower and 
thunderstorm chances, especially early in the work week. Best 
chances for storms will come early as the front is just moving in. 
Right now the better atmospheric ingredients for strong storms looks 
to be to our north, but we will likely see several thunderstorms in 
our area through the work week. Boundary will not really help out 
with the above normal temperatures with many locations expected to 
get near or above 80 degrees by Wednesday. We will slowly start to 
dry out through the mid to late part of the work week as the 
moisture streams off to our east. Another more fast moving system 
looks to move through the area at the end of the work week into next 
weekend bringing another chance for widespread showers and 
thunderstorms.

.DISCUSSION...

The upper level ridge axis is beginning to push to the east.
Higher PW values have advected into the region with low level
southerly flow. Water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis
indicates several weak shortwave troughs rotating around the
periphery of the ridge and could see a few shower/storms today 
across NE TN and SW VA. Chances are small with the lack of any 
substantial lift. For the update, increased cloud cover and 
dewpoints to account for the ongoing trends.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Ridge of high pressure centered
across the southeast United States will remain the main weather
feature across the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachian. An
area of best moisture and instability on top of the ridge axis
will be over southwest Virginia/northeast Tennessee this afternoon
allowing widely scattered/scattered convection to develop.
Greatest coverage will be across the higher elevations.

Moisture/instability is significantly lower across TYS and CHA as
upper ridge will suppress any convection there.

Another summer-like airmass will remain with highs only a few
degrees lower than record highs for today.

For tonight, suppressing ridge and loss of daytime heating will
keep things dry.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...
For the long term forecast warm temperatures continue with a chance 
of showers and thunderstorms each day. A slow moving cold front 
forecast to move towards the region late Sunday. With increasing 
moisture moving up from the Gulf of Mexico there will be a slight 
chance of showers and thunderstorms except highest in the northeast. 
The front will actually move in Monday with showers likely and a 
chance of thunderstorms. This front will produce significant 
rainfall of up to one inch Monday into Tuesday. As the moisture 
slowly moves east and another front approaches from the northwest at 
mid week rain chances will lower Wednesday night through Thursday 
night. Friday the next front will move into the eastern Tennessee 
Valley so rain chances increase once again.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

A warm day across the forecast area with most locations in the 
upper 70s and low 80s at 2 pm. The upper level ridge axis is 
overhead with 500 heights around 580-584 dm. Orographic lift along 
the mountains is leading to a few isolated showers across the 
Appalachians and have slight chance to chance PoPs there through 
sunset. Another mild night is forecast as the ridge shifts slowly to 
the east. Overnight lows will generally be in the 50s. 

Southerly flow throughout the atmosphere is forecast on Saturday as 
the ridge axis pushes to the east. A weak upper level trough will 
pass to the north with PW values of around an inch in SW VA and NE 
TN. With this weak lift, have slight chance to chance PoPs for these 
locations but still expect most areas will remain dry. Even though 
the ridge axis will push to the east, upper level heights will still 
remain elevated and afternoon highs on Saturday will top out in the 
upper 70s to low 80s for most locations.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Thursday)...

Main story for the rest of the forecast will be warm temperatures 
and nearly continuous rain chances. Main focus for our weather in 
the extended portion of the forecast will be a frontal boundary 
expected to move in and stall out in our region. Ahead of the front 
we could see some isolated showers and thunderstorms as moisture 
increases with winds coming up out of the Gulf of Mexico. Front will 
actually move into the area by Monday morning and then should stall 
out and will likely linger around for several days. During the 
first part of the week, with the boundary over us, is when we will
see the best chance for widespread showers and thunderstorms. 
While this boundary is in the area we could see decent CAPE 
available over us, but only minor to moderate shear is currently 
shown in forecast soundings. Confidence in strength and timing of 
any storms near us while the boundary is overhead is very low 
since the movement of this boundary can drastically affect the 
atmosphere in our region. Confidence should increase as high 
resolution models start to handle the system. Storm chances look 
like they will slowly fizzle out as moisture with this system 
moves off to the east. During this entire period temperatures will
remain very warm, about 10 degrees above normal for this time of 
year.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A ridge of high pressure both
surface and aloft will remain across the southern Appalachians.
Models do show some upslope flow into the far east mountains near
the Tennessee/North Carolina state-line. Marginal instability is
available (MLCAPES of 500-1000 J/Kg) to produce isolated to widely
scattered showers and possibly a thunderstorm there, mainly in the
afternoon.

Otherwise, summer-like ridging will produce unseasonably warm
temperatures. Trended toward the warm guidance values due to the
dry dewpoints and persistence of the last couple days.

For tonight, diurnal driven convection will dissipate with plenty
of cirru-stratus remaining. 

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...
Warm ridge continues but moisture and instability ahead of front 
moving into ohio valley enough to trigger isolated showers and 
thunderstorms mainly late afternoon to early evening across 
northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia. Front will be closer 
Sunday so chance of rain about 20 percent south and 30 percent 
north. Near 80 highs Saturday and slightly cooler Sunday with more 
clouds moving in late. Sunday night into Monday front stalls over 
region so rain chances will be slight chance south...higher north 
overnight and then increase to likely Monday. Tuesday the front may 
move back north as a warm front but still be in the area so 
continuing good chance of showers and storms. The warm moist south 
to southwest flow continues through Thursday with another front to 
the NW. Good rain chances continue along with mild temperatures 5 to 
10 degrees above normal. Some heavy rainfall is possible as the 
front stalls over the region early next week but timing for that is 
a little to early to tell what day it would occur.

.DISCUSSION...
An upper-level ridge of high pressure continues to dominate the
weather across the Southern Appalachian and Eastern Tennessee
Valley region, with tranquil weather expected again overnight. Any
isolated convection that fired along the SW NC mountains overnight
have quickly died with the loss of heating. A glance at Water
Vapor satellite imagery does show some moisture filtering back 
into the region -- helping to provide some very light high cloud 
cover at times overnight. Model progs show some increased boundary
layer moisture, which combined with a mostly clear sky and calm 
winds will allow for some patchy valley fog near bodies of water. 
As such, have added a mention of this to the forecast. The higher 
dewpoints will help keep low temperatures quite mild again, with 
low to upper 50s common over the entire valley region come the 
predawn hours on Friday morning.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Seeing some orographic lift today across the Appalchians. Visible 
satellite indicates a field of cu along the mountains. Just starting 
to see some showers show up on radar in association with this cu 
field and have continued with a slight chance of showers along the 
TN/NC line through this evening. Expect any showers will quickly 
weaken near sunset. Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air
analysis indicates a ridge across the Northern Gulf trying to 
build into the area, further to the north, an upper level trough 
is passing through the Ohio River Valley. A mild night is forecast
with higher heights aloft building into the region. Lows tonight 
will generally be in the 50s. 

The upper level ridge axis will be overhead on Friday with the low 
level high moving to the east. Low-level southerly flow will 
increase the moisture levels slightly across the area with PW values 
rising to around an inch. A weak trough will rotate around the 
broader ridge and there could be a few isolated showers and storms 
with the best chance for precipitation across the higher elevations. 
These higher elevations will provide additional orographic lift 
needed for any precipitation to form. Went a little higher with 
temperatures on Friday due to the ridge axis overhead. Expect most 
valley locations will top out just below record values in the low to 
mid 80s.

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Wednesday)...

Warm weather will continue into the weekend ahead of our next 
system. Moisture will increase ahead of an approaching front and we 
could see showers and thunderstorms as early as Saturday. As the 
front gets closer thunderstorm activity will continue with a bit 
better coverage likely on Sunday. Models then predict that the front 
should stall out somewhere over us and should act as the focus for 
continued precipitation and thunderstorms. While the front is 
stalled over us we could see a few strong thunderstorms during the 
early/middle part of the week...But with a system like this it's 
difficult to pin down exactly where the strongest storms will be due 
to the constantly changing position of the boundary. Front will 
linger around for several days before lifting back to the north as a 
warm front. During this entire 7-day forecast temperatures should be 
near or above normal with most people seeing daytime highs top out 
in the 70's with overnight lows expected to drop down into the 60's.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Will remain in a rather quiet
weather pattern with high pressure over the Southern Appalachian
Region through the short term. Expect another warm day with plenty
of sunshine as highs reach into the upper 70s and low 80s across
the TN Valley. With the strong diurnal heating and weak moisture
return in the south...could see a few isolated thunderstorms
develop over extreme southwest NC and possibly into the Smokies
late this afternoon. Otherwise...will see dry conditions across
the area with mild temperatures tonight.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...Models continue to be in 
decent agreement overall with fair run to run continuity, and 
forecast confidence is a bit above normal for this time of year. An 
upper ridge will be over the area Friday and Saturday with the axis 
shifting east by Sunday.  Much of this period will be dry, although 
some limited instability may allow for mainly isolated convection 
across parts of the higher terrain during the afternoons Friday and 
Saturday, and even into valley areas Sunday.  By Monday a cold front 
will be moving in, and this front is forecast to stall just to our 
south before moving back north as a warm front. This will keep the 
Monday through Wednesday period more unsettled, with more numerous 
showers and thunderstorms expected. Temperatures will continue to 
generally run above normal for the period.

A shortwave ridge of high pressure will continue to promote
tranquil conditions across the Southern Appalachian region
overnight. Water vapor imagery continues to show dry air in place
over the region, but IR imagery shows some cirrus to the west 
that may trickle in late tonight. Thus, have a subtle trend of 
increasing clouds after 06z -- though it will remain mostly clear
for the entire night period. Overnight lows will drop into the 
upper 40s to lower 50s just before sunrise Thursday morning. All 
in all, a very quiet night with very few adjustments needed to the
forecast.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate an 
upper level low centered across southern AL/GA with a shortwave 
ridge across the Lower Mississippi River Valley stretching 
northeastward towards the Southern Appalachians. At the surface, a 
cold front is now to the south and east of the area stretching north-
south along the Eastern Seaboard into the Northern Gulf. Drier air 
is advecting into the area behind the front but latest visible 
satellite imagery indicates a few towering cu in Cherokee and Clay 
counties in SW NC. Therefore, have continued with s slight chance of 
PoPs in SW NC throughout the remainder of the afternoon and into the 
evening. 

The surface high will pass to the north tonight with dry conditions 
forecast to continue. Overnight lows will range from the mid 40s to 
mid 50s. An upper level ridge will build northeast from the Northern 
Gulf on Thursday with an upper level trough passing across Great 
lakes into the Mid-Atlantic. It looks as through there will be 
enough moisture return from the departing surface high to mention a 
slight chance for afternoon showers across the higher elevations of 
the Smokies with the rest of the forecast area remaining dry. 
Forecast highs on Friday will top out in the mid 70s to low 80s for 
most valley locations.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...

Models are in fairly good agreement for the extended period. 
Upper ridge remains in place over the area through Saturday, 
resulting in warm, mainly dry days with sunshine. There does 
appear to be enough instability over the area on Friday to spark a
few isolated afternoon thunderstorms, especially along the 
mountains and higher terrain, but the majority of the area should 
remain rain-free. Moisture will begin to surge back into the area 
on Sunday as the ridge shifts east and southwest flow helps pull 
Gulf moisture back into the region. By Sunday afternoon, scattered
showers and thunderstorms are possible. A cold front will 
approach the area late Sunday into Monday, bringing an even better
chance for widespread showers and thunderstorms. This front will 
stall just south of the Tennessee border for Tuesday into 
Wednesday, remaining a focus for showers and thunderstorms as a 
shortwave ripples through and helps maintain instability and 
moisture across the area.

overall much of Thursday through Saturday should be precip free. 
Enough moisture return by Sunday to include isolated to scattered 
convection, and then a a cold front will move in by Monday for a 
better chance of showers and thunderstorms. The front will likely 
stall not far to our south, and some short wave energy should keep 
the chances for convection into Tuesday.

.DISCUSSION...
Band of mostly showery convection has developed over the Northern
Plateau in the past few hours. Much of this activity has been 
training across the same areas of Morgan and Scott County 
producing pcpn rates of near an inch an hour for the past hour or 
so. With flash flood guidance of 1.5-2.0 inches an hour across 
this area combined with a marked decrease in overall convective 
activity in the last few scans due to lack of any further 
heating/instability, do not expect any flash flooding threat at 
this time. 

Expect showers to progress eastward across the area overnight as 
they continue to diminish in intensity and coverage. This is in 
very good agreement with latest few runs of the HiRes models which
indicate front and associated shower activity moving east of the 
area by Wednesday morning.

Updated grids to reflect higher POPs across the NW plateau and SW
Virginia for the early portion of the overnight. Also adjusted
temps/dew points in line with latest observations while increasing
QPF a bit over this same area of NE TN and SW VA for the early
overnight period.

.AVIATION...A cool front is lifting a few showers and an
occasional thunderstorm over Middle Tennessee this evening. Would
expect a couple showers moving through the Great Valley later
tonight as the boundary slips slowly east toward the Appalachian
spine. Don't expect too much difficulty with flight operations due
to the weak nature of the boundary and limited moisture.
Therefore, while adjusting some ceilings down a bit with the
front, did not forecast any mvfr conditions later tonight. Skies
should be clearing Wednesday morning with another fine day for
flight as winds shift from southerly to northerly.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...Clouds are finally started
to increase across the western sections of the forecast area this
afternoon ahead of weak cold front. Winds have increased to
10 to 15 mph this afternoon with gusts to around 25 mph in the
past hour which have added to fire weather concerns as rh values
dropped to 35 to 40 percent. Temperatures were warm again in the
mid 70s to near 80 across the region. As weak front approaches 
scattered showers and a few storms will move across areas mainly 
north of I-40. Expect this activity to develop around 20-21Z and 
become more numerous from about 03-06Z. The activity should be 
mostly out of the area around 12Z as the front shifts slowly east.
Have kept a slight chance showers in the morning northeast and 
also over southwest North Carolina Wednesday. Wednesday skies
become mostly sunny again by afternoon with high temperatures only
a couple degrees cooler.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday Night through Tuesday)...An upper-level 
ridge of high pressure will generally promote pleasant weather 
late this work week, with a mostly sunny to partly sunny sky and 
just isolated chances for afternoon showers and thunderstorms 
(mainly along the terrain) -- thanks to a diffuse boundary 
dropping south Thursday into Friday. Another weak shortwave will 
pass through the region on Saturday, bringing some slightly better
chances for scattered convection (favoring the high terrain). A 
stronger front looks to push into the eastern Tennessee Valley 
Sunday night into Monday, bringing a better shot of organized 
thunderstorms. There is quite a bit of model inconsistency with 
this feature and it is too early to have a high confidence in 
timing, magnitude, etc this far out. This front is progged to 
slowly drop south of the region sometime by the middle of the new 
week. In addition to the isolated to scattered thunderstorm threat
each day, the period will be characterized by warm conditions, 
with highs in the mid 70s to lower 80s.

.DISCUSSION...
A weak cold front was located from near Detroit southwest across
western Kentucky then southwest into eastern Texas late this morning.
Scattered showers and a few thunderstorms were occurring in a
narrow band only just ahead of the front. Temperatures are already
in the upper 60s to the lower 70s at late morning. Clouds will
gradually increase during the afternoon. Best rain chances will be
across northern plateau. Instability will be limited so a few 
thunderstorms possible. Main rain chances will be tonight.
Relative humidity values have dropped to less than 50 percent
across parts of southwest Virginia and should reach 30 to 40
percent this afternoon. Winds will be southwest 5 to 15 mph with
gusts in the higher elevations up to 25 mph at times. A fire 
danger statement was issued earlier through early this evening.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...A weak cold front will push into 
the area late today and tonight. Forcing and moisture unimpressive 
with this system, and instability looks to be quite limited as well. 
Clouds will increase, and will carry slight chance PoPs far western 
areas late today and chance PoPs all areas tonight.  Will keep 
slight chance of thunder in the forecast through into first part of 
the night. Will not stray far from MAV temps.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...A few showers may linger 
over the area Wednesday morning as a cold front continues to pull 
away from the area.  Dry and warm conditions are expected by the 
afternoon.  A diffuse boundary will remain stretched to our south 
and as a result...could see isolated convection Thursday 
afternoon/evening.  A weak short wave will move through Friday and 
Saturday and should allow for isolated to scattered convection over 
the region.  Best chances will be during the late afternoon with the 
aid of diurnal heating.  Model consistency becomes quite poor by the 
end of the extended and confidence quite low.  Current model runs 
differ significantly in regards to an approaching system...so for 
now will keep chance pops in place.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...Another sunny and dry day
across the forecast area as temperatures have climbed to the upper
70s and lower 80s in a few spots. South to southwest winds have
increased to 10 to 15 mph in some locations with gusts to around
25 mph. Relative humidity values have dropped to 20 to 30 percent
with a few spots lower. Lower pressure over Lake Michigan and a
cold front extending southeast into the Southern Plains was slowly
moving east this afternoon. This weak front will move slowly east
toward the eastern Tennessee Valley tonight and Tuesday. Moisture
and instability are limited along the front so not expecting
clouds to significantly increase until Tuesday just ahead of the
front. Weak southerly flow will continue tonight so lows will
mostly in the 50s except the normal cooler spots in northeast
Tennessee and southwest North Carolina. Relative humidity values 
should rise about 10 to 15 percent Tuesday. Highs will be again 
warm...in the upper 70s. 

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday Night through Monday)...A weak cold front 
will shift east into the region Tuesday night, though it will 
likely bring a few isolated to spotty showers as models indicate a
strong weakening trend with this activity. However, clouds and 
perhaps a few sprinkles will linger through the midday hours on 
Wednesday before drier air filters in later in the day. An upper- 
level ridge just to the south of the region will be the 
predominant weather feature for much of the mid to late week 
period, though there will be opportunities for showers and 
thunderstorms each day this week. A weak frontal wave will move 
into the region Thursday night into Friday, triggering off another
round of isolated to scattered convection. Another weak impulse 
rounding the ridge will yield some chances for storms -- with 
perhaps some diurnally aided convection along the Mountains and 
the Plateau. A stronger front looks to push into the eastern 
Tennessee Valley the afternoon and evening of Easter Sunday, 
bringing a better shot of organized thunderstorms, a few of which 
could be severe. Damaging winds and hail will be the main threats 
with this activity -- though it is too early to have a high 
confidence in timing, magnitude, etc this far out. In addition to 
the isolated to scattered thunderstorm threat each day, the period
will be characterized by warm conditions, with highs in the mid 
70s to lower 80s.

.DISCUSSION...
Upper level ridge continues to slip east today with increasing
south to southwest flow. This will begin to increase moisture...but
rh values will still be low enough for fire weather interests to
have some concerns with increased winds. Temperatures are rising a
little faster than expected where winds are increasing so have
raised highs a degree everywhere and updated winds and rh values
as well. Most locations will have minimum rh values around 20 to
25 percent but some locations in southwest Virginia may be less
than 20 percent. Highest winds will be across the southwest
Virginia mountains and the southern Cumberland Plateau. High level
cloudiness will begin to increase this afternoon but this should
not affect high temperatures. Many locations will be near 80
degrees some 5 to 15 degrees above normal.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Upper level ridge over the 
region will continue to drift east as surface high pressure centered 
off to our east continues to extend into our area. Will see varying 
amounts of high clouds moving across the area , but still expect 
quite a bit of sunshine today.  RH values will be higher today than 
yesterday but still rather low, and winds will be a bit more 
significant than yesterday, which will be of concern for fire 
weather interests. However, still will not meet red flag warning 
criteria. Will not stray far from MAV temps.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...The advertised weak system 
still expected to move across the forecast area in the Tuesday 
through Wednesday time frame with low to medium chance probabilities 
for some showers and thunderstorms; mainly Tuesday night into 
Wednesday morning as a cool front moves through the Southern 
Appalachian region. There still should be a break in the action 
following this system. However, the models differ to some extent as 
to how long the break will be. Kept Wednesday night and Thursday dry 
with just a slight through low chance for some additional showers 
Thursday night into Friday with another weak frontal wave. Had to 
keep a slight chance for showers going into the first half of the 
weekend with differences in model timing of another weak short wave 
moving across the Mid South in a more zonal configuration. The 
superblend concept stayed closer to the European suggestion of 
another convective event with medium to high chance pops in 
association with a cold frontal passage to start the new week.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Monday)...
High pressure at the surface will remain nearly stationary off the
NC coast, while a low pressure system tracks NE across the Plains
into the Great Lakes. The mid/upper ridge axis over our area today
will shift to our east tomorrow. Dry weather with a warming trend
will continue through the period. Southerly winds tomorrow will 
be a bit stronger than today, in the 10-15 mph range. With 
minimum RH values in the 20-30% range expected, fire danger will 
likely be enhanced again. Highs will reach the upper 70s to around
80 in the Valley.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
Pattern begins to change Monday night as weak area of low pressure 
moves into the Great Lakes and trailing cold front moves into the 
lower Mississippi Valley and lower Ohio Valley. Southerly flow will 
keep lows mild. Have kept low chances for showers and a few 
storms moving in from the northwest Tuesday but trends are 
slowing system down as Higher pressure tries to hold on across the
Carolinas and the southeast states Tuesday. Best instability 
right along front late afternoon and early evening...mainly 
northern plateau and extreme northern Tennessee and southwest 
Virginia through early evening. Front makes it to near eastern 
border by early Wednesday. Slight chance showers and storms 
Wednesday...lowest west and highest chances east. Clearing skies 
Thursday. Front to move back north Thursday night into Friday so 
this will continue unsettled pattern with continued rain chances. 
Uncertainty for the weekend with front still in the area Saturday 
followed by a brief break Saturday night. A new more significant 
front to approach from the north and west Sunday. However models 
differ from about Thursday on so confidence in the last few days 
of the forecast are low.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Upper level ridge over the 
region will drift east as surface high pressure centered off to our 
east continues to extend into our area. Will see some high clouds at 
times, but still expect a mainly clear sky for the period.  RH 
values will be quite low today and winds will be a bit more 
significant than yesterday, which will be of concern for fire 
weather interests but winds will be well below red flag 
warning criteria. Will not stray far from MAV temps.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...Most Excellent ridging 
continues right into the beginning of the work week with a southerly 
flow providing pleasant warm temperatures and dry weather. The first 
of two relatively weak upper level troughs will build into the 
Eastern U.S. Tuesday into Wednesday bringing a chance for some 
showers and a few thunderstorms mainly Tuesday night and Wednesday 
as a weak surface cool front builds slowly south through the 
Southern Appalachian region. We should enjoy another dry period 
Wednesday night into Thursday behind this system while the second 
weak upper trough drops southeast out of Canada across the 
Northeastern states. Another weak boundary associated with this 
trough will make its way slowly south through the forecast area 
bringing a slight chance for showers and thunderstorms Thursday 
night into Friday. Forecast confidence drops off quite a bit by the 
end of the long term with model solutions hinting at another weak 
upper trough and surface front approaching the area on Saturday. 
Kept most of the forecast area dry with just a slight chance for 
convection across the Cumberland Plateau east into Southwest 
Virginia and Northeast Tennessee in this scenario. The long term 
looks good in terms of temperatures with near to above normal maxes 
and mins expected.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...
High pressure over the region today will shift east of the
Appalachians tonight, and off the Carolina coast tomorrow. We will
have another night of chilly temperatures in the 30s, but with the
very dry air mass, widespread frost is not expected. Will mention
some patchy frost north and east but it should be isolated enough
to not need an advisory. With the dry air mass, full sun, and the
low level flow turning to southerly, highs will reach the mid and
upper 70s again in the TN Valley tomorrow.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)...
Warm and dry for next 48 hours from Sunday night through Tuesday
as high pressure ridge gradually shifts east. South to southwest
winds at the surface will warm temperatures to the mid 70s to near
80 Monday...slightly cooler Tuesday with increasing cloudiness. 
Low pressure over Iowa Sunday night along weak front moves
northeast into the Great Lakes by Tuesday morning with front
moving into the western Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys.
Instability is weak but enough for scattered showers and storms 
late Tuesday and Tuesday night. Frontal system slows down
Wednesday with lingering shower and storm chances. Improving 
conditions Wednesday night and Thursday western sections. Another
quick moving system to interact with lingering moisture in 
eastern mountains so hanging on to slight chance showers there 
Thursday. After second front Thursday night clearing skies as high
pressure moves into eastern states and provides a fair Good 
Friday and Saturday before Easter. Temperatures still 5 TO 10 
degrees above normal during the day through the end of the 
extended.

No changes are needed to the forecast this morning. A upper level jet
streak and shortwave trough are bringing some cirrus to mainly the
northern half of the area this morning, but this should be
decreasing through the afternoon as the jet/trough move to the
southeast. High pressure at the surface will provide light to calm
winds today, which is good news for fire weather interests since
minimum RH values will only be in the 20s this afternoon. Forecast
highs between 65 and 70 for the TN Valley appear to be on track.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Surface high pressure will be 
over the region and an upper level ridge will be building in during 
the period.  Will see some high clouds especially early today, but 
still expect quite a bit of sunshine today and tonight will be 
mainly clear. Relative humidity values will be quite low today, 
although winds will be light which should help to lessen fire 
weather concerns.  Temperatures tonight will dip into the 30s in 
some areas, so will include a mention of frost mainly northeast and 
SW NC, but given uncertainties about any need for frost advisories 
or freeze warnings tonight and to avoid any confusion with current 
freeze/frost products, will defer any possible issuance for 
tonight to the day shift.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...The warming trend will continue 
right into the middle of the week as an upper level ridge builds 
slowly from the Midwest and Lower Mississippi Valley to the Eastern 
Seaboard. Perhaps the warmest day of the week will be on Tuesday as 
high temperatures will top out in the upper 70s to around 80 degrees 
across much of the forecast area. The dry period may be interrupted 
by a few showers and a couple thunderstorms mainly Tuesday night 
into Wednesday as a weak cool front builds south through the 
Southern Appalachian region. It still looks like another front will 
follow behind the initial boundary bringing just a slight chance of 
a shower Thursday night into Friday with slightly cooler air 
building in for the first half of the weekend.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...
An unseasonably cold air mass will continue to build in through the 
evening, and winds will drop off to near calm by midnight. With calm 
winds, clear skies, and afternoon dewpoints in the upper 20s to 
lower 30s, low temps tonight should drop into the lower to mid 30s 
across much of the TN Valley, with 20s in the mountains. The current 
Freeze Watch area will be changed to a Freeze Warning, with a Frost 
Advisory for the rest of the area where lows in the 33-36 range will 
be more common. High pressure will be centered over AL tomorrow, 
while a 300 mb jet streak and vort max will move over the area. This 
may bring some cirrus through the day but it should not have a 
significant impact on temperatures, which should warm into the mid 
to upper 60s. Low RH values in the teens and 20s may be a concern
for fire weather interests, but winds will be light.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...
A warming trend for this part of the forecast as upper level ridge 
builds across the southeast into the early part of the next week. 
Another cool to cold morning Sunday with frost again across the 
eastern Tennessee high mountains and colder valleys of southwest 
North Carolina...northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia. High 
temperatures back into the 70s from Sunday through Tuesday with 
mostly clear skies. Another chance for rain showers and storms 
late Tuesday with more cloud cover into Wednesday ahead of a weak 
upper trough and front. The front moves slow enough that lingering
moisture and instability Wednesday will allow more showers and a 
chance of thunderstorms across the eastern parts of the region. 
Dry conditions again Wednesday night through Thursday night but 
weak front Friday moving in and lingering with a chance for more 
spring showers and storms. Mild temperatures continue Tuesday 
through Friday.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)... Deep upper trough will slowly 
progress eastward today. In the wake cold air advection will 
persist bringing much cooler temperatures to the region. Strong 
northwest flow will produce widely scattered to scattered showers 
and in the higher elevations - snow showers through the remainder 
of the morning. Expect the snow showers to lighten considerably 
shortly after sunrise. Look for the winter weather advisory to end
at 8am as scheduled. Rain chances will be highest over NE TN and 
SW VA. Breezy and occasional gusty winds will persist through much
of the day, however, the wind advisory for the higher elevations 
issued yesterday has ended.

Tonight the winds will subside by sunset. The big story will be
the temperatures dropping into the 30s across the region.
Widespread frost will be likely for many areas and freezing 
conditions will occur in the highlighted areas covered in the
freeze watch. The freeze watch will be upgraded to a freeze 
warning later today. If you need extra time to protect your
plants, please use this extra information to get a head start.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...The forecast area will 
come under the influence of a most pleasant ridge pattern into the
early part of the new week with a warming trend taking max 
temperatures back into the 70s. The weekend will be dry in this 
regime with another chance for rain developing Tuesday into 
Wednesday in the form of showers and a few thunderstorms 
developing ahead of a weak upper trough and surface front. The 
forecast area should be able to dry out again for Thursday. 
Forecast confidence drops to some degree at the end of the long 
term, but there could be another weak wave building into the 
region by Friday with another chance for a few showers and 
thunderstorms.

.DISCUSSION...

Highest PoPs this evening into the overnight period will be across
the East Tennessee mountains and in SW VA. Latest radar imagery
indicates the coverage of showers is becoming more scattered as 
the upper level low exits to the northeast. Based on reports the 
rain/snow line appears to be around 3500 ft with snow amounts of 
up to 3 inches being reported on Mt LeConte earlier this 
afternoon. Storm total snow there could approach 6 inches. The 
winter weather advisory will continue for these higher elevations 
through 12z Friday. Strong cold air advection will move in tonight
behind the departing system with 850 mb temperatures dropping 
into the -8 to -4 C range. Overnight lows will be in the 30s for 
most valley locations. Elevated winds overnight will prevent any 
frost formation.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)... 
The large closed low to our north will continue to slowly make 
its way east across the Mid Atlantic region tonight and off the 
coast on Friday. Cold temperatures aloft and deep moisture under 
the low will keep scattered to numerous showers going across our 
area this evening, with the mountains seeing additional snow 
accumulation aided by a 30 kt NW upslope flow, mainly above 3000 
ft. So far we have had reports of around an inch in the higher 
elevations, and with another inch or two possible overnight, the 
Winter Weather Advisory will continue. Valley wind gusts are 
expected to diminsh with sunset, so the expiration time for the 
Wind Advisory at 03Z looks good, with the mountains maintaining 
the Advisory until 08Z. Cloud cover and winds overnight should
keep most spots above freezing tonight, except for the areas that
are under the Winter Weather Advisory.

The gradual departure of the upper low will result in decreasing 
precip chances and clearing skies through the day tomorrow from the 
SW to NE. Temperatures will be well below normal, with highs in the 
upper 40s north to upper 50s south.

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Thursday)... 
Friday night cold upper low moves away from the region and out into 
the Mid-Atlantic. Skies will become clear and winds will gradually 
decrease. Cold air advection will continue for the evening and 
temperatures will fall to near or below freezing after midnight. As 
the winds die down enough later Friday night...frost will form so 
have set up a freeze watch for the northern plateau...northeast 
Tennessee...southwest Virginia and the eastern Tennessee 
mountains...including southwest North Carolina. Outside of the 
freezing areas lows will be just above freezing with widespread 
frost. Higher pressure over the Mississippi Valley Friday night will 
build east and bring much warmer temperatures to the area Saturday 
with highs in the 60s. Saturday night another cool to cold night 
with frost again in the northeast and mountains. Sunday much warmer 
with south to southwest winds returning and highs in the 70s. Monday 
the surface high shifts to the east coast with moisture increasing. 
The next cold front approaches from the west Tuesday and will pass 
through Tuesday night with a chance of showers and thunderstorms. 
Mild temperatures Tuesday then slight cooling Wednesday and Thursday 
behind the front.

Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED
National Weather Service Morristown TN
1045 AM EDT Thu Apr 6 2017

.DISCUSSION...
The forecast is generally on track so far today. Latest radar
trends and short term model guidance suggest scattered showers
south to numerous showers north through the day. Winds have been
gusting close to 40 mph in several spots so far, and this should
continue through the afternoon, so the Wind Advisory will remain
unchanged. The 12Z OHX sounding shows a freezing level around 2400
ft, which is about the level where the forecast has accumulating
snowfall. However, the latest model snow accumulations look 
overdone, with too much accumulation during the day and in lower
elevations where temperatures are currently in the 40s. The only
change needed to the forecast will be to hourly temperatures, 
which are running 3-7 degrees cooler than forecast.

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
322 AM EDT Thu Apr 6 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Main frontal boundary is off to our east but we will still see
some colder showers behind this system. The colder showers in the
valley will be spotty and last through much of the day today. In
the higher elevations temperatures will be cold enough to where
rain showers will likely switch over to snow showers.
Accumulations should be pretty minor in most populated locations,
but the peaks of the mountains will potentially get enough to
warrant a winter weather advisory. In addition to this a low level
jet will pick up today behind the system and cause gusty winds
today across the area. The higher elevations will likely get the
strongest winds so a wind advisory is in effect for the mountains
as well.

.LONG TERM (Tomorrow through Wednesday)...
The upper-low that will bring a much colder air mass into the 
region, will gradually shift away from the Tennessee Valley on 
Friday toward the Mid-Atlantic region. However, a strong pressure 
gradient will help keep winds on the breezy side for most of the day 
(through likely below Advisory-level). Additionally, the strong NW 
flow will help reinforce a cold air mass. Some light snow showers 
will continue along the mountains through the day -- through there 
will be little accumulation. The real story will be the drier air 
moving in later in the evening, which will help create a clear sky 
Friday night. Due to the clear, dry, and calm conditions, a 
freeze/frost is likely over most of the region by Saturday morning. 
After a chilly (but slightly warmer day on Saturday), a significant 
warming trend will begin on Sunday as winds veer to the south and 
high pressure builds in. Highs will return to the mid to upper 70s 
through early next week. Another front and shot at precipitation 
will move in by Tuesday/Wednesday, with the potential for a few 
strong thunderstorms as well.

Given shear and instability later today along with synoptic forcing, 
threat for severe storms will increase. Shear and instability is 
sufficient for tornadoes across the CHA area through 01Z.

Besides the tornado threat, strong winds aloft, lowering freezing 
level, and increasing HAIL CAPES may produce some damaging winds and 
large hail up to Golfball size at CHA/TYS this evening.

352 PM EDT Wed Apr 5 2017

.SHORT TERM (This Evening through Friday)...Deep upper trough will
move into the Ohio Valley overnight and Thursday. Jet streaks move
around the upper low will continue to enhance the divergence aloft
over the Tennessee Valley through this evening. The upper trough
is inducing broad pressure falls over the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys.
The pressure falls is increasing the low-level jet over the area
deepening/strengthening the shear over the region, and pulling
moisture and better instability north. 

Significant tornado parameter has increased to near 2 over the
Plateau and southeast Tennessee. HAIL CAPES near 700 j/kg and
lower freezing levels is producing an environment for large hail
up to Golfball. Downdraft CAPES, mid-level dry air and high DCP
suggest an environment for damaging winds. End result, besides the
potential of tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds are a big
concern through this evening.

The convection will end from west (CHA around 01Z, TYS around 03Z,
and TRI around 06Z), and then wrap-around moisture and instability
will pull showers back into the area toward daybreak Thursday. A
good deal of low-level instabilty, moisture, and cyclonic flow
around upper trough will produce widespread showers. The
temperature profile will be cold enough for a transition to snow
across the highest elevations (around 4kt), then lower during the
day (around 2500 feet) by Thursday evening. Scattered snow showers
will continue across the orographic areas for Thursday night and
Friday morning. 

Besides the rain/snow showers, strong cold air advection will
produce windy conditions Thursday. Later shifts may need to issue
a wind advisory for tomorrow.

Due to concerns with hikers and vacationers across the Smoky
Mountains, residents of High Knob will issue a winter weather
advisory there beginning daybreak Thursday through day break
Friday.

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Wednesday)...
Much quieter weather expected through this period of the 
forecast. To start the period we could still be dealing with a few
lingering flurries across the highest peaks with NW still still 
in place. Not expecting any accumulation as this will be the tail 
end of the snow. Continued NW flow will also allow for gusty winds
to remain across the higher elevations into Friday night. 
However, the trough pushes east overnight into Saturday morning 
thus ending NW flow and high pressure begins to build in from the 
west. The biggest concern will be the cold temps that will occur 
across the area overnight. Lows will be in the mid 30s across much
of the Central and Southern Valley. NETN and SWVA will see lows 
right around freezing to a degree or two below freezing. It 
doesn't look like a hard freeze at this point but sensitive plants
may need to be brought inside.

High pressure quickly builds into the region for the weekend which 
will bring a welcomed warning trend. Highs on Saturday will be in 
the low to mid 60s and back into the low to mid 70s by Sunday. It 
does look like some upper level moisture rounds the ridge and 
streams down into our area for both Saturday and Sunday so high 
clouds look to be in place. Lows on Saturday night will be in the 
upper 30s to lower 40s and mid and upper 40s for Sunday night. 
Temperatures look even warmer Monday as an area of high pressure 
develops to our southeast. This returns us to southerly flow and 
bumps temps up into the mid to upper 70s. On Tuesday/Tuesday night 
we have a cold front approaching from the west that will provide us 
our next chance of showers and a possibly a few storms. The low is 
up across the Great Lakes with the front stretching all the down to 
the Gulf Coast States. Wednesday looks cooler behind the front with 
highs back down into the upper 60s.

National Weather Service Morristown TN
1116 AM EDT Wed Apr 5 2017

.DISCUSSION...A very active day is in store with a strong upper
level trough of low pressure moving from Missouri/Arkansas toward
the lower Ohio Valley. Satellite shows a double jet structure
across the Tennessee/Mississippi Valleys which will enhance the
lift over the Region Today into the this evening. The strong jet
forcing will enhance the fronto-genetic forcing across middle
Tennessee Alabama by mid/late afternoon. 

Ahead of this activity, a warm frontal boundary is moving slowly
north across northeast Alabama/northern Georgia. Models are doing
a poor job in analysing this activity thus confidence with this
convection is low. However, as pressure falls increase ahead of
the strong upper trough over the Tennessee Valley this boundary
will likely move slowly northward. This boundary may enhance the
tornado threat across southeast Tennessee/southwest North Carolina
later Today.

Giving increasing shear and instability later today along with
synoptic forcing, threat for severe storms will increase. Strong
potential long-track tornadoes are possible, especially over the
southern Plateau and southeast Tennessee given the warm frontal
boundary.

Besides the tornado threat, strong winds aloft, lowering freezing
level, and increasing HAIL CAPES will likely produce some damaging
winds and large hail up to Golfball size.

.AVIATION...
Storms to our south look like they have a better chance of making
it towards the KCHA/KTYS terminals this morning. These storms
could bring strong winds and hail. The main story is still the
storms in the afternoon along and ahead of the front moving in
from the west. High resolution models have handled precipitation
thus far extremely poorly so forecast confidence on the timing of
the storms this evening is very low. Have best forecast in the
TAFs but this may very well be altered with later forecast
issuances.

342 AM EDT Wed Apr 5 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Weather story of the day will be the 2 rounds of storms that will
move through our area.

First round will be storms moving up from the south and possibly
into our area. The strongest of this thunderstorm activity should
remain to our south, but the far southeast Tennessee/southwest
North Carolina could see strong storms as well. Current high 
resolution models depict that thunderstorm activity will likely 
stay to our east with these daytime storms, but some storm 
activity could break a bit west and head west of the Southern 
Appalachian mountains. Also of concern with this early convection 
will be the potential for storms to lay our a convective front 
that advances northward as the day progresses. If this happens, 
wherever that boundary sets up could act as a focus for increased 
storm and severe threat later in the day.

But the bigger threat will come later in the day as the front
approaches from the west in the evening hours. Before going into
details it must be noted that models have been handling this event
very poorly with little run-to-run consistency and constant
disagreement within the various models, so forecast confidence on
the exact details of this event are very low. Best environment for
severe thunderstorm potential will be in our western counties
along the Cumberland Plateau down towards Chattanooga, and as you
head further east the environment becomes less favorable. In our
western counties good instability of around 1000-2000 J/kg will be
present as the storms move in. This will combine with good shear
in the mid and low levels to provide fuel to see strong and severe
storms. Right now the biggest difference between the models is
with how much instabilty and CINH is present. The GFS is more
bullish on the CAPE values while leaving us essentially uncapped,
which would lead to much stronger and more widespread storms.
While the NAM is weaker and keeps us capped, and delays storms
developing ahead of the main front. In addition to all these
concerns, it seems that storms south of us are firing earlier 
than anticipated and the line of storms currently across Arkansas 
is staying together longer than models predicted. This again leads
to decreased confidence as we move forward today. 

All that being said the biggest threats we are expecting today is
hail up to the size of baseballs, strong winds, and tornadoes
cannot be ruled out. The highest chances to see these will be in
our western counties and around the Chattanooga area. Once the
front moves through overnight thunderstorms will end and we will
switch over to rain showers.

.LONG TERM (Tomorrow through Tuesday)...
A big change will be ushered in by early Thursday morning in wake
of the cold frontal passage as much colder air will move into the
Southern Appalachians. Sounding/profiles indicate the 
melting/freezing level will drop quickly over the course of the 
morning, to 4000 ft
-- and later that afternoon to 2500 ft. This will change any 
light rain showers over to snow along these high terrain areas. 
There will be some enhanced synoptic lift as the low passes 
through the region Thursday afternoon, night and into Friday 
morning, along with an orographic lift component as well. Thus, 
over the 36 to 48 hour period -- between 3 to 6 inches is possible
above 4000 in the Great Smoky Mountains and 1 to 3 inches over 
2500 across the mountains of East Tennessee and Southwest 
Virginia. 

These snows could cause some hazard travel conditions across the 
mountains for tourists as well as dangerous conditions for hikers in 
the mountains. A Winter Weather Advisory will be needed to address 
this by next period. Will hold off since the onset and peak are 
still around 30 hours out. In addition to the snow, we will have 
monitor for the potential for a wind advisory along the East 
Tennessee Mountains Thursday and especially Thursday Night as 
sustained winds in the 20 to 30 mph range, with gusts to 50 mph will 
be possible along the high terrain.  

The upper-low will also bring cold air into the region, resulting in 
a frost late Thursday night and a freeze for parts of the area on 
Friday night. Then, this storm system will pull away from the area 
on Saturday, resulting in a warming trend as winds veer to the south 
and high pressure builds in. Highs will return to the mid to upper 
70s by Sunday and Monday. Another front and shot at precipitation 
will move in by Tuesday/Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...The second half of the 
short term could be active with strong to severe convection 
developing in association with a deepening Midwest low pressure 
system. As usual, there is a little uncertainty in terms of the 
strength of the convection due to stabilizing effects with the 
passage of a morning system ripping northeast out of the Gulf 
States. If this morning system affects the forecast area with just
a glancing blow and rides a little farther south of the region, 
there could be more instability available for the afternoon when 
the powerful system cold front builds into the Southern 
Appalachian region. Instability is acceptable with this storm 
system, but shear appears to be rather strong with 40-50 kts in 
the 0-6km layer. Damaging straight line winds and hail would be 
the most likely mode of severe weather on Wednesday, but there 
could also be an isolated tornado due to adequate helicity values.
The strong southerly flow should enable max temps to rise well 
into the 70s prior to the main convective episode building in 
during the afternoon and evening. 

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...Some big changes 
in the forecast regarding snow for Thursday into Thursday night 
but we have to start with the severe weather first.

To start the period we will still likely be dealing with some form 
of severe weather across the area. The event should be winding down 
but the threat for a few strong to severe storms will persist until 
around 10pm/midnight. The main threats during this time will still 
be large hail and damaging winds but an isolated tornado can't be 
ruled out due to plenty of shear along with some remaining 
instability in place. Winds will still be gusty in the evening prior 
to the frontal passage due to a stout 850 mb jet. The actual cold 
front sweeps through around midnight and will begin to usher in much 
colder air into the region. Lows on Wednesday night will fall into 
mid 40s. After the frontal passage we have a break in precip before 
wrap around moisture enters into the area on the back side of the 
low that is located across the Ohio River Valley. 

The latest model data shows good snow potential on Thursday into 
Thursday night across the higher elevations. Both the NAM and GFS 
show moisture extending up to -15 deg C with the freezing level 
starting out around 5500 feet at 09Z Thursday. Freezing level drops 
through the day and the sounding profiles remain moist. Stout NW 
flow will also enhance snow across the higher elevations due to 
orographic lift. By 18z Thursday the snow/rain line should be down 
around 3500 feet and by 00z down around 3K feet. During the day we 
do see CAPE values high enough to suggest possible snow banding in 
the high terrain. Any area that gets under one of these bands could 
pick up quick accumulations; which could lead to isolated higher 
totals. The better moisture will begin to gradually taper off after 
00z but the upslope snow machine should still be pretty healthy as 
strong NW flow continues into the night. Expecting snow showers 
across the higher elevations to last well into the night on Thursday 
with some isolated areas of snow showers still across the higher 
peaks into Friday morning/early afternoon. Lows overnight will be in 
the lower to upper 30s. Some valley locations across Northeast TN 
and SWVA could see a few hours of light snow early Friday morning 
but will quickly switch back over to rain shortly after sunrise. Not 
expecting any accumulation or travel issues across lower elevations. 
All precip finally pulls out later Friday afternoon. Highs on Friday 
will be quite chilly with upper 40s near 50 north to mid to upper 
50s south.

Current thinking is that areas above 4000 feet will see between 3 to 
6 inches of snowfall from early Thursday morning through Friday 
morning. Areas between 3000 to 4000 feet will see 2 to 4 inches and 
2500 feet to 3000 feet 1 to 3 inches. Due to the snowfall still 
being several periods out will send out an SPS to highlight for now. 

Friday night we will see the coldest temps of the period with lows 
in the upper 20s to lower 30s north, low to mid 30s Central Valley, 
and mid 30s Southern Valley. The good news is that ridging quickly 
builds back in on Saturday and we see a nice rebound in temps. Highs 
will be in the upper 50s to mid 60s. Saturday night is milder with 
most locations above freezing. The warming trend continues for 
Sunday and Monday with highs back into the 70s. Our next system 
approaches on Tuesday with another shot at showers and a few storms.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
A few areas of showers continue to move across the region early
this morning as a weak shortwave passes through the Southern
Appalachian region. Some BKN/OVC decks of mid-level clouds will
linger into the mid-morning hours, but they should quickly
dissipate by midday as drier air quickly moves into the area from
the southwest. This will result in a sunny to mostly sunny day
over the afternoon and evening hours -- and combined with breezy
SW flow, push highs into the mid to upper 70s. Cloud coiver will
gradually increase overnight as a warm front pushes toward the 
region from the southwest. In general, think that a mostly clear
sky is likely across all but the far southern areas for most of
the night. Latest model guidance wants to keep any precipitation
out of the area until after 12z, so have adjusted the forecast
accordingly. Temperatures will stay mild, despite the clear sky
due to breezy SW and increased boundary layer moiature. 

.LONG TERM /Wednesday through Monday/...
Biggest weather story for this forecast will be the severe weather 
expected to roll through the region on Wednesday, and the colder air 
behind this system that could bring some very light snow to the 
higher elevations.

Main system driving the potential severe weather will be a low 
moving out of the plains and towards the Great Lakes region. Ahead 
of this low a warm front should be somewhere in our vicinity and 
locations south of this will have the best chances to see strong to 
severe storms on Wednesday. Models are depicting convection starting 
south of us early on Wednesday and moving northeastward as the day 
progresses. This daytime convection will likely cause the strongest 
storms of the day across the southeast United States. Models are 
showing that most of this stuff stays to our south, but we can't 
rule out the possibilty that some storms move into far southeast 
Tennessee/southwest North Carolina. During this time there should be 
good CAPE to work with (around 1000-2000 J/kg in the southern 
counties of TN/NC) and good shear as well (20-30kts SFC-1km/60kts 
SFC-6km). High resolution models show that the strongest activity 
should stay to our south, but it will be worth keeping an eye on 
this early convection. Even if we don't get strong to severe storms 
with this first round, any storms could help stabilize our 
atmosphere in preparation for the front and more storms expected to 
move through later Wednesday night. 

If the storms don't stabilize the atmosphere we will remain primed to 
see strong to severe storms along and ahead of the front as it moves 
through. Current models show that the storms along the front will 
likely move into the Cumberland Plateau/Chattanooga in the late 
afternoon and move east of the forecast area a little after 
midnight. The main threats associated with the storms will be strong 
straight-line winds and large hail, but an isolated tornado cannot 
be ruled out. Once the front has moved through our area overnight 
the severe threat will come to and end.

As the low moves northeast of us the 850mb jet on the backside will 
get cranking out of the north/west and could cause strong winds in 
the higher elevations along the Southern Appalachian Mountains on 
Thursday into Friday. This time frame will need to be monitored and 
as it gets closer a wind advisory might be warranted. 

The final weather possible with this front will be some potential 
light snow in the higher elevations Thursday/Friday night. Wrap 
around moisture will cause cloudy weather and some additional 
showers through the end of the work week. Since the front will cause 
us to drop about 20 degrees colder after it moves through the 
overnight lows in the higher elevations will get low enough that a 
brief switch-over to snow is possible Thursday night and Friday 
night. Any snow during this time would be brief before switching 
back over to rain and accumulations would be minimal (if any). 

Whew...

Much quieter weather and a warming trend will then set up for the 
weekend and into next week. Drier air from the northwest will lead 
to generally sunny skies and mid level ridging building in will help 
get temperatures back into the 70's by Sunday. Our next chance for 
precipitation will come mid-week as a front/shortwave combination 
moves through the area.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...The pressure center of rather
dynamic Spring storm system moves northeast into the Eastern 
Great Lakes by the end of the period. Some drier air is building 
east behind the initial short wave that is generating the moderate
to heavy showers currently nearing the eastern edge of the 
forecast area this afternoon. The downward motion and drying 
should allow for a few hours of quiet weather before the main 
upper level trough and surface cool front swing across the 
forecast area overnight. There could be a few more showers with 
these features overnight. While there could be a thunderstorm, 
instability will be in short supply so don't expect anything more 
than widely scattered coverage in terms of convection. Tuesday 
should be a most pleasant day with a return to sunshine and a warm
southwesterly flow. The insolation and warm advection should lead
to high temperatures in the mid and upper 70s. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Monday)...Main focus through 
the long term period will be the potential for strong to severe 
storms on Wednesday, followed by much colder air for Thursday and 
Friday with light snow across the higher elevations.

The period starts off quiet as we are in between systems. Lows 
Tuesday night will be around 10 degrees above normal due to good 
southerly flow and cloud cover. On Wednesday we have another deep 
trough that moves in from the west with a low that tracks through 
the Ohio River Valley. Currently, SPC has the whole area under a 
slight risk in their day 3 outlook. There is still quite a bit of 
uncertainty due to model differences. The latest NAM suggests 
early morning activity moves into the area and stabilizes the 
atmosphere. The NAM does show destabilization later in the 
afternoon and early evening but the destabilized layer is elevated 
while the surface is stable. The NAM then shows a line of convection 
to our west which moves in during the evening hours. This scenario 
would be more of a hail and wind threat due to the stable surface 
layer. The GFS is quite a bit different, it keeps the morning 
activity to our south and allows the area to become more unstable as 
well as surface based storms. This scenario would allow for 
afternoon showers and storms to develop with the threats being hail, 
wind, along with an isolated tornado due to good shear and surface 
based sounding profiles. Will have to continue to monitor the 
potential for storms on Wednesday as newer model runs come in. 
Besides the storms, the 850 mb jet is quite strong on Wednesday and 
breezy and gusty winds can be expected through the day. A wind 
advisory may be needed across the higher elevations as we get closer 
to the event.

Sharp cold front moves through overnight with lows dipping down into 
the mid and upper 40s. Much colder air moves in for Thursday with 
wrap around moisture swinging into the area. Highs on Thursday will 
only be in the lower 50s north and upper 50s south with rain showers 
across much of the CWA. Precip continues overnight and will 
changeover to snow across the higher elevations. There could be a 
brief window where light snow showers occur early Friday morning 
across the Northern Plateau, Northeast TN, and Southwest Virginia 
but quickly changes back to rain shortly after sunrise. Friday will 
be the coldest day of the period with highs around 10 to 15 degrees 
below normal. Light rain showers continue across the northern areas 
through the day before eventually tapering off Friday night. Friday 
night will be the coldest of the period with lows in the low to mid 
30s across the lower elevations.

Conditions rapidly improve through the rest of the period as high 
pressure begins to build back in on Saturday with highs back in the 
low to mid 60s. The warming trend continues Sunday and Monday with 
highs in the 70s.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
Slow moving cold front tracking from the Mid-South into the
Tennessee Valley and Southern Appalachian region later today.
Along/ahead of this front, a broad area of moderate to locally
heavy rain showers and isolated thunderstorms is slowly making 
it's way NNE across Middle Tennessee and Northern Alabama. By 12z,
this activity should begin to make it into the Southern 
Cumberland Plateau. This activity will move across the region from
the mid-morning hours through mid afternoon (13-20z).

The latest runs of the HRRR indicated the possibility of some 
semi-organized line segments with some of the thunderstorms that 
will develop and track along and south of I-40. Some localized 
damaging wind gusts are possible thanks to the strong 
directional/speed shear in place, but instability will be quite 
limited this morning. Still, enough may exist in the afternoon, to
get some localized severe storms, especially along the Mountains 
and in far southwest North Carolina. Additionally, strong gradient
winds along the Mountains are expected to develop early this 
morning through the late afternoon, which has prompted a Wind 
Advisory. 

In addition to the winds, the slow-moving nature of these storms
and PWAT values around 1.5-1.6 inches will allow for the potential
for locally heavy rainfall and some flooding along the mountains
and SW North Carolina.  

As mentioned, this activity will taper off west of I-75 by midday
and early afternoon, and along the mountains by 19-20z.
Thereafter, another round of scattered showers and storms is
possible early this evening and into the overnight hours as the
base of the trough -- and the true cold front moves into the
region. A strong storm will be possible, but do think the severe
threat will be very low after sunset. Have kept slight chance to
chance PoPs for the overnight period to account for this
possibilty. The clouds and moisture will allow temperatures to
stay mild -- in the 50s to lower 60s in most spots by Tuesday
morning. 

.LONG TERM /Tuesday through Sunday/...
Some lingering light showers will be possible across far 
northeastern Tennessee and southwest Virginia to start the 
extended period as Monday's system slowly exits the area. 
Conditions should be dry for Tuesday afternoon and night, but the 
next major system will be quickly strengthening and approaching 
the forecast area.

This system will rapidly build through the Mississippi Valley on 
Wednesday before the center of the low slides northeast into the 
Great Lakes region by Wednesday evening. For us, a surface warm 
front will push from south to north across the forecast area on 
Wednesday. This will put our area in a broad warm sector, and 
southerly flow will be advecting warm, moist, unstable air into the 
area by early Wednesday afternoon. Combined with strong deep/low 
layer shear and decent forcing, this will provide a favorable 
environment for storms to develop during the afternoon and evening 
hours. For those of you who like numbers, forecast soundings from 
both the GFS and NAM indicate MLCAPE values well over 1000J/kg, SFC-
1km shear values of 20+kts, and SFC-6km shear values of 60+kts 
across the southern Tennessee Valley. Of course, there are still 
some uncertainties with this event that could limit or enhance the 
severe weather threat. First, there are still some model differences 
with regards to exact low track and timing. This would affect when 
and for how long our area is in the warm sector. Second, there are 
still questions whether moist unstable air will be able to return to 
the area quickly enough in the wake of today's system. Third, it is 
again possible that ongoing convection closer to the Gulf Coast may 
cut off some of the northward flow of warm, moist air. For now, SPC 
has outlooked our area for a slight risk of severe storms, 
specifically mentioning the uncertainty and the potential for 
discreet supercells to form late Wednesday afternoon into Wednesday 
evening. Storm potential should quickly end Wednesday night as a 
strong cold front pushes through.

Strong north-northwest flow will set up behind the frontal passage, 
ushering much colder air into the region. Temperatures will be much 
colder than earlier in the week, with highs in the low to mid 50s on 
Thursday and mid 40s to lower 50s on Friday. Lows will drop into the 
30s Friday and Saturday morning, with temperatures in the 20s across 
the higher terrain. The deep trough will remain overhead for 
Thursday into Friday with several shortwaves rotating through, 
providing reinforcing shots of cooler air and moisture. This will 
result in cold rain showers on Thursday and the potential for high 
elevation snow showers Friday and Saturday morning.

Ridging will build in for the weekend, drying out the area and 
bringing a return to more seasonable temperatures and sunny skies.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Monday)... 
Rather benign night in store for East TN, SW VA, and SW NC with 
overnight lows expected to be about 10 degree above normal. 
Increasing cloud cover is expected by morning in advance of the 
next frontal system.

Tomorrow brings a fairly solid rain chance area wide with main
weather event being the possibility of some strong to severe 
convection mainly across the area south of I-40 mainly during the 
afternoon. Although bulk of instability is elevated with SBCAPEs 
during the day really struggling to reach 1000 j/kg, northward 
progression of a warm frontal boundary may serve as a focusing 
mechanism for any potential severe weather. Strong shear, on the 
order of 30-40 kts in the SFC-1KM layer and 50-60 kts in the SFC-
3km layer, coupled with effective SRH values in the 500-700 m2/s2 
range, are certainly sufficient to support organized strong to 
severe convection during the afternoon and evening hours. Main 
threat looks to be winds across most of the area with a small 
chance for an isolated tornado possible across the southern border
counties of TN and both SW NC counties. 

One thing that will bear close watching with this potential event
will be where and when convection develops south of our area early
Monday. GFS, ECMWF, and SREF all indicate convection to our south
and even southeast by Monday afternoon. Given this scenario, best
low level inflow of moisture, heat and hence instability would be
cut-off from much of our area. NAM soln however is a little 
slower with the eastward propagation of convection overnight 
tonight and therefore allows for greater low-level instability to 
develop by afternoon further supporting strong to severe activity 
in our area. 

A wind advisory will be issued for the mountain zones of East
Tennessee from late tonight into Tuesday afternoon as a rather
broad 50-60 KT 850 mb jet pushes NE across the area through the
early afternoon. Although sustained winds should likely remain
below advisory criteria, do expect gusts to reach advisory levels
over the higher elevations of the advisory area during that time. 

.LONG TERM (Monday Night through Sunday)...
Early week system will be exiting very slowly across the Eastern 
Great Lakes and Northeastern states. A significant amount of moist
air will be building across the region with some upslope westerly
flow generating widespread showers well through Monday night and 
possibly into the early part of Tuesday. We should be able to 
enjoy about 18-24 hours of dry weather but the next major system 
will building quickly through the Mississippi Valley on its way 
toward the Eastern Great Lakes 12z Wednesday into 12z Thursday and
this period looks rather active again with a decent possibility 
of more convection. There is still some uncertainty about the 
intensity and scope of thunderstorm development with both the 
European and GFS indicating the best inflow of moist and unstable 
air may be cut off by rather intense convection developing further
south across Dixie. The upper trough associated with this mid 
week system is progged to continue deepening well into Friday with
several short wave features rotating around a closed low 
circulation generating Thursday into Friday night with sufficient 
cold air building in with a strong northerly flow for the 
production of snow showers in the higher terrain. A drying 
northwesterly flow and ridging should allow for a dry weekend with
a most welcome warming trend.

the day. Greatest threat would be mainly south of I-40 across the 
southern third of the area. Entire area remains in a marginal risk
for severe weather with SW NC counties in a slight risk at this 
time.

Updated grids to reflect slightly slower start to daytime warming
and some lingering middle to high cloudiness over the northern
third of the area for the early part of this afternoon.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
An upper-level ridge axis will rotate directly over the eastern
Tennessee Valley today, promoting a mostly sunny and warm day.
Southerly winds increase by the afternoon as the pressure 
gradient tightens thanks to an approaching storm system off to the
west. The combination of dry conditions, ample sunshine, and 
these winds will push highs in the 75 to 80 degree range over much
of the Valley this afternoon. 

A clear evening will then allow temperatures to drop quickly, but
high clouds ahead of an MCS moving into the lower Mississippi 
Valley will quickly move into the Southern Valley by late 
evening/midnight. These clouds will become denser and gradually 
lower as moisture increases. A few isolated showers will be 
possible late tonight along the NC/TN mountains thanks to 
orographic and weak isentropic lift. However, most areas will 
remain dry, with just the increased cloud cover to deal with. 

These clouds and a stout downslope wind will serve to keep 
temperatures around 15-20 degrees warmer tonight. The 
aforementioned winds may approach advisory criteria along the 
terrain, but did not have enough confidence that they will reach 
that criteria as of this package. However, the downsloping winds 
will certainly keep temperatures on the mild side for later 
tonight.

.LONG TERM /Monday through Saturday/...
The active spring weather pattern will continue through the 
extended period with a couple systems cycling through the forecast
area next week. 

The next storm system will approach our area on Monday. A cold front 
associated with this system will push through Monday afternoon and 
evening. Favorable frontal passage timing combined with decent 
instability and plenty of shear should result in convection in the 
warm sector ahead of the front. However, there still is some 
uncertainty whether convection closer to the Gulf of Mexico will cut 
off northern moisture transport -- which would greatly limit the 
potential for severe weather across our forecast area. Given this 
uncertainty, SPC has outlooked the majority of our area in a 
marginal risk for Monday, with the northern edge of the slight risk 
just clipping the southeastern Tennessee border and North Carolina 
counties. Additionally, strong low level warm air advection and 
strong forcing could lead to some decent rainfall amounts with these 
storms and some locations (especially across the southern half of 
our forecast area) could see 1-3" of rain. WPC has outlooked much of 
our forecast area in a marginal risk for excessive rainfall to 
reflect this potential. As the front pushes off the east coast on 
Tuesday, there will be enough moisture on the back side of the 
system for scattered showers across the north. 

Another stronger system will approach the Mississippi Valley on 
Wednesday. A deep trough will set up over the central US as the 
surface low pressure system continues to strengthupper level en. Our 
area should enjoy some morning sunshine and another day of warm 
temperatures o n Wednesday. Rain/thunderstorm chances increase 
during the afternoon and evening hours as a surface warm front moves 
from south to north across the forecast area and strong southerly 
flow streams moisture into the area. There looks to be plenty of 
instability, shear, and moisture in the warm sector to support 
convection across the area before a strong cold frontal passage 
early Thursday morning.

Strong northwest flow will set up behind the frontal passage for 
Thursday into Friday, ushering much colder air into the region. 
Highs Thursday and Friday will be about 20 degrees cooler than 
Wednesday, struggling to reach 60 in most locations. Lows will drop 
into the lower 40s and 30s for late week, and there's the potential 
for subfreezing temperatures, especially across the higher terrain. 
Enough moisture will linger behind this system for showers to 
continue Thursday into Friday, with a reinforcing shortwave or two 
cycling through the base of the upper trough. With overnight lows 
below freezing, high elevation snow showers are possible Friday and 
Saturday mornings, but these snow showers should have little impact.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Sunday)...
Clouds still eroding over the northern 1/3 of the area.  Looks like 
the last to clear (since there is no downsloping component there)
will be the northern plateau toward sunset, . Overnight skies 
should be clear over most of the area and winds should be light, 
allowing for a cool start for Sunday morning. By Noon Sunday, as 
the surface ridge slides to the east, a southerly return flow will
start up the valley. Also, this return flow will bring much 
warmer air back into the area quickly.

.LONG TERM /Sunday Night through Saturday/...
Little change to the previous forecast. The progressive pattern 
which has brought a parade of upper level troughs and associated 
surface fronts will continue, as the period will experience two 
system passages, each one bringing warm sector convection and cool 
sector showers. The first system will occur Monday into Tuesday, and 
the second system will occur Wednesday night to Thursday night. The 
first system has prompted SPC to place most of the CWA under a 
marginal risk of severe thunderstorms. The second system will have 
more of a cold punch behind it, as the upper trough will deepen into 
a closed low. There will be just enough cool air in the cold sector 
to bring some high elevation snow showers Friday morning and maybe 
early Saturday morning. These snow showers should have little 
impact.

.DISCUSSION...
Amazing motions on visible satellite this morning with wave clouds
all over the area, subsidence evident in some parts of the area,
and many directions of motion at varied levels of the troposphere.
With all this going on, the forecast of the cloud erosion today
will be challenging, with a general south to north erosion, but it
looks like there will be some pockets of erosion that don't 
follow that pattern. Likewise, the hourly temperatures will be a 
challenge as the temps respond to increasing sun as the clouds 
erode. Am leaving the Max Temps the same, but have slowed the 
warmup to much slower than the normal diurnal Temp curve. Most of
the other grids look to be on target and should be a little 
better behaved this afternoon.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
An upper-level ridge of high pressure will continue to shift east
toward the eastern Tennessee Valley today, bringing with it a
warmer and drier air mass. This morning, lingering boundary layer
moisture and a stable atmosphere has helped to keep some low
stratus clouds in place across much of the central and northern 
Valleys. These clouds will initally be slow to erode, but drier
air will filter in by early afternoon, resulting in a mostly to
partly sunny day for most areas after 17-18z. Clouds will be
slowest to breakup across far NE TN and SW VA, so a sharp temperature
gradient will exist across the region. NW winds and clouds will
keep temperatures in the upper 50s to lower 60s. Elsewhere highs
will range from the mid 60s to lower 70s across the far southern
Valley. A clear sky tonight will allow for good radiaitional
cooling -- with temperatures dropping off into the upper 30s to
mid 40s by early Sunday morning. 

.LONG TERM /Sunday through Friday/...
The active spring weather pattern will continue through the 
extended period with a couple systems cycling through the forecast
area next week. To start, Sunday should be a pleasant day with 
minimal cloud cover and temperatures rising into the 70s across 
much of the area. Locations in the southern Tennessee Valley will 
approach 80 degrees. Enjoy it while you can, because it looks like
it will be rainy for much of the workweek.

The next storm system will approach our area on Monday. A cold front 
associated with this system will push through Monday afternoon and 
evening. Favorable frontal passage timing combined with decent 
instability and shear should result in some convection for Monday 
afternoon and evening. However, there still is some uncertainty 
whether convection closer to the Gulf of Mexico with cut off 
northern moisture transport -- which would greatly limit convection 
across our forecast area. As the front pushes off the east coast on 
Tuesday, there will be enough moisture on the back side of the 
system for scattered showers and gloomy skies. 

Another stronger system will approach the Mississippi Valley on 
Wednesday. A deep trough will set up over the central US as the 
surface low pressure system continues to strengthen. While our area 
should enjoy some sunshine and another day of warm temperatures 
ahead of this system for Wednesday, there's the chance for some 
popup showers and thunderstorms as strong southerly flow streams 
moisture into the area. The strong cold front associated with this 
system will push across our forecast area Wednesday night into 
Thursday. There looks to be plenty of instability, shear, and 
moisture with this system to support convection. Strong northwest 
flow will set up behind the frontal passage for Thursday night into 
Friday, ushering much colder air into the region. Highs by Friday 
will be about 20 degrees cooler than earlier in the week. Lows will 
drop into at least the 30s for late week, and there's the potential 
for subfreezing temperatures, especially across the higher terrain. 
Enough moisture will linger behind this system for showers to 
continue Thursday night into Friday; some of which may fall as snow 
across the aforementioned higher terrain.

Upper low moving eastward from NE KY about to enter western WV. 
The expanse of its cold pool aloft has not extended as far south 
as previously forecast, so will trim POPs for the remainder of the
afternoon and also overnight from previous forecast--have it dry 
after 04Z. Stratocumulus have continued to be subborn to erode, so
will keep cloud cover going that shows mostly cloudy conditions 
overnight for most of the area. The sun should return for Saturday
and help warm temps higher than today's readings, although clouds
in the NE will take into the afternoon to erode. Winds Saturday 
should be much lighter as the low level ridge moves into the 
region.

.LONG TERM (Saturday Night through Friday)...Another active period 
of Spring weather with a nice ending to the weekend with nearly full 
sunshine and high temperatures returning to the 70s forecast area 
wide thanks to Eastern United States upper level ridging. Next storm 
system drives east out of Mid America with relatively strong short 
wave aloft and a surface low pressing northeast out of the Lower 
Mississippi Valley through the Upper Ohio Valley Sunday night 
through Tuesday morning. The low will drag a cold front through the 
Southern Appalachians with a small chance for some light showers 
well ahead of the system Sunday night with categorical pops for 
showers Monday and Monday night. There is still a bit of instability 
progged ahead of the front for the possibility of some convection on 
Monday. The pressure center deepens as it heads into the Eastern 
Lakes on Tuesday and there should be more than enough moisture on 
the back side of the system for a continuation of a few showers on 
Tuesday. No rest for the weary as another, stronger system in fast 
on the approach toward the Mississippi Valley on Wednesday and the 
superblend broadbrushes mainly a slight chance for showers ahead of 
this deep upper trough and surface low pressure system. Model 
solutions still not on the same page concerning system strength and 
pressure center positioning for this mid week feature but the 
superblend gradually increases pops from low chance to high chance 
probability Wednesday night into Thursday night ahead of the strong 
cold front associated with the deep nearly full latitude trough. 
Instability and shear are more than adequate for convection for this 
system. It will be turning significantly colder in the lengthy, and 
strong northerly flow on the back side of the deep Eastern states 
upper trough. And, it appears there may be at least one and possibly 
two shorter wavelength systems driving southeast across the forecast 
area Thursday night into Friday with sufficient moisture for some 
more showers; some of which may fall as snow in the higher terrain 
areas.

Line of showers exiting the eastern areas now, and a few peaks of
sun in some locations. However, the strong and cold upper Low 
over the Ohio Valley will be moving to the east today and its cold
pool aloft should be able to induce showers over parts of the 
area--fairly widespread showers over our northern counties and 
more scattered along the I-40 corridor, tapering to little if any 
coverage in SE Tenn. Surface temperatures will be kept cooler by 
this scenario, especially across the north where the surface 
warming will quickly get drawn up by the widespread/weak 
instability of the upper low overhead. Have shaved POPs after 21z 
by about a category at each location as the low starts getting 
past us.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
A cold front currently draped along the western edge of the 
Cumberland Plateau is slowly pushing east into the region early 
this morning. Accompanying this front is a broad line of showers 
and isolated thunderstorms. This activity will push into the TN 
Valley and eventually the mountains and foothills, before clearing
the region by 12-15z. A slow-moving upper-low moving across 
Southern Kentucky will help maintain a breezy westerly flow and
keep the dense cloud cover in place for most of the day. This 
should severely limit heating, though some breaks are expected 
(mainly along and south of I-40). As a result, highs will only 
climb into the low to mid 60s in most places.

Additionally, lift from the upper-trough will help to generate 
some light showers periodically throughout the day and into the 
evening hours -- particularly along the mountains and far NE TN 
and SW VA. As a result, have gone a little higher on chance PoPs 
for this area throughout the day. This activity will gradually 
taper off overnight, through do think the clouds will stick around
(at least partially) across most of the region until Saturday 
morning, given the abundant boundary layer moisture. Also, some 
patchy fog will be possible along the sheltered valleys and lakes 
tonight due to this as well (in areas that see some partial 
clearing). 

.LONG TERM /Saturday through Thursday/...
High pressure will be in control to start the period. Southerly 
flow on Sunday should help warm most areas into the 70s -- with 
locations in the southern Tennessee Valley pushing 80. A low 
pressure system will approach the area Sunday night, bringing rain
for Monday. While the best instability looks to be to our west, 
there should be enough to spark some thunderstorms across the 
area, but severe weather is not anticipated at this time. 
Lingering showers will be possible Tuesday morning, but should be 
clearing out by Tuesday afternoon. 

From here, the forecast gets a bit murky with increasing differences 
between models. For the second half of the week, a rather strong mid 
latitude system will move through the area, and will bring showers, 
thunderstorms, and the potential . However, there are significant 
timing and positioning differences between models, so for now have 
broadbrushed chance PoPs for the end of the extended period.  It is 
worth noting that temperatures will turn colder as this system blows 
through, with strong northwest flow setting up for the end of the 
week. Highs on Thursday will be in the 60s and, more significantly, 
overnight lows will dip back into the 30s and lower 40s (with even 
colder values possible in the mountains).

.DISCUSSION...
Convection near the Gulf Coast has helped to stabilize our area,
and with sunset, the threat of severe storms has dropped to nearly
zero. We could still see some locally heavy rainfall and
thunderstorms overnight, and their N-S movement with slow eastward
progression could result in training cells that produce localized
flooding. Winds aloft have not been particularly strong either,
between 30-35 kts in VWP and RNK sounding. Gusts in the 40-50 mph
range cannot be ruled out with a few isolated storms, and the Wind
Advisory for the mountains will be maintained. A few small changes
will be made to the forecast with the evening update, mainly to 
adjust timing and coverage of precip based on radar trends.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Saturday Night)...
Slow going with the thunderstorm development so far.  High 
confidence that we will have storms tonight as the cold front pushes 
through the area late tonight, but low confidence on how much will 
develop ahead of front late this afternoon and into this evening. 
Anything that can get going earlier will have better heating, 
but it is questionable how much will get going. By Friday morning, 
all the focus should be turned to the Carolinas, and just have 
showers in the forecast for our area by then. Then it slowly dries
out the rest of Friday and into Friday night. 

Main threat will be damaging winds with the strong wind field
aloft that can be brought to the surface in stronger downdrafts. 
Hail looks to be limited to only about quarter size and mainly 
west of I-75. Tornado threat seems low--even though there is a 
strong wind field, storm updrafts will be getting pretty weak 
overall as the storms move in late.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Thursday)...The long term period has a 
couple of systems that will impact the forecast area. The superblend 
targets Monday with the first feature and Thursday with the second 
with some broadbrushing of lower chance pops around either side of 
these two periods. We should be able to squeeze out a decent Sunday 
with a fair amount of sunshine and pleasant temperatures in the 70s. 
The first system will be another relatively strong upper trough 
building into the region on Monday. The superblend is a little 
closer to the more northern ecmwf depiction of the storm system low 
pressure center in comparison to the gfs. This system will have some 
modest shear and instability so kept some mention of convection in 
this period with decreasing probability of precipitation on the back 
side of the system on Tuesday. The end of the extended period 
features a blending of the ecmwf and gfs solutions, due to 
positioning and timing differences with a rather strong mid latitude 
cyclone expected in the Southern Appalachian region around the 
Wednesday into Thursday timeframe. Slightly higher chance pops were 
weighted further out in time to Thursday with the system cold fropa. 
Convection looks very probable with this strong system so applied 
this concept to the new day seven forecast.

.AVIATION...Deep low pressure system will continue moving slowly
east from the Eastern Plains to the Central Appalachians. The
difference in pressure from the ridge over the Southeastern
Atlantic Coastal region to the low is generating a healthy
southerly flow which appears to be aiding in keeping lower
ceilings and precipitation out of the Great Valley, due to a
warming and drying downsloping flow across the higher terrain. 
Would expect this trend to continue for many hours during this 
forecast. In fact, convection which forms ahead of the Mississippi
Valley cold front may not build into cha until around 03-05z and 
tys until around 05-07z. The convective precip may not show up at
tri until about 08z. Drying should take over behind the front
toward daybreak with some showers perhaps ongoing through about
13z at tri. Visual flight rule weather would likely return to each
terminal around 12-14z with about a broken 3500-4000 foot ceiling
hanging around through much of the remainder of the forecast.

.DISCUSSION...
The forecast for the approaching system continues to be a
challenge with timing. Based on current trends the timing part of
convection today looks iffy, so I've trimmed back POPs where the
higher POPs were on the Plateau and SE Tenn. Still not sure how
much convection we will be able to get in any parts of the area
prior to 00z. Then before midnight we will likely have some
convection ahead of the front, but not sure how much. Good bet for
convection along the front as it finally pushes through after
midnight. Damaging winds from stronger cells looks like the main
threat, with best threats for any impacts being greater on the
Plateau and fading farther east as we get deeper into the night. 
Looks like by 09z to 10z most of the suppoting dynamics will be 
refocused into the Carolinas. Flooding threat depends somewhat on 
earlier convection--if we get more organized pre-frontal storms, 
that precip added to the storms along the front could certainly 
make more of a flood threat, than simply the heavy rains along 
the frontal line of storms. 

Wind Advisory looks like it will suffice--moderate to strong
winds, but not at the optimal trajectory for a pure mountain wave
event.

.Short Term (Today)...Warm southerly winds will increase low level 
moisture and convective instability across the region, ahead of an 
approaching storm system that will impact the area tonight. Expect 
showers and perhaps a few thunderstorms to develop and move into the 
Plateau and southern valley in the afternoon, although the more 
widespread activity will not arrive until tonight. As winds increase 
today, strong mountain wave winds will develop during the late 
afternoon and continue overnight.

.LONG TERM (Tonight through Wednesday)...A negative upper trough
will move across the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys tonight and early
Friday morning. A series of jet streaks exiting the upper trough
will produce divergence aloft over the region late today through
early Friday morning. These circulation around this jets will
enhance the fronto-genetic forcing overnight. 

Models show the airmass becoming moderately unstable with MLCAPES
of 1000-1500 J/Kg with Hail CAPEs of 150-300 J/kg. Shear/SR
Helicity does become quite strong with favorable values for
rotating updrafts with incoming storms. LCL heights lower
overnight as well. Models show a 850mb jet of 40-50kts overnight. Given
these parameters, isolated tornadoes are a concern with the main 
threat being damaging winds up to 60 mph and hail of 0.5 to 1
inch.

SPC has placed essentially the entire area under a slight risk of
severe thundestorms, even though the western/southern half of the
area seems to have the greatest threat.

Given the low-level jet and favorable thermodynamic profile,
strong winds are expected across the mountains and foothills for
tonight. Have issued a wind advisory for these locations.

For Friday, after early more showers (thunder northeast), models
show plenty of boundary layer moisture remaining keep the area
under mostly cloudy sky. Enough low-level instability to keep
chance showers going, especially for the orographic lift areas.

For this weekend, upper and surface ridging will produce a dry and
warm Saturday and Sunday.

Next strong upper trough will move into the area for early next
week. This system also has strong upper jet forcing with potential
of widespread showers and scattered storms.

.Short term (tonight and tomorrow)...

Mostly clear skies will remain 
this evening and tonight...with low temperatures tonight several 
degrees above normal. A low pressure system and associated frontal 
boundary will approach the area tomorrow late afternoon. Ahead of 
this boundary...low level flow will be consistent out of the S and 
SW...bringing an increase in moisture and warm air advection to the 
area. Clouds will increase through the late morning Thursday...with 
high temperatures settling about 10 degrees above normal for this 
time of year. 

Models show minimal instability...only a couple of hundred J/kg 
through the afternoon...with dry mid levels. As moisture increases 
with the low level flow...could see a few isolated...non severe 
thunderstorms form...mainly along the plateau...extreme southern 
valley...and higher elevations in the east TN mountains. Would 
expect light rainfall with these storms. 

Gusty winds will be a concern through the afternoon Thursday...with 
a mid level jet moving through the area. Higher elevations could see 
the worst of the wind...with gusts up to 60 mph possible. With this 
possibilty...with keep a High Wind Watch going from Thursday 
evening through Friday morning. 

.LONG TERM (Tomorrow night through Tuesday)...

Main line of storms will be pushing through Middle Tennessee 
tomorrow evening and heading towards us. Right now the models are 
depicting the main line to move into our western counties sometime 
around midnight (or maybe a bit before). Best chance for severe 
storms will be ones that form to our west and maintain strength as 
they move into our western counties. The decent amount of shear in 
the mid to low levels could help maintain storm intensity, with 
strong straight-line winds being the main threat. Can't rule out 
large hail and a possible tornado in our area, but the chances are 
much lower for them. Storms will quickly lose strength as they move 
through our area as the instability and shear quickly decreases the 
further east you move. 

The low level jet that is aiding the strength and shear of these 
storms will eventually have a southeasterly component across the 
Southern Appalachian Mountains leading to a possible mountain wave 
event tomorrow night. Direction of the winds isn't exactly like a 
traditional mountain wave event, but we have strong enough winds in 
the low levels so some locations should experience the strong winds.

We'll take a break from precipitation and warm up through the 
weekend ahead of our next system. Models are in a bit of 
disagreement on the strength and timing of this next system, but it 
looks like another round of showers and thunderstorms will accompany 
it the first half of the next work week.

.Short Term (Today and Tonight)...Ridging between weather systems 
will mark the short term. Warm temperatures of 10-12 degrees above 
normal are expected, with fair weather. Light winds today will 
become southerly overnight. Upslope precipitation on the NC side of 
the mountains late tonight may flirt with TN mountain communities on 
the state line, but will maintain the non-mention of precip.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...Main concern is a strong
upper trough lifting east fro the central/southern Plains into the
Tennessee Valley Thursday and Thursday night. Strong jet streaks
will move across the upper low across the Tennessee Valley with
broad upper divergence across the Region. The circulation around
these jets will produce strong upper forcing across the Tennessee/
Mississippi Valleys. In response to the upper forcing, a strong
low-level jet will develop as well with 850mb winds of 50-60kts
pulling abundant moisture/instability into the Tennessee Valley,
especially the western and middle Tennessee. 

Very favorable environment for tornadoes development with good
shear and thermodynamics over the western half of Tennessee
Tennessee and Mississippi Valley with long-lived tornadoes
anticipated. Main question for the Plateau and southeast Tennessee
is if these tornadic supercells can make into this far east into
lesser environment. CIPS analogs suggests there is a threat into
the Plateau and southeast Tennessee with SPC pulling a slight risk
into these areas. For the central Valley, there is a threat of
damaging winds as these storms weaken with a marginal risk.

For the northern half of Tennessee Valley into southwest Virginia,
the strong southerly low-level jet will produce downsloping
conditions limiting convection. The strong low-level jet combined
with favorable thermodyanmic conditions will set the stage for
mountain wave high winds for the far east Tennessee Mountains and
foothills for late Thursday through early Friday morning.

This system moves east of the area Friday morning, but wrap-around
showers will continue for the northern/eastern areas Friday
afternoon and night.

Upper ridging returns for Saturday and Sunday with the next strong
upper trough expected for Monday and Tuesday. Strong dyanmics with
this system as well with showers and storms likely.

may accompany this activity as well -- though am not confident 
enough to adjust up to mentionable levels there. The remainder of
the Valley will stay mostly to partly clear -- and with light 
winds and abundant boundary layer moisture, some patchy fog will 
once again be possible late tonight into early Wednesday morning. 
The higher dewpoints will also help keep temperatures on the mild 
side, with lows bottoming out in the upper 40s to lower 50s.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...
Cloud cover will continue to diminish tonight as the upper level 
shortwave that brought yesterday's showers and thunderstorms
continues to push east. With less cloud cover, temperatures will
be cooler than last night, around 50 in most locations and in the
mid to upper 40s in the Smokies. Cooler temperatures combined with
residual boundary layer moisture from the rain should aid in fog 
formation tonight and areas of fog are possible across the area 
tomorrow morning. After sunrise, a ridge will build overhead 
throughout the day and keep skies mostly sunny. This will allow 
for high temperatures in the 70s tomorrow, with locations in the 
southern Tennessee Valley potentially approaching 80 degrees. Just
how warm it gets will depend on how much fog/low stratus develops
tonight and how long it takes for it to clear out tomorrow 
morning.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
A ridge through the mid and upper levels will be over our area to
start the period, while at the surface, low pressure will be 
tracking slowly east- northeast from the southern Plains to the 
Ozarks. The southerly low level flow ahead of this system will be 
increasing through Thursday, bringing mild temps in the mid/upper 
70s and rising dewpoints. Afternoon destabilization may bring 
scattered/isolated showers/storms Thursday afternoon to southern 
and western sections. A downslope flow of 30-40 kts at 850 mb 
across northern sections should help cap convection in that area 
through Thursday night. The model trend with this system has been 
slower, and expected convection near the Gulf Coast may also limit
northward moisture transport and increase midlevel stability 
through Thursday night. As a result, will delay the onset of 
categorical PoPs until Friday morning when the upper trough axis 
and jet streak move across the area. At this time any widespread 
severe storm threat appears to be south of our area, but with a 
40-50 kt LLJ, some strong gradient winds in the mountains and 
foothills may be possible Thursday night. Model differences and 
run-to-run timing changes lead to some uncertainty regarding the 
end of precip, but will continue low PoPs into Friday evening.

The weekend will be dry as the amplified pattern aloft brings 
another ridge across the region. The general model consensus is for 
a closed low to track from the southern Plains toward the TN/OH 
Valley region on Monday/Monday night, but there are differences in 
model timing and positioning of the low that add uncertainty. Will 
have high chance PoPs for the area during that period, with 
decreasing PoPs through Tuesday.

Should be a mild day with slowly decreasing cloud cover. May have
to update cloud cover trends again a little later depending how
stubborn this cloud deck is. Seems like it may stick a bit longer
than anticipated, and this would also impact temperatures this
afternoon -- keeping things a bit cooler than originally forecast.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...Upper trough is moving across
the lower Ohio Valley with the best forcing moving east of the
area. Due to continued cold air aloft remaining over the area
through early afternoon, we may still see scattered shower
development. Models sounding show plenty of boundary layer 
moisture remaining today, so mostly cloudy sky will be the rule.

For tonight, plenty of surface moisture remains allowing fog and
low stratus clouds to develop. Some of the fog will likely be
locally dense.

.Long Term (Wednesday through Monday)...Progressive pattern will 
continue. By Wednesday, the latest deep H5 trough will be centered 
over west Texas, resulting in warm ridging and fair weather across 
our area Wed and Wed night. As the trough lifts northeastward, it 
will push through the next frontal system Thursday and Thur night, 
with showers likely and scattered thunder. The core of the trough 
will pass Friday, keeping precip chances in the area Friday and Fri 
night. Then fair weather returns thanks to H5 ridging between the 
departing system and the next southern Rockies/west Texas H5 trough 
over the weekend. Yes, this means a great Spring weekend is shaping 
up. Models diverge on the timing of the ejection of that late-period 
trough, but it will probably bring increasing chances of showers and 
a few thunderstorms during the early part of the next work week.

showers will move across TRI/TYS through 08Z. As upper trough moves 
across the Ohio Valley this morning, enough instability remains to

progressing through the eastern half of the forecast area late
this evening. Secondary line is making its way onto the Cumberland
Plateau and while there will still be some convection in the line
which may be strong across Southeast Tennessee as it moves into

and Lower Ohio Valley is bringing some showers and thunderstorms
to the Great Valley this evening. Movement of the area of rain is
so slow that the terminals will be impacted for several hours
through the late evening into the early morning. A trailing line
of showers and thunderstorms currently over Middle Tennessee will
likely weaken in the stabilizing late night airmass and pass
through the Southern Appalachian region mainly in the form of rain
showers. Kept much of the forecast period vfr with a chance of an
mvfr ceiling or visibility reduction in rain and fog in some of

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...
Shortwave crosses the forecast area tonight, bringing a continued
threat of showers and thunderstorms. With SFC-6km shear of 
30-35kts and MLCAPE values maxing out around 1500J/kg, localized
damaging winds are possible with these storms through at least
midnight -- especially across the Cumberland Plateau. SPC has
outlooked this area for a slight risk of severe storms today.
Through the rest of the afternoon/evening hours, there is also the
potential for some of the storms to produce some small hail with
hail CAPEs up to 300J/kg. The storms this afternoon/early evening
will be more isolated with coverage increasing later this evening
as storm mode becomes more linear and clusters of storms congeal
into more of a line. Severe threat should decrease overnight as
well as the atmosphere becomes more stable. 

This system will slowly exit the area on Tuesday, with showers and
maybe an isolated rumble or two of thunder expected for at least 
the morning hours. By the afternoon, upper level ridging will
begin to build in for the west, and skies should gradually clear
through the afternoon and evening hours.


.LONG TERM...(Tuesday night through Monday)...
The front will have moved south and east of our area Tuesday 
evening, with a surface high over the Great Lakes extending 
southward while a ridge aloft builds in from the west. The 
progression of this ridge will provide dry weather and mild 
temperatures through Thursday morning. 

The models have some differences with the next system that may bring 
showers and storms to the area from Thursday afternoon through 
Friday. The ECMWF and GFS Ensemble Mean agree on a closed low over 
the Plains that becomes an open wave after it crosses the MS River 
and tracks NE along the OH River. The GFS maintains the closed low 
and takes it due east along the TN/KY border. A southerly low 
level flow ahead of it will likely result in downslope 
warming/drying that will delay precip in our northeastern half on 
Thursday afternoon, with isolated/scattered showers possible south
and west. The ECMWF/Ensemble solution is preferred, which focuses
the highest precip chances late Thursday night and ends precip 
Friday afternoon. Upper jet positioning near the Gulf Coast and 
the limited northward extend of the 850 mb theta-e ridge into 
AL/GA suggests the greatest severe threat will be to our south 
with this system, with only a low threat for our area. The 
expected overnight timing will further limit instability. With 
these uncertainties, will maintain PoPs in the likely range for 
now with a chance of thunderstorms. 

The pattern remains amplified through the rest of the forecast, with 
a ridge providing a dry weekend with near normal temperatures. The 
models depict another closed low crossing the southern Plains and 
Ozarks on Monday, although with some big differences in timing. Will 
start Monday with a chance of showers and thunderstorms.

Tweaked temperatures, sky cover, and PoPs based on current trends
and short term guidance. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will
develop this afternoon and evening, and some may be strong enough
to produce damaging winds and small hail. The latest SPC day one 
outlook nudged the slight risk a bit further east to include our 
plateau counties. Will continue to monitor trends and forecasts
throughout the day. As we head into the overnight hours, a more
widespread line of showers (with embedded thunder possible) will
push through the area as the trough axis crosses overhead. By this
point, the atmosphere should be more stable, and severe 
conditions are not anticipated overnight at this time.

.Aviation...Main concern is developing storms late this 
afternoon and overnight. Another short-wave trough will move east 
from the southern Plains into the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys late today 
and tonight. Jet dynamics places the Tennessee Valley under good 
divergence aloft. A boundary layer jet is also induced across the

level dry air may produce localized damaging winds.
Hail CAPES up to 300 J/kg will also support small hail, possibly
isolated quarter size with the stronger storms. 

Besides the convection, another unseasonably mild day due to breezy 
southwest winds ahead of approaching upper trough. Southwest winds

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...First mid/upper level trough
will lift out as second approaches during the period. Current 
convection is expected to lift northeast with less activity 
overnight, although cannot rule out a shower at any time. Tomorrow
will see instability increase again and with upper trough edging

continue through at least the first half of Tuesday, but these 
should mainly be garden variety thunderstorms, and severe storms are 
not anticipated. The shortwave slowly pushes off the east coast 
Tuesday afternoon, and we should get a brief stretch of dry weather 
for Wednesday and the first half of Thursday as a weak ridge builds 
over the southeast US. Models continue to show differences with the 
next system, but the general consensus is another round of 
convection will move through Thursday into Friday as the center of a 
low pressure system tracks northeast just west of the forecast area. 
Some lingering showers are possible early Saturday behind the 
departing system, then another brief dry spell is expected before 
yet another system moves in at the end of the forecast period.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A trough axis is moving across
the region early this morning with broad upper divergence helping
to produce a band of showers. This area will be across southwest
Virginia/northeast Tennessee around 12Z. Behind this axis, the
upper trough along with marginal instability will produce
scattered showers and afternoon thunder. Since upper forcing is
lifting northeast away from the area this afternoon and
instability is marginal, only expect isolated strong storms
possible. 

Model soundings do show a boundary layer jet of 25-35kts remaining
today with some mid-level dry air, so strong gusty winds are
possible.

For tonight, enough instability remains, so will continue with a
chance of showers, but most locations will remain dry. Patchy fog
is possible, especially Plateau and southwest North Carolina.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...Will remain in an unsettle 
weather pattern through much the extended as the first of two 
weather systems pushes into the Southern Appalachian Region for 
Monday and Tuesday. This system does have sufficient low level 
moisture and weak lift and expect the atmosphere to become weakly 
unstable for scattered convection to develop.  Overall...do not 
expect this to be a significant event but can not rule out a stray 
strong storm.  A few showers may linger across the area Tuesday 
night as the system pulls out of the area.  By Wednesday...we will 
basically be between systems for a dry for mid week.  Models 
continue to show differences by the end of the period but do expect 
to see another system move in around the Thursday/Friday time frame 
providing our next round of convection with a few lingering 
showers into Saturday as the system exits the region.

.AVIATION...A large area of deep moisture and lift is slowly
advancing east within the broad circulation of the Missouri upper
low. The leading edge of this lift will build into Southeast
Tennessee through the evening and overnight hours gradually
building into Central East Tennessee. Therefore, will expect some
showers moving across cha this evening and advancing across tys
well after midnight due to the slow movement seen in radar imagery
and depicted in model solutions. Not real convinced that there
will be a great deal of convection involved but added vicinity
thunder to these locations. Tri will not become involved in this
action until around 12z Sunday. It appears that flight weather may
not even drop into an mvfr category at the terminals with the
exception of cha where visibility may be low enough in a slightly
heavier shower later tonight.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...Overall, unsettled short term 
period as a low pressure system moves in and brings showers and a 
few thunderstorms across the area. 

System is rather slow moving and it will take awhile before we see 
any precip. To begin the period have narrow zone of likely pops in 
place across the far southwest corner of the CWA, chance pops across 
Plateau and Southern Valley and slight chance extending up into the 
Central and Northern Valley. The general progression of pops 
overnight will be to have increasing pops from southwest to 
northeast, thus keeping Northeast TN and Southwest VA driest the 
longest. For most locations, mainly expecting rain but soundings do 
show a few hundred joules of CAPE overnight so will include slight 
chance for a Tstorm, expect for NETN and SWVA where airmass is more 
stable. Lows tonight will once again be very mild, with lows around 
15 degrees above normal.

A stronger 850mb jet core moves in after 00z and will bring near 
wind advisory criteria to the highest peaks of the Smokies. 
Sustained winds of 20 to 25 mph with gusts near 40 mph will be 
possible above 5000 feet. Elevations below 5000 feet will see breezy 
and gusty conditions as well, with sustained winds of 15 to 20 mph 
and gusts near 30 mph. These breezy and gusty winds will continue 
into tomorrow. No advisory planned at this time.

Initial wave of showers begins to decrease in coverage and intensity 
tomorrow morning after sunrise and that trend continues through late 
morning and early afternoon. Later tomorrow afternoon, the forecast 
is a little more tricky. With cold front still back to our west, and 
partial clearing expected, it appears that shower and thunderstorm 
redevelopment is possible just back to our west with activity moving 
into our area by mid to late afternoon. If we can get redevelopment 
some of the storms could become strong with an isolated severe not 
out of the question. Tomorrow afternoon NAM soundings show 500 to 
1000 J/KG of MLCAPE across the area with steep lapse rates along 
with 30 to 40 kts of 0-6km shear and near 30kts at 0-3km. Will 
continue to watch model runs to see how they handle afternoon 
redevelopment. Current SPC outlook has our area under a marginal 
risk tomorrow. Highs tomorrow will be in the upper 60s to low 70s.


.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...Will stay in an active 
weather pattern through the extended forecast period as a series of 
systems move through the area. To start the period, a cold front 
will slowly be exiting the forecast area, bringing reduced 
thunderstorm chances for Sunday night. The next system is right on 
its heels, with a shortwave over the central plains moving east into 
the area by Monday evening into Tuesday. This will bring another 
round of showers and thunderstorms to the region. Shortwave pushes 
east by Tuesday evening and upper level ridging builds, bringing the 
only stretch of dry weather for Wednesday into Thursday.

Another system strengthening over the south-central US will push 
east for the end of the workweek, but this is where model solutions 
begin to diverge with the ECMWF progressing the system slightly 
faster than the GFS and tracking it further north.  Regardless, rain 
chances increase once again for Thursday into Friday with more 
showers and thunderstorms possible as this system impacts the 
forecast area.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast on track in respects to approaching system
to our west but have made changes to cloud cover for today. A good
amount of clearing currently seen on VIS sat imagery across the
area. Clouds will continue to come and go through the day but more
sunshine expected overall than previously forecast. Feel like
current HRRR run has a pretty good handle on cloud cover through 
the day so trended toward that model. Because of the decrease in
clouds in the forecast have bumped up max temps by a degree or 
two, on average, across the area. Temps are already in the mid 60s
in most spots and we should warm up quickly today with good 
southerly flow and sunshine. Will send out new zones for cloud and
temp adjustments.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Main system of interest is a
slow moving upper trough across the southern plains. This system
will move northeast into the Ohio Valley by Sunday. The trough
axis will move into the Tennessee Valley late today and tonight.
Associated upper jet will place the region under the favored right
entrance region of the jet with broad divergence. The upward
forcing will move into the southern Plateau/southeast Tennessee
late this afternoon, then slowly move across the rest of the area
overnight. Enough instability to include thunderstorms for TYS and
CHA areas.

The upper jet forcing will also induce a low-level jet of
35-45kts. Later shifts may need to issue a wind advisory for the
far eastern Tennessee Mountains tonight.

Followed model temperature guidance closely for today and tonight.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...Will stay in an active weather 
pattern through the extended as a series of frontal boundaries and 
short waves track through. We will begin the extended with a cold 
front across the region.  We will see decent moisture in place with 
dew points increasing to the upper 50s and possible a few low 
60s...strong daytime heating with highs climbing into the upper 60s 
and 70s and a 40 to 50 KTs 850 MB jet pushing through.  This will 
all combine to provide a marginally unstable air mass and allow for 
a line of convection to develop and move in.  A stray storm could 
become strong or potentially severe.  The cold front will exit 
Sunday night but will be followed quickly with and other system 
moving in.  A warm front will lift though the area Monday with the 
accompanying cold front tracking into the area on Tuesday for a 
continue chance of convection through the first part of the work 
week.  A few showers may behind the system...but overall...the best 
chance at a dry period will be around the Wednesday time frame with 
weak ridging over the area. Model consistency lessens by the end of 
the period but the trend is to bring in the next system around 
Thursday or Friday.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through tomorrow)...Expect some cloud cover to 
linger overnight but also with patches of partial clearing across 
the area. With lingering clouds and continued southerly flow lows 
will be quite mild. Temps will generally be in the upper 40s to low 
to mid 50s, which is around 10 to 15 degrees above normal.

High pressure that has been to our east will gradually shift further 
east tomorrow in advance of an incoming low pressure system. 
Incoming low and high still to our east will further ramp up heights 
increasing max temps by another few degrees. Temps in the lower 70s 
expected at most locations, which will be around 5 to 10 degrees 
above normal. This system is rather slow to move in due to the 
amount of dry air in place out ahead of it. Will keep areas north of 
I-40 dry through the day. By mid afternoon start introducing pops 
south of I-40 and slowly increase them through the rest of the 
afternoon. Bulk of the precip is expected to move in after this 
short-term period. With the tightening pressure gradient expecting 
winds to be gusty tomorrow with gusts generally ranging from 10 to 
15 mph with some gusts up to 20 mph. Expect party sunny conditions 
for the most part, with clouds around the area along with peaks of 
sunshine.

.LONG TERM...Saturday night through Friday)...Overall...expect a 
rather unsettled weather pattern throughout the extended. While 
there are some discrepancies, as expected, between models, they are 
in relatively good agreement through about Tuesday. A cold front 
will approach the area Saturday night into Sunday.  With weak 
instability and decent 850mb winds, there will be a chance for some 
thunderstorms overnight Saturday. Daytime heating on Sunday will 
help to further destabilize the environment with forecast afternoon 
SBCAPE values of 500-1000 J/kg, and when combined with dewpoints in 
the upper 50s and forecast 0-6km shear values of 20-30kts, this 
should be enough to trigger isolated to scattered thunderstorms. At 
this point, SPC has our forecast area outlooked for a marginal risk 
of severe storms for Sunday, with the main concerns being isolated 
damaging winds and potentially some hail with the strongest 
updrafts. This system pulls away from the area Sunday night, but we 
will have only a brief break in rain chances before the next system 
moves in for Monday/Tuesday.

A weak shortwave will push east from the Great Plains on Monday, 
bringing another round of showers and potentially some thunderstorms 
to the area. Wednesday and Thursday look like potentially the driest 
days of the week, with weak ridging overhead as another system for 
late week digs into south-central US and strengthens. A warm frontal 
boundary associated with this closed low will approach the area late 
Thursday, and will serve as a focus for showers and thunderstorms on 
Friday.

.DISCUSSION...Some changes to the forecast this morning mainly for
cloud cover. HI-RES models do show good southerly flow into the
area with cloud cover streaming in from south to north. Overall
however, looping GOES-16 vis imagery over the past few hours
reveal a decreasing trend in cloud cover. It seems that the
positioning of the high just off to our east is allowing most of
the Central Valley and Northward to benefit from downsloping 
influences, although weak, at 850 mb up 700 mb. It looks like 
areas north of I-40 should see the most sun today, with the 
Southern Valley breaking out into sunshine be mid to late 
afternoon. The extreme Southern Valley and Southwest North 
Carolina will hold onto clouds the longest. Because of an overall 
decrease in cloud cover in the forecast, have bumped up max temps 
today by a few degrees in most places. Will send out new zones for
temps and cloud cover adjustment.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A ridge of high pressure along
and just east of the southern Appalachians will produce another
dry and warm day. Model soundings show a strong boundary layer
inversion (around 850mb) over the region today. Satellite shows a
broken ceiling (around 850mb) advecting north into the area due to
the low-leve southerly flow around the ridge. This cloud cover
will remain through most of the morning, especially
central/south, then scattered during the afternoon. A good deal of
cirrus/cirru-stratus is expected late today and tonight.

Even though mostly cloudy/partly sunny sky is expected, warm
southerly winds will allow temperatures climb in upper 60s to
lower 70s most locations today.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...Overall...expect a rather 
unsettled weather pattern throughout the extended.   Could see 
scattered convection begin to move in late Saturday afternoon in 
advance of an approaching cold front.  However...current model 
timing brings the main line of convection across the area Saturday 
night.  A 40 to 50 KT 850MB jet will accompany the front and the air 
mass will be weakly unstable for likely to categorical showers and a 
chance of thunderstorms.  Convection will continue over the region 
into Sunday and with daytime heating the atmosphere will destabilize 
further.  A few showers may linger into Sunday night as the system 
pulls way from the area.  Will not see much of a break between 
systems with another cold front quickly moving in and bringing 
another round of showers and thunderstorms to the region around the 
Monday/Tuesday time frame.  A few showers may linger into Wednesday 
with weak ridging to zonal flow aloft.  Then...another system will 
be approaching the area for Thursday...will only have a light chance 
of pops mentions on Thursday as the main band of convection is 
currently expected to remain west of the area through the end of the 
extended period.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Tomorrow)...A fairly calm night in
store but with increasing clouds as the lower levels of the 
atmosphere begins to moisten up. Surface high pressure, and up to 
850 mb, is centered just off to our east. This brings in a decent 
fetch of moisture from out of the Atlantic and into our area. This
will provide cloudy to mostly cloudy skies overnight. Cloud cover
that moves in overnight can currently be seen on VIS sat imagery 
across Central and Southern Georgia. Increased cloud cover will 
allow lows to be around 5 degrees above normal with lows in the 
lower to upper 40s. 

Unfortunately, clouds linger tomorrow but with increasing southerly 
flow comes increasing temperatures. Temperatures will be quite 
nice with highs in the upper 60s for most locations, which is 
around 5 degrees above normal. There could be a few peaks of 
sunshine later in the afternoon.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...Ridging continues 
to slide east Friday night, ahead of a closed low that will 
approach from the west on Saturday. A cold front will associated 
showers and thunderstorms will push into the area by Saturday 
night. Rain chances will decrease throughout the day on Sunday as 
the low lifts northeast. Weak ridging briefly builds in for Monday
before a shortwave approaches Monday night/Tuesday bringing the 
next chance for showers. It looks like there will be enough 
instability to trigger a few thunderstorms with this system. 
Things dry out again on Wednesday as the shortwave pushes east and
upper level ridging builds. Again, this won't last long with 
another system approaching for the end of the workweek. 
Temperatures will be slightly warmer than normal for this time of 
year through the extended period with highs in the low to mid 70s 
and lows generally in the 50s.

.DISCUSSION...Quick update to bump up max temps for today across
Northeast TN and Southwest VA. Hourly temps have been running a
few degrees warmer than the forecast. This, combined with sunny
skies and latest LAMP guidance warranted the adjustment. Tweaked 
temps across other areas as well but NETN and SWVA were raised the
most, 2 to 3 degrees on average. Also tweaked sky cover for the 
rest of the day to slow progression of incoming clouds out of 
Middle TN. Area of showers moving into Middle TN should dissipate 
before they reach us as we still have very dry air in place, 
dewpoints are still in the mid to upper 20s. Will send out new 
zones for temp adjustment.

.SHORT TERM...

Did a quick update to remove the Freeze Warning wording from the
zones and other products as we have warmed above the freezing 
mark. Temperatures will continue to climb this morning and 
afternoon under mostly sunny skies, so it should be a fairly nice 
day across East TN.

Looking upstream, there is a weak wave bringing rainfall to
portions of Middle TN. Latest hi-res guidance has this wave
weakening prior to reaching the Cumberland Plateau, so will leave
our western zones PoP-free for now and monitor for later this
afternoon.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...An upper level ridge will be on
the move from the plains states into the eastern third of the
nation through the period with a trailing deep upper trough. The
gradient of pressure between these two systems will allow for a
strengthening southerly flow; initially aloft, but a returning
southerly component will also develop closer to the surface a
little later in the period. This will keep a few clouds around;
especially later this afternoon into the overnight hours.
Temperatures should still be able to reach Wednesday's maximums
or a little warmer today while mins will be a little above this
mornings readings thanks to the southerly wind direction. 

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...A mid/upper level ridge 
axis will be shifting east of our area to start the period, 
allowing a deep SW flow to develop. We will remain capped on 
Friday and Friday night, but precip will begin to approach from 
the west on Saturday as a closed low moves into the mid MS Valley 
region. Scattered showers may develop near the Plateau on Saturday
afternoon, but the majority of synoptic lift enters Saturday 
night as the low moves into the lower OH Valley. A negative tilt 
to the upper low and a LLJ near 50 kts will give a chance of 
thunderstorms overnight. The NAM tracks the upper low across the 
KY/TN border while the GFS takes it north of the OH River. In 
either case, we should see decreasing rain chances through the day
Sunday. 

We will have a brief dry period on Monday between systems, and 
without a strong push of cold air expected behind the departing 
system, temperatures on Monday will be quite mild in the 70s. GFS 
and ECMWF generally agree on an open shortwave trough moving from 
the Plains into the TN Valley on Monday night and Tuesday. Chance 
PoPs will be continued for these periods, with a dry day expected on 
Wednesday as high pressure builds into the area.

.DISCUSSION...
Forecast is on track at present time. Temperatures starting out
were about a degree or two lower than previously fcst. Also
decreased cloudiness early in the overnight but still expect 
increasing cloudiness later tonight across much of the southern 
two thirds of the area. Therefore continue to believe that 
current freeze warning is on track. Additionally, with persistent
low level winds expected to maintain for the overnight, do not 
plan to introduce a frost advisory at this time. Latest MOS 
guidance continues to fall in line with this solution as well.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...Surface high pressure over 
the Great Lakes Region will shift east and southeast, as the upper 
ridge to our west edges east.  Flow over our area will turn more 
southerly, allowing some moisture return.  Expect an increase in 
clouds overnight, then expect some decrease in clouds again during 
day Thursday.  Biggest question will be need for any freeze warnings 
or frost advisories tonight.  Right now appears portions of 
Northeast TN and Southwest VA that are in the freeze program will 
get cold enough before clouds move in to warrant a freeze warning. 
Will not include frost further south as expect too much cloud cover 
and in many areas a light wind will be stirring.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Tuesday night)...Thursday night 
through Saturday morning...High pressure off the east coast will 
continue to move out in to the Atlantic. At the same time...a low 
pressure system over the Great Plains will approach the mid MS 
Valley. Our area being between the high and low pressure...SW flow 
will increase beginning Friday morning...bringing an increase in 
warm and moist air advection. Temperatures Friday and Saturday will 
be several degrees warmer than normal...and cloud cover will 
increase along with the moisture advection. 

Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon...the low pressure will 
begin a sharp N to NE climb towards the Great Lakes with another low 
pressure system and associated trough developing in its wake. A 
boundary that approaches the area Saturday afternoon will cause 
scattered showers and thunderstorms to develop in areas generally 
south of I40...moving to the north. Instability is low and winds 
will be fairly unidirectional and gusty through the midlevels. PW 
values are above normal for this time of year...especially in areas 
south of I40. With the atmospheric profile...not expecting any 
severe threats to be low. However...gusty winds and flooding rains 
could be a concern...especially with the flow moving parallel to the 
boundary...storms could easily train over the same area causing the 
flooding. 

Sunday night through Tuesday night...The low pressure will move off 
to the NE...with only a slight chance for light scattered lingering 
showers over NE TN and SW VA through Sunday night. Behind the low 
pressure...flow continues from the S and SW...with the moisture and 
warm air advection continuing. Temperatures will remain several 
degrees above normal. The next low pressure system and associated 
trough will move through the area Monday afternoon through Tuesday 
night...keeping scattered showers over the area each period.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
In the wake of the cold front clouds will scatter out by late
morning leaving mostly sunny skies. Breezy northerly winds will
commence especially after clouds clear and will persist into the 
afternoon before dissipating after sunset. Daytime high 
temperatures will be noticeably cooler than yesterday and a 
couple of degrees cooler than seasonal norms.

Overnight, high clouds are expected to increase which may pose a
challenge when it comes to freezing temperatures over NE TN and SW
VA. Current forecast has freezing temps mentioned in these areas
however if cloud cover is more dense, then those freezing
temperatures may never be realized. Will hold off on issuing a
freeze warning for these areas and let the following shift examine
the potential of a freeze. In the meantime, will mention the
possibility of freezing temperatures in the hazardous weather
outlook this morning.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...
Surface high pressure will be across the Mid Atlantic and 
Appalachians on Thursday, with a dry NW flow through the mid and 
upper levels. The eastward progression of the ridge starts to 
turn the low level flow to a southerly direction, but moisture 
appears too limited and shallow to warrant any PoPs on Thursday. 
Dry conditions and a warming trend will continue through Friday 
night as an amplified mid/upper ridge makes its way east across 
the region.

With the ridge to our east and a closed low tracking from the Plains 
to the mid MS Valley, moisture will be increasing on Saturday. A 
shortwave trough extending from the closed low will provide some 
lift for rising PoPs through the day Saturday, with likely PoPs 
Saturday night as the negatively-tilted trough moves through and the 
LLJ picks up to 40-50 kts. The trailing cold front remains north of 
our area as the low-to-midlevel flow remains S to SW, so we will 
remain in the warm sector with mild temperatures and slight chance 
PoPs into Monday. Another low pressure system develops over the 
Plains and tracks along the front into the Ohio Valley. This will 
bring an increase in rain chances for Monday night/Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM (This Evening through Wednesday)...HRRR model
continues to show confidence in an area of convection moving east
southeast across the area late this afternoon/early evening,
mainly along and south of interstate 40. Strong 300 mb jet over 
the Ohio Valley will place east Tenessee under the favored Right 
entrance region of the jet. This forcing with increasing 
instability will produce severe thunderstorms. The dry air in the
mid-levels (DCAPE up to 1200 J/kg and DCP values near 3) combined
with good hail CAPE (values near 1000 J/kg and SHIP up to 2.5) 
will set the stage for damaging winds and large hail. 

Main threat remains over southeast Tennessee and southwest North
Carolina. Timeframe for severe weather is between 20-23Z. Give the
hail/wind parameters, hail sizes up to Golfball size and wind
speeds to 70 mph are possible.

Forcing will move east of the area this evening with only showers
anticipated by 03z, then dissipated around 06Z. Afterwards, plenty
of the dry air to clear sky out for Wednesday morning.

Severe thunderstorm Watch will be out soon.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday Night through Tuesday)...
Long term starts out dry as slow moving cold front finally pushes
through the area. Models are in fair agreement that the boundary,
just south of the area will continue to slightly elevate pcpn 
chances over far SE TN and all of our SW NC counties through 
Thursday. 

Middle level ridge amplifies across the area Friday into Saturday 
with daytime highs climbing about 10 degrees above normal by 
Saturday. Models are in fair agreement on the strength and location 
of the next low pressure system Saturday and Sunday, although ECMWF 
is a bit more progressive with the frontal boundary pushing it 
through the area by Sunday evening while the GFS is much slower. 
Current POP fcst is a blend of both solutions which brings in higher 
POP by Saturday afternoon and holds onto those POPs until overnight 
Sunday. Based on current models and ensemble fcsts, suspect greatest 
pcpn chances will likely be on Sunday.

A secondary system begins to move into the area pretty quickly 
behind the weekend system on Monday. Once again models remain in 
fair agreement on the track of low center and associated cold front 
with our area falling under a broad area of low pressure out ahead 
of the front and continued chance for showers and maybe a 
thunderstorm Monday and Tuesday as the front seems to stall across 
the area late in the period. With steady low level warm advection, 
area will likely see daytime high temperatures remain at about 10 
degrees above normal for the early part of the new work week.

hail will be possible at CHA. 

HRRR model shows confidence in an area of convection moving east 
southeast across the area late this afternoon/early evening. Strong 
300 mb jet over the Ohio Valley will place east Tenessee under the 
favored Right entrance region of the jet. This forcing with 
increasing instability will produce strong thunderstorms. The dry 
air in the mid-levels combined with good hail CAPE will set the

.DISCUSSION...Overall forecast still on track. Have bumped up 
temperatures a degree or two through the early afternoon to 
account for mostly to partly sunny skies and increased warming 
through the late morning. Scattered strong to severe thunderstorms
are possible beginning late afternoon mainly in areas south of

plenty of instability will allow strong updrafts. As the evening

.AVIATION...A cold frontal boundary will be ever so slowly
slipping south across the Great Valley through the day. Showers
and thunderstorms will be developing along the boundary's western
extension through West Tennessee during the day and by mid to late
afternoon, the leading edge of this convective development will be
building across Southeast Tennessee impacting cha. Perhaps some of
this action will affect tys by early evening with little impact as
far north as tri. While there will be some strato cu ceilings
around this morning, don't believe they will be low enough for
mvfr. However, late today into the evening, there is a chance for
some mvfr ceilings and visibility reductions in thunder showers
and fog. Would expect much of the convective rain to end at cha by
03z and tys by 05z.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Thursday night)... 
A frontal boundary is located from SW KY across central KY, then 
curves southward along the Plateau between CSV and TYS. A NW flow 
through the midlevels will gradually push the front southward today, 
and a vort max in the flow will aid in convective development near 
the front this afternoon. In the warm sector, the RAP shows MLCAPE 
exceeding 2000 J/kg, so the instability will be sufficient for a 
threat of severe storms south of I-40. Shear is modest but 0-6 km 
shear values in the 30-40 kt range should support some rotating 
updrafts. High CAPE and low WBZ heights (around 10 kft) point toward 
hail as the primary threat, with damaging straight-line wind 
potential too. The HRRR and RAP suggest a timing window of the 
greatest severe potential of 19-23z. 

The front continues to push south on Wednesday, and high pressure 
shifting east across the Great Lakes will build into the area.
Temperatures will trend cooler, with highs Wednesday in the mid
50s to mid 60s, and some northern areas near freezing Wednesday
night. On Wednesday night, the 850 mb flow shifts back to a more 
southerly direction, creating some isentropic lift across our 
southern half into Thursday. The NAM is far wetter than the GFS 
this period, and may be overdone, but some low to slight chance 
PoPs will be added to Wednesday night and Thursday.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Monday)...
Typical, active spring pattern to continue across the forecast 
area during the long term period. However, we should be able to 
squeeze out a dry start on Friday as the amplified pattern brings 
an upper level ridge through the southeastern states. Increasingly
warmer and more humid air builds into the Southern Appalachians 
Saturday through Saturday night ahead of a relatively strong upper
trough which should move into the Midwest and Eastern Great Lakes
later Saturday night into Sunday. The upper feature will be 
dragging a cold front into the forecast area during this timeframe
with showers and thunderstorms becoming likely overnight Saturday
into Sunday with some instability noted in the models. The front 
should be east of the region by Sunday evening. However, the upper
level flow remains southwesterly behind the weekend system with 
more warm and moist advection developing ahead of yet another 
frontal wave during the first couple days of the work week. 
Therefore, held onto some chance pops for showers at the end of 
the long term. The good news in the extended is the warming trend 
that will take temperatures back above normal for late March with 
highs in the low to mid 70s and lows in the low to mid 50s.

.DISCUSSION...Area of showers and storms currently moving
southeast out of Middle TN will continue to approach the Central
and Southern Plateau, as well as portions of the Southern TN 
Valley over the next few hours. Instability gradient just off to 
our west so these storms will begin moving into a more stable air
mass very shortly. This is reflected in latest HRRR and RAP runs 
as both of these models show this activity weakening and then 
dissipating as it moves into our CWA. Have decided to introduce 
slight chance and chance POPs across the aforementioned areas to 
account for the remnants of this activity moving in. POPs are all
west of I-75. Another round of showers and a few storms are 
dropping south out of KY but this activity should mainly stay 
north of our area, expect our Southwest VA counties, where POPs 
are highest overnight into tomorrow morning. Updates to forecast 
were mainly for the activity moving out of Middle TN and to tweak
hourly temps and dewpoints. Rest of forecast on track. Will send 
out new zones to account for POP adjustment.

UPDATED FOR LONG TERM DISCUSSION

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)... 
A 850-700 mb shortwave trough over MI/WI/IA is progged to track 
SE across the Ohio Valley today and reach the central Appalachians
this evening. Ahead of it, a 850 mb theta-e gradient/warm front 
will cross the area this morning, and associated isentropic lift 
will bring broken clouds for most of the morning and early 
afternoon. Warm advection and partial sun today should bring temps
into the 60s in most spots, with lower 70s near CHA. The best 
lift and moisture with the trough stays north of our area closer 
to the upper jet, but we will see increasing moisture and 
instability through the day as the theta-e axis shifts south into 
KY/SW VA. Precip chances will rise across northern areas this 
evening but will keep coverage scattered due to limited moisture 
and fairly weak lift in our area - the categorical POPs of the GFS
MOS seem overdone. Elevated instability will be present and 
warrant a mention of isolated thunderstorms tonight.


.LONG TERM (Tuesday Night through Monday)...
Front will be slow to progress Tuesday night becoming nearly 
stationary across the area. Ample deep moisture, model PWs at 
about the 90th percentile, coupled with potential training of 
storms along the boundary and we could see some isolated heavy 
downpours during the overnight. Current flash flood guidance 
across much of the area is at roughly 1.5 inches in an hour and 2 
to 2.5 inches over three hours. Latest model QPF guidance seems to
be indicating highest pcpn amounts on the order of an inch or so,
therefore would expect mainly localized flooding issues to be 
possible in this event. Also, south of the front, over the 
southern third of East Tennessee and SW Virginia, instability 
Tuesday night remains a bit elevated with CAPE values of 500-750 
J/kg. This, along with sufficient shear could lead to a few 
organized thunderstorms and some possible training thunderstorms 
across this area, mainly during the first half of the overnight.

After some residual POPs from the slowly moving front on Wednesday, 
we then dry out across the area into Saturday. At the same time, we 
will once again start to warm above seasonal normals for the weekend 
and beyond. Next frontal system moves into the area Saturday 
increasing POPs through Sunday before pushing east of the area on 
Monday. With warming temperatures, some model indicated instability, 
and increasing shear with the approaching system on Saturday, 
prospects of some strong thunderstorms are possible Saturday and 
Sunday with this next system.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...A band of convection currently
moving through the Ohio Valley will work into the Central
Appalachian area this evening. The tail end of this convection
will brush across northern areas of the MRX CWA during the rest of
the afternoon and evening hours. Then...the frontal boundary the
convection developed along will slowly drop south and move into
the Southern Appalachian Region during the short term. Additional
convection is expected to form along the frontal boundary for
scattered showers and thunderstorms moving through the area
Tuesday morning. With increased low level moisture and daytime
heating...the air mass across the region will become marginally
unstable Tuesday afternoon. Additional convection is expected to
develop for the afternoon hours and a stray storm could become
strong or potentially severe. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...Front will be knocking on 
our door by early Tuesday with precipitation chances continuing 
ahead of the front. Front will struggle to continue moving south 
during the day on Tuesday and will likely act as the focus for 
convection over our area as the day progresses. Along and south of
the front we will destabilize enough to where we could see strong
to possibly severe storms in our area. Forecast soundings are 
showing 1000-2000 J/kg of CAPE available with the higher amounts 
further south in Southeast Tennessee/Southwest North Carolina. 
There is a moderate amount of shear in the mid to low levels to 
work with as well south of the front. Right now the environment 
south of the front looks to support hail and strong winds as the 
primary threat in the strongest storms on Tuesday. As the sun sets
and the front continues to push south storms will transition to 
rain showers overnight and slowly diminish as we move into 
Wednesday.

After the rain ends a slow warm up will begin the second half of the 
work week and into the weekend. There will still be some moisture in 
the atmosphere over us during the time, but there appears to be no 
major forcing that would allow it to precipitate. Better chances for 
precipitation will come with our next system, a low pressure system 
and cold front expected to quickly swing through at the end of the 
weekend into early next week. Currently the models are actually in 
decent agreement that precipitation chances will ramp back up on 
Saturday evening and continue through Sunday night. They do however 
differ on the exact track of the associated low and how much 
instability we will have to work with, but right now it looks like a 
decent chance that thunderstorms will accompany this system.

.AVIATION...A short wave along a cold front will continue to track 
across the Ohio Valley today.  The associated convection will push 
across the Ohio Valley and into Central Appalachia. This feature 
will bring mid and high clouds into our area this afternoon with 
continued VFR conditions and winds remaining less than 10 KTs. The 
main band of convection should stay to our north...but northern 
locations...mainly around TRI...will begin to see associated 
scattered showers and possibly a few rumbles of thunder reach into 
the area during the afternoon. Overnight...as the cold front 
advances towards the Southern Appalachian Region...clouds will 
increase and scattered showers will move into northern areas with 
local MVFR to IFR conditions possible towards morning...winds should 
remain light.  A stray thunderstorm will be possible but this 
activity should be quite isolated and will not mention in TAFs at 
this time. The front will continue to push toward the area on 
Tuesday and in advance of this feature...will see additional shower 
and thunderstorm activity begin to increase with areas of low clouds 
and MVFR to IFR conditions at TRI for the end of the TAF period.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
A 850-700 mb shortwave trough over MI/WI/IA is progged to track SE
across the Ohio Valley today and reach the central Appalachians
this evening. Ahead of it, a 850 mb theta-e gradient/warm front 
will cross the area this morning, and associated isentropic lift 
will bring broken clouds for most of the morning and early 
afternoon. Warm advection and partial sun today should bring temps
into the 60s in most spots, with lower 70s near CHA. The best 
lift and moisture with the trough stays north of our area closer 
to the upper jet, but we will see increasing moisture and 
instability through the day as the theta-e axis shifts south into 
KY/SW VA. Precip chances will rise across northern areas this 
evening but will keep coverage scattered due to limited moisture 
and fairly weak lift in our area - the categorical POPs of the GFS
MOS seem overdone. Elevated instability will be present and 
warrant a mention of isolated thunderstorms tonight.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...
Front will be knocking on our door by early Tuesday with 
precipitation chances continuing ahead of the front. Front will 
struggle to continue moving south during the day on Tuesday and

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Monday/...
Drier air continues to filter into the region this afternoon,
which has helped to significantly erode the low stratus in place
over much of the valley this afternoon (with the exception of far
northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia). Clouds should 
completely dissipate by the mid to late evening as high pressure
settles in. This will lead to good radiational cooling after
sunset. As a result, some areas across portions of SW VA and NE TN
may approach or drop just below freezing. Have opted to go with an
SPS for now given the very close call on things. However, we will
be monitoring conditions overnight and could adjust to a Freeze
Warning for a few counties if it seems warranted. Most areas that
do drop below freezing will experience this briefly (only an hour
or so). For Monday, warm southerly winds will increase ahead of a
disturbance moving in from the west. This, along with plenty of 
sunshine for most of the day will warm the region about 10 degrees
higher than last night in the mid 60s to lower 70s. Clouds will 
stream in from the west late in the day ahead of the next storm 
system, but this should have little impact on heating. 

.LONG TERM /Monday Night through Sunday/...
A area of light showers will continue to move across the region 
(mainly for areas along and north of I-40 through the remainder of 
the evening hours). A cold front will then sweeps south into the 
region between 00-03z, bringing a line of strong showers to the 
region. This activity will gradually drop south to the I-40 corridor 
around 06z, and then areas to the south between 06-12z. QPF totals 
will be around 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch in some areas given the 
slightly heavier precipitation and the slow moving nature of the 
storms. Drier air will quickly filter into the region in wake of the 
front after 12z, with significant clearing going on by 15z. The 
combination of WSW flow and ample sunshine will warm the Valley into 
the mid to upper 60s. Late in the period -- clouds will filter into 
SW VA and far NE Tennessee ahead of the next frontal boundary. 
However, the forecast will remain fry through 00z.

.DISCUSSION...
The low clouds that oozed south in wake of the frontal passage
this morning have begun to slowly break-up with the onset of
mixing and solar heating. A cool, NW flow will continue through
the day which will help to counteract somewhat the heating from
the sun in the afternoon. However, have gone a few degrees above 
MOS given the longer daylight hours. Do think lower 50s will be 
common across the northern valley, with mid 50s to around 60
degrees being common across the central and southern Valleys.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
The closed upper low over the Mid Atlantic region will continue to
track southeast through the day. As it moves farther away, the 
cold midlevel air that has maintained clouds and a few light 
showers in our northeast sections overnight will depart, and we
should have mostly sunny skies area wide by the afternoon. A deep
northerly flow with 850 mb cold advection will result in cooler
temperatures today, with highs in the 50s in most spots. Tonight,
clear skies and calm winds will allow temperatures to drop into
the 30s, with some Valley locations potentially falling below 
freezing.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...
A couple of warm days on Monday and Tuesday ahead of the approaching 
front will lead to temperatures 5-10 degrees above normal. The front 
will move through during the middle of the week and help to act as 
the main focus for shower and thunderstorm activity in our forecast 
area. Best chances for precipitation will be along and ahead of the 
front, but models are disagreeing with how far south to bring the 
front and how fast to bring in the next system and push the boundary 
out of our area. During this timeframe there looks to be enough 
instability to warrant the mention of thunderstorm chances through 
the middle of the work week. All the models do agree that a second, 
and stronger system, should move through late in the week/into next 
weekend and bring another round of showers and thunderstorms. Timing 
and strength differences of the associated low pressure system leads 
to lower confidence in at the end of the forecast, but all models 
agree that thunderstorms will be present at some point or another.

counties now. Strautocumulus will likely fill into the northern
half of the area tonight and erode on Sunday. Will have some 
light POPs in the northeastern zones with light QPF as well. Next 
to no snow with this system as the cooling will be too slow for 
how fast the air will be drying. Just a couple of high elevation 
places in the northeastern mountains that have 0.1" in the grids

will remain in control through Monday for a quiet and dry beginning 
of the extended.  With plenty of daytime sunshine...Monday afternoon

will still be slowly pushing south across the area Tuesday night for 
widespread...likely showers.  With the warm temperatures in 
place...should see all rain.  A few showers will linger over the 
area Wednesday as the boundary drops to our south.  Models then 
bring the front back north across the area as a warm front around 
the Thursday time frame as a slight chance of showers push in from 
the south.   Should be between systems for Friday with another 
system moving in around Saturday.

.AVIATION...
Weak Cold Front moving through the area now with showers ahead of
it. Looks like the showers are already far enough east to allow
not including them in this set of TAFs. Breezy winds should pick
up for the rest of the afternoon. Moisture from NW expected to
fill in and have a ceiling at KTRI and KTYS overnight. LAMP Guidance
had 4SM HZ at KTRI late tonight, but think that NW wind will keep
things stirred up enough to prevent that.

.DISCUSSION...
Cold front oriented NNE-SSW now moving through western parts of
the area...about to head into the valley from the plateau. Showers
developing along front and showers will likely increase as daily
heating kicks in some more instability. Will not have thunder in
the forecast for this afternoon at this time--instability very
limited and after about 18z, the surface focus shifts to the
Carolinas as a lee trough continues to strengthen. Think shower
coverage along the front may increase until about 18z, then fade
as the focus leaves the area. By focus, mean that pre-frontal
winds will veer to westerly component in our area, resulting in
less and less convergence along the front. Winds should be breezy
this afternoon, but below advisory criteria. Max Temp forecast
remains about the same for today.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Current precip associated with a shortwave trough and jet entrance
region will be exiting the area early this morning, with drier air
aloft working its way in from the NW later this morning. However,
the surface front lags behind, and will not move through our area
until the afternoon. Low level moisture preceding the front and
falling midlevel temps under the closed upper low will help
regenerate showers and possibly an isolated thunderstorm in the
early afternoon, mainly in northern sections. SW VA and NE TN
remain under the influence of the closed low through tonight,
which will keep isolated showers going. The delay of the surface
front until the afternoon will allow temps to reach the 60s in
most spots, and around 70 south where there will be greater
clearing. It will be breezy today as a surface low deepens over
VA and some clearing enhances boundary layer mixing, but it should
stay below wind advisory levels. The current wind advisory will be
canceled as current obs do not support it continuing. 

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...
Generally quiet weather to end the weekend and begin the work 
week as a ridge starts building in from the west and dry air 
continues to move in from the northwest. Warming trend continues 
for the first few days of the long term portion of the forecast 
leading to our warmest day on Tuesday where high temperatures will
top out in the 60's (and possibly even the low 70's in Southeast 
Tennessee). The next system that will bring a good chance for 
widespread precipitation will be a cold front diving in from the 
north Monday into Tuesday. Warmer temperatures ahead of the front 
will allow us to become unstable enough to where we can see 
showers and thunderstorms along and ahead of the front. Models are
forecasting for the boundary to bog down near the Gulf Coast and 
depending on the exact location of the boundary we could see some 
isentropic lift leading to continuing rain chances into the second
half of the work week. Boundary will then eventually get pushed 
east of us to make way for our next system (a front quickly moving
in from the west) which current models have moving in Saturday 
into Sunday.

Showers with a few isolated thunderstorms will continue moving
south across the area overnight. Mainly VFR vis and cigs have 
been observed despite the rain, but conditions are expected to
drop to predominantly MVFR to IFR in the next few hours based on
upstream conditions over KY that will be spreading south. A cold
front is expected to cross the area during the late morning hours,
which will raise vis and cigs back to predominantly VFR, with
clouds becoming scattered in the afternoon. With clearing, winds
will become gusty today. An upper level trough dropping across WV
will bring an increase in clouds at VFR levels after 00Z at TRI

.DISCUSSION...The right entrance region of the upper level jet
will continue to produce divergence aloft over the region. The
upward forcing will also maintain a strong low-level jet with
850mb winds of 40-50kts. The boundary layer jet will also produce
good isentropic lift over the area. This lift along with elevated
instability above 800mb will produce isolated/scattered
thunderstorms.

Due to the strong low-level jet, will issue a wind advisory for
the Smoky Mountains through mid-morning.

Have a good night.

.DISCUSSION...Main concern is convection, including thunderstorms, overnight.
Convection will reduce visibility to IFR conditions at times. 
Greatest at TRI between now and 06Z, TYS between 03-08Z, and CHA 
between 05-10Z. For TYS and CHA, storms may produce gusty winds 
since the low-level jet is strong (850mb winds of 35-40kts).

Ceiling will drop to IFR conditions as well at all TAF sites between 
08-13Z. Upper jet producing the forcing will move east of the area 
early Saturday morning with drier air moving back into the region.
Flight conditions will quickly become VFR by mid-morning Saturday.
Main concern Saturday will be increasing westerly winds between 14-
20kts sustained with gusts up to 30kts.

Strengthening of the right entrace region of the jet over the

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Saturday/...
An area of light showers will continue to move across the region 
(mainly for areas along and north of I-40 through the remainder of 
the evening hours). A cold front will then sweeps south into the 
region between 00-03z, bringing a line of strong showersto the 
region. This activity will gradually drop south to the I-40 corridor 
around 06z, and then areas to the south between 06-12z. QPF totals 
will be around 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch in some areas given the 
slightly heavier precipitation and the slow moving nature of the 
storms. Drier air will quickly filter into the region in wake of the 
front after 12z, with significant clearing going on by 15z. The 
combination of WSW flow and ample sunshine will warm the Valley into 
the mid to upper 60s. Late in the period -- clouds will filter into 
SW VA and far NE Tennessee ahead of the next frontal boundary. 
However, the forecast will remain dry through 00z. 


.LONG TERM /Saturday Night through Friday/...
Saturday night...cooler...drier air with northwest flow aloft 
will filter in behind an exiting cold front. An upper low to our 
north will rotate in minimal low level moisture with the upslope 
flow. A few isolated light showers and even a few flurries may 
develop over far northern locations and eastern mountains. Little 
to no snow accumulation is expected over high elevations. The rest
of the area will remain dry. Surface high pressure will build in 
on Sunday and Monday for dry conditions and abundant daytime 
sunshine will allow afternoon temperatures to warm to near normal 
levels. Will transition back to an unsettle weather pattern for 
Monday night and Tuesday as a cold front moves in and becomes 
stretched across the area. Weak instability could create 
widespread showers and a slight chance of thunderstorms Monday 
night. With the continued frontal boundary across the 
area...expect to see widespread showers and a slight chance of 
thunderstorms continuing over the region through Tuesday. The 
temperatures profile looks warm enough for an all rain event. A 
few showers will linger into Tuesday night and Wednesday as the 
frontal boundary slowly slides south of the area. Model 
consistency drops by the end of the extended and confidence become
quite low. However...current trend is for the boundary to quickly
rebound back across the area around the Thursday/Friday time 
frame as a warm front for another round of showers.

Scattered light rain showers have moved into the region this 
morning a little earlier than expected. QPF will be very light,
with only a few hundredths of accumulation expected. Another 
round of more widespread, heavier showers is generally expected to
move into the Northern Plateau around 18z or so, and across 
northern tier portions of the region (along and north of I-40) 
through 00z time period. Some isolated to scattered activity is 
expected Knoxville and points south, but QPF amounts will be lower
with this through the remainder of the period. in fact, some 
places across the far southern Plateau and Valley may not see a 
drop. The expected precipitation and cloud cover will help to 
suppress temperatures this afternoon -- but the warm air 
advection taking place should warm us into the 50s areawide by the
afternoon.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Saturday)...
Clouds will be spreading into the area over the next few hours
from west to east, but for most of the day, moisture will be
confined to a thin layer around 850 mb. Precip onset this
afternoon will be pushed back a few hours from the previous
forecast based on the latest model trends. Isentropic lift will
increase after 18Z, producing some light QPF through the mid to
late afternoon, mainly in northern sections. Deeper moisture and 
better lift, associated with the upper jet nosing into western KY 
and a surface convergence zone, will result in higher PoPs area 
wide and moderate rainfall tonight. Passage of the surface front
and mid/upper trough axis occurs Saturday morning, and rapid
drying/clearing should follow. A surface low develops in the lee
of the Appalachians in VA, which may cause breezy conditions
across our area Saturday afternoon. 

.LONG TERM (Saturday Night through Thursday)...
Behind the front we will get drier northwest air filling in along
with a ridge of high pressure moving in from the west. We still 
could see a few places in far Northeast Tennessee/Southwest 
Virginia and along the Southern Appalachians get below freezing 
Saturday/Sunday night, but most locations in the valley will stay 
above freezing. A slow warm up will begin with locations getting 
around, or just above, normal temperatures by Monday. Another 
front will dive in from the north on Monday into Tuesday and bring
a round of showers and possibly thunderstorms. Temperatures will 
get knocked back a few degrees but we will rebound quickly, 
returning to near normal temperatures by Thursday. Our next system
looks to be a cold front moving in out of the west next weekend, 
just beyond the end of the 7-day forecast.

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Friday/...
High pressure will gradually slide east of the region overnight,
but a mostly clear sky will prevail in most areas. This, combined
with the dry air at the surface will allow temperatures to drop
well below freezing over much of east Tennessee, southwest
Virginia, and southwest North Carolina, In the meantime, clouds
will very gradually stream into the region ahead of the next low 
pressure system. They may make it the Southern Plateau and Valley
late tonight, which should help to keep them just above freezing.
However, widespread frost is expected to develop, so a Frost
Advisory has been issued to account for this. On Friday, a front
will slowly move it's way into the region during the early
afternoon, bringing with it dense cloud cover and some scattered 
to eventually widespread rain showers during the afternoon. The 
cloud cover and rain chances will keep temperatures down some -- 
but southwesterly winds should help things get into the 50s to 
perhaps lower 60s in a few spots. 

.LONG TERM /Friday Night through Thursday/...
A cold front will move through the Southern Appalachian Region 
Friday night for likely to categorical pops. Temperature profile 
should be warm enough for all rain. The front will slowly pull out
of the area on Saturday with precip ending from northwest to 
southeast. The upper low will rotate through to our north on 
Saturday night and could pull in a few light rain showers or 
possible a few flurries late in the night. We will be between 
systems Sunday and Monday. The next system will move in Monday 
night into Tuesday bringing a cold front through for another round
of showers. A few showers will linger over the area Tuesday night
and with cooler air moving in...northern locations and higher 
elevations cloud see a mix of rain and snow. A warm front then 
moves north across the area Wednesday night and Thursday for 
another chance of showers.

.DISCUSSION...
A quiet day across the region with a surface ridge promoting sunny
and dry conditions. A cold, Canadian air mass still lingers this
morning, with temperatures that bottomed out in the mid Teens to
lower 20s at sunshine. Solar heating will help warm temperatures 
above freezing by 15z, so will let the current Freeze Warning 
expire then. Then, ample sunshine and winds gradually veering 
more to the southwest will help push the mercury into the mid 40s
to lower 50s by the afternoon. High cirrus may begin to move in by
the evening hours ahead of the next upper-level disturbance
moving in from the south.

417 AM EDT Thu Mar 16 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
High pressure will remain in control today with mostly sunny
skies. Will let wind chill advisory and freeze warning ride
through late this morning with current air temps in the upper
teens to mid 20s across the Tennessee Valley. Already seeing some
temperatures in the single digits along the spine of the Smokies,
so it will not take much wind at all to drop wind chills below
zero. Temperatures will rebound after sunrise and highs should
reach the 40s and lower 50s across most of the area under
abundant sunshine. (The exception again will be the higher 
elevations where temps will remain in the upper 20s to 30s. 
Surface high pressure slides east tonight, and mid and high clouds
will gradually move in, ahead of our next weather system. 

.LONG TERM...(Friday through through Wednesday)...
Next upper low dives SE out of Canada on Friday then off the Middle 
Atlantic coast by Saturday. Models in fair agreement on timing of 
the associated surface system which will drop into the area by 
Friday evening with fropa by Saturday afternoon. Timing of pcpn 
arrival ahead of the front now looks to be late enough that chances 
for any frozen pcpn in NE TN and SW VA will be very low as even the 
higher terrain should have enough time to warm up before it starts. 
Similarly, latest model runs indicate that moisture is long gone 
before the low levels can cool down enough for any snow showers 
behind the front. However, will still keep some light snow showers
and flurries in fcst for Saturday night over highest elevations 
of SW VA and NE TN during that time as at least SREF and GFS 
continue to show some pcpn in those areas overnight. 

Upper ridge then builds back across the area by Sunday night before 
next system begins to flatten out that ridge by Monday afternoon. As 
pattern becomes broadly zonal across much of the eastern US on 
Tuesday, models are indicating an east to west frontal feature 
draped across the area through Tuesday night that could keep weather 
unsettled and increase pcpn chances into Wednesday morning.

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
346 PM EDT Wed Mar 15 2017

.SHORT TERM /Tonight through Thursday/...
A cold, northwest wind will continue reinforcing a bitterly cold 
arctic air mass. The combination of a clear sky and this cold air 
will allow temperatures to plummett after sunset well below 
freezing -- eventually bottoming out into the mid teens to lower 
20s across the Valley. A freeze warning is in effect to address 
this potential for a widespread, killing freeze. In addition, 
winds along the East Tennessee Mountains will remain in the 10 to 
15 mph range, and combined with bitterly cold air cause wind chill
values to drop to dangerously low levels in the -5 to -15 degree 
range. By late morning these products will expire as temperatures 
warm due to solar heating. A warmer day is expected as highs will 
peak in the 40s to lower 50s. 

.LONG TERM /Thursday Night through Wednesday/...
The cold pattern continues over the eastern states as yet another
upper trough builds southeast out of the central Canadian 
provinces Friday into Saturday. A cold front will accompany the 
feature and most of the precipitation will be in the form of rain 
showers; however, if the precip moves in too fast on Friday, the 
low level airmass may be too cold in the higher terrain for rain 
so will have to mix in a couple snow showers and then at the end 
of the event as the airmass is drying out on Saturday night, there
may be another couple flurries. Dry northwest flow and ridging 
keeps the forecast area dry Sunday into Sunday night. However, the
upper trough and cold front moves into the area later Monday 
night into Tuesday with some more rain showers followed by a 
another period of dry cold advection on Wednesday.

to the subfreezing surface temperatures, a quick 1/2 inch to inch
of snow accumulation is possible underneath these bands over the 
nest couple of hours. Given the very localized nature of this 
activity -- a Special Weather Statement is in effect until 17z to
account for the potential slick travel spots. As drier air 
filters into the region, lingering cloud cover and precipitation 
will dissipate by midday. This will result in a sunny, but very 
cold day across the region. Temperatures will struggle to climb 
above the 35 to 40 degree mark in most of the Valley -- with 
above freezing temperatures not expected until early afternoon. 
Thus, will continue to the Freeze Warning until this time period.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Still seeing some bands of snow showers on radar early this
morning across mainly SW Virginia and NE Tennessee. Some bursts 
of heavier snow are possible in these bands, and a dusting of snow
is possible on some roadways across SW Virginia for the morning 
commute. Bands should fizzle out later this morning. Surface high
pressure builds across the area today, and cloud cover will
decrease from southwest to northeast throughout the day, but it 
will remain cold with temperatures struggling to reach freezing by
noon. Highs today will vary from around 40 degrees in the 
southern TN valley to the mid 20s across the higher elevations. 
The brisk northwest wind will continue and even increase a bit 
today as daytime mixing occurs. Temperatures drop back down below 
freezing after sunset tonight and once again will bottom out in 
the upper teens to lower 20s.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...
Models are in relatively good agreement on the timing of the next 
frontal boundary for Friday Night and Saturday. Only difference is 
that NAM remains a bit slower than both GFS and ECMWF regarding 
onset of any precipitation. Currently tending toward NAM soln for 
pcpn timing overnight Friday into Saturday based on the low level 
dry air that looks to remain anchored across the area at least into 
Friday afternoon. Once front moves through by Saturday evening, 
expect another cold surge, albeit not as potent as the current air 
mass, into Sunday morning. With temperatures falling below freezing 
overnight Saturday and Sunday highs expected to be about 10 degrees 
below normal, residual moisture could fall as snow by Sunday 
morning. This snow event would be confined to the higher elevations 
of SW VA and NE TN with no accumulations expected, as most of the 
moisture is gone prior to the cold air arriving. Beyond Sunday, next 
frontal system drops into the area Tuesday with increasing pcpn 
chances through the day Tuesday and into Tuesday night ahead of the 
actual frontal boundary.

.DISCUSSION...Widely scattered snow showers are still occurring 
across much of the forecast area early this evening as seen on
traffic cameras in Knoxville about an hour ago. Cold air advection
with NW flow coming off the Great Lakes is streaming south across
much of KY and TN. These showers may drop a tenth or two of snow
before moving on but no significant accumulations are expected. 
Updated forecast to add a few more hours of snow showers to 
central sections of the area. Also temperatures have already
dropped into the 20s to about freezing already so already updated

.SHORT TERM (Today into tomorrow)...
Overcast skies have helped to keep temperatures down today, and 
light precipitation continues to wrap around the low off the east
coast. This very light precipitation will likely continue in at 
least parts of our area overnight and into early tomorrow. Since 
this is a weak northwest flow event locations in the valley will 
likely only see a few drizzles of rain or a few flurries in the 
sky with no accumulation on the ground. Some locations in the 
higher terrain could see some very slow and light accumulations 
today into tonight, with possibly a couple of inches at the peaks 
of the mountains. Tonight will be very cold as the air continues 
to funnel in from our northwest and we get some clearing of the 
clouds overnight. With the lower temperatures we saw today I have 
gone ahead and made the freeze warning begin a couple of hours 
earlier than the previous issuance. Temperatures during the day 
tomorrow will likely be similar to what we experienced today.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
Models are in decent agreement overall, although still 
differences in the details. Forecast confidence is about average 
for this time of year. Will be very cold Wednesday night and a 
freeze warning will be needed, but will not issue at this time to 
avoid confusion with headlines. Will keep mention in HWO. Will see
some moderation of temps Thursday, then moisture will start to 
return on Friday ahead of next frontal system. GFS very fast with 
precip return even bringing light precip north Thursday night, but
will lean toward slower NAM/ECMWF solutions given the dry air in 
place near the surface. Front pushes through Friday night/early 
Saturday along with showers, then another batch of colder air will
move in behind the front. This colder air will not be quite as 
cold as this most recent cold outbreak, however. After a dry 
Sunday, moisture will return again early in the week ahead of yet 
another frontal system.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)... 
Latest water vapor and RAP upper air analysis shows potent upper 
level low over the western Great Lakes with a very strong 
shortwave trough over Eastern GA this morning. As the Great Lakes
low drops further SE into Western PA by tonight, the shortwave 
trough will move rapidly off the East Coast to help deepen the 
sfc low associated with the Northeast Blizzard today. 

At the surface, cold front that is ushering in some of the coldest
temperatures yet this winter is beginning to approach the TN-NC 
border this morning. As such, the best deep moisture is now 
shifting east of the area. However, a few potent shortwave spokes 
rotating around the Great Lakes upper low coupled with wrap around
moisture from the deepening East Coast bomb will continue to 
squeeze out some valley rainshowers and higher elevation
snowshowers through the day today. Pcpn will primarily be found in
valley locations north of I-40 and in elevations above 3000 ft
everywhere in the area. Although valley locations may see some 
evening and overnight snow in showers, no accumulation is
expected. All pcpn winds down by Wednesday morning with 
accumulations of up to 1-3 inches still possible in the higher 
elevations of the Smoky Mountains and SW VA through that time.

Temperatures tonight will drop into the lower 20s and upper teens 
across much of the area putting the overnight lows in the top 10 
for this winter season. As for record low territory, not gonna 
happen. It was 15 March 1993 that saw lows of 11, 6, and 1 in 
Chattanooga, Knoxville, and Tri-Cities respectively behind the now
infamous Super Storm. Either way, we are looking at a solid freeze
across the area tonight.


.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...
Models are in good agreement for much of the extended period. 
Main story is cold conditions continuing through Friday morning. 
Daytime temperatures Wednesday will struggle to reach the mid 30s 
in places. Temperatures will drop well below freezing most nights.
Freeze warning will be needed for Wednesday night with 
temperatures dipping into the teens, but to avoid confusion with 
active winter weather advisory and Tuesday night's freeze warning,
will wait until a later shift to issue. Temperatures will rebound
by Friday, with southwest flow ushering warmer, more moist air 
into the region. A cold front will approach the area Friday 
evening into Saturday, bringing the next chance for rain showers. 
Temperatures should remain above freezing during this frontal 
passage, but a wintry mix is possible later Saturday across SW VA 
and NE TN as the system exits the area and cooler air filters back
into the area on a northwest wind. The weekend should be pleasant
with mostly sunny skies and highs in the 50s. Monday will be even
warmer, with highs in the 60s and increasing cloud cover, ahead 
of the next approaching system.

343 PM EDT Mon Mar 13 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
A cold front will move through the area tonight and bring a round
of rain and snow to the area tonight. Generally we expect to see
snowfall amounts above 3000 feet, but can't rule out a few
flurries in some of the lower elevations. System is moving through
a bit faster than previously forecasted which would trend towards
seeing more rain than snow in our area. A winter weather advisory
is in effect for the mountain zones of the Southern Appalachians
tonight into tomorrow. Snowfall could accumulate a few inches
overnight, especially above 3000 feet. Cold and cloudy conditions
will continue through tomorrow with highs expected to top out in
the 40's across much of the area. Wrap around moisture could
continue to bring light snowfall to the higher terrain into
Tuesday/Tuesday night.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Monday)...
Models in good agreement early with some divergence of solutions 
late, but overall forecast confidence is above average for this 
time of year. Main story will be the very cold conditions for the 
early part of the period. Will be some lingering snow 
showers/flurries into Tuesday night, and temps will drop well 
below freezing entire area. Given high confidence will go ahead 
and issue a freeze warning for all areas in the freeze program 
from midnight Tue night until noon Wed. Wed will be quite cold for
this time of year, then another very cold night expected Wed 
night. Temperatures will remain well below normal until Friday, 
when the next front will be approaching with a chance for showers.
This front will bring somewhat colder air back into the area, but
not as cold as the first round. Once any lingering showers end 
Saturday, will go dry for Sunday and Monday.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Tuesday)...
Yet another rather potent late season winter storm will effect our
area through the period. System is expected to bring primarily
cold rain into the East Tennessee Valley while portions of SW
Virginia and higher elevations in East Tennessee will likely see
accumulations of up to 4 inches with this event. Models are in
surprisingly good agreement on the track and deepening of this
system off the east coast on Tuesday. Consequently, models are
also in fairly good agreement that initial and subsequent wrap
around moisture that will allow for an extended period of frozen 
precip mainly across our higher elevations until very late on 
Tuesday. Although we are in an airmass producing temperatures well
below normal, guidance continues to suggest Valley locations will
remain warm enough to make this an all rain event. However, higher
elevations will certainly see accumulations during this extended 
event. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Sunday)...  
Upper low over the eastern Great Lakes will keep Northwest flow 
across region Tuesday night with snow showers mainly higher 
elevations with light accumulations to continue. Lower elevations 
may see a few tenths across northeast Tennessee and southwest 
Virginia. NAM model moves moisture out quickly Tuesday evening while 
GFS and European hold onto it through the night. Skies will clear 
from southwest to northeast as the night progresses and temperatures 
will drop into the teens and 20s. Have kept temperatures close to 
extended guidance MAV numbers. Lingering cloud cover and strong NW 
Winds may keep temperatures up across Northeast Tennessee and 
southwest Virginia. An arctic air mass will move in from Canada 
Wednesday with frigid temperatures for this time of year. Highs will 
struggle to reach 20 in the high mountains and be only mid 20s to 
mid 30s northeast and upper 30s to lower 40s southeast. Cold air 
advection will continue overnight Wednesday night with another hard 
freeze. Lows will be in the teens to lower 20s areawide. Thursday 
upper trough begins to shift east with much warmer temperatures in 
the mid 30s to upper 40s but still well below normal. Friday morning 
will be the last cold morning below freezing lower 20s to lower 30s. 
The cold high pressure area will shift east and clouds increase 
ahead of a cold front. Temperatures will warm more to the mid 40s to 
mid 50s. A brief period of snow is possible northern sections early 
Friday but no accumulation expected. The cold front will move 
through the eastern Tennessee valley Saturday with higher pressure 
moving back in Sunday. Temperatures over the weekend will stay 
warmer in the 50s to lower 60s....

.Short term (tonight and tomorrow)...

High pressure and mostly clear skies will be present through the 
early morning Monday. Low temperatures overnight will be below 
normal for this time of year...though will struggle to get much 
below freezing in many areas. Will keep the freeze warning going 
overnight...though low level winds will shift to the southwest 
early Monday morning behind the high pressure...starting to bring 
advection of warmer and more moist air to the area. 

A low pressure system will approach from the NW...causing scattered 
showers to begin by late morning/early afternoon. Little to no 
instability is expected...with dry mid and upper levels...so only a 
few tenths of an inch rainfall accumulation is expected. 
Temperatures Monday will be in the mid to upper 40s...several 
degrees below normal.

.LONG TERM... 

Cold and cloudy weather will continue tomorrow 
night as the front/low sweep through and move east of us. 
Precipitation chances will continue during this time, but most 
places will likely just see rain. In the valley temperatures near 
the surface should remain warm enough to see all liquid, but we 
could see some decent accumulations in the higher elevations of 
the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Can't rule out a little bit of
light snowfall in some of the northern valley locations during 
the coldest parts of the night, but overall it looks like 
temperatures will remain warm enough that the vast majority of the
population just sees rain with this event. Wrap- around moisture 
could help continue very light sprinkle/flurry chances in far NE 
Tennessee/SW Virginia (mostly the higher elevations) through 
Tuesday night, but most places will see precipitation end by mid 
day on Tuesday. 

Cold air will continue to pour in from the northwest leading to 
several very cold days/nights, with the coldest temperatures all 
week expected on Wednesday/Wednesday night. Temperatures will likely 
be in the 20/30's during the daytime and drop down into the teens 
overnight. We will see a slow warming trend towards the end of the 
work week ahead of our next system. Timing is still off with the 
models for this next system, but they generally agree that we should 
be warm enough to see only rain outside of the mountainous areas. We 
will finally warm up to around normal temperatures at the end of the 
weekend with some places seeing 60 on Sunday.

National Weather Service Morristown TN
441 AM EDT Sun Mar 12 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Current radar trend indicates that last significant band of snow  
is moving eastward along the TN-GA border into NC-SC this 
morning. Further north there are some radar bands moving across
the Central Valley, but any snow there is really struggling to
reach the ground in such dry low level air. Current dew points 
are into the single digits across NE TN and into the lower teens 
across the Central Valley N of I-40 this morning. 

Was able to cancel the winter weather advisory for NW counties in
the advisory area as only an additional chance of flurries exists
in the dry air surge southward. Will let the southern tier
counties along with the mountain zones expire on time with snow
already on the ground in those areas and an additional light 
dusting possible before the event ends at 12Z. 

After this late winter system moves out this morning, forecast
calls for unseasonably cold and dry through tonight ahead of yet
another late winter system. With overnight temperatures dropping
quickly under clear skies tonight, will need yet another freeze
warning for all of the Central Valley northward as well as SW NC
and some portions of the Southern Plateau where temperatures will
drop to below 30 degrees (about 10-15 degree below normal) by
early Monday morning.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...
Continued cold weather this week as upper trough stays over eastern 
third of the country. Next system to spread clouds and precipitation 
from Monday through Wednesday. Also a cooling trend through mid week 
as upper low over Quebec on Monday drops south and southeast toward 
the mid atlantic Wednesday. At the surface a low pressure area over 
Missouri Monday morning and cold front will quickly move into the 
Tennessee Valley by evening. With cold temperatures early Monday as 
precipitation starts there may be a little snow mixed in before 
temperatures warm ahead of the front. Rain will spread in from west 
to east with light snowfall amounts only at the highest elevations 
of east Tennessee. Monday night as temperatures cool aloft behind 
front higher elevations may see a couple inches of snow from 
southeast Tennessee north into southwest Virginia but temperatures 
in the lower elevations will stay in the mid to upper 30s with no 
accumulations expected. Tuesday and Tuesday night as the upper low 
drops south and southeast. Higher elevations will see more snow with 
Northwest flow aloft but lower elevations will be to warm Tuesday. 
Lower elevations in the northeast sections may see a few tenths of 
an inch of snow Tuesday night and early Wednesday before the upper 
low shifts east and northeast. Then on the back side of the system 
much colder air will bring lows down into the teens and 20s early 
Wednesday and Thursday. Also even as skies clear Wednesday highs 
will only reach the 30s to lower 40s...and 20s in the mountains. 
Temperatures begin to warm Thursday back into the 40s...30s higher 
elevations. Late Friday another system will drop southeast from the 
northern Plains. This system will be warmer as temperatures Friday 
and Saturday will be in the upper 40s and 50s. Precipitation will 
stay as mostly rain. A little snow is possible in the higher 
elevations overnight Friday night into Saturday.

.Discussion...It will be an active night weatherwise with two main 
weather concerns.  First...cold air continues to push into the 
region and overnight lows will once again fall below freezing across 
most locations.  A freeze warning remains in effect for all but the 
far southern areas tonight.  Also of concern is a weak winter 
weather system advancing across the area.  With the cold air in 
place...weak lift and increasing low level moisture...a mix of rain 
and snow earlier this evening has transitioned to all snow for 
tonight. The main band of snow is expected generally south of I-40 
and along the east TN mountains.  Lower elevations north of I-40 can 
expect generally less than an inch though a few areas could see up 
to 2 inches possible.  Locations south of I-40 can expect 1 to 3 
inches of snow. The higher elevations of the east TN mountains could 
see 2 to 4 inches.  A snow advisory is in effect for the southern 
areas and the higher elevations.  No significant changes expected in 
the current forecast...will update to remove evening wording.

304 PM EST Sat Mar 11 2017

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Sunday)...

Overcast clouds and scattered light precip through the day has 
kept temperatures across the TN valley and plateau from reaching 
in the lower 40s. With the lack of warming through the day...have 
gone with temperatures in the mid to upper 20s overnight. Will 
keep the Freeze Warning going from 12 AM EST through 10 AM EDT 
across the area where these temperatures will be several degrees 
below normal for this time of year. 

Tonight...the system will continue to move east...with scattered 
light rain showers expected through the evening. Colder air 
advecting in...combined with the sun setting...will allow for the 
scattered light rain to change over to snow. Light snow showers are 
expected through Sunday morning. Models are diverging on the exact 
position of this system through the early morning...though they 
are still keeping on to enough moisture and lift for snow 
accumulations...ranging from 1-2 inches in areas I40 and south. 
Areas in the higher elevations of east TN could see around 2-4 
inches as slight NW mid level winds will keep upslope flow over 
east TN. Have kept the Winter Weather Advisory going from 7 PM EST
tonight through 8 AM EDT Sunday morning.

Sunday...enough dry air will filter in behind this system for snow 
showers to end by mid morning. High temperatures on Monday are 
expected to warm quickly in to the mid to upper 40s as high pressure 
moves in for Sunday. 

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Friday)...

Main weather story will be the front and associated winter weather 
as it moves through our area. Believe that most of the populated 
locations will see minimal snowfall amounts as most of this system 
will hopefully be rain as the brunt of it moves through the forecast 
area on Monday night. However in the higher elevations of far 
Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia it might remain cold 
enough the the majority of the system falls as snow. If this does 
occur they could see several inches of accumulations in the highest 
terrain. Down in the valley amounts will be much less with a dusting 
to an inch likely in northeast TN/southwest VA. Confidence is still 
somewhat low as models are disagreeing with how much moisture to 
bring in ahead of the front. 

After this system moves through cold temperatures will remain 
through the rest of the forecast. Another system with the potential 
for winter weather will move in out of the west next weekend, but 
timing differences in the models make this one a bit tricky to feel 
confident about at this time.

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
405 AM EST Sat Mar 11 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today through Sunday)...
The forecast questions for the period is "How much snow and where
will  it fall?", both of which seem to trending downward and 
southward respectively. Latest few runs of all available models 
continue to trend towards less moisture and a more southern track.
Current guidance suggests a dusting to less than an inch north of
I-40 in the East TN Valley and Northern Plateau while areas 
further south may see an inch in the Valley increasing up to 2 
inches in the higher elevations of the the Southern Plateau. 
Additionally, areas in the foothills along the Appalachian 
Mountains of East TN and SW NC will likely see 1 to 3 inches total
with some isolated higher elevations seeing accumulations of up 
to 4 inches. 

Forecast confidence is fairly high with the timing of the snow
being  mainly in the 0-12Z time frame with best moisture centered
around 6Z tonight. Forecast confidence is somewhat lower on 
precise location of snowfall totals as the east to west 
orientation of the event sets up a rather sharp moisture and 
therefore snowfall gradient. In these situations...location is 
everything. A small shift north or south and the central valley 
could see 1 to 2 inches during the overnight with the southern 
third of the area getting a slightly lesser amount. 

One area where confidence IS growing would be the forecast for  
the Northern Plateau, SW Virginia, and NE Tennessee. These areas 
look like they will be out of play for this event. There is just 
no moisture available to work with and with consensus of models 
keeping moisture well south of that area for the event, would not 
expect a sudden shift that far north for best QPF. 


.LONG TERM (Sunday Night through Friday)...
Another cold night Sunday night with clear skies and light winds. 
Lows once again lower to mid 20s northeast Tennessee and southwest 
Virginia to upper 20s to lower 30s elsewhere. A low pressure area 
over the mid Mississippi Valley early Monday will bring moisture up 
from the south as low pressure along a cold front in the northern 
Gulf and another low off the Southeast Coast along the front deepen 
and begin to move northeast. As the low moves into the Ohio Valley 
late Monday precipitation will increase over the forecast area. 
There could be a little snow early before changing to rain...except 
the higher mountains. Accumulations will be light during the day 
Monday but could be a couple inches in the northeast Tennessee 
mountains. Monday night and early Tuesday as cold front approaches 
with surface low moving across the Ohio Valley and upper trough digs 
south. This will be the best time for accumulations. Temperatures in 
the lower elevations will be just above freezing so accumulation 
does not look to be significant. However higher elevations could see 
a few inches. Also as surface low moves northeast cold air on back 
side of low and with upper trough some upslope snow will occur 
Tuesday and Tuesday night and even early Wednesday across southwest 
Virginia. Temperatures will be cool Tuesday and will drop even 
farther early Wednesday into the upper teens to upper 20s. Snow 
showers linger across northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia 
Wednesday. Very cold high pressure builds down over the southern 
Appalachians Wednesday night and Thursday. Lows again 15 to 20 
northeast sections and 20 to 25 south half. Thursday highs only 30s 
mountains and parts of southwest Virginia to 40s elsewhere. Several 
degrees warmer Thursday night. Flow becomes more zonal by Friday 
with warmer temperatures but another weak system drops down from the 
northwest bringing in mostly rain.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast on track this evening with high pressure
temporarily in place. Clear skies will gradually give way to
increasing cloud cover late in the night in advance of tomorrows 
system. Lows tonight still look to bottom out in the mid to upper
20s across northern areas, upper 20s to low 30s for the Central 
Valley and southward. No major updates to forecast as most 
elements look spot-on. Only change was to adjust hourly dewpoints
downward as they fell a little quicker than previously 
anticipated. No new zones to be sent.

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
255 PM EST Fri Mar 10 2017

.SHORT TERM (This Evening through Sunday)...A ridge of high
pressure will settle into the Tennessee Valley and southern
Appalachians tonight. Dry airmass, clear sky, and light/calm winds
will allow temperatures to drop into the 20s with a hard freeze
most locations. Since Fruit trees and berries are susceptible to
freeze damage, a freeze warning has been issued for late tonight
and early Saturday morning.

Main forecast concern is a storm system coming from the central
Plains into the southern Appalachians late Saturday through early
Sunday morning. Models have been inconsistent with lack of run-
to-run continuity. The latest NAM is the most aggressive with the
GFS the least. Models show best chance of 4 inch snowfall remains
across the far eastern Tennessee Mountains, thus will continue the
watch there, but will hold off expanding due to lack of
confidence. Advisory snowfall possible elsewhere.

Another night of freezing temperatures/hard freeze most locations
by early Sunday morning.

For Sunday, dry air quickly returns with sky becoming mostly
sunny. 

For fire weather purpose, low afternoon relative humidity is
expected both Saturday and Sunday.

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Friday)...
Mostly clear skies on Sunday afternoon and high temperatures 
expected to be near 50 across most of the area will combine to 
help erode most of the snow that fell in the valley. But the sunny
skies and warming temperatures won't last for to long as our next
system makes it's way towards our area. A cold front will move 
out of the west towards the area and bring another chance for 
winter precipitation. There is model discrepancies with when the 
moisture and precipitation will start in our area. The ECMWF has 
the low off to our south much closer to the coast and brings 
moisture in sooner Tuesday morning leading to earlier and heavier 
snowfall. The GFS wants to keep the low further off the coast and 
holds back the moisture until the main precipitation band moves in
with the front. If this is correct we will likely be warm enough 
to where we see mostly rain, whereas the ECWMF solution would 
trend towards more snowfall than rain for our area. Best time for 
snow would be around the 00z time frame as that is when there is 
the most moisture available in the dendritic growth zone. However 
at this time temperatures might not have dropped low enough near 
the surface to produce snow unless the evaporative cooling helps 
bring the temperature down quickly. After 00Z drier air in the mid
levels moves in and dries out the dendritic growth zone leading 
to lower snowfall production potential from the atmosphere. At 
this time confidence is pretty low for this system since the 
models are unsure of how to handle the moisture over our area and 
since our temperatures for some places will be at or above around 
freezing at the surface for the time of best snowfall potential, 
this also lends towards a less confident forecast. 

Colder and drier northwest flow will set up behind the system 
leading to a continued period of below average temperatures for the 
second half of the work week. Another system moves in towards the 
weekend, but at this time it looks like temperatures will be warm 
enough that it should be mostly rain.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Convection has winded down for the night as left over showers 
make their way SE through the area this morning. Rainfall totals 
of up to one inch in heavy showers over NE TN and SW VA have 
caused some localized flooding issues, as per a spotter report. 
Based on pcpn trend, have issued a pair of urban and small stream 
advisories for those areas set to expire by 12Z this 
morning...although declining radar trend may allow for an earlier 
cancellation. 

Expect gradual clearing by this afternoon as the cold front 
currently extending SW from central West Virginia into NW Tennessee 
finally pushes east of the area by afternoon. Temperatures will then 
begin to fall by this evening, dropping to near and below freezing 
under clear skies across much of the area. A hard freeze is expected 
for SW Virginia, NE Tennessee and the Northern Plateau counties and 
a freeze warning has been issued for those areas. Elsewhere 
temperatures will teeter near freezing in a light overnight breeze. 
Guidance is split at around the freezing mark for the southern half 
of the area, therefore went with consensus for current fcst. A 
second look this afternoon may result in a greater southern extent 
to the freeze warning at that time.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...An active pattern for
the next several days as cold air mass from central Canada moves 
across the southeast Saturday while an upper level disturbance 
moves southeast from the mid Mississippi Valley then into the 
Tennessee Valley and across the southern Appalachians Saturday 
night and Sunday morning. NAM model is faster and much stronger 
with this system and forms a weak surface low across the southeast
states Saturday night into early Sunday. GFS Model trending a 
little slower with precipitation start on Saturday which would 
have temperatures warm more than NAM. Have kept highs closer to 
GFS/MAV numbers. For Saturday night lowered snowfall amounts first
6 hours and raised last 6 hours. Best chance for accumulations 
will be after sunset to mid morning Sunday. Have issued a Winter 
Storm Watch for the eastern Tennessee Mountains for 4 to possibly 
9 inches. Lower elevations of the valley and plateau are expected

Precipitation ends by late morning Sunday and skies clear. 
Another cold night Sunday night with lows mid 20s to lower 30s. 
From Monday through Thursday a cold upper trough digs south from 
the plains Monday bringing a chance of rain and snow during the

.AVIATION...Area of showers and thunderstorms making decent
progress toward the Great Valley early this morning and should
arrive at the terminals between 06-09z with continuation of some
showers behind the initial development all the way into mid 
morning as the system cold front swings southeast of the region. 
There should be a period of mvfr ceilings and visibility in the 
showers but would expect a return to vfr conditions around 15-19z.
The other thing of note is there will be a rather gusty westerly

.DISCUSSION...
MCS over far NW Tennessee will continue to move ESE across Middle
Tennessee and eventually into the Plateau and Central and Southern
Valleys between 06-08z per the latest runs of the HRRR and RUC.
Instability is extremely limited and with essentially no CAPE 
east of I-75. A strengthening 60 kt 850 mb jet between 06-09z per 
the NAM will help keep this line together into the region, with 
strong to marginally severe wind gusts possible, locally in the 
50-60 mph range -- and plenty of lightning. This activity will 
wane as it moves toward the mountains before exiting the area 
early Friday morning. Strong gradient winds are also expected 
ahead of the line along the Great Smoky Mountains where a Wind 
Advisory is in effect overnight into Friday morning.

.Short Term...(This Evening through Friday)...A strong upper level 
jet will move across the Ohio Valley overnight placing the Tennessee 
Valley and southern Appalachians under the favored Right Entrance 
Region. Strong and deep omega is noted over the region between 06-
09Z enhancing the fronto-genetic forcing along a cold frontal 
boundary. Forecast soundings show elevated instability, especially 
across TYS and CHA. 

Enough instability and strength of fronto-genetic forcing to produce 
a band of showers and thunderstorms early Friday morning. The strong 
upper level jet will also induce a low-level jet of 50-55kts, so any 
thunderstorms may have some locally strong/gusty winds. Small hail 
is also possible with the stronger storms across the southern half 
of the area.

Besides the storms, low-level jet will produce windy conditions over 
the higher elevations of the Smoky Mountains, so will issue a wind 
advisory there between 05-15Z Friday.

For Friday, scattered showers will end quickly as drier air moves 
into the region with sky becoming mostly sunny/partly cloudy during 
the afternoon. Much cooler air will be the rule.

.Long Term...(Friday night through Wednesday)...
Much colder air will continue to flow into our from the northwest
as we move into the weekend setting us up for some winter 
precipitation Saturday night into Sunday. A shortwave will be 
diving out of the northern Great Plains towards our area and a low
south of us tracks to the northeast. In addition there will be 
atmospheric divergence above us as we sit in the right rear 
quadrant of an upper level jet leading to another favorable 
synoptic ingredient. Precipitation will move in from the 
west/northwest Saturday night and will initially begin as rain for
most of the forecast area. As temperatures drop overnight it will
transition to snow...Forecast soundings suggest that the 
transition will come relatively quickly once temperatures drop low
enough and we should hopefully not really see much in the way of 
icy precipitation. With recent warm temperatures the ground will 
be pretty warm which could help melt initial snowfall... However, 
with this event occurring at night and some moderate to even 
briefly heavy snowfall the melting process on the surface could 
quickly end. There is a wide model spread when it comes to 
snowfall totals which leads to a decreased confidence in this 
aspect of the forecast. The NAM and the GFS are more bullish with 
snowfall amounts while the SREF and ECMWF are lighter. NAM/GFS 
have more moisture in the atmosphere to work with and also have 
moderate to heavy snowfall around midnight through the early 
morning hours. Have not bitten off on the higher amounts since 
model spread is pretty wide and with the (very few) winter events 
this year the GFS/NAM have tended to back off a bit as the event 
draws closer. Snow should quickly exit our area by midday on 
Sunday and we should actually be able to see the sun for a while. 

Another trough will swing through the northern part of the country 
and a front will sweep through Monday night/Tuesday. This will bring 
another round winter weather, but model differences on the timing of 
the track of this system make confidence pretty low for the Monday 
night/Tuesday system. We will dry out again after this second 
system, but the cooler temperatures will stick around through the 
end of the work week.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Friday)...Today will be another warm 
...dry day with surface high pressure in control.  Plenty of 
sunshine will push afternoon highs into the 60s and low 70s across 
the Tennessee Valley.  The warm temperatures combined with the dry 
air mass in place will bring relative humidities down to around 25 
percent again this afternoon.  We will then transition into a more 
active weather pattern tonight and Friday as a weak cold front moves 
through the region.  Clouds will begin to increase this evening and 
rain showers should move in around 06Z.  The showers will spread 
east across the area overnight for likely pops.  The rain will 
slowly exit from west to east Friday morning into early afternoon. 
Cooler air will move in behind the front and Friday afternoon 
temperatures will range from the mid 40s to mid 50s mountains to mid 
50s to mid 60s across lower elevations.

.LONG TERM (Friday night through Wednesday)...Models still showing 
differences run to run and between models for the Saturday/Saturday 
night system. Agreement is even poorer late, leading to below 
average forecast confidence especially for latter periods.  There is 
a fairly high level of model agreement that there will be some 
wintry weather for Saturday night as a weak low pressure system 
tracks by to our south and a short wave trough aloft swings across 
the region.  Cold air in place should allow much of the 
precipitation to be snow across higher elevations and far northern 
areas, with snow possible central and maybe even some snow mixing in 
before precip ends across southern areas.  Details of how much 
precip and precip type still hazy this far out however. Will keep 
mention in the HWO.  Drier conditions will return by Sunday 
afternoon.   Models disagree on next cold front/upper trough that 
will bring possibility of more precip to the area and another shot 
of colder air, with the GFS focusing more on Monday/Monday night and 
ECMWF/Canadian some 12 or so hours later.  For now will lean toward 
the slower solution and keep higher PoPs Mon night into Tue.  May be 
some snow at least higher elevations/north with this as well.  Will 
go dry for Wed.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

With dewpoints mixing out and temperatures climbing, RH values are 
currently around 20 percent across the area. Additionally, seeing
some wind gusts in the 20 to 25 kt range. Will continue to forgo 
a SPS or RFW due to the recent widespread rainfall. Current water 
vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a broad trough
across the CONUS with a more substantial shortwave trough across 
the Northeastern U.S. At the surface, a cold front is located 
along the Eastern Seaboard with high pressure across the 
Southeastern U.S. Further to the northwest, there is a cold front 
stretching across the Great Lakes region into the Central Plains. 
The surface high will shift to the east tonight with light 
southerly flow returning by sunrise. Lows tonight will range from 
low 30s to low 40s. Expect the coldest temperatures will be in the
sheltered valleys of NE TN and SW VA. 

For Thursday, will see the boundary to the north slow and may be 
even retreat some to the north across the Ohio River Valley. Warm 
air advection will take over in the low levels with high 
temperatures rising into the mid 60s to low 70s. Deep mixing will 
occur again on Thursday with RH values dropping down to around 25 
percent with winds of around 5-15 mph. These values are borderline 
for fire weather products. For now, will forgo a SPS but could see 
this being needed for tomorrow afternoon. 

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...

Forecast confidence is below average for much of the extended 
period with differences between forecast models and even 
individual runs of models. A cold front will swing through 
Thursday night/early Friday, bringing the chance for some showers 
for mainly the first half of Friday. Colder air will move in 
behind the front, then models show an upper trough swinging across
the area and a weak surface low moving by to our south late 
Saturday through early Sunday. While the system may initially 
start out as rain, thermal profiles suggest a quick changeover to 
snow after sunset Saturday night. Accumulating snow will be 
possible, especially north of I-40 and in the mountains. Areas 
south of I-40 may see some accumulating snow, but confidence is 
much too low at this point to indicate anything more than a 
rain/snow mix. It appears that the last few runs of the GFS and 
ECMWF have trended cooler, indicating a better potential for snow 
in our forecast area, but there's still plenty of time for finer 
details to change. Keep in mind, this event is still 4 days out, 
and the energy for this system is still out over the Pacific Ocean
where observing equipment for model initial conditions is sparse.
Details remain uncertain. Will continue the mention of possible 
snow in the HWO. System moves well east of our forecast area by 
late Sunday, and Monday looks dry. The main story for next week 
will be cooler temperatures, especially overnight, with hard 
freezes possible for a couple nights in a row. Another front with 
limited moisture is forecast to push through Monday night into 
Tuesday, and temperatures will remain cold enough overnight for 
some flakes to mix in at higher elevations.

.AVIATION...A cold front currently moving through the Southern 
Appalachian Region is producing scattered rain showers and increased 
winds across the TAF sites.  As the front exits the area overnight 
precip should end...clouds slowly move out and winds begin to 
decrease.  Local MVFR conditions will be possible through sunrise 
but this should be limited due to slightly elevated winds and drier 
air moving in.  By Wednesday mid morning through the rest of the TAF 
period...conditions will significantly improve with clearing skies 
and VFR conditions.  Winds may become breezy during the afternoon 
then decrease Wednesday evening.

.DISCUSSION...
Last of significant precipitation is just about through the area.
Some portions of the Smoky Mountains and SW NC will continue to 
see rainshowers over the next hour or so before it begins to 
taper off in those areas as well. With the passage of the pre-
frontal band of showers, winds have dropped considerably across
much of the area. Therefore canceled the wind advisory, although
wind gusts to 30 mph will still be possible ahead of the front
tonight. 

Presently, the cold front still lies to the west of the 
area approaching the Plateau counties. With deep moisture still
present across the area, a stray shower remains possible until
after frontal passage. However, have started to speed up
decreasing POPs west to east across the area for the remainder of
this evening and into the overnight. Front will finally push 
through the area tonight with clearing and drying behind it to 
start the day Wednesday.

Updated grids to reflect decreasing POP trend early this evening 
and overnight. Additionally tweaked temperatures, dewpoints, and
winds in line with latest observations.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...
Scattered showers continue across the forecast area with leading 
edge of more solid area of showers and embedded thunderstorms now 
moving across plateau. Stronger south to southwest winds in the 
Knoxville area have gusted to 35 to 40 mph. Winds with the storms 
expected to be about 30 to 40 mph along and ahead of the line. 
Temperatures have reached into the mid to upper 60s ahead of the 
main line and have dropped back down into the 50s on the plateau. 
Will keep chance of thunderstorms in for next few hours with main 
line and high rain chances. Wind advisory will be reissued for late 
afternoon into early evening. May be able to be cancelled early 
after storms move into the Appalachians. By mid evening showers will 
begin to taper off and winds will shift to to the northwest. Expect 
lows to be fairly uniform in the upper 30s to lower 40s. Wednesday 
higher pressure and mostly sunny skies with brisk west to northwest 
winds. Highs near to slightly above normal Wednesday.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
A ridge of high pressure and zonal flow aloft for Wednesday 
night and Thursday producing dry conditions and warm afternoon 
conditions. For Thursday night and Friday morning, a frontal 
boundary will move across the Tennessee Valley and southern 
Appalachians. Due to the persistent ridging into the Gulf of 
Mexico, this boundary will be moisture starved with only light 
showers anticipated. However, much cooler temperatures will spill 
into the Region as a cold airmass moves into the Ohio/Tennessee 
Valleys. 

Main concern for the extended is the potential of wintry conditions 
for southern Virginia, northern third of Tennessee, and far eastern 
Tennessee Mountains for Saturday night and Sunday. This is still 
several days out, but models show a strong 300mb jet moving across 
the Ohio Valley/mid-Appalachian region placing our area into the 
favored Right Entrance of the jet. Even though we have warm air 
advection at 06z Sunday, models show strong cooling of the 
vertical column which suggest strong forcing. 

Looking at the vertical cross-section, strong ageostrophic vertical 
circulation noted over the area so good diabatic cooling 
anticipated. Forecast soundings over southwest Virginia look snowy, 
so will need to watch over the next several days for the potential 
of Wintry conditions for Saturday night and Sunday (especially 
morning).

For Monday and Tuesday, zonal flow returns with another system 
possible.

.DISCUSSION...
Scattered showers are occurring across the region this morning in
moist air mass ahead of cold front moving into the lower Ohio
Valley and approaching the Mississippi Valley late this morning. 
The more solid area of pre-frontal convection should reach the 
forecast area by mid afternoon with more scattered activity late 
this morning and early afternoon. Winds are gusty in the higher 
elevations of the Appalachians this morning with gusts from 40 to 
50 mph continuing through the day. Have updated the forecast 
slightly in precipitation timing. Temperatures are generally on 
track to reach the mid 60s...possibly upper 60s south before 
steady rain starts. Then temperatures should steady out or may 
drop a little. Instability still looks to be limited but a few 
thunderstorms are possible especially southern areas mid to late 
afternoon. Gusty winds in the valley and plateau could reach 30 to
35 mph as well. Will update wind advisory shortly.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...A cold front will swing through 
the area late today/early tonight.  Widespread showers can be 
expected ahead of and near the front, so will carry categorical PoPs 
all areas with this system. Instability looks quite limited so while 
expect some thunder, chance for any severe storms looks minimal 
despite significant low level shear. However, a moderately strong 
southerly low level jet will bring windy conditions to the higher 
elevations and foothills along the east TN mountains, so will issue 
a wind advisory for these areas. Will not stray far from MAV temps 
overall.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...The extended will begin in a 
quiet weather pattern as surface high pressure builds in.  This will 
provide dry and warm conditions Wednesday and Thursday.  We will... 
then transition into an active pattern as the first of two systems 
moves in for Thursday night into Friday.  This first system will be 
the weaker of the two.  An initial band of showers should push

even a few thunderstorms expected for Friday.  Should see a brief 
break between systems Friday night into early Saturday.  There 
remains some question as to timing of the second system...though 
models are in reasonable agreement with midday Saturday into Sunday 
time frame. Deep moisture is associated with this system along with 
weak instability.  Therefore...expect widespread showers with a few 
rumbles of thunder possible.  Drier...cooler air should move in

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tuesday)...
A few showers were lingering across the northeast sections of 
Tennessee and Southwest Virginia at mid afternoon. Skies were 
mostly cloudy but a few breaks had developed across the southern 
part of the area. Temperatures had warmed into the mid and upper 
60s south and mid 50s to lower 60s north and northeast. South 
winds were beginning to increase with gusts to 25 mph at times 
southern valley and parts of the plateau. The drying and clearing 
trend will persist into the evening ahead of deepening low 
pressure system over the northern plains with trailing cold front 
that stretched south and southwest through the Plains states into 
west Texas. Overnight the pressure gradient will tighten with 
gusty winds on the plateau and higher elevations of the 
Appalachians but below wind advisory criteria. Models bring 
moisture back late tonight ahead of front which will be near the 
Mississippi River by then. Increase rain chances late tonight and 
gradually through the day Tuesday as front approaches. Instability
is fairly weak so expect some thunderstorms but only during the 
afternoon ahead of the front. NAM model shows strong thunderstorms
early Tuesday in west Tennessee then weakens line later in day as
it moves into middle Tennessee. GFS shows broader area of general
showers spreading in sooner in the day. Front will move into 
western sections by around sunset. Temperatures tonight again mild
upper 40s to lower 50s. Highs Tuesday lower to mid 60s with more 
clouds and rainfall. Rainfall amounts Tuesday from about 0.5 inch 
northeast to one inch southwest

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday Night through Monday)...
A cold front will sweep through the region on Tuesday night, 
bringing with it drier air into the region for Wednesday. As a 
result, rain showers will showers will taper off late Tuesday 
night, with a mostly clear sky expected for Wednesday morning. 
Winds will quickly veer back to the south and west for Wendesday. 
The warm southerly flow and dry air mass will promote some low RH 
values Wednesday/Thursday afternoons - but above critical levels. 
This will also result in warmer temperatures, with highs climbing 
back into the mid to upper 60s each day. Thereafter, a series of 
fronts will impact the region late this week into this weekend - 
bringing good chances for showers and thunderstorms. The first 
system will move through Thursday night into Friday, with a second
(stronger) cold front progged to move through late Saturday into 
early Sunday. Cooler conditions are expected in it's wake for 
Monday, with highs back into the 50s.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Patches of light rain/sprinkles 
associated with weak isentropic lift will diminish from south to 
north across the area today as forcing weakens and lifts north. 
Quite a bit of cloudiness will linger as mid level moisture remains. 
Much of tonight will be precip free, but some additional showers may 
begin to move in by late tonight as the next cold front draws 
closer. Winds will be gusty at times over some of the higher 
elevations and foothills tonight as southerly low level jet begins 
to strengthen. Temperatures will be well above seasonal normals.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)... A frontal system is still 
on target to move across the Southern Appalachians later Tuesday 
into Tuesday night bringing showers and a slight chance of a 
thunderstorm to the region. A period of dry weather; compliments of 
high pressure, will bring some sunshine to the area Wednesday and 
Thursday followed by a relatively weak short wave feature Thursday 
night into Friday. The wave doesn't appear to have a significant 
amount of moisture available for lifting, so maintained just chance 
pops for the development of a few showers here. A better chance of 
rain will be back in the forecast on Saturday with a more 
significant upper level trough and cold frontal passage. Used likely 
pops for the early weekend system. Max temperatures won't stray too 
far from typical early March norms while timing of this week's 
systems and their low level mixing abilities and cloud coverage may 
keep mins a few degrees above normal through a good deal of the long 
term.

Forecast update keeps the overall package the same with only a few
minor adjustment to some of the hourly weather parameters.
Reflectivities on radar are most likely not reaching the ground
with the drier air near the surface. This should change later this
evening and we will see some light QPF in scattered rain showers.
QPF amounts should be minimal, but if a particular locations 
picks up enough rain we could see some very patchy fog form. 
Expect the incoming clouds tonight to stay around tomorrow leading
to cooler temperatures than we experienced today.

Radar reflectivities are moving in from the southwest, but
precipitation is struggling to make it to the surface. We will
eventually see light showers tonight, which could cause brief MVFR
conditions, but confidence it to low on that occurring, so have 
VFR conditions at all sites through the TAF forecast. Rain will 
move out by tomorrow with mid level clouds sticking around.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Monday)...
The shortwave trough now over AR/LA will move across our area
tonight. Much of the rain ahead of this trough across AL and
eastern MS is not reaching the ground as the low levels remain
quite dry, and the onset of measureable precip in our area will 
likely be near midnight. Precip amounts should be light as lift is
weak overnight, probably less than a tenth of an inch in most
spots. The trough exits Monday morning. Behind it, there will be 
very little forcing or instability to produce rain showers 
through the day, although midlevel saturation remains and should 
give mostly cloudy skies. Thus, highs will be a bit cooler than
today, in the lower to mid 60s.

.LONG TERM (Monday night through Sunday)...
A brief dry period early Monday night as most of the energy 
associated with approaching cold front moving into the Mississippi 
and Ohio valleys stays far to the west and northwest closer to the 
front. Lows will be mild though...close to 50 degrees. Winds will be 
somewhat gusty on the plateau from the south at 10 to 15 mph with 
gusts to 30 mph. More steady rainfall in the form of showers will 
spread across the region Tuesday. The best instability and forcing 
will stay over the lower Ohio valley and western Tennessee Valley 
Tuesday then weaken or shift mostly south of the area by late 
afternoon and evening. The NAM model is hinting at some stronger 
storms developing over the southern part of the forecast area 
Tuesday evening but at this time not thinking severe. Will have high 
rain chances Tuesday and Tuesday night. Rain moves out Wednesday as 
high pressure builds in. Thursday will again be mostly sunny. 
Thursday night through Sunday pattern again becomes unsettled as 
front drops down from the north and northwest Thursday night and 
Friday with a few showers. This front may pass through but then 
stays in the vicinity Saturday into Sunday. A better chance for 
showers will occur Saturday night. A few storms possible Saturday 
afternoon and evening and again Sunday. The mild pattern continues 
with above average lows and highs through next weekend.

.DISCUSSION...
No changes are needed to the forecast this morning as all
parameters are on track with current obs. Surface high pressure 
to our east will provide a SW low level flow that will help 
temperatures warm into the 60s in the Valley. As the 500-300 mb 
ridge axis passes over the area, mid/high clouds will increase 
from the southwest through the afternoon. Weak isentropic lift may
bring a little light rain to the area tonight.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Moisture will gradually increase 
across the area during the period as the flow turns more southerly 
and increases.  Will see an increase in mostly high clouds today. 
Relative humidity values will again be quite low in the afternoon 
which may be of concern to fire weather interests, and although 
winds will be a bit stronger than yesterday they should again 
be on the light side. Appears there will be enough weak 
isentropic lift tonight to warrant slight chance to chance PoPs 
for some patches of light rain. Temperatures will be above 
seasonal normals and MAV temps look in the ball park for the most 
part.

.LONG TERM...(Monday through Saturday)...Still just a slight 
chance for a shower with warm and moist advection ahead of the 
approaching upper trough on Monday. However, likely to categorical
pops are appropriate for the system cold front on Tuesday. 
Doesn't appear to be a huge threat for convection with the frontal
push so just kept a chance for some thunderstorms across the 
southern half of the forecast area. Model forecasts not quite on 
the same page late in the period but was able to keep Wednesday 
through Thursday dry. A weak wave required the use of slight 
chance pops for showers Thursday night into Friday. Perhaps higher
probabilities for showers would apply at the end of the long term
period as another system builds east through the Mississippi 
Valley. No major chill is expected during the long term with 
temperatures near to slightly above normal.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...
With a dry air mass over the area, along with clear skies and calm
winds, low temperatures tonight will again fall below freezing in
many locations. With the precedent of issuing a SPS for freezing
temperatures having been set yesterday after discussion with the UT
Ag Dept...another SPS will be issued for tonight. 

The mid/upper level ridge axis shifts east of the area tomorrow,
which should allow for some high clouds to spread into the area 
ahead of a shortwave trough over TX/LA. A SW low level flow will 
bring some warm advection that will push temperatures into the 60s
for most of the TN Valley. 

.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Saturday)...
Ridge of high pressure will begin to shift to the east coast Sunday 
night and into Monday with moist flow off the Gulf bringing moisture 
back into the forecast area. For the first 24 hour period just 
slight chances for showers as main deep surface low moves into the 
northern Plains states early Monday. The main energy along and ahead 
of the front does not approach the eastern Tennessee Valley until 
Tuesday. Only weak shortwave energy ahead of the main system will 
allow for a few showers Monday morning and again late Monday night. 
NAM model slower with main system as compared to GFS. It brings a 
little rain Monday night and early Tuesday then holds off with more 
significant precipitation until Tuesday night. GFS brings rain back 
in Tuesday morning and has front coming through during the afternoon 
and decreasing overnight. Will keep high rain chances Tuesday into 
Tuesday night. Best chance for thunder in the southern part Tuesday 
afternoon. Improving weather Wednesday as higher pressure moves 
overhead. Mostly clear conditions through Friday with next system 
approaching Saturday with increasing rain chances. Temperatures will 
be at or up to about 5 degrees above normal.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...
The week starts out with relatively decent weather as an 
amplified ridge slides slowly east to the Eastern Seaboard by 12z 
Tuesday. There will be just a small chance for a shower across 
western sections of the forecast area through late Monday night. 
However, probability of precipitation in the form of rain showers 
will increase on Tuesday as a cold front makes progress across the
Ohio Valley and Mid South region. Kept a scenario going which 
includes at least a chance for convection across western and 
southern sections of the viewing area, but model forecasts do not 
depict a great deal of instability with this system at this time. 
Went closer to a faster GFS vs. ECMWF fropa which rapidly drops 
off pops Tuesday night in time for a dry Wednesday. In fact, was 
able to keep rain out of much of the remainder of the extended 
forecast with more ridging and dry advection. It looks like 
temperatures will be a few degrees above normal through much of 
the long term; with the exception of Wednesday and Thursday where 
maxes and mins will be near climatological normal for early March 
in the wake of the mid week frontal passage.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...
High pressure centered over OH will extend southward into the TN
Valley tonight, providing calm winds. A little thin cirrus may
pass over northern sections tonight but should have little impact
on falling temperatures. Lows tonight will be well into the 20s
across the area. While the recent warmth has allowed some
vegetation to bloom/bud earlier than normal, after consulting 
with the UT Ag folks, we will not begin our freeze program yet. We
will continue to see a warming trend into Saturday as the ridge
aloft builds east, and highs will reach the 50s across the lower
elevations. Low minimum RH values in the 20s and upper teens will
be a concern for fire weather interests, although winds will be
lighter compared to today.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)... 
Mostly clear and cold again Saturday night as cold high pressure 
still lies across the eastern Tennessee Valley and Southern 
Appalachians. Temperatures again will be near to several degrees 
below freezing. Winds begin to pick up from the south and 
southwest for some moderate warming. Highs mostly in the 60s. 
Moisture then on the increase Sunday night and Monday as another 
significant low pressure system develops over the Great Plains. 
Due to the dry air mass over the area now it will take until about
Monday night before there is significant lift to produce showers.
Models show clouds increasing Monday but only a few sprinkles 
possible Monday. Moisture will increase rapidly Monday night and 
Tuesday. Associated cold front with this system to move across 
Tennessee valley Tuesday and Tuesday night. There will likely be 
some thunderstorms ahead of the front with significant rainfall 
late Tuesday and Tuesday night. Behind the front Wednesday 
clearing skies may be slow as secondary low may form along front 
to the SE. As high pressure builds later Wednesday skies will 
become mostly clear and continue through the end of the week. 
Temperatures will stay near normal to slightly above normal 
through the end of the period.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...The brief snow showers and 
flurries across the north associated with the exiting cold front 
will end quickly today, followed by clearing skies as drier air 
moves in.  Surface high pressure will be in control this afternoon 
through tonight.  There will a few more clouds north tonight in weak 
isentropic lift as warmer air begins moving back in. Winds will be 
gusty from the west and northwest.  MAV temps look reasonable 
overall, so will stay close.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...The period starts out 
with a mostly sunny and dry weekend as seasonably cool surface high 
pressure slips from the Appalachians to the Atlantic Coast. However, 
another relatively strong storm system will be on the approach on 
Monday as a cold front presses east from the Western Plains into the 
Mississippi Valley by Tuesday morning. As warm and moist air builds 
in on a strengthening southwesterly flow through this period, 
increasing clouds and a chance for showers will creep back into the 
forecast.  The cold front will build closer to the region during the 
day Tuesday with a frontal passage early in the evening; closer to 
the faster ECMWF depiction of early week weather. There appears to 
be some instability available for thunderstorm development with this 
system, so maintained at least a chance for convection here. The 
region will have a chance to dry out Wednesday and Thursday with a 
prevailing northwesterly flow on the back side of the Eastern U.S. 
long wave trough. A modest warming trend will occur ahead of the 
early week front followed by a return to temperatures near, if not a 
few degrees below normal.

.DISCUSSION...

A reinforcing shot of cold air will move in tonight with a cold
front. Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis
indicates a broad upper level trough from the Northern Plains 
eastward to the Northeastern U.S. A shortwave trough is forecast 
to rotate through the Central and Southern Appalachians late 
tonight into early tomorrow. This trough along with the surface 
front will provide enough lift for a few light snow 
showers/flurries late tonight into early tomorrow morning. Model 
soundings indicate a brief period of low level saturation around 
200-250 mb deep across NE TN and SW VA centered around 12z. PW 
values increase to around 0.3 inches. Due to this, there was 
enough evidence to increase PoPs some late tonight into early 
tomorrow morning. Additionally, stretched them a bit further to 
the south with a few flurries possible as far south as Knoxville. 
However, the lack of moisture and the brief window will lead to 
trace amounts up to half an inch in the higher elevations in SW VA
and extreme NE TN. These values are below thresholds for any 
winter weather products. Additionally, will forgo an SPS with 
amounts more than a dusting being limited to the aforementioned 
higher elevations.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...
The channeled vort max on the western side of the Eastern
Canada/Conus longwave trough will be dropping into the Ohio
Valley/Ern KY/WV tonight. Models agree that it will squeeze out
some precip in SW VA after midnight and into Friday morning, but
they differ on how much and the timing. The NAM and GFS depict
over one inch in Wise and Russell counties. This seems a bit
too high given the lack of moisture that will precede the system,
and its fast movement. Less than 0.1 liquid QPF seems more 
realistic, which is what the SREF shows. Will have some light snow
accumulations in SW VA and NE TN mountains, but less than 1 inch
max.

Veering 850 mb winds behind the exiting shortwave trough will
reenforce cold advection across the area tomorrow. As a result, 
highs should be a few degrees colder than today, in the upper 40s 
to mid 50s. It will be breezy as well, with 10-20 mph W-NW winds,
which combined with RH in the 20-30% range in the afternoon, 
could cause some concerns for fire interests. 

.Long Term (Friday night through Thursday)...
After cold temperatures Friday the mercury will tumble down into 
the 20s with another killing frost. High pressure in southern 
Canada today will settle over the eastern states friday night and 
early Saturday with clear skies...a dry airmass and light winds 
for ideal radiational cooling. A quick warmup will resume Saturday
with highs 5-10 degrees warmer than Friday. Winds switch to the 
southwest Saturday. The high pressure area shifts east with 
continued warming into the upper 50s to lower 60s. On Monday the 
surface high will be off the east coast. Increasing moisture with 
southerly flow off the gulf will bring clouds back and a slight 
chance of showers Plateau and southern valley. Monday night and 
Tuesday best rain chances with some instability Tuesday increasing
risk for thunderstorms. Precipitation will end early Wednesday as
cold front moves east of region. Decreasing clouds later 
Wednesday as higher pressure moves back in and continues Thursday.
Temperatures will be near to a few degrees above normal for the 
period Monday through Thursday...mostly upper 50s to mid 60s at 
lower elevations.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Much quieter weather expected today with colder and drier air
behind the front. Even with the rainfall from the storms the dry
air will help keep dew points low and fog away tonight. High
temperatures will be about 15 degrees cooler today compared to
yesterday, and overnight low tonight into tomorrow will be
near/just below freezing across our forecast area. A weak
secondary front tonight could bring enough energy and moisture to
cause some light snow in Southwest Virginia. Currently think that
any accumulations would be minimal as there is little moisture to
work with and it will move in and out of our area very quickly, so
PoP chances are pretty low in the forecast.

.Long Term (Friday through Wednesday)... A weak shortwave will pass 
through Thursday night into Friday, bringing in a secondary push of 
colder air., With some very limited moisture in place over SW 
Virginia, would not be surprised to see some isolated snow showers 
early Friday morning. However, not expecting any appreciable 
accumulation other than a light dusting in a few spots. The cold 
northerly flow will make for a chilly day on Friday with 
temperatures 10-20 degrees below normal for early March. Highs on
Friday will struggle to climb out of the 40s in most places. High
pressure will slide into the region Friday night into Saturday, 
maintaining the dry weather -- with abundant sunshine expected for
the weekend and warmer temperatures as winds veer back to the SW.
The next opportunity for precipitation may be very late in the 
period on Tuesday into Wednesday as the next frontal system 
approaches the region from the west.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Thursday)...
The threat of damaging winds, hail, and isolated tornadoes will 
continue to the south of I-40 over the next few hours. Within that 
area, severe weather parameters indicate the southern Plateau and 
Chattanooga areas have the highest threat. The HRRR seems to have a 
better handle on the timing of storms than it did this morning, and 
it shows the severe threat winding down around 6 pm. Will include a 
pre-first period in the forecast to address the storms and severe 
threat. 

Obs show a few locations with winds near advisory criteria, so the 
Wind Advisory will be continued for the entire area until midnight. 
Wtih fropa occurring between 00z and 03z, winds will shift to the W-
NW, and decrease in intensity. Will end the wind advisory for all 
locations, including the mountains, at midnight. PoPs will also be 
dropped after midnight, with skies clearing as dry air aloft builds 
in. With a NW flow providing cold advection through tomorrow, 
temperatures will be much cooler, with highs in the upper 40s to 
upper 50s.

.LONG TERM (Thursday Night through Wednesday)...
Brief zonal flow on Thursday night will become northwesterly by 
Friday morning as a secondary dry cold front tracks through the 
area.  This will bring in another surge of cool...dry air for 
Friday/Friday night.  Highs on Friday will range from the 30s 
mountains to 40s and low 50s across lower elevations.  Lows Friday 
night will generally be in the 20s and lower 30s.  A ridge of high 
pressure will build in for the weekend in...beginning a warming 
trend and continuing the dry conditions.  The main system of the 
extended will be a low pressure system moving through the region 
Monday into Tuesday.  The main frontal passage on Tuesday should be 
accompanied by a line of convection.  Behind the system...another 
dry...cool air mass will push in for Wednesday.

.AVIATION...
Line of severe thunderstorms has picked up speed and will arrive a
bit faster than previously forecasted. Winds ahead of the front
will be breezy, and a wind advisory is in effect for all
terminals. Threats with the line are still the same with damaging
winds being the main threat, along with potential for large hail 
and possibly a tornado. Once the line hits, storms could last for 
a several hours before quickly moving out. Gusty winds will remain
behind the front due to the low level jet, but will eventually 
mix out during the overnight hours.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Currently seeing some patchy fog out there early this morning.
Some locations are starting to see the winds picking up ahead of
the approaching front and this is helping to blow away the fog.
Expect for winds to continue to increase as the front gets closer,
so am not expecting widespread dense fog this morning. Low level
jet over us will likely cause wind advisory criteria across the
area today, especially in the higher terrain. Wind advisory still
looks on track through today and into tonight until the front
sweeps through. 

Of course the biggest threat with this system will be the 
potential for severe weather midday today into tonight. With the
low level jet blowing we will see quite a bit of shear over us.
Combine that with the warm/moist air being pumped in from the
south and ingredients are primed to see some strong to severe
thunderstorms. Model forecast soundings are showing CAPE values
generally in the 500-1500 J/Kg range across our area. Hi-
resolution models are struggling a bit with the timing of when the
front will move into the plateau counties, but generally expect it
to move in late morning or early afternoon. With the strong low
level jet and lots of shear to work with the main threat with the
line of storms will be damaging winds. However, with moderate CAPE
values we also cannot rule out large hail or a few tornadoes in
our area.

Main line of storms should be east of our area by the evening
hours and definitely east of us before tomorrow morning. Overnight
lows behind this system will be much colder with some places
flirting with freezing temperatures tonight.

.Long Term (Thursday through Tuesday)...
Strong NW flow will result in the reinforcement of a colder, drier 
air mass behind the cold front on Thursday. There should be plenty 
of sunshine by the afternoon, but this will do little to help 
counteract the cold air advection taking place. Another weak 
shortwave will pass through Thursday night into Friday, bringing in 
a secondary push of colder air. Highs on Friday will struggle to 
climb out of the 40s in most places. High pressure will slide into 
the region Friday night into Saturday, maintaining the dry weather --
 with abundant sunshine expected for the weekend and warmer 
temperatures as winds veer back to the SW. The next opportunity for 
precipitation may be very late in the period on Monday/Tuesday time 
period, with just scattered showers expected.

Already some fog out there, and expect it to continue to get worse
as the night progresses. Eventually winds will pick up tomorrow
morning and quickly blow the fog out. A line of strong/severe
storms will move through tomorrow afternoon and cause dangerous
conditions until it passes. Have done the best with the timing of
the fog and the line of storms, but confidence in the exact timing
of both is relatively low at this time due to run-to-run model

336 PM EST Tue Feb 28 2017

.SHORT TERM (This Evening through Wednesday)...A jet streak moving
across the Ohio Valley has increased the isentropic lift over the
area producing widespread showers. Enough elevated instability to
produce scattered thunderstorms as well. This jet streak will move
east of the area this evening with decreasing convection chances.

Most of the night only a low chance of showers and possible
thunder. Main action will occur Wednesday afternoon/early evening.
A strong upper jet will move across the Ohio valley with an
another jet moving through the lower Tennessee valley. These jets
will produce divergence aloft of the region with good upper
forcing along a pre-frontal surface trough. 

This surface trough will move across during the area with the
airmass becoming sufficiently unstable (MLCAPES of near 1000
J/Kg) so widespread thunderstorms anticipated. Due to increasing
low-level jet in response to upper jet dynamics, the 850mb winds
increase to 60kts+. The strong low-level jet combined with mid-
level drying will set the stage for widespread damaging wind
event. Derecho Composite Parameter values above 1 are likely based
off SPC Ensembles.  

Enough speed shear to warrant a low chance of tornadoes as well
especially near any book-end vortices and/or notches. Marginal
severe hail is also possible.

The best time-frame for severe weather will be between Noon and 6
PM ET.

Besides the thunderstorms winds, strong low-level jet will produce
windy conditions tonight across the higher elevations and area-
wide for Wednesday.

.Long Term (Wednesday Night through Tuesday)...
The fast moving line of strong to severe storms will be exiting 
the area at the beginning of the long-term forecast and have PoPs 
coming to an end around 06z. Some of the model guidance is even 
quicker and could see an end to the rain chances closer to 00-03z 
Thursday if trends continue. 

Cooler and drier air will advect in behind the departing system. PW 
values will range from 0.1-0.2 inches on Thursday. These values are 
near the minimum observed for early March. The high temperatures on 
Thursday will be 15-20 degrees cooler than on Wednesday with highs 
generally in the 50s. A dry cold front will move through the 
forecast area late Thursday into early Friday bringing in a 
reinforcing shot of colder air. PW values increase slightly ahead of 
this boundary into the 0.2-0.4 inch range but it still looks too dry 
for precipitation. The latest model trends have shown precip. moving 
further south, potentially into SW VA, but have left the forecast 
dry for now. Low temperatures Friday morning will be just below to 
near freezing for most locations with the cold air advection. 
Adjusted highs down below guidance for Friday with the heart of the 
cold air advection overhead with forecast highs ranging from upper 
30s to low 50s. The coldest morning will be on Saturday with the 
surface high located overhead with ideal radiational cooling 
conditions. Expect a widespread freeze Saturday morning with lows 
ranging from the low 20s to the low 30s. 

Temperatures will moderate over the weekend and into early next week 
with a broad upper level ridge across the region. Highs will top out 
in the 60s for most valley locations Sunday and Monday. Rain chances 
will return late Monday as a warm front lifts northward across the 
area with another system approaching the forecast area near mid-week.

.AVIATION...
Main concern is timing of convection through the forecast period. 
First round is/will move across this afternoon/early evening. Main 
concern is reduced visibility to IFR conditions.

This area will move out this evening with return of VFR conditions 
until around 10Z at CHA where low cloud deck will return producing 
IFR conditions. 

For Wednesday, another round of strong convection will be developing 
late in the forecast period, but generally at 18Z. A squall line is 
likely for Wednesday afternoon with damaging winds the main 
concern.
IFR/LIFR low stratus and fog will continue at KCHA this morning as 
-RA eventually moves into the region from the SW along/ahead of a 
warm front. -RA will move into KTYS/KTRI by the late morning and 
early afternoon, dropping vis/cigs to MVFR/IFR levels at times.
Ceilings will lift some overnight as southerly winds will 
gradually pick up, limiting rain chances and improving vis back to

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
412 AM EST Tue Feb 28 2017

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
A warm front will move northeast into the region, coinciding with
a weak shortwave trough/ripple tracking across the Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys later this afternoon. This feature will bringing with it 
a warmer/moist air mass in it's wake as well as opportunities for
scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms from the late 
morning through the evening hours (supported by the latest runs of
the RAP/HRRR). The best chance for precipitation will be during 
the afternoon, with the highest PoPs favoring the Plateau and 
Southern/Central Valleys. Strong downsloping winds along the 
mountains will lessen coverage and QPF amounts along the immediate
mountains and foothills. Low instabilty will significantly limit 
any severe threat for today, other than a couple strong storms 
along the Plateau later in the afternoon.

Overnight, a 850 mb jet will begin to intensify as it moves into
the region ahead an amplifying trough and it's associated cold
front to the west. These strong southerly winds will result in
advisory level concerns along the Great Smoky Mountains late
tonight and across the entire region on Wednesday (addressed in
the section below). The winds will also help to maintain the warm,
moist air mass in place, setting the for a potential severe
weather outbreak on Wednesday (Also addressed below). Main impact
overnight will be with temperatures as lows will remain in the mid
50s to lower 60s, with similarly high dewpoints. Strong/severe
storms will fire along the cold front along the Mississippi River,
with some remnants of which may approach the Plateau late 
tonight, so have higher PoPs and a thunder mention there. 


.LONG TERM /Wednesday through Monday/...
Biggest weather event of concern will be the chance for severe 
weather as a trough moves across the northern plains and a surface 
low moves through the Great Lakes Region with it, and this system 
drags a cold front through our area on Wednesday. We could have some 
ongoing convection Tuesday night into Wednesday morning which could 
help stabilize the atmosphere and alter the chances for severe 
weather. Soundings suggest that any ongoing convection would be 
pretty weak and could wain in the overnight hours as dry air in the 
mid levels hinders convection, and we could get some cloud clearing 
during the day. If this hindrance does occur then the atmosphere 
should be primed for much stronger storms as we roll into Wednesday 
and the front moves closer to our area. Best timing for the 
strongest storms still seems to be the afternoon hours till a bit 
after sunset. During this time mid level jet will put us in the 
favored region for some upper level support and the low level jet 
will be cranking from early in the morning until the front moves 
through. Low level jet speeds of 50-60+ knots will help create 
strong shear as well as strong pre-frontal winds on Wednesday. 
Forecast models indicate the possibility of 500-1500 J/kg of CAPE 
depending on the model and location in our forecast area. This 
combined with strong 0-1km and 0-6km shear will lead to a good 
possibility to see damaging winds from a line of severe 
thunderstorms. In addition with this set up we could also see large 
hail and a few tornadoes as well. 

As the front exits overnight we will cool down quite a bit as drier 
air pours into our area. Highs on Thursday will be about 20 degrees 
cooler than they will be on Wednesday before the front moves 
through. These colder temperatures will last through the end of the 
week and into the weekend and overnight lows on Thursday night and 
Friday night will likely get below freezing. These temperatures will 
be unfortunate for some of the plants out there that have started to 
bloom due to the recent extraordinarily warm February we 
experienced. Ridging will build back in over the area and a warming 
trend will begin over the weekend and into next week, with another 
chance for precipitation coming at the tail end of the 7-day 
forecast.

.SHORT TERM Tonight and Tuesday...

The upper trough that provided light rain earlier today mostly 
over the southern TN Valley was translating into NC. The majority 
of light rainfall has moved east of the forecast area. Therefore, 
mostly dry conditions will occur during the first part of tonight.
There will be another shortwave approaching the forecast area, 
however, warm air advection and strong southerly flow will occur 
ahead of that system. Expect increasing rain showers after 2am ET.
By noon, scattered thunderstorms will be more common along the 
Plateau with increasing instability. Thunderstorms will spread 
eastward through the afternoon. At this time, these thunderstorms 
will bring brief heavy rain and wind gusts to 40 mph.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday Night through Monday)...

The main focus for the long-term forecast will be the risk for 
severe weather Wednesday afternoon and evening. 

A deep upper level trough will traverse across the Great Plains 
Tuesday night into Wednesday with a surface low tracking from the 
Oklahoma panhandle to near Chicago by Wednesday morning. There are 
some questions about how much convection will be ongoing at the 
beginning of the long-term period. Model soundings indicate dry air 
in the mid-levels with a cap in place most of the overnight hours 
Tuesday into Wednesday morning. For now, have backed off on PoPs a 
bit during this timeframe. 

The main line of severe storms will approach the area during the 
early afternoon on Wednesday. There are still some minor timing 
differences but the noon to 8 pm timeframe looks to be pretty good. 
A sub-tropical 300mb jet max of around 120-130 kts will be located 
over the Lower Mississippi River Valley Wednesday afternoon putting 
the forecast area in the favored left exit region of the jet. A low 
level jet of around 50-60 kts will develop as the cold front 
approaches. A warm and moist airmass will advect northward across 
the forecast area with upper 50s to low 60s dewpoints. These higher 
dewpoints will yield SBCAPE values of around 500-1000 J/Kg depending 
on model run variability. Low level 0-1 km SRH is around 300-400 
m2/s2 but most of this is speed shear with little change in 
direction in the low-levels with deep layer 0-6 km shear around 50-
70 kts. All of these parameters point to a line of severe storms 
with damaging winds being the main threat. The low-level shear 
suggests that an isolated tornado cannot be ruled out. 

Much drier air will advect in quickly behind the departing system on 
Wednesday night. Therefore, decreased the PoPs Wednesday night into 
Thursday morning. PW values drop down into the 0.1-0.2 inch range. 
Highs will be about 15-20 degrees cooler on Thursday in the 50s. A 
dry front will move through the forecast area late Thursday night 
brining in a reinforcing shot of cold air. Adjusted highs slightly 
below guidance for Friday with the heart of the cold air over the 
region during this timeframe. The coldest morning of the forecast 
period will occur on Saturday morning with the surface high pressure 
centered overhead. Lows will drop down into the mid 20 to low 30s 
with a widespread freeze anticipated Friday morning. Broad ridging 
will be in place over the weekend with temperatures at or slightly 
above average. Next chances for rain looks to come early in the work 
week.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
A weak shortwave trough/upper-level disturbance is approaching the
eastern Tennessee Valley early this morning. Latest satellite
trends show mid/high clouds quickly moving into the region, with
BKN/OVC decks of some lower clouds expected by late morning into
the afternoon. Some light rain showers (with perhaps a rumble or
two of thunder) will accompany this feature today, though QPF 
amounts will be light. The best coverage of precipitation will be
along the Plateau and the Southern Plateau/Valley during the
afternoon. Locations across NE TN/SW VA may actually be a few
degrees warmer today comparatively due to some breaks in the 
clouds and the lack of precipitation. 

Later tonight, the upper-trough over the Great Basin will continue
to amplify, placing the region underneath a southwesterly Gulf 
moisture fetch. Thus, an additional round of scattered showers is 
expected later tonight over a good portion of the eastern 
Tennessee Valley thanks to a weak warm front in the vicinity and 
isentropic lift. Downslope winds along the high terrain will 
become breezy/gusty overnight (but should stay below Advisory 
criteria). However, these winds will cutback on precipitation 
along the Mountains and points NE, so have tried to depict the 
highest rain chances favoring Knoxville and points south and west.
 

.LONG TERM /Tuesday through Sunday/...
An upper level trough just entering the Pacific NW this morning 
will deepen as it slowly makes its way east through midweek. This 
will result in warm, moist air overriding a cooler airmass in 
place across the Southern Appalachians. The associated warm front 
will push north across our forecast area on Tuesday, and provide 
enough lift to trigger scattered showers and even a few 
thunderstorms Tuesday afternoon and evening. Our area will be 
firmly in the warm sector by Tuesday afternoon, and temperatures 
will reflect this -- rising into the upper 60s/lower 70s Tuesday 
and Wednesday. 

The main event for our area will be on Wednesday as a strong cold 
front sweeps through the area. Models indicate the potential for 
severe weather on Wednesday, but there are still some differences in 
the exact timing of the frontal passage, with the GFS bringing it 
through midday, and the NAM/ECMWF during the afternoon/evening. 
Regardless, with dewpoints in the upper 50s/lower 60s, bulk shear 
values of 70+kt, 700-500 mb lapse rates betweeen 7.0-8.0 C/km, and 
decent instability (500+ J/kg in the GFS and 1000+ J/kg in the
NAM) -- this event has the potential to be significant. As such, 
SPC has the area west of a line extending from the TN/KY/VA border
- Knoxville - the TN/NC/GA border outlooked for an Enhanced Risk 
of severe storms on Wednesday and a mention of severe 
storms/damaging winds has been added to the gridded forecast. It 
still looks like the main threat at this time will be damaging 
winds with a squall line/broken line segments, but there is the 
potential for supercells to form ahead of the main line.

The cold front pushes east of the forecast area overnight Wednesday. 
Another round of cooler, drier air rushes into the area for the 
second half of the workweek and Saturday under surface high pressure 
and northwest flow aloft. High pressure moves off the coast on 
Sunday, and southwest flow once again begins ushers warmer, more 
moist Gulf air into the area.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tomorrow)... 
Surface high pressure centered over the area this afternoon will 
begin to shift NE off the Middle Atlantic coast by Monday morning.
Meanwhile, latest water vapor and RAP upper air analysis 
indicates a shortwave trough embedded within the larger scale 
zonal flow over central Kansas this afternoon, will move rapidly 
east across the area by Monday evening. 

Although current visible imagery indicated perfectly clear skies  
across much of the area this afternoon, a broad area of middle and
upper level cloudiness will move in ahead of the disturbance 
overnight tonight. This will cut off radiational cooling after 
midnight and will keep temperatures above freezing for a large 
portion of the area tonight. This is in slight contrast to the 
latest GFS and NAM MOS guidance that continue to suggest 
subfreezing temperatures throughout the area, exception being CHA 
and points south and west.

With passage of this disturbance late tomorrow, areas in the SW
corner of the CWA will have likely chance of pcpn by the end of
the day while the remainder of the area will see only a slight
chance of pcpn into the afternoon hours. With the current low
level air mass being so dry (dewpoints below 40 degree for much of
the day on Monday) any appreciable pcpn will have to wait until
beyond the fcst period. 

.LONG TERM (Tomorrow Night through Sunday)... An upper level 
trough will make it's way slowly east from the Western U.S. 
through the Mississippi Valley through mid week. As it does so, 
warm and moist air will override a cooler air mass in place across
the Southern Appalachians. Scattered showers and even a few 
thunderstorms will occur in this warm frontal push into the 
Southern Appalachian region. But the big event will be on 
Wednesday into Wednesday evening as another strong cold front 
sweeps through the Eastern U.S. Sufficient instability and shear 
will be available for storm strengthening with this feature, and 
the thunderstorms that accompany this frontal passage could become
severe. The front should move across the Appalachian spine later 
Wednesday night with drier and cooler air streaming back into the 
region on northwesterly winds. The remainder of the forecast will 
be dry with a gradual warming trend into the weekend as the low 
level ridge shifts east to the Southeast Atlantic Coast.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
High pressure at the surface prevailing today will promote a clear
sky with dry conditions. Despite the fact that there will be 
plenty of sunshine, a light WNW flow will keep highs in check 
once again (in the 50s) -- though it should feel a bit warmer than
yesterday due to the lighter surface winds. Clear conditions in
the evening, should allow for good radiational cooling after 
sunset. However, cloud cover will begin to work it's way into the
region after midnight ahead of the next upper-level disturbance
that will track into the Tennessee Valley later on Monday. This 
cloud cover will help keep lows 5-8 degrees warmer than the 
previous night, preventing a freeze from occurring for a second 
night in a row.

.LONG TERM /Tuesday through Saturday/...
Upper level flow becomes more southerly for Monday into Tuesday, 
helping to advect warmer, more moist air into the forecast area. A
warm front will push north across the forecast area Monday night 
into Tuesday, providing enough lift for scattered showers and even
a few thunderstorms Tuesday afternoon and night. We'll be firmly 
in the warm sector on Tuesday into Wednesday, and temperatures 
will again climb into the upper 60s to mid 70s. The best chance 
for widespread showers and thunderstorms will be Wednesday into 
Wednesday night as a strong cold front sweeps through the area. 
We'll continue to keep a close eye on the potential for severe 
weather with this frontal passage, as this event gets within the 
time range resolved by shorter, higher- resolution models. Rain 
chances taper off Thursday morning as the front exits the area and
northwest flow ushers cooler air into the region. Precipitation 
may end as a few snow showers across the higher terrain, but no 
accumulation is expected. Highs for the second half of the 
workweek and next weekend will be near seasonal normals, generally
in the 50s at most locations. A weak shortwave does cross north 
of the forecast area on Friday, but at this point it looks like 
precipitation will be mainly north of the area, and did not have 
enough confidence to include any showers across SW Virginia. High 
pressure will be overhead through the weekend, keeping the area 
dry with mostly sunny skies.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tomorrow)...
Cold front is now east of the area with colder drier airmass 
working its way eastward into the area. Gusty winds this afternoon
will gradually subside as we head into this evening. Couple that 
with clearing skies area wide overnight, and we could expect some 
very efficient radiational cooling to help drop the overnight lows
down into the middle to upper 20s, or about 5 degrees below late 
February normals. 

Zonal flow aloft through the period will allow for a rapid
eastward progression of surface high currently centered over 
central Oklahoma this afternoon. Overnight, this high shifts east,
becoming centered across the area by Sunday afternoon. With it, 
we will see plenty of sunshine, with seasonal afternoon high 
temperatures in the upper 40s over SW VA to the mid to upper 50s 
over SE TN. 


.LONG TERM (Tomorrow Night through Saturday)...
The upper pattern becomes amplified again during the period as a 
long wave trough builds slowly east out of the Western U.S. As the
southerly flow strengthens Monday into Tuesday, a warm front will
be pressing north across the forecast area. Isentropic lifting 
with this boundary along with some weak short wavelength energy 
should lead to the development of scattered showers during the 
first couple days of the work week. As previously advertised, the 
best chance of widespread showers will be Wednesday into Wednesday
night as another strong cold front sweeps through the eastern 
states. Of course, in this period of changing seasons with warm 
and moist low level air rising into very cold air aloft, 
thunderstorms will be part of the equation again on Wednesday. 
Will need to watch this again as these storms could become rather 
strong. The rain tapers off on Thursday and temperatures may be 
cold enough in the higher terrain for a few snow showers on the 
tail end of the departing system. Models are not all on the same 
page for Friday but generally show a trailing short wave dropping 
southeast out of the lakes. The chance for precipitation will be 
limited geographically and probabilistically at this point. So, 
just added a slight or low chance pop for showers along with some 
snow showers across Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee due
to some cold air advection building in with the upper feature. 
Was able to keep Saturday dry as the upper flow trends back toward
a zonal configuration with some higher pressure.

.DISCUSSION...
Cold front is just about out of the area and gusty W-NW winds are
beginning to increase across the region. Precipitation has ended 
with exception of few light showers in extreme NE TN and eastern 
half of Washington and Russell counties in SW VA. In agreement 
with latest hires guidance, CWA should be pcpn free for the 
afternoon under gradually clearing skies. Temperatures are 
expected to remain steady or fall slightly over the northern half 
of the CWA while the southern half, getting more insolation 
through the day, may see a slight upward bump before leveling off 
for the remainder of the afternoon.

Removed any POPs from current forecast for the afternoon. Also
adjusted sky cover to reflect quicker clearing over the southern
half of the CWA. Likewise, updated temperatures in line with 
current observations.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
A cold front is quickly moving into the eastern Tennessee early
this morning, bringing with it a broken line of strong to severe
storms. This activity is tied closely to a 50 kt 850 mb LLJ that 
has rotated across the region over the last 3-5 hours. Instability
is limited, but would not be surprised to see this activity 
maintain itself over the next couple of hours, given the added 
lift by the LLJ. Damaging winds will be the main threat along with
some small hail.

Thereafter, winds will shift to the WNW and NW and drier/cooler 
air will quickly advection into the region. the high temperature
may well occur in the morning, before northerly winds gradually
stabilize/decrease them by later in the afternoon. Low stratus 
will linger through the morning and into the early to mid 
afternoon across much of the area, before breaking up late in the 
day. However, this brief bout of heating should not impact the 
temperature curve much. Winds will be quite breezy in the 
afternoon, helping to reinforce this cooler air mass. However, 
sustained winds in the 15 to 25 mph range will be below advisory 
criteria. 

Overnight, a clear and calmer night will make for good radiational
cooler in the evening. A hard freeze is expected over much of the
Valley, with lows in the mid to upper 20s. Thus, readings will be
some 50 degrees cooler than the high temperatures recorded 
earlier on Friday. Quite the difference in air mass!

.LONG TERM /Sunday through Friday/...
Models start out with good agreement for the long term period, 
with surface high pressure in control for Sunday and zonal flow 
aloft. High pressure slides off the east coast Sunday night, and 
flow becomes more southwesterly for Monday. Moisture will work 
into the area by Monday afternoon and showers will develop for 
Monday into Tuesday. From here, we start to see some model 
differences, but the general forecast consensus is pretty good. 
The atmosphere will destabilize on Tuesday with a warm front 
approaching the area, which may help spark some thunderstorms 
during the day. The better chance for convection will be Tuesday 
night into Wednesday, with our area sitting in the warm sector 
ahead of another relatively strong cold front that will cross the 
area later Wednesday afternoon and overnight. Kept the remainder 
of the long term dry with high pressure building in and northwest 
flow setting up. Models do indicate a shortwave crossing north of 
the area Friday, and this could bring the chance for some showers 
to SW VA, but odds are too low to include at this point.

.DISCUSSION...
Showers and thunderstorms have begun developing ahead of cold
front moving into middle Tennessee at mid evening. Air mass is
still unstable over middle Tennessee as well as the Cumberland
Plateau and southern Tennessee Valley. As low level jet
strengthens and ML CAPE of 500-1000 J/kg and bulk shear of
35-45 kts continues, the line of storms should stay organized for
the next several hours as it moves east. Strong straight line
winds with a line of storms will be the main threat. The storms 
will likely move into the Forecast Area before midnight and then 
cross the region through the pre-dawn hours. Have updated forecast
slightly on timing. Temperatures will fall only very slowly until
the rain moves in and there will be a significant drop towards
morning into the 40s and lower 50s. South to southeast winds were
increasing in the higher Smoky Mountains and will be gusting over
40 mph until early Saturday. Will update wind advisory shortly.

.SHORT TERM...
Upper level low centered over central Iowa this afternoon will
lift NE toward the Great Lakes overnight tonight. At the surface,
associated 995 mb low centered over central Illinois will also 
lift NE into the eastern Great Lakes by Saturday morning. 
Associated cold front moving toward the Mississippi Valley this 
afternoon will push east across TN tonight before moving east of 
the area Saturday morning. 

Ahead of the front, an intensifying LLJ will move across the
Plateau and into the Tennessee Valley during the overnight hours.
Over the Plateau, ML CAPE of 700-900 J/kg coupled with bulk shear
values of 45-60 kts will allow the line of convection to remain 
organized with the real possibility of some strong to severe 
storms as it pushes through the area during the overnight. Timing 
looks to be a little more delayed than previous model runs with 
both hires HRRR and RAP13 indicating that convection will push 
through the area during mainly the midnight to 6 am time frame. 
This agrees well with the NAM that has also slowed the progression
of this front as well. With presence of the near unidirectional 
wind profiles, strong to severe straight line winds look to be the
dominant threat with this event. Any overnight severe weather 
event poses an additional risk. Given that people are not as 
connected to latest weather information as they typically are 
during normal waking hours, people should be extra diligent to 
ensure they have access to the latest watch and warning 
information from the NWS. 

Further east of the front tonight in the eastern portions of the 
cwa, a tightening pressure gradient is expected to increase winds
for areas of the Smoky Mtns above 3000 ft in Cocke, Sevier, and 
Blount counties. These winds will decrease with the frontal 
passage on Saturday morning. A Wind Advisory has been issued for 
the those areas from 7 pm tonight until 7 am on Saturday.

As the front moves out on Saturday conditions should gradually
improve through the afternoon. Gusty west winds and a daytime high
in the lower to middle 50s that will slowly drop during the day
will make it feel a bit more like winter. Especially after the 
record breaking late week warmth we have been experiencing. With 
the gusty winds tomorrow, consideration was given to a wind 
advisory behind the front, but 850 mb winds weaken precipitously 
by afternoon. However, do expect to see marginal advisory level
gusts, particularly near mid-day and a Special Weather Statement 
may be necessary by morning to alert users to the winds gusting 25
to 35 mph behind the front.

.LONG TERM...The long term forecast 
will follow the slower ECMWF modeling rather than the quicker GFS 
suggestion of a frontal passage for the week ahead. Dry and cold 
advection brings an end to the precipitation Saturday night with a 
zonal westerly flow regime gradually becoming southerly again ahead 
of another amplified long wave Mid America trough at mid week. In 
this scenario, isentropic lift with a moist, southerly component 
will lead to the development of showers Monday into Tuesday. The 
atmosphere will be destabilizing in the moistening pattern by 
Tuesday and so some thunderstorms could be part of the mix at this 
time. But the better chance for convection will be Tuesday night 
into Wednesday ahead of another relatively strong cold front due in 
the Southern Appalachian Region later Wednesday afternoon and 
evening. Kept the remainder of the long term dry behind this system 
with a prevailing west to northwesterly flow building in with higher 
surface pressure. The new week's temperature forecast features 
another most pleasant warm up into mid week with highs back in the 
upper 60s and lower 70s followed by a return to more typical early 
March weather.

Winds across the western half of the CWA are beginning to increase

Severe weather remains a strong prospect with this front during 
the overnight hours tonight as damaging straight line winds looks

from yesterdays model runs, with hires guidance just beginning to 
bring activity into the area by 11 pm followed by the main line

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
A strong frontal system is poised to impact the region over the 
next 24 hours, bringing with it the potential for strong to severe
thunderstorms later tonight -- and a much cooler air mass heading
into Saturday in it's wake (addressed in the next section). Ahead
of the front, breezy gradient winds from the south will help 
bring Gulf moisture into the region. In addition, this warm air 
advection and the insolation from the sun will help to warm us to 
near or above record high values by the afternoon. Most areas will
peak in the mid to upper 70s, though I would not be shocked if a 
few areas across the southern Valley and along the immediate 
valleys near the foothills of the Smokies hit the 80 degree mark 
(thanks to downslope warming). 

The area will remain capped through the afternoon and evening as 
the front remains well to the west. Then between 00-06z an 
intensifying 850 mb jet will rotate across the Plateau and Valley 
in association with a prefrontal trough. These features will play 
a big role in whether convection will develop late in the evening 
and linger after the midnight hours across the eastern Tennessee 
Valley. Some modest instability will develop by 21-03z, with 
plenty of wind shear to provide lift and organization to any thing
that does develop. The combination of around 800-1200 j/kg of ML 
CAPE and the 40-50 kts of bulk shear will allow a line of 
organized storms to develop and remain strong to severe as they 
move across the region between 03-09z. The primary threat with 
this activity will be damaging straight line winds and some 
marginally severe hail. Although a brief tornado or two cannot be
ruled out, the presence of a pre-existing boundary will play a 
big role in realizing this threat. More veered/unidirectional wind
profiles do favor line segments and damaging straight-line winds 
much more so over tornadoes at this time.

In addition, as the LLJ ramps up overnight, strong gradient winds 
will be felt over the Great Smoky Mountain zones of Cocke, 
Sevier, and Blount Counties. Thus, we have issued an Advisory for
those zones from 00-12z on Saturday. 


.LONG TERM /Saturday through Thursday/...
Cold front will be pushing east of the forecast area by Saturday 
morning. High pressure builds in Saturday, bringing sunshine and 
generally dry conditions. West winds will be steady at 10-15kt and
will help usher cooler air and more seasonable temperatures into 
the Tennessee Valley. Highs on Saturday will be 10-20 degrees 
cooler than Friday, ranging from the upper 40s across the 
Cumberland Plateau to the mid 50s in the Tennessee Valley. Very 
minimal lingering moisture behind the cold front combined with 
upslope flow may keep some light showers possible across the NE 
higher elevations through Saturday night. As cooler air rushes in 
behind the frontal passage and temperatures drop below freezing 
after sunset Saturday, a few snowflakes may even mix in, but no 
accumulation is expected. High pressure remains in place for 
Sunday with another day of sunny skies and seasonable 
temperatures. 

High pressure slides off the east coast Sunday night, 
and upper level flow becomes more southwesterly, helping to advect 
warmer air back into the region ahead of a fast-moving shortwave 
that will bring the next chance for showers. There's still some 
differences in model solutions, but the general picture is a short 
wave lifting out of the Southern Plains, bringing scattered showers 
to mainly the southern half of the forecast area Monday afternoon. A 
warm frontal boundary will lift north and cross our area 
Tuesday/Tuesday night. It's still a few days out and details will 
better resolve themselves as the days pass, but at this point it 
looks like this could bring another round of potentially severe 
thunderstorms to the area Tuesday into Tuesday night. The warm front 
would provide a focus for convection, and the GFS is currently 
showing a 50kt+ 850mb jet, CAPE values of 500-1000 J/kg, and PWATs 
maxing out at 1.3". For now, it's something we'll be keeping our 
eyes on, and thunder's been added to the grids. The cold front is 
progged to push through the area on Wednesday, and should spark a 
more organized line of thunderstorms as it moves through.

High pressure builds back in for Thursday, bringing drier, cooler 
conditions and mostly sunny skies.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tomorrow)... 
Latest water vapor and RAP upper level analysis indicate ridge 
axis building NE across the area this afternoon ahead of a 
deepening Plains trough. This ridge axis will further amplify 
through the day Friday as it shifts east of the area ahead of our 
next frontal system Friday night.

At the surface, ridge of high pressure noses SW from central North
Carolina into central Alabama and Mississippi. Next surface front 
currently extends SW from the Great Lakes SW across central 
Illinois and into northern Oklahoma. As the surface front 
continues to slowly push east through Friday, gradient winds 
aiding with low level warm air advection along with modest rising 
heights aloft will allow for temperatures to climb into possible
record territory by the afternoon. 

Current forecast calls for breaking records at Chattanooga,
Knoxville, and Tri-Cities tomorrow. Guidance suggests that the 
Tri-Cities record is most likely to fall as both NAM/GFS MOS are 
3-4 degrees above the record set in 1982. As for Knoxville and 
Chattanooga, both of which set records in 1890, guidance is at and
slightly above the record for both sites. The one caveat with this
is that MOS guidance has had a warm bias of around 1-3 degrees 
for all three sites over the past few days. If that continues, 
then we may only approach and not break these records. However, 
thoughts are that we will see minimal fog overnight due to 
slightly increasing low level winds. This will allow for quicker 
start to daytime heating across much of the area. Coupled with 
fcsted strong southerly winds by afternoon and we may reach those 
records.

Finally, with increasing southerly low-level winds, we could
approach wind advisory levels. However, strongest 850 mb core will
remain west of the area through the afternoon but may clip our
northwest Plateau counties by early evening hours as an 850 mb 
jet core lies just to the west of our area at that time. 
Presently, however, only the GFS has 850 MB winds in excess of 40 
kts at that time, and it indicates an 850 jet core of 50 kts over
south central Kentucky during the evening hours. 

.LONG TERM (Tomorrow Night Through Thursday)... 
The early weekend storm system drives east from the Mississippi 
Valley through the Appalachians through the first twenty four 
hours of the extended period. Convection will be building across 
the forecast area Friday night into early Saturday morning. It 
still looks like thunderstorms could be rather strong or even 
become severe in another healthy shear but weakly unstable 
environment. The best period of possibly strong storms would be 
around 00-05z Saturday and mainly over western sections of the 
forecast area. The main threat would be straight line winds and 
large hail, however some decent helicity values were noted on the 
Cumberland Plateau early in the event so there is a limited chance
for a brief tornado in this area. The showers and thunderstorms 
gradually end from west to east later Friday night into Saturday 
morning with a nice, dry high pressure regime building in for 
later Saturday afternoon through Sunday evening. The next system 
is a fast moving short wave that rips rapidly northeast out of the
Southern Plains with a surge of moisture and warm air in warm 
frontal fashion, generating scattered showers across the region. 
Because there are some model differences in the early part of the 
work week in association with this wave, chance pops were broad 
brushed in from Monday into Tuesday night. By Wednesday, a deeper 
trough edges it's way into the Eastern U.S. driving another 
relatively strong cold front into the Southern Appalachians. This 
looks like another convective episode with a decent chance of 
rain. Highest pops were placed on the daytime period Wednesday 
with decreasing pops and colder temperatures Wednesday night into 
Thursday. The warmest period of the extended will be in the warm 
air advection pattern Monday through Wednesday where more above 
normal temperatures will be seen.

.DISCUSSION...
Dense fog area wide has dissipated. However portions of the
central and southern Tennessee Valley along with central and
southern portions of the Plateau continue to see patches of dense
fog. As such, have expired the Dense Fog Advisory and issued a 
Special Weather Statement for patchy fog in those areas until 
noon. 

Persistent fog coincides with axis of surface ridge which 
extends westward from NW North Carolina into SW Tennessee. 
Observations along and south of the ridge axis in our area 
continue to show calm to light winds. Expect this fog to gradually
lift by noon as the ridge axis strengthen a bit helping to 
increase winds slightly and the heating of the day begins in 
earnest.

Updated sky and weather grid to include patchy fog over SW 
portions of the CWA for the remainder of the morning. Similarly 
tweaked temperature grid in line with latest observations.

358 AM EST Thu Feb 23 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Dense fog has formed overnight
after skies cleared late Wednesday and moisture lingered from day
time rainfall. Winds are light area wide. Temperatures are in the
mid 40s to lower 50s. Will continue Dense Fog Advisory through
10 AM EST. High pressure was located off the Atlantic Coast with 
low pressure over Florida and a cold front across the Great Lakes 
extending through the Mid Mississippi Valley. The weak pressure 
gradient over the Forecast Area will tighten up by late morning as
the sun warms the atmosphere with fog dissipating and light south
to southeast winds developing as cold front to the northwest 
moves into the Ohio Valley. Temperatures will warm into the upper 
60s to mid 70s as skies become partly to possibly mostly sunny 
once the low level moisture gets mixed out. Tonight another mild 
night with some patchy fog and lows in the upper 40s to mid 50s. 
As deepening surface low moves from the central Plains to the Mid
Mississippi Valley. Light south winds will continue overnight.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
An active period of weather forecast over the long-term forecast.
The main focus will be the possibility of severe storms late 
Friday night into early Saturday morning. At the beginning of the 
period a robust upper level low will be traversing the Central 
Plains into the Mid-Mississippi River Valley. A surface low will 
track from near Kansas City to Chicago during the day Friday. 
Strong low level southerly flow will advect in warm air and 
moisture to the Southern Appalachians. Temperatures are forecast 
to be at and even above record values. Please see the records 
below for more information.

Chattanooga: 77 set in 1890
Knoxville:   76 set in 1890
Tri-Cities:  72 set in 1982

A cap will be in place around 700-800 mb and should keep any 
convection from forming throughout the day. Winds will increase to 
near advisory criteria during the timeframe with the tightening 
pressure gradient from the approaching cold front. 

The main focus for severe weather will come from roughly 9 pm Friday 
through 4 am Saturday. There are still some timing issues to work 
out but the consensus is that this will be overnight event. Models 
indicate a low level jet of 45-55 kts around 02z-07z Saturday. Model 
soundings indicate SBCAPE values of around 500-1000 J/Kg. These 
soundings also show some unrealistic decoupling and these values 
could be slightly underdone. The 0-1 KM SRH will be around 200-300 
m2/s with deep layer 0-6 km shear around 50-60 kts. It looks as 
though the highest threat area will be north of I-40 and west of I-
75 where the best combination of shear and instability well be. 
However, can not rule out severe weather across any location in the 
forecast area. The line should begin to weaken in the 2am-6am 
timeframe as the low level jet lifts out to the northeast and the 
instability begins to wane. For now, it appears that all modes of 
severe weather will be possible, especially in the area of highest 
risk mentioned above. Due to the low level shear, can not rule out 
an isolated tornado and will go ahead and add this to the HWO.

Much cooler and drier air will filter in behind the front on 
Saturday with noticeably cooler temperatures. Northwesterly winds 
will also be near advisory criteria on Saturday as well. The GFS 
indicates a few wrap around showers across SW VA and NE TN. The GFS 
soundings are fairly dry with PW values dropping to around a quarter 
of an inch. Therefore, lowered PoPs during this timeframe. 
Additionally, this was the timeframe where some light snow 
shower/flurries were mentioned but based on the latest guidance this 
is looking less likely. 

A widespread freeze is anticipated Sunday morning and this could 
pose an issue to any sensitive vegetation that has begin to bloom due 
to the recent warm weather. Mid to upper 20s will be possible across 
SW VA and the higher elevations. Dry conditions will feature on 
Sunday with surface high pressure shifting to the east. 

Models are in fairly good agreement with widespread showers 
developing on Monday ahead of an advancing warm front. Isentropic 
lift ahead of this boundary will create widespread precipitation. 
There is some difference about how far north the boundary 
progresses. The GFS indicates that the boundary will move into 
southern portions of the area with a few strong thunderstorms 
possible. The ECMWF keeps the boundary to the south with just 
showers. For now, will side more toward the ECMWF with just showers 
mentioned in the forecast. This warm front will eventually lift 
through the area by Tuesday with another system expected to move in 
on Wednesday. The system on Wednesday could bring another round of 
strong to severe storms to the area but this is well out in the 
extended and will not mention it in the HWO at this time.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tomorrow)...
Latest water vapor and RAP upper level analysis continues to show
rather strong middle level circulation moving eastward across the
Northern Gulf of Mexico and Northern Florida. As this feature 
moves out, Atlantic surface ridge builds westward tonight. 
Residual low level moisture and calm to very light winds will 
likely lead to fog across the area, with some locations possibly 
seeing dense fog during the latter portion of the overnight hours.

Shortwave trough aloft will ride east across Kentucky and West
Virginia through the day tomorrow. With it, prospects of some 
light pcpn across the Northern Plateau counties, NE Tennessee, and
SW Virginia are possible for the afternoon hours. Any pcpn with 
this feature should be rather short-lived before the shortwave 
exits the area to the NE by the evening hours.

Temperatures tonight and tomorrow will remain nearly 20 degrees
above seasonal normals. This in a month that is already ranking
within the top ten warmest Februaries on record for Chattanooga,
Knoxville, and Tri-Cities.


.LONG TERM (Thursday Night through Wednesday)...
Another warm day on Friday with highs topping out in the 70's and
some places will be pushing 80 degrees. In fact we could see all 
3 climate sites break record high temperatures for this day, 
here's the data for the 24th.

Chattanooga: 77 set in 1890
Knoxville:   76 set in 1890
Tri-Cities:  72 set in 1982

This warming will all happen ahead of our next system which could 
produce severe weather in our area. That system is a low moving 
across the central plains states and into the Great Lakes region 
with a cold front being dragged along with it. Increasing southerly 
winds ahead of the front will bring in warm air and the increasing 
speed of the low level jet will help produce good shear in our area. 
0-1 km and 0-6 km shear values are strong which will help lead to 
strong winds as the primary severe threat in our area. CAPE values 
will be pretty good as well (in the 500-1000 J/kg range), but a cap 
could inhibit some convection from forming ahead of the main line. 
Biggest threat for our area will be with the main line passing 
through late Friday night through early Saturday morning. 

Once the front passes through it will force temperatures to drop and 
highs on Saturday will be about 15 - 20 degrees colder than they 
were on Friday, but we will STILL be a few degrees above normal even 
after this front passes through (going to show how warm we've been 
lately).

We could potentially see a light snow flurry or two in the higher 
elevations Saturday night into Sunday, but minimal accumulations 
would be expected. Unfortunately many locations will see sub 
freezing or near freezing temperatures which could kill off early 
growth due to the recent warm temperatures. We start to warm back up 
and will see another round of showers early next week.

areas of rain and rainshowers, mainly north of I-40 across the
area. Expect this activity to begin to taper early this afternoon,
although we will likely see spotty pcpn area wide persist into
this evening before ending.

Had to adjust temperatures downward area wide as pcpn and cloud 
cover have caused temperatures to level off after sunrise this
morning. Similarly lowered afternoon high temperatures as any
subsequent heating will struggle to get temperature increases of
10 degrees in continued cloud cover and areas of pcpn. Otherwise
no changes to fcst for this afternoon.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...Upper low over Mississippi
will move slowly southeast into the northeast Gulf today.
Isentropic lift will continue this morning and afternoon and
trigger light showers across much of the forecast area. A weak
surface trough over Kentucky into middle Tennessee will also act
to enhance the shower activity. Rainfall amounts will be
light...heaviest near the Tennessee border and across southwest
Virginia. Skies will stay mostly cloudy. Mild temperatures this
morning in the mid 50s will rise to the mid and upper 60s this
afternoon. Tonight showers will end as upper low moves southeast.
Low level moisture will remain with mostly cloudy skies and mild
temperatures in the lower to mid 50s.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...
The main focus for the long-term forecast will be on the severe 
weather expected to impact the area late Friday into early 
Saturday morning. 

On Thursday, an upper level trough will move out of the Rocky 
Mountains with lee cyclogenesis. A warm front will extend eastward 
from the surface low in Colorado to the Ohio River Valley. This will 
put the forecast area in the warm sector. PW values will be around 
an inch on Thursday. These values are around the 90th percentile for 
late February. There is a weak mid-level trough that moves through 
but not seeing much in the way of lift. Therefore, went ahead and 
trimmed back PoPs on Thursday to mainly just the higher elevations 
and only have around 20 percent there. Temperatures will continue to 
be well above normal with highs in the upper 60s to mid 70s. Mid-
level ridging will build in Thursday night into Friday morning ahead 
of the next approaching trough. The small PoPs will come to an end 
and expect dry conditions during the overnight period. Southerly 
flow will begin to pick up overnight as the pressure gradient 
tightens as a cold front races across the Central and Southern 
Plains. These southerly winds will keep overnight lows up in the 50s 
across most of the forecast area. 

On Friday, the focus will shift to the possibilty of severe 
storms. Currently, it appears that most of the day Friday will be 
dry with the ridge still providing some influence. In addition, 
model soundings indicate a cap throughout much of the day with drier 
air in the mid-levels. Temperatures will once again top out near 
record values with highs in the 70s. Southerly winds will also be 
strong throughout the day and approach advisory level criteria. 
Expect the cap aloft and the linear forcing will keep most of the 
convection along a line just ahead of the front. The NAM and GFS 
indicate a surge in the low level jet around 03-06z Saturday up into 
the 45-55 kt range. In addition, the strong warm air and moisture 
advection will produce SBCAPE values in the 500-1000 J/Kg range 
during the overnight hours. The strong upper level flow aloft will 
lead to 0-6 km bulk shear values of 50-60 kts. Strong jet dynamics 
will also setup at this time as a speed max rotates through the base 
of the trough. The low level 0-1 km SRH will range from around 200-
300 m2/s2. Some model soundings indicate that the boundary layer 
will decouple and produce lower instability values, however, this is 
unrealistic given the strong southerly flow.  Therefore, have sided 
more towards the NAM since it shows less decoupling. At this time it 
appears the highest risk for severe weather would be from roughly 10 
pm - 6am late Friday night into early Saturday with damaging winds 
being the main threat.

Much drier and colder air will advect into the Southern Appalachians 
on Saturday into Saturday night. So cold in fact, models indicate 
some light snow possible across the higher elevations Saturday night 
across the higher elevation. With the recent warm weather, flowers 
and plants have been blooming and it looks like a widespread freeze 
will occur Sunday morning. The cooler conditions will be short-lived 
as a warm front lift across the area early next week. Rain showers 
will be possible Monday night into Tuesday as the front lifts 
northward with highs on Tuesday in the mid to upper 60s.

.DISCUSSION...
Light rain showers will continue to overspread the region late
this evening as an upper-level low tracks south of the region
along the Gulf Coast. These showers will expand in coverage after
midnight thanks to isentropic lift, though they will still
generally remain light in nature. Total QPF amounts between 0.1 
to 0.25 inches will be common across the region through 12z. The 
combination of the cloud cover and precipitation will keep low 
temperatures quite mild overnight -- generally in the low to mid 
50s. Despite the precipitation, patchy fog is expected to develop 
along the mountains after midnight and will be possible across the
entire region early Wednesday morning due to the moist boundary 
layer conditions.

.SHORT TERM...(Today thorugh Wednesday night)...
Clouds continue to push across the area. Though overcast, clouds
were thin enough across the north to allow some sunshine to filter
through and warm locations to around 70 degrees, with some spots
climbing into the low 70s. Some light rain showers this afternoon
will slowly give way to steadier rain across southern portions of
the forecast area as the atmosphere slowly becomes more 
saturated. Short term models continue to want to keep areas north 
of I-40 dry through at least midnight tonight. For Wednesday, 
conditions should slowly dry out across the south as the closed 
low slides east and cuts off the moisture transport to our area. 
In contrast, this looks to be the better setup for rain across SW 
VA and NE TN, and models indicate some rain through Wednesday
evening over the northern half of the forecast area. Overall,
rainfall amounts should be light, but south to southeast winds
could lead to some areas of downsloping. With overcast skies, lows
tonight will remain mild, holding in the 50s across much of the
area. Cloud cover tomorrow will keep lower, especially across the
north. Highs will range from the lower 60s there to the upper 60s
in the southern valley where some sunshine may be able to work in
by late afternoon. 

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...
A 700-500 mb shortwave trough is expected to cross the area on 
Thursday. Forcing with it is weak, and forecast soundings show weak 
instability across northern sections while southern sections 
remained capped. Will have just a slight chance PoP north on 
Thursday. Temperatures will continue their upward trend Thursday and 
Friday as the southerly 850 mb flow strengthens ahead of a Midwest 
low. Highs in the TN Valley will be in the lower 70s Thursday, and 
mid 70s Friday.

Models have been consistent and in good agreement on the timing of a 
cold frontal passage late Friday night. Convection ahead of the 
front is expected to develop in Middle TN in the evening, and move 
into East TN around midnight. The overnight timing means instability 
should be weak, but strong shear and favorable positioning of the 
upper jet exit region could result in some strong to marginally 
severe storms. Likely PoPs with a chance of thunderstorms will be 
continued. With fropa expected around 12Z, Saturday should have 
lowering rain chances with clearing skies through the afternoon. 

Cooler temperatures build in over the weekend, but still only close 
to normal for late February - highs in the 50s and lows in the 30s. 
The GFS shows a fast-moving shortwave trough bringing some precip to 
northern areas Sunday night, but the ECMWF shows nothing. Will keep 
this period fry for now. We return to a mild SW flow pattern on 
Monday as the pattern becomes more amplified with a deepening trough 
over the Rockies, which will also bring a return of rain chances on 
Tuesday.

temperatures are warming up this morning faster than previously
forecasted. Also slowed down rain onset and cloud lowering this 
afternoon based on current radar trends and short term model 
forecasts. For now, have kept rain out of the far southwest until 
after 18Z and then slowly pushing north. The 14Z HRRR and 12Z NAM
runs both show rain staying out of SW VA and NE TN until after 6Z.
Will continue to monitor trends and may slow down rain onset in

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Cirrus clouds have streamed into the area ahead of the next 
approaching upper level system. Current water vapor imagery and RAP 
upper air analysis indicates a closed low across Eastern Texas with 
moisture streaming northward from the Gulf of Mexico into the Mid-
Mississippi River Valley. The ridge axis has now passed to the east 
but upper level heights remain elevated. At the surface, a weak 
low pressure center can be noted near Memphis with a weak boundary
stretching to the southeast across Central Alabama and into 
Southern Georgia. in addition, there is a broad area of low 
pressure across Eastern Texas near the upper low. 

For today, the atmosphere will slowly saturate ahead of the slow 
moving upper level low. Clouds will increase across the Southern 
Appalachians. Due to the slow nature of the system, expect the 
morning and most of the afternoon will be dry. Models indicate that 
the moisture advection picks up across the region around 21z. PW 
values will eventually top out around 1.2-1.4 inches later tonight. 
These reading represent values over the maximum observed for late 
February. At the same time, the upper level low will become cut off 
and track to the southeast across the Northern Gulf of Mexico. 
Therefore, there are still some question to just how much 
precipitation will occur. The models indicate that convection along 
the Northern Gulf could cut the area off from the best moisture 
advection. In addition, winds in the low-levels will be from the 
south to southeast and could lead to some downsloping. Overall, 
forecast rainfall amounts are around 0.10-0.25 inches. For now, 
have PoPs around 70-80 for tonight but could see these increased 
in later forecast issuances. Well above normal temperatures are 
forecast again today with warm air advection highs will range from
the upper 60s to lower 70s. Widespread cloud cover and rainfall 
tonight will keep lows in the upper 40s to mid 50s tonight.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...

Upper low over Gulf moves east southeast still slower than 
previous model runs with showers lingering Wednesday. Weak trough 
will bring drier air into the region during the afternoon 
Wednesday. Rain showers end by evening with partial clearing 
overnight Wednesday. Followed drier GFS with no rain Wednesday 
night. A weak midlevel shortwave trough still to cross region 
Thursday afternoon and evening. With some instability and warm 
temperatures and some moisture about a 30 percent chance of 
showers possible. Added slight chance of thunderstorms too. 

Surface low develops over Plains Thursday night and decreasing 
clouds over the Tennessee Valley as weak ridging moves across the 
southeast. The low deepens across the midwest and upper Mississippi 
Valley into Friday. A cold front will then cross the Mississippi 
Valley Friday and move into the Tennessee Valley Friday afternoon 
and night. Very warm temperatures will likely occur with deep 
southwest flow aloft. Increased upper level winds and instability 
will set the stage for showers and thunderstorms Friday night with 
some storms possibly severe. Will continue mention in the HWO. 
Behind this system a big drop in temperatures back to near normal 
50s and even colder Sunday in the 40s to mid 50s. Showers move out 
Saturday and skies clear Saturday night and continue Sunday. A weak 
system to move southeast from the northwest Sunday night into Monday 
with temperatures warming into the 50s to lower 60s.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Tomorrow night)...High pressure will 
remain in control tonight but will be slowly moving off to our east 
due to an incoming closed off low. A cirrus layer will remain over 
the area tonight which will yield mostly clear conditions. Overnight 
lows will be in the mid to upper 40s north (TRI) and upper 40s to 
low 50s south (CHA).

Mid-level moisture begins to spread in from the west tomorrow 
morning as the closed off low nears the area, brining an increase in 
clouds. Moisture will spread from west to east through the day. It 
takes a while for soundings to moisten up so don't bring pops into 
the area until the afternoon hours, where a slight chance/chance pop 
is in for the Cumberland Plateau, Southern Valley, and SWNC. 
Gradually spread pops from southwest to northeast through the day 
with increasing chances as the day progresses, Northeast TN and 
Southwest VA stay dry the longest. 850mb flow reveals some 
downsloping winds early tomorrow so tried to hold off clouds in 
these areas until later in the day. So the foothills of our eastern 
mountains should see sunshine the longest. QPF amounts look light 
through the day with only a few hundredths of an inch forecast. 
Highs will be cooler with the increased cloud cover, mid to upper 
60s are expected. 

Low moves across to our south during the overnight hours giving the 
best chances of precip with deeper moisture and better lift in 
place. Have likely pops across the area with around 0.15 to 0.25 
inches expected on average. Lows will remain mild tomorrow night 
with the added cloud cover. Lows will be in the upper 40s to lower 
50s.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...
The 12Z model runs have trended toward a slower departure of the 
low pressure system over the northern GoM, so the chance of rain 
Wednesday morning will be raised to likely for northeast sections 
as the 700 mb deformation zone remains over the mountains at 12Z. 
But any rain chance should be gone by the mid/late afternoon, with
decreasing clouds. A weak midlevel shortwave trough is progged to
cross the area on Thursday, and with forecast soundings showing a
little instability present, a low to slight chance PoP will be 
carried in the afternoon, favoring NE sections where soundings 
show a weaker capping inversion. 

A strengthening low in the lee of the Rockies on Thursday night will 
provide a deep S-SW flow across the TN Valley on Friday.  The jet 
streak rotating around the base of the closed upper low will move 
into West and Middle TN Friday night, becoming favorably
positioned to provide strong upper divergence. Frontogentic 
forcing in the jet exit region peaks over our area around 06Z 
Saturday. The overnight timing will mean limited instability, but 
given the strong dynamic forcing and high shear that may be 
present, there appears to at least be some potential for severe 
storms at this point. Will add a mention of this to the HWO.

High temps will peak in the lower to mid 70s on Friday before colder 
air arrives behind the front on Saturday. Still, it will not be a 
bitterly cold air mass, with highs in the mid/upper 50s Saturday and 
lows in the 30s Saturday night. The next chance of rain appears to 
come on Monday as a cold front sags slowly southward across the OH 
Valley and a series of weak disturbances move through a nearly zonal 
flow aloft.

adjustment was to take some areas from sunny to mostly sunny.
A cirrus band is currently oriented NW to SE and is moving NE 
into our area from out of Middle TN and Northern Alabama, which
will impede some of the sunshine. Other than that, everything 
looks good. Will send new zones to get rid of morning fog wording 
and for sky adjustment. Happy Washington's Birthday!

.AVIATION...

VFR conditions currently and forecast to continue throughout the
TAF cycle at CHA and TYS. The main challenge this TAF issuance
will be timing the improvements at TRI over the next couple of
hours. Conditions should improve to MVFR around 14z quickly 
improving to VFR by 15z. Light winds are forecast through the TAF 
cycle. Fog will be possible once again late in the TAF period but 
kept conditions VFR for now.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Mostly clear skies and light winds have lead to ideal radiational 
cooling conditions this morning with patchy fog being reported. 
Above average temperatures continue this morning with lows in the 
upper 30s and 40s. Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air 
analysis indicates the closed low is now out over the Atlantic with 
a strong upper level ridge building into the region. The ridge will 
lead to subsidence and dry conditions throughout the short-term 
forecast. Models indicate that 500 dm heights are already in excess 
of 580 dm, therefore, expect well above normal highs for today. It 
does not look like it will be the warmest day of the year 
(temperatures on February 12th were in the mid 70s for all climate 
sites). Forecast highs are also still a couple of degrees below 
records for the day. The record for today are 78 for Chattanooga 
in 1986, 75 for Knoxville in 1986, and 75 for the Tri-Cities in 
2014. Current forecast highs are 74, 72, 72 for Chattanooga, 
Knoxville, and the Tri-Cities respectively. Much above normal 
temperatures will continue into the overnight hours as the ridge 
axis passes just to the east. Overnight lows are forecast to be in
the mid 40s to low 50s.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday...

The extended will begin with unseasonably warm temperatures and 
the approach of a weakening cold front. Models have had a 
difficult time with the front in regards to timing...strength and 
amount of moisture available. While there continues to be some 
discrepancy in the details...the overall trend is for increasing 
clouds Tuesday with a few possible isolated showers beginning to 
push in late in the afternoon. The main band of showers should 
move through Tuesday night. Available moisture and strength now 
look sufficient enough for widespread showers across the area and 
have increased pops to likely category. The showers should slowly 
exit the area on Wednesday. Models have also had problems 
resolving the weather pattern for Thursday...current thinking 
brings in a weak short wave for a slight chance of showers and 
even a possible rumble of thunder. Another cold front is progged 
into the the region on Friday/Friday night. Timing has been an 
issue with this feature as well. Current model runs are trending 
towards a Friday night frontal passage. Warm...moist air will be 
in place ahead of the system and should allow the atmosphere to 
become at least weakly unstable. Could see a some scattered 
convection develop well ahead of the front for Friday afternoon. 
However...the main activity currently looks to occur Friday night.
Overnight ...the stability should be limited...but still expect 
to see some thunderstorm activity. Behind the front for Saturday 
and Sunday... temperatures will fall to near normal levels. A few 
scattered showers may linger into Saturday morning but 
otherwise...high pressure will build in for dry conditions.

VFR conditions currently at the terminals. A ridge of high
pressure building in has lead to ideal radiational cooling
conditions tonight with mostly clear skies and light winds. MVFR
fog is forecast to develop at the terminals over the next couple
of hours with highest probabilities of occurrence at CHA and TRI.
Additionally, have a TEMPO group at TRI near sunrise to account
for the possibility of brief IFR conditions. Any fog will mix out
quickly after sunrise with VFR conditions after 14z.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...Things looking much better for 
this forecast period as high pressure is building into the area. 
Clouds will continue to decrease tonight and allow for mostly clear 
skies. Clear skies, calm winds, and lingering low-level moisture 
will allow for fog to develop once again. The NAM is very aggressive 
with fog while other models are not. For now will go with areas of 
fog across the whole CWA but patchy dense fog is certainly possible. 
Will keep a close eye on fog development overnight and adjust as 
necessary. Lows tonight will be mild again with lows in the upper 
30s to lower 40s, around 8 to 10 degrees above normal. Tomorrow we 
will be centered under a ridge of high pressure. Mostly sunny skies 
with high temps in the upper 60s to lower 70s can be expected. While 
no record highs are in danger of being broken, high temps will be 
around 15 to 18 degrees above normal. 

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)... Monday night will be dry 
with clouds increasing on Tuesday ahead of an approaching cold 
front. Forecast models still have some discrepancies with regards to 
this front, but they all show it weakening as it approaches the area 
Tuesday night. There should still be enough moisture present to 
produce some showers Tuesday night, but no significant rainfall is 
expected. Increased moisture remains in place over the forecast area 
for the remainder of the workweek. Some scattered showers are 
possible Wednesday, and models indicate another weak disturbance 
moving through on Thursday, but models aren't resolving it great and 
there are many differences between each forecast, so have 
broadbrushed slight chance to chance PoPs to account for this. There 
does appear to be enough instability Thursday include a slight 
chance of thunder, but confidence is low. A low pressure system will 
strengthen over the Midwest and drag another cold front through the 
area Friday/Friday night. Warm, moist air ahead of this front will 
help increase instability and the front should provide enough 
forcing to potentially trigger some thunderstorms with this system. 
The front pushes east of the area Saturday, and another high 
pressure system brings a return to clear skies for the Second half 
of the weekend. It will be unseasonably warm with highs 10-20 
degrees above normal through Friday. Slightly more seasonable air 
will filter into the area for next weekend behind the frontal 
passage, with highs dropping back down into the 50s and 60s.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

A mild start to the day currently with temperatures in the mid 40s 
to low 50s. Seeing some patchy fog on the observations but not 
expecting anything to get down low enough for a dense fog advisory 
this morning. Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis 
indicates a closed low spinning overhead. At the surface, there is a 
trough to the east of the Appalachian Mountains. 

For today, the closed low will transition to an open wave and will 
be located just off the South Carolina coast by the end of the day. 
Expect fog and light drizzle will continue this morning with a small 
chance of a shower across the higher elevations. The main challenge 
will be how long do the clouds hold in across the area. Low level 
isentropic lift looks to come to an end by early this afternoon with 
clearing skies from southwest to northeast. A ridge will quickly 
move in behind the departing low with 500 mb heights of 580-583 dm 
building in by the end of the day. These higher heights aloft will 
produce much warmer than normal temperatures across the area with 
highs today generally in the mid to upper 60s. If clouds clear out 
sooner could see temperatures warm into the low 70s in a few 
locations. Drier air will settle into the area tonight with PW 
values in the 0.3-0.5 inch range. Warmer than average lows will 
continue tonight with temperatures generally in the upper 30s to mid 
40s.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...

A strong ridge of high pressure will remain positioned over the 
eastern U.S. on Monday for a seasonally warm and dry day. On 
Tuesday...will see a cold front approach the region. Models have 
struggled with the timing and strength of this system. The current
trend is towards a slower approach...so have pushed low pops to 
late in the day Tuesday with the main band of showers and highest 
pops expected late Tuesday night and Wednesday. There continues to
be questions as to strength and amount of moisture associated 
with the boundary. This is due mainly to the effect of another low
moving through along the gulf. As such...have kept pops in chance
category for now. For the rest of the extended...there continues 
to be poor agreement with models. Overall...it looks to be a 
rather unsettle period. A weak short wave is expected to move 
through the region around Thursday but strength and track remain a
question and have kept pops around 20 to 30. Then...another 
frontal boundary is expected to move in around the Friday/Saturday
time frame. With warm...moisture air moving in ahead of the 
system...could see weak instability develop over southern areas 
for a chance of thunder. As for timing...have trended highest pops
for Friday/Friday night. Temperatures will be well above normal 
for much of the period.

low. A weak disturbance within this circulation will move across
the Southern Appalachian region overnight generating a couple

development. Would expect visibility to stay in an mvfr category
due to the protective blanket of low ceilings. Slow improvement
will occur in the lower category flight weather on Sunday with a
gradual return to vfr conditions as some drier air filters in
behind the departing upper low.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...Upper-level low rotates through 
the area tonight with a few lingering showers around, mainly from 
the Central Valley and northward, and moreso across Northeast TN and 
Southwest Virginia. Precip amounts will be light with only a few 
hundredths of an inch expected as we will be on the back side of 
this feature with the main jet energy having already moved off to 
our east. Patchy fog could develop tonight due to mild overnight 
lows and elevated dewpoints. Winds should be light but dense cloud 
cover could prevent development.

A few light showers/drizzle may linger around on Sunday morning 
across aforementioned areas but any precip that falls will be 
very light. Skies will gradually clear through the day as the low 
moves further off to our east and high pressure slowly begins to 
build back into the area. All areas should see sunshine by mid to 
late afternoon. Warmer tomorrow due to increasing heights and 
decreasing clouds. Temps will range from the low to mid 60s north 
to mid to upper 60s south.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...Ridging over the 
eastern US will result in dry and warm conditions to start the 
extended period. The ridge will push off the east coast on Tuesday 
as two weather features approach the area. A low centered over 
central Canada will drag the tail end of a cold front across 
northern portions of the forecast area Tuesday night into Wednesday, 
bringing some light rain showers to SW Virginia and NE Tennessee.  A 
second closed low will slide across southern Texas and into the Gulf 
of Mexico Tuesday into Wednesday, pulling Gulf moisture into the 
southeast US. Most of the rain associated with this second system 
will stay to our south, but some showers may work into the forecast 
area on Wednesday. Flow briefly becomes zonal on Thursday, with the 
continued slight chance of some light showers. From here, model 
solutions begin to vary with regards to finer details, exact track, 
and timing, but the general consensus is another upper level trough 
digging into the western US with upper level ridging building over 
the east. A low pressure system will strengthen over the Midwest and 
drag a decent looking cold front across the Southeast 
Friday/Saturday. Moist southwest flow ahead of this front will bring 
the chance for showers, and with this warm, moist airmass in place, 
there's the chance for some thunderstorms Friday/Friday night, 
depending how fast the cold front progresses eastward and whether 
its passage lines up with the period of peak instability. The 
majority of next week will be unseasonably warm with highs 10-20 
degrees above normal. More seasonable air will filter into the area 
on Saturday behind the frontal passage, with highs dropping back 
down into the 50s.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast mostly on track this morning but with a 
few minor adjustments. Tried to better pin down precip coverage with
latest HRRR/RUC/NAM. Models in general agreement that better 
chances of precip stay west of I-75, except across the Southern
Valley. Models keep the Northern Valley, Northeast TN, and 
Southwest Virginia relatively dry. So have decreased pop chances 
across these areas through the rest of the day, especially across
NETN and SWVA. Also took down temperatures a few degrees across 
the Central and Southern Valley based on latest hourly obs and 
latest temp guidance. Bumped up Southwest Virginia by a degree or 
two due to lesser chances of rain. Will send out new zones due to 
precip and temp adjustments. All other elements look good at this 
time.

VFR conditions currently at the terminals. Seeing some reports of
rain showers near CHA and moved up the timing of VCSH. Showers
will push northeastward throughout the day into TYS around 13-14z
and TRI after 18z. Ceilings have been higher than previously
forecast and went more optimistic over the next 6-12 hours with
mostly VFR conditions with brief MVFR conditions possible in
heavier showers. MVFR conditions look to return overnight with fog
and low stratus. Some models indicate IFR conditions but
confidence is too low to include it in the TAFs at this time.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Temperatures this morning are the coldest expected throughout the 
forecast period. Some of the cooler valleys will start off in the 
mid to upper 30s with most locations in the 40s. The main feature in 
the short-term forecast will be the closed low currently located 
near Texarkana. Current water vapor imagery indicates moisture 
being pulled northward with this system from the Gulf of Mexico 
into the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee River Valleys. An upper 
level ridge exists just ahead of the advancing closed low 
stretching from the Florida Peninsula northwestward into the Ohio 
River Valley. At the surface, high pressure is now over the 
Atlantic with southerly flow across the area in the low levels. PW
values will increase throughout the morning as moisture advects 
into the area. Model soundings indicate that the atmosphere will 
saturate from the top down as the upper low moves closer. 
Widespread light showers are forecast today as the system moves 
in. Rainfall amounts should be light with amounts ranging from 
0.10-0.25 inches. Widespread cloud cover and precipitation will 
keep temperatures in the 50s throughout much of the day. Due to 
this, went on the lower side of guidance. The closed low will 
transition into an open wave late in the short-term period over 
the Mid-Atlantic. A ridge will build in quickly behind the 
departing system. Northwesterly flow will keep precip. chances in 
for the higher elevations early Sunday morning.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...

A few showers may linger over far northeastern locations early 
Sunday morning as Saturday's system exits the area. 
Otherwise...the extended begins in a quiet weather pattern as a 
high pressure ridge builds into the eastern U.S. This will result 
in dry and seasonally warm conditions for Sunday and Monday. For 
the rest of the extended...model and run consistency remains quite
poor. The GFS is faster and wetter with the approach of a cold 
front...progging it into the region Tuesday into Tuesday night. 
The ECMWF is slower with the feature...bringing it through Tuesday
night into Wednesday and trending towards a weakening frontal 
passage. For Thursday...the GFS has fairly zonal flow in place 
with a weak impulse moving through then brings low pressure system
in around the Friday time frame. The ECMWF for the same period 
shows weak ridging for Thursday with a system approaching but not 
quite reaching into the area for Friday. With overall confidence 
low...will make little in the way of changes to the current 
forecast and continue with a strong chance pops for Tuesday night 
and Wednesday...low pops Thursday with increased chances for 
Friday. As for temperatures...will remain in a warm pattern with 
above seasonal temperatures throughout.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Sunday)...A weak H5 trough will move
eastward through the area Saturday, bringing cloudcover, showers,
and cooler temperatures. That will not last long, as high 
pressure quickly builds back in by Sunday, and temperatures climb 
to well above normal readings. The warmth will continue into the 
extended period.

.LONG TERM (Sunday Night through Friday)...High pressure remains 
in control through Monday night with dry conditions and above 
normal temperatures. Model consistency is still poor with the next
weather event. The GFS moves a decent cold front through Tuesday 
night with more moisture and the drier ECMWF holds off the precip 
until Wednesday morning as a disintegrating cold front moves 
through. It appears that the limiting factor for how much moisture
can make it up into our forecast area will be the strength of the
closed low over the Gulf and the ability for associated 
convection along the Gulf Coast to cut off the northward flow of 
moisture. For now, have just broadbrushed chance/ slight chance 
PoPs for this time period. Another low pressure system will 
strengthen over the Midwest by late week, and models all indicate 
the associated cold front pushing through sometime next weekend, 
but differences in timing and amount of moisture that far out in 
the forecast will result in more broadbrushed chance PoPs for 
Friday into the weekend. Warm air will remain firmly entrenched 
over the forecast area for the duration of the extended period 
with high temperatures 10-20 degrees above normal for this time of
year.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Temperatures this morning are the coldest forecast over the next 7 
days. Expect values in the mid 20s to mid 30s by daybreak this 
morning. Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis 
indicates a shortwave trough moving southeast across the Great 
Lakes. This shortwave will bring an increase in clouds later this 
morning to Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia but no 
precipitation is expected with the lack of moisture. A ridge extends 
from the Northern Gulf of Mexico northwards to the Northern Plains. A 
closed low is currently spinning across Texas and will impact the 
weather just beyond the short-term forecast period. At the surface, 
a ridge of high pressure stretches from the Northern Gulf Coast into 
the Great Lakes region. Southwesterly winds will develop today as 
the surface ridge shifts to the east. Increasing heights aloft and 
an ample supply of insolation will lead to highs in the upper 50s to 
mid 60s this afternoon. The closed low currently across Texas will 
transitions into an open wave and track to the northeast into the 
Mid-Mississippi River Valley by late tonight. Model soundings 
indicate saturation developing in the mid to upper levels late in 
the forecast period with PW values increasing into the 0.7-0.9 inch 
range by early Saturday morning across the western half of the 
forecast area. Latest model trends indicate precip. starting around 
12z Saturday morning and have left the short-term forecast dry for 
now. Cloud cover will increase tonight with lows in the mid 30s to 
mid 40s.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...

A low pressure system will track northeast across the Southern 
Appalachian Region on Saturday and Saturday night. Scattered 
showers will accompany the low spreading rain across the MRX CWA. 
Temperature profile looks warm enough for an all rain event. A 
ridge of high pressure builds in on Sunday through Monday night 
for dry conditions and above normal temperatures. Model 
consistency becomes quite poor by Tuesday and confidence is low. 
The GFS model shows a more active weather pattern through the rest
of the extended with a cold front moving into the area late 
Tuesday/Tuesday evening...then a low pressure system tracking 
through along the gulf on Wednesday...and a weak short wave on 
Thursday. The ECMWF is slower with the cold front...bringing it in
Tuesday night into Wednesday with weak ridging for Thursday. For 
now will compromise between the two with the best chance of pops 
Tuesday night into Wednesday and a mix of 20 to 30 pops through 
the rest of the extended. With a warm air mass in place...expect 
generally rain thorugh the period.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...Surface high pressure will 
continue to extend into our area as the upper level ridge centered 
to our west builds east. Will be some mainly high/mid clouds around 
tonight especially north, which will then decrease on Friday.  After 
seasonable low temperatures tonight, it will be warmer Friday with 
temperatures climbing to well above normal.  

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)... Upper level SW flow 
Friday night will advect moisture into the area and clouds will 
start to increase ahead of a closed low tracking across OK/AR/TX. 
This looks to be a favorable setup for deep convection near the Gulf 
Coast, which would cut off much of the moisture flow to our area. 
Therefore, continue to think that precip will be light Saturday and 
Saturday night as the low moves across Tennessee. Have limited POPs 
to chance categories because of this. Upper level deep ridging and 
associated surface high pressure will build in for Sunday through 
Tuesday, providing mostly clear skies and above normal temperatures. 
Highs should peak around 70 degrees Monday and Tuesday. Clouds begin 
to build back into the area Tuesday afternoon, under SW flow again 
ahead of the next low pressure system.  This low is progged to track 
even further south, moving across TX and into the Gulf of Mexico, 
which again would trigger convection across the Gulf Coast and limit 
moisture advection over the Tennessee Valley.  For now, have limited 
POPs associated with this system around 30 percent due to 
uncertainty on how much moisture will be available over our area.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...Prevailing northwesterly flow 
on the back side of the Eastern U.S. long wave trough should bring
mostly dry air and sunshine to the area today. A few mid deck 
variety clouds will stream southeast across Southwest Virginia and
Northeast Tennessee during the first half of the day but there 
still should be a fair amount of sunshine in this region; 
especially during the afternoon. High pressure will be edging 
farther east through the southeastern states in an effort to 
replace the departing upper trough. Temperatures should be near 
mid February norms through the period. 

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...Friday will be dry and 
warmer as a ridge builds over the area. Full sun highs should be 
reached, in the lower to mid 60s. Clouds will start to increase on
Friday night ahead of a closed low tracking east across OK/AR. 
The position of the southern stream jet and high theta-e air at 
850 mb near the Gulf Coast will likely produce deep convection in 
that area, preventing northward transport of deep moisture. Thus, 
precip in our area will be light on Saturday and Saturday night as
the low moves across TN. The closed low transitions to an open 
wave, and will be east of the mountains Sunday morning. 

A highly amplified ridge will be over the region for Sunday PM 
through Tuesday, providing mostly clear skies and above normal 
temperatures. Temperatures will peak in the upper 60s to lower 70s 
on Tuesday. The ridge gives way on Wednesday as a closed low tracks 
slowly along the TX/LA coastline. Isentropic lift ahead of this 
system may bring light precip into the area starting Tuesday night. 
Like the previous system, the southern position of this low may 
result in Gulf Coast convection limiting the depth of moisture that 
is advected northward.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...Surface high pressure will 
build into the region.  Some sheared energy rotating around the 
Northeast US upper low will help to bring some high/mid clouds 
especially north late tonight into thursday, but no precipitation is 
anticipated for the short term period. Temperatures will be not far 
from seasonal normals. Just some minor adjustments to MAV temps.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...Dry NW flow ahead
of Midwest ridge starts to shift east Thursday night as surface high 
pressure drifts east along the Gulf coast. One more cold night early 
Friday with lows again near to slightly below freezing. Warming 
trend Friday as surface winds switch to southwest. Highs about 10 to 
12 degrees above normal...upper 50s to mid 60s. Models still want to 
take a closed low from Arkansas early Saturday and across Tennessee 
during the day then east across the Carolinas Saturday night into 
Sunday morning. Rain to spread from southwest to northeast during 
the day Saturday as the upper low moves east. Convection along the 
Gulf Coast late Saturday and Saturday night may limit moisture 
return so only light amounts of rain expected. System will shift 
east by Sunday morning. 

As skies clear Sunday highs actually will be warmer and ridge of 
high pressure begins to build over the southeast states. This ridge 
expands Monday then begins to break down Tuesday as front moves into 
Ohio Valley and surface low and weak front moves across Texas gulf 
coast toward the Mississippi River. Moisture will gradually increase 
Tuesday with a chance of showers late...continuing into Wednesday. 
Temperatures will stay much above normal Sunday through Wednesday. 
Highs will be in the 60s Sunday...then upper 60s to lower 70s Monday 
and Tuesday. Slightly cooler Wednesday with a chance of showers.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...Upper trough will move rapidly
east across the Southern Appalachians this morning producing
mostly rain, but some higher elevation snow is possible across
Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee; mainly above 3000 feet
elevation where a tight 85h temperature gradient with sub-freezing
air is impinging early this morning. Model solutions move this
system out of the region by mid to late morning. However, some
lower clouds could hang around for several hours into the
afternoon; especially across northern parts of the viewing area.
Temperatures will be about five to eight degrees cooler today in
the cold air advection pattern behind the departing pressure
system. It should be clear and colder tonight with some radiation
occurring under clear to partly cloudy skies.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...A dry NW flow aloft in 
advance of a building Midwest ridge will be over the area on 
Thursday, while surface high pressure will be drifting east along 
the Gulf coast. This will provide mostly clear skies and a warming
trend into Friday. Near normal highs can be expected Thursday, 
warming to highs 5-10 degrees above normal on Friday.

The mid/upper ridge axis moves to our east on Saturday as a closed 
low tracks into the MS Valley. Rain chances will increase through 
the day on Saturday ahead of this system as it tracks across TN/KY 
through the night.  The setup of the upper jet and 850 mb theta-E 
appears to favor convection along the Gulf Coast that may 
significantly cut off moisture in our area, so PoPs Saturday 
afternoon and night will be kept in the chance range, and QPF 
appears light. Current timing of the system may keep a slight chance 
of rain into Sunday morning. 

A large ridge builds over the Southeast on Monday. This will bring 
mild temperatures and sunny skies, and highs on Monday are expected 
to reach the upper 60s to lower 70s. The GFS and ECMWF differ on the 
timing of the next system, with the ECMWF being more progressive in 
pushing a cold front toward the area. The size of the preceding 
ridge suggests the slower GFS may be the better solution, but with 
some uncertainty, will have a slight chance PoP for Tuesday to 
maintain forecast continuity.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Wednesday)...

Current radar imagery indicates an area of precipitation just north 
of I-40 progressing eastward. The low-levels remain dry across the 
area with surface dewpoints in the teens and 20s. Wet-bulbing in the 
low levels is leading to a few reports of light sleet from time to 
time with temperatures in the 40s to low 50s. In addition, seeing 
radar returns diminish as they progress eastward into the drier air. 
Therefore, any precipitation that occurs this afternoon and evening 
will be light with amounts of a couple of hundredths at most. 

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate two 
troughs of interest. The first is a closed low across the Southern 
Plains with the second moving southeast out of Canada into the Great 
Lakes. At the surface, low pressure is centered near the 
Texas/Louisiana line with a warm front stretching to the east just 
inland along the northern Gulf Coast. To the north, an arctic 
boundary is moving southward into the Northern Plains and Great 
Lakes. These two upper level features and surface features will be 
the main players over the short-term forecast. 

Overnight, the surface low will track to near Columbus, MS around 
midnight. Strong isentropic lift along the north side of the warm 
front will eventually saturate the low levels of the atmosphere with 
widespread precipitation expected after midnight. At this point, the 
arctic boundary will push southward into the Ohio River Valley. This 
system is taking a climatologically favored track for a widespread 
snowfall across the forecast area but the surface temperatures 
remain too warm for any snowfall outside of the higher elevations. 
The freezing level begins to drop after midnight as the arctic 
boundary nudges into the area. Expect to see a mixture of rain/snow 
develop in the mountains for elevations generally above 3 kft just 
after midnight. Eventually, should see a period of all snow for the 
higher elevations after 3-4 am or so with some minor accumulations 
of wet snow. For now, expect amounts will be around 1-2 inches for 
elevations above 3 kft. Regardless, lows should only be around 32-33 
degrees and do not anticipate any major travel issues and will go 
with a SPS for now. As for the valley, expect all rain with amounts 
ranging from 0.25-0.50 inches. 

Slightly cooler temperatures are expected tomorrow with highs in the 
upper 30s to upper 40s. A few snow showers will persist thanks to 
northwest flow across the mountains but will come to an end by the 
afternoon.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday Night through Tuesday)...

The long term fcst sees two periods of unsettled weather with a 
gradual warming trend which will bring daytime highs and overnight 
lows to about 15 degrees above normal by the the early part of next 
week.

First period of pcpn looks to move into the SW portions of the area 
Saturday afternoon then spread NE through the evening hours. Models 
are in fair agreement for this event which is tied to a middle to 
upper level low ejecting NE out of Texas. The best moisture with 
this system as it tracks NE across the area is confined to the 
middle levels. With little moisture inflow in the lower levels, 
models suggest less than 0.2 inches of rainfall with this quickly 
moving system that will exit the area during the overnight hours of 
Saturday night. 

Rather strong ridge then follows on Monday becoming amplified over 
much of the SE US as the next mid to upper low, in a fairly steady 
progression of pacific lows, begins to push eastward across Northern 
Mexico. There is fair model agreement on the progression of the mid 
to upper feature, however interaction between the northern and 
southern streams in the model is a much lower confidence event. As a 
northern stream shortwave attempts to weaken the ridge and allow for 
the associated surface front to sneak into the area by late in the 
period, the models diverge greatly. With split in guidance on 
whether boundary can push far enough south to be a weather maker, 
have trended toward slight chance POPS across the southern two-
thirds of the area for now which is in fair agreement with GFS 
Ensemble and ECMWF while the GFS continues to keep things dry across 
the area at that time.

.DISCUSSION...

The surface low is currently located near Houston with a warm
front stretching to the east along the northern Gulf Coast.
Current radar imagery indicates an area of showers from Arkansas
to Kentucky with isentropic lift to the north of the warm front. 
Dry air in the low-levels is making it difficult for 
precipitation to make it to the ground on the eastern edge. The 
12z sounding this morning from OHX depicts significant dry air 
below 750 mb. Therefore, expect precipitation chances will hold 
off until at least 18z with best chances coming between 06-12z 
tonight. 

For the update, lowered highs just a touch with current
temperatures running below the previous forecast. In addition.
tightened up the PoP gradient during the afternoon with best
chances for precipitation in Tennessee north of I-40.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Thursday night)...
The low pressure system over TX/NM will track east today and
eventually merge with a northern stream low over the Great Lakes
by Wednesday morning. Midlevel clouds ahead of this system are
already moving across Middle TN, and will give mostly cloudy skies
for our area today. Low level dry air and weak lift should result
in most precip holding off until after 00Z this evening, at which
time the surface to 700 mb low crosses the MS Valley and QG
forcing strengthens. Initally the freezing level is well above
mountain top level, but with evaporative cooling, it rapidly drops
to around 3000 ft by 06Z across northern sections. Thus the higher
elevations of NE TN and SW VA could start seeing snow as early as
midnight. The best lift occurs in the 06Z to 12Z window as the
models depict midlevel frontogenesis occurring as the northern and
southern stream systems merge. Precip should start to diminish
after 12Z with rapid drying aloft behind the departing trough.
There are uncertainties with this system, mainly relating to the
timing of precip onset and how quickly temperatures will drop to
change to snow in the mountains, as well as QPF. 1-3 inches of
snow may be possible above 3000 ft, but will allow the day shift
to evaluate the need for any Winter Weather Advisories. 

The rest of the period will be dry with a NW flow and a building
ridge across the Deep South, with temperatures slightly cooler
than normal.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Monday)...
Model depictions of the long term are relatively similar with 
rather pleasant weather expected in terms of another period of 
mild temperatures. The period starts out dry on Friday with a 
short wave ridge moving away from the region. However, a weak 
short wave builds across the southeast states on Saturday 
producing a few showers. Specifics on exact timing of this feature
are typically uncertain six days out. Therefore, some small 
chance pops were broadbrushed across two twelve hour periods here.
Superblend moves this wave out of the area for a dry Sunday 
through daytime period Monday while significant amplification 
develops with a major league upper ridge preceding a healthy short
wave trough, due into the Southeastern U.S. Monday night into 
Tuesday. Temperatures should be very nice during the long term 
with maxes a good ten to twelve degrees above normal while lows 
will be about five to ten degrees milder than typical mid February
minimums.

.DISCUSSION...
Surface high pressure will continue to dominate the weather 
pattern overnight before pushing east on Tuesday. High and mid
clouds will spread in from the north and west Tuesday afternoon,
ahead of a low pressure system that will bring some rain showers
to the area Tuesday evening into Wednesday. For this update,
tweaked hourly temperatures and tonight's low based on
observations and short term model guidance. Lows ended up being a
few degrees cooler in most locations than previous forecast.
Clouds are taking a bit longer to move in than previous forecast,
and dewpoints remain quite low, which will allow for more 
radiational cooling overnight under clear skies with very little 
moisture present.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...High pressure will continue to 
dominate weather across the Southern Appalachian Region tonight for 
mostly clear skies...light winds and seasonal temperatures.  The 
high will pull out of the area on Tuesday...allowing a low pressure 
system to approach for the west.  Clouds will increase throughout 
the day with a slight chance of showers moving in late in the 
afternoon as the low advances toward the region.  With high 
temperatures climbing into the 50s across the valley Tuesday 
afternoon...all precip should fall as rain.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday Night through Monday)...Rather impressive 
deep layer low straddling the New Mexico-Mexico border this 
afternoon will be the main player in our next pcpn event Tuesday 
Night and Wednesday. Models remain in agreement with pcpn moving 
in Tuesday night as the surface low center tracks east across 
central portions of Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia before 
moving off the coast by Wednesday night. In a typical winter 
pattern, this low track could be a snow maker for the area. 
However, there is no substantial cold air in place north of the 
low in order to make this happen. Tuesday night lows are expected 
to be in the middle to upper 30s across much of the Tennessee 
Valley while temperatures at 850 mb struggle to get below freezing
until Wednesday morning across the northern third and Wednesday 
afternoon across the southern third of the area. Both too late to 
produce any snowfall other than in the highest elevations where 
less than an inch of snowfall can be expected, mainly in the 
morning hours on Wednesday. Even with this snowfall, warm surface 
temperatures will likely result in minimal accumulations on the 
ground by late Wednesday morning. To further lend support to a 
cold rain event, guidance has been consistent regarding dew points
that are expected to remain at or above freezing until after the 
best pcpn chances have shifted east of the area negating any wet 
bulb effect to pcpn type.

Beyond this event, another ridge axis builds northward across the 
area through Friday ahead of the next pacific low pushing NE from 
northern Mexico on Saturday. Track of this low is much further N 
than the Wednesday system, and once again, these February 
temperatures which continue to run about 8-11 degrees above normal 
should be warm enough to keep any pcpn with this event also in the 
form of rain, excepting for locally higher elevations.

Things dry out and heat up further by Monday as a ridge over the SE 
US amplifies ahead of next pacific deep layer low approaching from 
northern Mexico. With temperatures running about 15-20 degrees above 
normal, it looks to be a very unseasonable start to the work week.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Winds overnight have been well below advisory criteria at all
observation points, and the trend through the morning should be
diminishing winds as high pressure builds in from the west. So the
wind advisory will be canceled. Today, the surface high center
will be over KY, wtih and a deep dry NW flow aloft. 850 mb cold
advection will continue but with full sun, highs will be in the
50s across the Valley, a bit above normal. Clear and calm
conditions tonight will allow lows to drop into the 20s and 30s.  

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...
One more day of slightly above normal temperatures ahead of our 
next system. A low moving across the Southeastern United states 
will be the main focus for precipitation chances. Precipitation 
could start ahead of the main system as early as Tuesday afternoon
and continue until it exits the region on Wednesday. Given that 
it's a low moving near us in the middle of February would seem to 
suggest that snow is a possibility...but due to the very warm 
temperatures ahead of the system it seems like this system will 
likely bring just cold rain to the majority of our forecast area. 
Forecast soundings show that temperatures will likely remain above
freezing on Tuesday into Wednesday before dipping below freezing 
Wednesday night after the precipitation has exited the area. Dew 
points are forecasted to remain a few degrees above freezing in 
the Valley which would also lend credence towards the fact that 
most will see a cold rain. In the higher terrain and isolated 
locations in Northeast Tennessee/Southwest Virginia we could see a
brief switchover to snow overnight , but with the very warm 
temperatures recently it will be difficult for light snow to 
accumulate on the warm grounds. 

After this system moves on out we will start to get ridging building 
in from the west leading to another warm up with weekend 
temperatures climbing into the 60's and maybe even flirting with 70 
around Chattanooga. A weak shortwave trough is forecasted to move 
through over the weekend as well and could bring another shot at 
precipitation. With the warm temperatures forecasted over the 
weekend, if we do see any precip, it would be in the form of rain.

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Monday/...
A cold front is moving through the eastern Tennessee Valley this
afternoon. Ahead of the front, a prefrontal trough has triggered
some scattered showers that are quickly racing through the Valley
and across the Mountains into NC. Ahead of the front, very mild,
near record to record high temperatures are prevailing, with many
stations peaking in the 70s. A big change is coming behind the
front as colder and drier air is moving in. Winds will quickly
veer to the NW with the frontal passage, and between 00-03z, the
clouds will dissipate as drier air filters in. The result will be
a mostly clear night, allowing temperatures to drop close to the
freezing mark across much of the Valley by sunrise. Additionally,
very breezy/gusty NW winds are expected due to the tight pressure
gradient. Along the high terrain of far NE TN and SW NC, a Wind
Advisory is warranted which is in effect from 00-18z Monday. The
breezy winds will continue on Monday, reinforcing the cooler and
drier air mass. This will keep highs near seasonable levels in the
mid to upper 50s for Monday, despite the abundant sunshine. 

.LONG TERM /Monday Night through Sunday/...
An upper ridge will remain in control through Tuesday for dry 
conditions and seasonal temperatures. The main system of concern 
through the extended will be a low pressure system moving in 
around the Wednesday time frame. Model consistency has been quite 
poor in regards to timing and track of this system and confidence 
low on details. However...the overall trend brings isolated to 
scattered showers into the area Tuesday evening with the main band
moving in late Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning...then 
lingering showers Wednesday afternoon as the system exits the 
area. Temperature profile looks warm enough for a mainly rain 
event with a mix of rain and snow possible over northern areas and
across higher elevations...mainly during late night/early morning
hours. Cool and dry northwest flow on Thursday and Friday will 
provide generally dry conditions with near seasonal temperatures. 
An upper level ridge builds in for a dry weekend with warmer 
temperatures.

.DISCUSSION...
An upper-level trough will amplify as it drops out the northern
Plains into the Ohio Valley this afternoon, and eventually the
Tennessee Valley this evening. This feature will send a cold
front/prefrontal trough across Middle Tennessee and the eastern
Tennessee Valley by this evening. Accompanying this feature will
be some isolated to scattered showers -- especially during the
afternoon. However, QPF will be fairly light due to limited
coverage, so have decreased PoP/QPF slightly. Some breaks in the
clouds this morning have allow for some heating (as some lower 
70s have already popped up across the southern and central Valley.
Though temperatures will not change much this afternoon as clouds
rolls in, a few records may be in jeopardy -- especially at KTRI 
and other areas across NE TN and SW VA.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Showers have started to move into the area, but the models have
generally been overdone with precip over the past 24 hours. The
foecast for today will undercut model PoPs and QPF as moisture
will remain shallow and forcing/instability will be weak. Through
the morning, isentropic lift will produce cloduy skies and isolated
to scattered showers, with the most likely time for rain coming 
around 18Z when convergence along a pre-frontal trough moves 
through. Given the expected overcast cloud cover, will cut a few
degrees off high temps shown by MOS, but TRI's record of 68 should
still be easily broken.

Frontal passage occurs this evening between 21Z and 00Z, followed
by clearing skies and strong cold advection. Lows tonight will
fall into the upper 20s to mid 30s. Winds will be gusty through
the night, but below advisory criteria on our side of the
mountains in the NW flow pattern.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...
A mostly dry forecast for the upcoming work week and into next 
weekend. Dry and cool northwest flow will be well established by 
Monday leading to near normal temperatures under sunny skies. The 
only decent chance for precipitation in the long term will come on 
Tuesday into Wednesday as a split system moves through the United 
States. As mentioned in previous forecast discussions models have 
disagreed with how to handle this system but are slowly starting to 
trend towards each other. Right now it appears that the better 
chance for precipitation will come from the trough moving across the 
Southern United States. Depending on the exact track/speed we could 
see precipitation start Tuesday night and continue through Wednesday 
night. Best chances will be in our southern counties closer to the 
track of the low. There is some indication in the models that the 
northern system could have moisture dip down far enough to the south 
that we get some in our area, and it could combine with cold 
temperatures to bring a chance for light precipitation in the higher 
elevations. 

After these systems and the fronts associated with them move on 
through we will clear the sky out and maintain temperatures 
relatively near normal through the rest of the work week. Ridging 
starts to build in over the weekend and we will once again see 
temperatures rising into the 60's in the Valley.

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Sunday/...
Isentropic lift ahead of an approaching shortwave trough will 
generate some scattered light rain showers overnight will continue
throughout most of the night. In addition, low clouds and patchy
fog is expected off and on, especially after midnight.
Temperatures will not drop much overnight, and in fact, may
increase slightly a few hours before sunrise as a LLJ ramps up
again. The breezy winds on Sunday morning will warm the Tennessee
Valley quickly after sunrise -- and all the way into the mid 60s 
to lower 70s by 18z or so. This could produce near record high 
temperatures in a few locations across SW VA and NE TN. Another 
round of showers are expected on Sunday as a cold front approaches
the region from the west. The timing of the front looks to be 
between 18-21z along the plateau and 21-00z across the rest of the
Valley. In it's wake, cold air advection will take place, along 
with some drier air (and an end to the precipitation). 



.LONG TERM /Sunday Night through Saturday/...
Not much change in the long term forecast over the past few days.
To start the period we have a cold front moving through the area,
which should be east of us shortly after the period begins. As of
now, it looks like it takes a while for temperatures to drop 
behind the front so by the time it is cold enough for snow any 
lingering moisture will already be gone. So have removed all snow 
chances from forecast for Sunday night. Flow quickly shifts to 
northwest behind front and breezy winds can be expected across the
higher elevations, along with cooler and much drier air moving 
in. Monday will feature plenty of sunshine but we will see about a
15 to 20 degree temperature drop. High temps will be in the upper
40s to mid 50s. Expect increasing cloud cover on Tuesday as our 
next system approaches, but a dry forecast still in store. Highs 
will be in the lower to mid 50s. 

Timing is a little better for our mid-week system but with still the 
same model disagreement on track as seen in previous runs. Upper low 
begins approaching the area Tuesday night and moves through 
Wednesday but the GFS continues to keep the low south, leaving us 
precip free. The ECMWF continues to show a more northerly track, 
thus brining precip into the area. So while timing is starting to 
come together the track is still up in the air. Will continue to go 
with superblend guidance which gives us slight chance pops north and 
chance pops south for Wednesday, until better model agreement. 
Again, if the ECMWF is correct we could still see some light snow on 
the back end of the system across the high terrain of our eastern 
mountains. System moves east of us by Wednesday night but we remain 
in northwest flow. Some clouds around Thursday as a weak impulse 
moves down through the long wave trough, seasonal temps expected. 
Friday we start to see ridging build back into the area ending our 
NW flow pattern, which puts us back into the mid to upper 50s. 
Ridging even stronger Saturday and we are in the low to mid 60s. 
Thursday through Saturday look dry for now.

A LLJ ramps up this morning, bringing in a plume of Gulf moisture
into the forecast area. Isolated to scattered rain showers are
expected overspread the eastern Tennesse Valley this morning
through the mid afternoon -- in response to the lift and moisture
in place. By the late afternoon and evening, this activity should
begin to wane (from south to north). Despite the overcast day
expected, the breezy southwest flow at the surface will warm
temperatures in the upper 50s to lower 60s by the afternoon.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Low level moisture will be spreading into the area from the west
this morning, keeping cloudy skies in place through the day.
Shallow isentropic lift at the 295K level may be adequate to
produce some light rain or drizzle today. Will keep chances of
measureable precip at only slight chances today. The models show
the isentropic lift picking up slightly tonight in advance of a
850 mb shortwave trough, and produce a little more QPF. Will bring
PoPs up into the low chance range, but with very light amounts. 
With the expected cloud cover, will lean toward cooler highs today
and warmer lows tonight compared to MOS.

Obs overnight have shown wind gusts in the 40s in Wise County,
with a slight decreasing trend in the past couple hours. The Wind
Advisory expiration time of 12Z looks on track. 

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...
One more day of very warm temperatures and rain 
chances on Sunday ahead of the front. This will be our warmest 
day, by far, of this forecast with high temperatures reaching into
the 60's and 70's in the Valley. Still look on track to be 
flirting with record high temperature for KTRI Sunday as well. 
Also still on track to see some light showers this day as well 
until the front moves through and clears out the sky as well as 
dropping our temperatures. Once the front pushes through Sunday 
night we will experience drier west/north winds for several days 
which will help keep temperatures down much closer to normal (or 
even below normal).

Most interesting weather feature for our area this forecast will 
come next week as a couple of lows/troughs moves across the United 
States. ECMWF and GFS still differ on their solutions with how to 
handle the synoptic elements of this system. GFS keeps the southern 
system much further south and slower than the ECMWF and keeps the 
moisture wrapped up with it generally out of our area to the east 
and south. Th ECMWF, however, wants to keep the southern system a 
bit quicker and further to the north which would bring more moisture 
and better lift to our forecast area. ECMWF shows a potential for 
snow in the higher elevation of Northeast Tennessee/Southwest 
Virginia behind the fronts associated with these systems, but will 
wait till better agreement between the models before bringing in any 
widespread snowfall into the actual forecast.

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Saturday/...
Good radiational cooling will take place this evening with high 
pressure promoting clear and dry conditions. Winds, however, will
begin to pick up along the high terrain after sunset -- and across
the rest of the area after midnight as a LLJ cranks up over Middle
TN. This will create some Advisory level wind gusts over the Great
Smoky Mountains and thus have a Wind Advisory there from 00-12Z 
on Saturday. This LLJ will bring in some moist, Gulf air into the
region late tonight into Saturday. As a result, clouds will
increase over the area between 06-12z, and some isolated to
scattered light shower activity will be possible throughout the
day on Saturday. The southerly winds will also help knock
temperatures into the upper 50s to lower 60s by the afternoon,
despite the cloud cover. 

.LONG TERM /Saturday Night through Friday/...
Very mild to start off the period with overnight lows Saturday in
the mid to upper 50s. These lows will be around 20 to 25 degrees 
above normal. These lows will also be warmer than our normal daily
highs. Models have actually sped up Sunday's precip arrival and 
are now more in line with what the ECMWF was showing yesterday. 
Models seem to be in good agreement that the bulk of the precip 
will move through Sunday afternoon and the front will be through 
the area by around 00z Sunday. Highs on Sunday will be in the 
upper 60s to near 70. TRI could break their daily max of 68 set 
back in 1938. As the front passes through we will switch to a 
northwest flow. Northwest flow will squeeze out any lingering 
moisture up across extreme NETN where upslope flow may lead to a 
few flurries Sunday night. Clouds clear quickly through the night 
behind the front with clearing skies and dropping temperatures. 
Temps will bottom out in the lower to mid 30s. 

Overall, we reside in a long wave trough NW flow pattern through the 
rest of the long term. Behind the front we cool down into the upper 
40s to low 50s for Monday under sunny skies. Clouds start to 
increase Tuesday out ahead of our next system. Models still widely 
varying with solutions for the mid-week system. GFS continues to keep 
the low suppressed far to our south, keeping us precip free. The 
ECMWF actually has moved further north in its latest run, brining in 
more precip than previous ECMWF runs. The northern movement in the 
low in the latest run actually allows the system to phase up much 
better with the long wave trough and colder air. If the latest run 
of the ECMWF ends up being correct, we could see some rain change to 
snow by Wednesday night. Again though, models still really 
struggling with this system so very low confidence at this point. 
Both models show the system to our east on Thursday. Chilly on 
Thursday in the wake of the system but warmer and drier on Friday as 
high pressure starts to build back in.

.DISCUSSION...
A quiet morning across the eastern Tennessee Valley and Southern
Appalachian region with high pressure at the surface in control.
NW flow aloft has pushed an area of dense mid/high clouds into NE
TN and SW VA. These clouds will stick around through midday and
early afternoon, before quickly exiting into NC. Thus, heating
will be slightly more limited further north and east. However,
winds will veer to the SW by the afternoon, and with the partly to
mostly sunny conditions -- a much warmer day is on tap by the
afternoon. Highs in the mid to upper 50s are expected across most
of the Valley, with lower 40s more likely over the far
northeastern zones in SW VA and NE TN.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
A dry NW flow in the mid to upper levels will continue today, while 
high pressure at the surface will be drifting east across the 
Carolinas. Scattered high clouds should have little impact today, 
and full sun should bring high temps into the 50s for the entire TN 
Valley, with CHA approaching 60. Tonight, with the surface to 850 mb 
high near FL and a strengthening low pressure system moving into the 
Great Lakes, a strong LLJ will develop over the TN Valley region. 
While the W-SW direction of the jet will not favor a mountain wave 
setup, model depictions of 50-60 kt winds at 850 mb could result in 
advisory level winds in the higher elevations. The Wind Advisory for 
the Smokies will be continued. Resulting warm advection with the jet 
will also bring an increase in clouds late tonight. 

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)... 
Temperatures will keep increasing on Saturday as the low level jet 
continues to crank in warm air from our southwest while ridging 
builds pressure over the area. This trend will continue on Sunday as 
a front approaches the area, to the point where some places might 
flirt with 70 degrees for a high temperature on Sunday. These 
temperatures will be running about 20 degrees above normal, and the 
Tri-Cities record high for January 12th is 68 set back in 1938, 
which will be in danger of falling as the forecast high is right 
around that mark. Knoxville and Chattanooga both have record highs 
of 76 degrees for that day, so their records will be more difficult 
to break. On thing that could dampen record high chances is some 
precipitation that will be possible over the weekend.

We could see a round of rain ahead of the front as some moisture 
might be drawn off of the main jet to our north and combine with 
lift ahead of the front. If any rain does occur it would be pretty 
light as the moisture in the atmosphere will be pretty minor, but 
there should be enough to keep us somewhat cloudy through the 
weekend. As the front pushes through late Sunday/early Monday we 
could drop temps down quick enough to see a brief switchover to 
light snow flurries in the higher elevations for a brief period of 
time overnight. 

Drier and colder air quickly replaces the warm air, and we get back 
slightly below normal temperatures by the middle of the work week. 
Long term models then show a low/trough diving down out of Canada 
across the Great Lakes and into New England and a second low/trough 
moving across the southern United States as we get closer to the 
weekend. There is disagreement with the strength and speed of the 
southern system which, depending on it's track could bring another 
round of precipitation to our area. Will keep in low end 
precipitation chances for the end of the forecast and wait for model 
trends and better agreement as it gets closer.

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Friday/...
Low stratus and isolated snow showers are finally diminishing
across NE TN and SW VA this afternoon, with no additional
accumulation expected (save for the highest mountain peaks). 
After sunset, the sky will quickly become mostly clear, allowing 
for good radiational cooling in place. The cold, dry air mass will
drop temperatures into the upper teens to mid 20s across much of 
the Valley by the early morning on Friday. A high pressure ridge 
will build in for Friday and winds will veer and increase from the
SW by the afternoon. This will allow for a nice warm-up as highs 
will soar into low to upper 50s across the Valley. Some clouds may
sneak into SW VA during the day, so will keep them a little 
cooler than would otherwise. Overall, A sunny and dry day across 
the Tennessee Valley. 

.LONG TERM /Friday Night through Thursday/...
Models continue to be in modest agreement for the weekend system 
coming through Sunday/Monday. Disagreement still exist on the cut-
off low for next week. 

Friday night we see a very nice rebound in overnight lows with high 
pressure over the South Eastern Coast. Overnight lows will be 15 to 
20 degrees warmer than tonight, which will be around 10 degrees 
above normal. 850 jet really gets going across our area Friday night 
into Saturday morning. Both the GFS and NAM show between 50 and 
60kts. This has prompted the issuance of a wind advisory for the 
high terrain of Blount, Sevier, and Cocke counties. Elevations above 
2500 feet will see sustained winds from 20 to 30 mph with gusts up 
to 40 mph. Elevations above 3500/4000 feet will see sustained winds 
from 25 to 35 mph with gusts up to 50 mph. The strong LLJ will also 
create a very strong temperature inversion. Overnight lows Friday 
will be warmer in the high terrain of mountains by as much as 5 to 
10 degrees compared to valley locations.

850 surge of warm air continues on Saturday and further cranks up 
our temperatures into the upper 50s and low 60s. Although warm, 
there will be some cloud cover around out ahead of an approaching 
system on Sunday. There will also be a slight chance of showers 
through the day on Saturday but amounts will be very light. Very 
mild Saturday night with lows warmer than our normal daytime highs! 
Lows will be in the lower to mid 50s, spring-like. Temperatures even 
warmer Sunday with highs in the mid to upper 60s. ECMWF continues to 
be quite a bit faster with precip out ahead of the cold front than 
GFS. ECMWF brings main band of precip in around 00z Monday whereas 
the GFS is closer to 06z Monday. The actual front pushes through 
late Sunday night and brings about a 10 degree cool down for Monday, 
with highs in the lower to mid 50s, but still above normal.

After the front passes we stay in northwest flow through the rest of 
the long term as a long wave trough resides over the entire Eastern 
U.S. Around Tuesday, a large cut-off low is in place over the 
Dessert Southwest and Northern Mexico. The ECMWF and GFS still 
handling progression and development of this system quite different. 
The ECMWF is much quicker to absorb this low into the long wave 
trough and race it through the area Wednesday into Thursday while 
the GFS is much slower and doesn't move it through until 
Thursday/Friday. The GFS also keeps this system suppressed to our 
south with no precip affecting our area. The ECMWF solution would 
bring us some precip. For now, will continue to follow superblend 
guidance on pops until better model agreement.

.DISCUSSION...
Light snow showers will continue along the East Tennessee and
Southwest Virginia Mountains and Valley areas of far Northeast 
Tennessee and Southwest Virginia through 18z or so, before 
tapering off quickly thereafter as drier air moves in. Some slick 
roads are possible in the higher elevations above 3000 feet due to
1/2 an inch to an inch of accumulation. Elsewhere in the Valley, 
a dusting to a 1/4 inch is possible, mainly on cars and roofs -- 
but surface temperatures at/above freezing should not create 
issues on roads. As drier air moves into the region, low stratus 
should break up by mid-afternoon, allow temperatures to climb into
the mid 30s to low 40s in most spots. However, the gusty NW winds
will make it feel colder due to the wind chill, and help 
reinforce the cold air mass now in place.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Behind the cold front that crossed the region late last night, a 
brisk northwest wind will help advect cooler, more seasonable air
into the forecast area. Highs this afternoon will be in the upper
20s/lower 30s across the north and higher elevations and struggle
to reach 40 across most of the Tennessee Valley. It will be 
breezy today with wind gusts up to 35 mph. Additionally, upslope 
flow combined with a bit of lingering moisture will help produce 
some light snow showers across the higher terrain this morning. 
Some light accumulations are possible, generally above 3500 feet. 
No impact is expected at lower elevations. A Special Weather 
Statement has been issued to highlight this potential.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
Models are in modest agreement through Monday on the evolution 
and timing of next frontal system expected to push through the 
area late Sunday and Sunday Night. However, differences arise by 
Tuesday for the following frontal system expected mid-week.

Friday starts with high pressure over the SE US shifting offshore by 
evening as return flow and low level warm air advection starts in 
earnest. Highs Saturday will climb about 10 degrees above normal 
while Sunday may even see daytime highs reach nearly 20 degrees 
above normal. Although Saturday afternoon will see some rain chances 
ahead of the front, the primary opportunity for pcpn will likely be 
Sunday afternoon and evening, ahead of the approaching front. 
Based on timing of front and best instability/shear, areas in the 
Plateau could see a rumble of thunder in the afternoon, but 
elsewhere showers are to be expected. 

Biggest difference between models remains with the handling of the 
Pacific upper level low that is fcst to drop southward along the 
west coast Saturday then across Northern Mexico through Monday 
morning. From this point on, ECMWF is much more progressive with 
this low by pulling it NE into the Plains by Tuesday while GFS 
cuts off this low over Northern Mexico and then slowly drifts it 
eastward toward the NW Gulf coast through Wednesday. 
Interestingly, the majority of GFS ensemble members also tend 
toward a slowly moving cut off low over Mexico/Texas while the 
Canadian model sides with ECMWF. As models remain consistent with 
themselves and still unable to trend toward any consensus, have 
retained chance POPs Tuesday and Wednesday for the time being.

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Thursday/...
An upper-level trough continue to race east toward the Tennessee
Valley and Southern Appalachian region this afternoon. Ahead of
this system, lingering low stratus trapped in the inversion and
debris mid/high clouds ahead of this system still prevail across a
good chunk of the area. However, the latest satellite trends
indicate some breaks have begun to develop, especially across
northern Alabama and Middle Tennessee. This is expected to 
continue over the next 2-3 hours across the Central and Southern 
Valley areas of East Tennessee and the Cumberland Plateau. As a
result, some modest instabilty is expected to develop by early
evening.

As the cold front pushes east into the Plateau by 22-00z, a broken
line/areas of convection is expected to develop across middle TN
and move into the Plateau. Depending on how much the atmosphere
can destabilize, this activity will be strong to severe. With the
steep lapse rates and low wet bulb zero heights, severe hail will
be the biggest risk with the strongest activity -- along with
damaging straight-line winds. The shear profile shown on the model
soundings (and supported by the straight hodographs) suggest
supercelluar structures and multicell clusters as storm mode.
Additionally, a weak boundary in place will create a very
localized weak tornado threat. The peak of this event will be
between 23-05z this evening when upper-level divergence peaks and
the LLJ pushes NE into the Valley. 

In it's wake, strong cold air advection will occur as NW flow
ramps up behind the frontal passage. There will be an opportunity
for some light snowfall accumulations (generally above 3500-4000
feet) in the TN/VA/NC mountains due to the orographic upslope
component and the lingering moisture between 09-15z early Thursday
morning. Accumulations could be an inch or two along the peaks,
but lowers elevations are not expected to be impacted. As such,
will handle this with a Special Weather Statement for now.
Otherwise, a cold breezy day is expected for Thursday with highs
in the 30s to lower 40s across the Valley. 

.LONG TERM /Thursday Night through Wednesday/...
Some ridging and dry advection should allow for a dry period to 
start the long term from Thursday night through Friday night. By 
Saturday, an amplifying Western U.S. upper trough and associated 
surface low pressure system will be moving east toward the 
continental divide. While winds turn southwesterly ahead of this 
feature, warm and moist air advancing northeast across the 
Southern Appalachians could generate some showers Saturday into 
Saturday night. However, the main period of higher probability for
showers and even some thunderstorms would be Sunday into Sunday 
night as the system cold front presses southeast across the 
forecast area. Drier and cooler air fills in behind the front for 
Monday through Monday night bringing an end to the rain. The 
Superblend procedure trends toward the wetter ECMWF solution 
toward the end of the long term bringing a stronger southern 
stream short wave through the Lower Mississippi Valley Tuesday 
night into Wednesday with more rain, and perhaps some higher 
elevation snowfall. The nice thing through the forecast is the 
most pleasant warming trend where temperatures warm well into the 
60s over the weekend ahead of the early work week cold front.

.DISCUSSION...
An upper-level trough over the Central Plains will continue to
intensify as it as it shifts east into Tennessee later this
evening. A cold front will accompany this feature and trigger some
scattered showers and thunderstorms by late this afternoon and
early evening over the Plateau -- which will spread east across
the Tennessee Valley this evening through midnight. The main
question for tonight will be -- how unstable can the atmosphere
get by late afternoon/evening before initiation begins. Do think
that cloud cover will begin to diminish across the
southern/central Valley between 18-21z, allowing for some
insolation and destabilization there until sunset. However, there
is still some uncertainty as to if that will occur. Model
soundings support hail (given the steep lapse rates and cooler
mid-level temps) and localized damaging winds with the strongest 
activity in this scenario and thus SPC has outlooked most of the 
CWA in a slight risk.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...We'll start the morning with
areas of patchy fog and low clouds, with residual boundary layer
moisture from yesterday's rain. Ceilings will lift by the
afternoon hours as a cold front slowly approaches the area.
Temperatures this afternoon will be unseasonably warm with warmer,
moist air advecting into the area. Showers and thunderstorms are 
expected ahead of the front this evening. While earlier model runs
indicated storms moving in by late afternoon, latest high- res 
models slow down convective initiation over middle TN/southeast 
KY, and it looks like this will be more of an evening event for 
our forecast area. Currently the SPC has our area outlooked for a 
marginal risk of severe weather. NAM forecast soundings show a 
skinny CAPE profile with SBCAPE values up to 1000 J/kg (MLCAPE 
values up to about 750 J/kg), about 70kt of SFC- 6km shear, and 
mid level lapse rates around 7 degrees C/km across our forecast 
area. Combined with incoming colder air aloft and the front acting
as a forcing mechanism, this would be enough to produce some hail
across mainly the northern half of the CWA. Additionally, 
accelerating line segments along the front may cause some gusty 
winds. It should be noted however, that there are some large 
differences in how models handle this situation and the resulting 
severe potential with the GFS showing much less instability than 
the NAM. As the cold front crosses the area Wednesday night, winds
will shift and increase a bit. With colder air rushing in behind 
the front, some snowflakes will mix in with the rain showers, 
especially at higher elevations in SW Virginia and the Smoky 
Mountains early Thursday morning.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)... As the front finally 
pushes through, cold air will surge into the area on Thursday. 
Lingering moisture and lowering temperatures through the day will 
allow for some snow showers and lingering flurry activity mainly 
in SW Virginia and the higher elevations of the Smoky Mountains. 
However, lack of substantial moisture with the arrival of the cold
air will result in only a light accumulations across those areas,
with up to an inch or two possible in the highest elevations by 
Thursday evening.

Temperatures should drop or remain steady through the day on 
Thursday with overnight lows Thursday night dropping about 10 
degrees below normal before rebounding to near seasonal norms on 
Friday. Return flow by Saturday will boost weekend temperatures to 
about 10 degrees above normal Saturday, increasing to 15 degrees 
above normal on Sunday.

Models are then in good agreement through the weekend as a cold 
front approaches the area by Sunday evening. ECMWF is a bit quicker 
with the front while GFS is a bit slower. Similarly, GFS ensemble 
members even suggest a slower progression of the front through 
Sunday evening. However, current consensus expectation is for best 
pcpn chances to occur Sunday night. 

Beyond Sunday night, we see the greatest disparity in models late 
Monday and Tuesday when weekend frontal boundary has pushed south 
extending along the gulf coast back to a developing low pressure 
system along the SE Texas coast. It seems that a middle level low 
over northwest Mexico on Monday is at the root of the disagreement 
in soln for Tuesday. ECMWF is more aggressive in handling of middle 
level low over northern Mexico and is already lifting this low NE 
across Texas by Tuesday while GFS and GFS Ensemble keep the low over 
northern Mexico through most of Tuesday. This results in more 
progressive surface low in the ECMWF which brings pcpn back into the 
area by Tuesday afternoon while GFS lags about a day behind. With 
uncertainty of soln and using super blend as basis, went with 30 POP 
across much of the southern half of the area for Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM (Today through tomorrow)...
Line of thunderstorms is just now starting to move into our
western counties. Looking to our west there have been widespread
reports of 30-40 MPH winds, and isolated reports of pea to dime
size hail. Environment would suggest that we see similar (or
weaker) impacts in our area. Not much in the way of CAPE to work
with over our area, but we do have good shear in place over us. So
wind is a main concern, but currently think that most everybody
will see regular thunderstorms with some gusty winds in them. Once
thunderstorms start they will likely last for several hours until
tonight when the moisture is forced to our east and we dry out.
Expect that we could see another round of fog overnight,
especially in places that get decent rain this afternoon/evening.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
Models in decent agreement early on, but agreement between models
and run to run consistency suffer late. Forecast confidence is 
about average for this time of year for much of the period but 
dips a bit below average late. A cold front will push through the 
area Wednesday night. Showers and possibly thunderstorms can be 
expected ahead of and near the front. Some storms may be strong to
severe, so will keep mention in HWO. By late in the night much 
colder air will be pushing in, changing any lingering rain showers
to snow showers in at least in the higher elevations late. Some 
additional showers/snow showers can be expected Thursday 
especially higher elevations in the usual upslope areas in the 
northwest flow and cold advection. Could see some light snow 
accumulations in the higher elevations late Wed night into 
Thursday, so will mention in HWO. Winds will also be rather gusty 
on Thursday. Should be dry on Friday, and there will be a warming 
trend into the weekend. Moisture will return, and while there may 
be some showers around Saturday looks like the better chance will 
be sometime Sunday through Monday as the next front pushes 
through. Lots of uncertainty for Tuesday, but for now will go with

.DISCUSSION...
Line of storms moving through Middle Tennessee will eventually
impact all of the terminals. Trends have shown these storms to be
weaker than previously forecasted, so hopefully impacts within any
storms will be less than previously anticipated. Due to the
rainfall we will likely see another round of fog overnight,
currently the confidence in ceiling/visibilities overnight is low
until we see what these storms due this afternoon.

Some patchy fog sticking around a few locations in the Tennessee
Valley. Most places have seen the fog burn off already, but those
still in the fog could see it persist for a couple more hours.
If the fog sticks around for a while longer those places will also
see a bit less warm up today. Line of storms across middle
Tennessee will continue to move towards our area and should make
it to our western counties in the early afternoon. Current timing
has the line of storms moving into the Cumberland Plateau/Chattanooga
area around 2-3pm this afternoon.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Latest water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicating
trough digging southeast across Kansas and Oklahoma this morning.
Ahead of this feature over West Tennessee, convection is 
beginning to develop this morning and is expected to track 
eastward across the state through the day reaching into our 
Plateau counties by early this afternoon. Hires HRRR and RAP 
models both indicate that the activity will reach into the Plateau
counties by 18-19Z before pushing into the Tennessee Valley by 
20-21Z this afternoon.

Models have been consistent over the past day in keeping highest
CAPE values southwest and west of the area with favorable shear 
profiles that extend further east into our CWA. Given that SFC-6km
shear values in excess of 40 kts and SFC-1km storm relative 
helicity values in excess of 200 meters squared per second squared
will be found across much of the Plateau and southeastern 
Tennessee counties by afternoon, any thunderstorms that do develop
could become organized enough to produce damaging winds, hail, 
and a possible isolated tornado with main threat being damaging 
straight line winds.

Any instability and vertical shear will decrease as we move toward
midnight with much of the activity expected to push east of the 
area by late evening. Leftover showers will linger past midnight
before tapering off before morning as middle level trough axis
shifts east of the area and dry air aloft begins to move into the
area.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...
A cold front will move through the area Wednesday 
afternoon/evening, bringing another chance for some scattered 
showers and thunderstorms. A few of these storms may become 
severe, with damaging winds being the main threat. Although this 
is not that far away, there is still a good bit of model 
disagreement with regards to the amount of instability and shear 
present (with the NAM much more bullish on the severe weather 
potential than the GFS). Additionally, PWATS look to max out at 
about 0.90" in the Tennessee Valley -- which is around the 90th 
percentile for this time of year. The latest SPC Outlook has our 
entire forecast area in a marginal risk, so will continue the 
mention for isolated severe in the HWO for now. 

Temperatures Wednesday night will dip to near freezing or slightly 
below at the higher elevations in SW VA, the Cumberland Plateau, and 
along the Smoky Mountains. With lingering moisture, this will result 
in some light snow overnight, with very little actual accumulation 
expected. As the front continues to push out of the area on 
Thursday, a few light showers remain possible in NE TN and SW VA. 

Northwest flow behind the frontal passage will usher in cooler air 
for Thursday and Thursday night. Highs on Thursday will be around 5 
degrees below normal.  Lows Thursday night will be 5-10 degrees 
below normal. The cold snap will be short-lived with high pressure 
building over the Gulf of Mexico as we head into the weekend.  This 
will result in SW flow over the area, advecting warmer, more moist 
air into the region. This will also result in another chance for 
showers on Saturday, although models disagree with how much moisture 
will actually be present. A frontal boundary will then push through 
the area Sunday night/Monday morning, bringing a better chance for 
more organized showers and thunderstorms.

.DISCUSSION...Showers have been decreasing in coverage over the
past few hours and will continue to do so through the rest of the
night. Have updated POPS accordingly to reflect lesser chances
than previous forecast. A little bit of a difficult forecast 
regarding fog for the rest of the night. Warm front progged to 
move north into the Southern Valley later tonight, but it's taking
its time. Until the front moves in, we will continue to see 
little to no temp/dewpoint depression across the area, especially 
the Central/Southern Valley and SWNC. Have introduced areas of 
dense fog in the forecast for these areas. For areas generally 
north of I-40, have put in patchy fog. Current belief is that warm
front will eventually make its way northward into the area. As 
the front moves north it should help us to mix out a little, 
slowly raising visibilities. Until the front does so, expect fog 
to be around, with some dense. Temperatures should hold steady
thorugh the night for the most part, but will rise slightly just 
ahead of the front and as it moves in. Will send out new zones for
POP and fog updates.

A warm front is located across N GA and N AL, which is expected to

midnight, which will lead to the current LIFR conditions improving
to MVFR and an increase in southerly winds. The front is likely to
stall south of TYS, so overcast MVFR to IFR cigs are expected
there all night. TRI is currently VFR but is expected to have cigs
drop to MVFR after midnight. All sites should see improving
conditions in the late morning hours tomorrow, before another
round of showers moves in late in the TAF period.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Tuesday night)...
Currently seeing a round of rain move up through the Tennessee
Valley this afternoon. Pretty light accumulations of less than a
tenth of an inch are expected as it rolls through the valley. Once
this round moves through we should get a brief break from rain
overnight and into tomorrow morning as the frontal boundary
approaches our area. High resolution models are generally pointing
towards a mid afternoon arrival of showers and thunderstorms from
our west. Forecast sounding show that there will be little in the
way of CAPE to work with, but much more shear for storms to tap
into. CAPE values are more impressive to our south and west, but
if storms are able to form in these higher CAPE environments and
tap into the shear caused by a strong low level jet, they could
remain strong to severe as they move into the western counties of
our forecast area. Currently the main threat with the strongest
storms will be straight-line winds, but with good shear to work
with, we can't rule out some hail or an isolated tornado (however
unlikely). As the front pushes through precipitation will slowly 
fizzle out overnight.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...
A weak disturbance will move through the area Wednesday...bringing
another chance for scattered showers and thunderstorms. Models 
differ on timing of the convection moving through. With the low 
level flow out of the SW and instabilities increasing to over 1000
j/kg...kept timing late afternoon through the evening. 
Directional shear will be weak at the surface...with 30 to 40 kt 
in the mid levels. Can expect the strongest storms in areas south 
of I40...with a few storms becoming severe. Damaging wind will be 
the main threat at this time...with localized flooding also a 
possibility. The PW values are above the 90th percentile for this
time of year. 

Temperatures overnight Wednesday and into the early morning Thursday 
are expected to drop at or below freezing...with light snow 
possible...mainly in NE TN and SW VA. For now...not expecting any 
accumulations more than a dusting. This convection will continue to 
move east through the day Thursday...with only light scattered 
showers remaining in NE TN and SW VA Thursday afternoon. NW flow 
sets up behind the showers moving out of the area...with 
temperatures dropping below normal for Thursday night and Friday. 
High pressure will then set up in the Gulf for Thursday night 
through Saturday morning...transitioning the winds from NW to the 
SW...bringing warmer air and more moisture to the area. 

A slight chance for scattered showers is possible Saturday through 
Sunday...though models disagree on amount of moisture that will 
actually be present. A frontal boundary will then push through the 
area Monday morning...with the next chance for scattered 
thunderstorms possible through the morning.

Fog has been stubborn to leave the Tennessee Valley this morning
with some observations still reporting less than 1/2 mile of 
visibility. Looking at webcams around the area this seems to be an
exception rather than the norm. But regardless, visibilities 
could be reduced into the late morning hours before the fog really
starts to erode. This fog lingering around a bit longer could 
help keep temperatures a bit cooler than previously forecasted, so
a few minor adjustments have been made.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Water vapor imagery and RAP upper level analysis indicate a very
modest shortwave trough currently over central Arkansas. This 
shortwave will ride a weak ridge eastward through the day moving 
across our northern Tennessee and SW Virginia counties later this 
afternoon and evening before shifting east of the area tonight.

At the surface, stationary boundary extends northwest across
northern Alabama into northern Arkansas. This boundary will move 
northward as a warm front across the western portions of the CWA 
later this afternoon and evening. With it, a surge of low level 
moisture (dew points climbing into the upper 40s to lower 50s) 
along with weak instability will reach into the southern and 
Plateau counties by this afternoon. Expect primarily showery pcpn 
as it moves across the area from SW to NE today. However, with the
shortwave providing some dynamic support, cannot rule out a 
possible thunderstorm across the southern and Plateau counties 
this afternoon and evening before the shortwave exits the area. 
Additionally, increasing southwesterly winds of 40 kts at 850 mb 
could mix down to the surface in any convection that does develop,
producing some gusty, albeit sub-severe winds.

By tonight, best support for precipitation is NE of the area with
only northern counties and areas of SW Virginia possibly seeing
some lingering shower activity ahead of an approaching front on
Tuesday. 

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...
Warm and unsettled through mid week. Tuesday and Wednesday highs 
in the 60s to possibly near 70 in places Wednesday. Strong 850mb 
jet early Tuesday across the mid Tennessee and Ohio Valleys 
shifting farther north and east late in the day Tuesday. Warm 
moist air mass with broad trough moving into the eastern half of 
the country and a couple short waves coming through during the 
afternoon and evening will set off some thunderstorms. NAM and GFS
model show CAPE values are very low Tuesday but more significant 
Wednesday so less confident that we will see much severe late 
Tuesday. With expected cloud cover and on going precipitation 
during the day this could limit destabilization as well. Showers 
and threat for thunderstorms continue Tuesday night as lower 
pressure moves into the Great Lakes. Trailing cold front will be 
over the Ohio Valley early Tuesday Evening and then is expected to
move into the forecast area Wednesday morning. More thunderstorms
will develop along the front Wednesday. If front slows down there
could be some strong storms Wednesday as temperatures warm into 
the 60s to near 70 ahead of the front. Strong gusty winds will be 
the main threat Tuesday afternoon into Wednesday and marginally 
large hail. An isolated tornado also possible. 

Wednesday night into Thursday behind front temperatures will drop to 
near freezing overnight and early Thursday with a narrow window for 
light winter precipitation. Higher elevations could see some light 
accumulations. Skies will clear Thursday night and Friday as high 
pressure builds in. Temperatures will be near normal Friday. 
Saturday high shifts east and another front will approach by Sunday. 
Clouds increase Saturday night and Sunday with chance of showers and 
milder temperatures again Sunday. Highs will again reach the 60s.

The inversion that has set up over the area through the day is 
expected to weaken...with clouds decreasing through the early 
night. With the low level moisture in place...and the light winds 
overnight...patchy dense fog could be possible across the area 
through the early morning Monday.

strong storms through Monday afternoon. Low level flow will continue 
out of the SW through the day...bringing moisture advection and 
warmer temps to the area Monday.


.LONG TERM (Monday night through Saturday)...

Very warm temperatures will be present to start the long term 
portion of the forecast. Tuesday and Wednesday will see widespread 
60's as a high temperatures. Along with these warm temperatures we 
will get moisture moving into the region ahead of an approaching low 
and cold front. With the warming temperatures and moist air moving 
in from the south we will have a decent amount of CAPE to work with, 
combine this with good shear due to the low level jet and we could 
see some strong to severe thunderstorms Tuesday evening/night. Will 
have to see how much showers/storms/cloud coverage is present during 
the daytime which could help limit instability. Atmosphere would be 
conducive to possibly see strong/severe storms that could bring 
gusty straight-line winds, possibly some large hail, and a isolated 
tornado can't be ruled out at this time.

Depending on when the front sweeps through and how much moisture is 
left lingering around as it moves through and shortly afterwards we 
could see a quick round of winter precipitation (mostly in our 
northern counties) late Wednesday/early Thursday morning. Most 
models show that the majority of the moisture has moved out by the 
time the sub-freezing temperatures move in so any accumulations look 
to be light at this time. Quiet weather will then persist the rest 
of the week and into the weekend as a ridge starts to set up and 
brings our daytime temperatures into the 60's over the weekend. A 
frontal boundary will make a run into the area at the end of the 
weekend and bring another round of precipitation, but it currently 
looks to stay warm enough that this would remain as all rain.

.SHORT TERM (Early this Morning through Tonight)...Strong westerly
winds between 850-700mb has produced isentropic lift across the
Tennessee Valley/southern Appalachians early this morning.
Scattered light rain showers, mixed with light snow, sleet and 
spotty freezing rain, especially across southwest Virginia and  
the higher elevations. Very light precipitation will continue 
until around daybreak with light icing anticipated over the higher
elevations. Will re-issue the SPS for this event.

For Today...westerly flow aloft will weaken with isentropic lift
diminishing. Soundings show plenty of boundary layer moisture...
so clouds will be stubborn to erode with sky remaining mostly
cloudy.

For Tonight...the 850-700mb moisture has dissipated, but boundary
layer moisture remains, so anticipated patchy fog, some locally
dense, and areas of low-clouds.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)... Lower pressure over the 
Northwest States Monday will move southeast along a frontal 
boundary draped over the Plains and northern Ohio Valley. A 
secondary low pressure area over Oklahoma will move northeast 
Monday night and toward the Great Lakes Tuesday. Shortwave energy 
ahead of the low pressure area will increase clouds and showers by
Monday afternoon. The first wave of rainfall will move through 
late Monday. Then NAM model brings deep low pressure across mid 
Mississippi Valley Monday night and into the Great Lakes by 
Tuesday morning. A warming and unstable atmosphere to trigger 
showers and thunderstorms across western sections of the forecast 
area Tuesday afternoon and evening. Strong upper system with 
increasing winds aloft will bring the threat for damaging winds 
ahead of cold front associated with upper system. The system will 
weaken overnight but showers will linger into Wednesday morning. 
Cold front will move south of the forecast area Wednesday 
afternoon and evening but shortwave energy moving southeast behind
front in upper trough will bring a slight chance of snow showers 
Wednesday night into Thursday night mainly northeast and eastern 
mountains. Highs Monday and Tuesday will be mild mid 50s to lower 
60s Monday and mid to upper 60s Tuesday. Cooler Wednesday and 
especially Thursday. Warming back to near normal Friday and above 
normal Saturday. Higher pressure will return Friday into Saturday 
with more sunshine.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast mostly on track. Weak upper level impulse
beginning to slide into the area here shortly. Light radar 
returns are present back to our west across Southern Middle TN and
Northern Alabama. Dewpoints across our area are still very dry so
it will take a while before we see any light precip across the 
Southern Valley and Southern Plateau. After midnight it is still 
possible that a few areas across SWNC, our eastern mountains, and
foothills could see some light freezing drizzle/rain. Precip 
should be very light so little to no accumulation is expected and 
travel shouldn't be a concern. For the slight chance pop in for 
far the eastern mountains north of I-40, slight chance of snow 
after midnight is possible as LLJ doesn't quite reach that far 
north thus resulting in sounding profiles looking cold enough for
snow. Again, little to no accumulation expected and travel issues
not a concern. 

Grid edits were made to pops to bring slight chance of rain a 
little further north across the southern valley, just south of 
Knoxville. Also changed FZRA to snow north of I-40 for far 
eastern mountains. Hourly temp and dewpoint adjustments also made 
to match up with latest obs. Will send out new zones for pop 
adjustments.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Sunday)...

High pressure will slowly shift east through Sunday...with a weak
disturbance moving through the area overnight. Models disagree on
amount of any rainfall overnight. With low level winds turning 
out of the south and southwest later in the night...moisture looks
limited. Little to no instability is present as well...so left in
only slight chance for rain in the southern plateau...far 
southern valley...and SW NC around midnight tonight through Sunday
morning. Clouds are expected to increase through the night...with
the temperatures remaining a degree or two below normal. A few 
areas in SW NC could see temperatures cold enough at the surface 
for freezing rain before sunrise...but accumulations are expected 
to be less than a tenth of an inch. 

A weak mid level jet will move through overnight tonight...with 
higher elevations able to see gusty winds up to 30 mph. 
Sunday...zonal flow sets up over the region...with cloudy skies all 
day. With winds from the south and southwest...temperatures will be 
a couple of degrees warmer than Saturday...but still near normal for 
this time of year.


.LONG TERM (Sunday night through Friday)...

A dry but warming trend will be the main story as we move into the 
early part of the work week. Our next system will be a low moving 
across the northern portion of the United States and a cold front 
will follow with it. Ahead of this front we could see a ripple of 
energy bring in some showers early in the week, but the main threat 
of precipitation and thunderstorms will likely come on Tuesday. Just 
ahead of the front temperatures will warm into the 60's across much 
of the area on Tuesday. CAPE values of up to around 1000 J/Kg 
(higher values in the southern counties with lower values further 
north) will be present. In addition a low level jet of will get 
cranking on Tuesday and provide good shear (around 30 knots or more) 
over parts of our forecast area. These will combine to give a chance 
for showers and thunderstorms, some of which could be strong to 
severe. Right now the biggest threats with any storms that do form 
would be strong winds and large hail. 

Storms could linger into Wednesday, but by Wednesday night the front 
should have pushed all the precipitation to our south and east. 
Models begin to disagree with how to hand the the environment behind 
the front. The GFS shows a shortwave zip across and provide another 
quick round of precipitation late in the work week, while the ECMWF 
is dry through this period. If the GFS is the correct solution we 
could get a quick round of snow as temperatures will be cold enough 
behind the main front. Will mention the potential for snow in the 
forecast, but will keep precipitation percentages low until better 
model agreement is reached. Ridge begins to build in over the 
weekend and we will experience above normal temperatures as we move 
into Saturday.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Sunday)...A surface ridge of high
presure and zonal flow aloft will dominate the forecast through
Sunday. Models show weak isentropic lift between 850-700mb from
late this evening through Sunday morning producing widespread
overcast sky. Moisture layer is shallow but enough to include a
slight chance of rain showers...possibly mixed with freezing
rain/sleet or snow across the northeast. Generally followed the
drier GFS solution due to the shallow nature of the moisture.

Moisture moves out of the area for Sunday afternoon.

Drier pattern will come to an end at the end of the weekend as 
higher pressure shifts east and lower pressure moves into the plains 
then deepens as it moves into the mid Mississippi Valley. Showers 
increase Monday with southerly flow developing by afternoon. Much 
warmer temperatures Tuesday with south flow even stronger. 
Instability Tuesday enough for scattered showers and storms during 
the afternoon and into the overnight hours ahead of front. Some of 
the storms may be strong with higher winds. Much colder Wednesday 
behind the front with showers ending. A weak system moving southeast 
in the NW flow will bring a brief snow threat to the mainly the 
northeast sections late Thursday into Friday.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Saturday)...

Still seeing some post-frontal clouds across the area but a few 
breaks are continuing to develop. Current water vapor imagery and 
RAP upper air analysis indicates a few features of note. There is a 
shortwave trough progressing eastward across the Great Lakes region 
with a ridge across the Rocky Mountains. At the surface, the cold 
front is now well to the south and east along the coast. High 
pressure is centered across the Central Plains. Skies will continue 
to clear during the evening and overnight period as high pressure 
moves into the area. Extremely dry air will move in with PW values 
down to around 0.08-0.15 inches tonight. These values are around 
the minimums observed for early February. Therefore, expect a 
mostly clear and cold night tonight. Nearly ideal radiational 
cooling conditions should set up with mostly clear skies and light
winds, temperatures will drop down into the teens and 20s. The 
cold air will be short-lived as the surface high shifts quickly to
the east tomorrow and southerly flow returns by the end of the 
day. High temperatures on Saturday will top out in the upper 30s 
to low 50s under mostly sunny skies.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Thursday)...

Shortwave that will move through the middle of the weekend continues 
to look pretty meager as it gets closer. GFS is completely dry over 
our area while the ECMWF and the NAM shower a bit of precipitation, 
mostly to our south. If we do see some precipitation it would most 
likely be very light and it could be a mixture of rain/snow/freezing 
rain, but it would quickly melt on Sunday as highs climb into the 
50's. Semi-zonal flow sets up the rest of the weekend leaving us in 
dry weather until Monday afternoon when showers might start forming 
ahead of a low moving across the Central Plains. Scattered showers 
will be likely early in the week and more wide spread precipitation 
will move in as the low and the associated cold front sweep through. 
Ahead of the front temperatures will warm to about 10-15 degrees 
above normal by the middle of the week. This warm unstable air will 
combine with strong low level winds to give us a chance to see 
thunderstorms. Best combination of thunderstorm ingredients will 
likely be on Tuesday. After the frontal passage we could see a brief 
switchover to light snowfall in Southeast Virginia on Thursday 
morning, but nothing major is expected at this time. After that 
colder temperatures will settle in as air from the northwest funnels 
in.

air advecting into the Southern Appalchians. There were a few
reports of sprinkles/flurries earlier this morning but those have
come to an end and removed them from the forecast. Dewpoints are
around 3-8 degrees lower than forecast thanks to the northerly
winds and drier air. Therefore, for the updated adjusted these
downward. Also, kept cloud cover in for a few more hours into the

.AVIATION...West to Southwest mid-level flow is producing weak 
isentropic lift. This lift has produced widespread cloud cover 
between 5-8kft over the TAF sites. This moisture will slowly become 
more shallow through time this morning/early afternoon as the winds 
in this layer shift to the northwest. Sky will clear by mid-
afternoon with only high cirrus/cirrus-stratus Friday night.

Winds will be northerly through the period generally between 7 and 
12kts. Winds will decouple tonight producing calm/light winds.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...Weak isentropic lift is
producing widespread clouds across the area early this morning
with scattered snow flurries/sleet/and sprinkles. Since the 
boundary layer is quite dry with dewpoints in the teens, a lot of 
the precipitation on radar is not reaching the ground (virga). 

The west/southwest mid-level flow will become veer to the
northwest by this afternoon allowing drier air to move into the
region. Sky will clear this afternoon. Ridging will build into the
southern Appalachians tonight with dry and cold air-mass. The 
clear sky...light/calm winds...and dry air-mass will allow 
temperatures to drop quickly overnight. 

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through through Thursday)...Still looks 
like quiet weather Saturday before another chance at winter 
precipitation late Saturday night and Sunday morning. Models quite
different with the GFS dry and the NAM much more moist and a weak
short wave moving through overnight and sunday morning will bring
a chance of rain and snow and the possibility of light freezing 
rain. The northern areas would have the best chance. Precipitation
will be light. Temperatures Sunday will warm quickly into the mid
40s to mid 50s so any winter precipitation will melt fast. 

After the system Sunday quickly moves out Sunday night looks to be 
dry then a low pressure area develops over the Plains Sunday night 
and Monday with southerly flow developing out ahead of it. Showers 
to spread north and east Monday into Monday night. The low deepens 
as it moves northeast across the Ohio Valley Tuesday. Increased 
instability ahead of this low and associated front will add a chance 
of thunderstorms Tuesday and Tuesday night. Cooler behind the front 
Wednesday and Thursday. Shortwave energy Wednesday night and 
Thursday and cold temperatures cause more winter precipitation. 
Thursday will be the coldest day with highs only in the mid 30s to 
mid 40s and colder high elevations.

.DISCUSSION...
A weak front has moved up into the southern Tennessee Valley of
East Tennessee this evening, triggering off scattered rain 
showers across areas mainly along and south of the Interstate 40 
corridor. As a result, have increased PoPs in this area through
the overnight hours to 30-50 percent in this area, with gradual
tapering off late tonight. The combination of cloud cover and this
light precipitation will result in some slightly warmer low
temperatures in the mid to upper 30s in most areas in the central 
and southern Valleys.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Friday)...

Mostly zonal flow aloft across the CONUS. Current water vapor 
imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a fast moving shortwave 
trough moving southeastward out of the Northern Rockies and Northern 
Plains. At the surface, the surface low is currently centered near 
Charlotte, NC with a cold front stretching southwestward to near 
Montgomery, AL. The front has made some slow progress to the south 
throughout the day. Current radar imagery indicates an area of 
showers moving east across Northern Mississippi into Northern 
Alabama. Hi-Res models indicate that this area of showers will move 
into the Southern Valley and Plateau around 22-00z with precip. 
coming to an end around 05-06z. Rainfall amounts will be light and 
under a tenth of an inch. The fast moving shortwave trough will dive 
quickly into the Great Lake region on Friday pushing the front even 
further to the south. Drier air will advect into the area on Friday 
with PW values dropping down into the 0.3-0.4 inch range. For 
temperatures, went a little higher with lows overnight tonight in 
the mid 20s to upper 30s. Models indicate widespread post-frontal
cloud cover with northerly winds around 5-10 mph. This should 
keep lows on the higher side of guidance. Colder air will advect 
in on Friday with more seasonal highs generally in the 40s.

.LONG TERM (Friday Night through Wednesday)...

Quiet weather on Saturday before we might get a bit of a chance at 
some wintery precipitation by Saturday night into Sunday. Models 
seem to be coming in drier than before with the weak short wave that 
moves through. But at this point we can't rule out the possibilty
to see some precipitation as it moves through. With that being 
said, if any does occur it could be a wintry mix of light 
rain/snow/freezing rain. Best chances will be in the northern 
counties of our forecast area during the overnight hours Saturday 
night/Sunday morning. If any precipitation does occur the QPF 
amounts would be pretty light with a dusting possible (maybe a bit
more in the higher elevations), but we should warm up enough on 
Sunday that it will all evaporate regardless. 

A better chance for precipitation will come in the early parts of 
the work week next week as a low moves across the Great Lakes region 
and drags a cold front along with it. Good warming ahead of the 
front will allow for warmer temperatures and increased instability 
to the point that we could see some thunderstorms ahead of this 
system. We should quickly dry out at this system exits, but any 
lingering precipitation (specifically in the higher terrain) could 
briefly switch over to a light snow early in the morning on Thursday.

front...there continues to be a band of low and mid level clouds and 
isolated to scattered showers.  Local MVFR conditions with low 
clouds and reduced VIS are possible as a shower moves through a TAF

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A weak cold front will continue 
its slow push across the Southern Appalachian Region early this 
morning.  Along the front...there continues to be a band of low and 
mid level clouds and isolated to scattered showers.  With cooler air 
aloft...rain shower may be briefly mix with sleet. The shower 
activity should end across much of the area early this morning but 
may linger over southern and southwestern locations as the front 
stalls along to just south of our southern border.  With the 
proximity of the boundary through the short term....expect some 
clouds to remain over the region.  However...cooler...drier air will 
move in behind the front with highs this afternoon in the 40s and 
50s and lows tonight in the 20s and 30s.

.LONG TERM(Friday through Wednesday)...Models continue to be in 
decent agreement overall and run to run consistency is fair. Forecast 
confidence is a bit above average for this time of year. Should be a 
dry start to the long term period as surface high pressure builds in 
Friday into Saturday.  A weak short wave is forecast to move across 
the area Saturday night into Sunday.  Models continue to disagree 
and waffle on thermal profiles during any precip Saturday night and 
Sunday morning, so will keep possibility of rain or snow mainly 
north and central, and while no mention in the forecast yet still 
cannot rule out a bit of light freezing rain.  However, any precip 
looks to be rather light. Will keep mention of a wintery mix in HWO. 
A more significant system is forecast to affect the region by late 
Monday or Monday night through Wednesday.  Appears this precip will 
be mainly rain as warmer air moves in.  Might be some thunder ahead 
of the cold front sometime in the late Tuesday into Wednesday time 
frame.

.DISCUSSION...
A cold front is dropping south through the eastern Tennessee
Valley this evening, triggering off a some scattered clusters of
light showers. This activity will mainly favor the I-40 corridor
and points south after midnight as the progression of the boundary
slows near the TN/GA border by 12z. P-Watt values around 0.8
inches will result in some locally heavy downpours with the
strongest activity, with generally 0.1-0.2 inches of QPF expected
over the course of the night. Locally higher amounts are possible
in areas underneath the stronger cores. Accompanying this boundary
will be dense cloud cover which will linger across the region
tonight. Thus, despite a push of colder air, temperatures will 
remain above the freezing mark in most places -- generally in the 
upper 30s to lower 40s in the Valley, with mid 30s across SW VA 
and the Plateau.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Thursday)...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates 
rather zonal flow across the CONUS. The jet stream stretches from 
the Northern Rockies eastward to the Mid-Atlantic. At the surface, a 
low pressure is currently near Boone, NC with a cold front 
stretching westward to near Knoxville and further to the west near 
Memphis. Not seeing much on the radar presently except for a few 
post-frontal showers to the north in West Virginia. Precipitation is 
forecast to increase later this evening into tonight along the 
frontal boundary as a weak surge of low level moisture moves into 
the region. PW values will increase into the 0.7-0.8 inch range 
which is near the 90th percentile for early February. Model 
soundings only indicate saturation in the lowest 200-250 mb of the 
atmosphere and expect the precipitation should be light. Rainfall 
amounts tonight into this evening will generally be around a tenth 
of an inch. A few passing shortwave troughs well to the north across 
the Great Lakes will be the only push for the cold front, therefore, 
expect the slow sinking motion of the front to continue throughout 
the evening and overnight before eventually stalling early Thursday. 
Continued with small chance for showers across the Southern Valley 
early Thursday before the drier air moves in behind the front. 
Models indicate that PW values will drop down into the 0.3-0.4 inch 
range. The NAM stalls the boundary further north with light showers 
continuing for much of the day Thursday but have kept things mostly 
dry for now. Overnight lows will range from the mid 30s to mid 40s 
with no wintry precip. expected. The cold air advection behind the 
front is not overly impressive and high temperatures will top out in 
the upper 40s to mid 50s.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...

To start the extended period, a boundary remains to our south. 
However, models do indicate some weak isentropic lift along this 
boundary, which will produce some rain/snow showers Thursday night
into Friday. The GFS keeps these showers well south of our 
forecast area, while the ECMWF indicates precip pushing a bit 
further north into the southern half of the forecast area. Surface
high pressure builds in across the eastern U.S. Friday and 
Saturday, bringing a period of dry, seasonable conditions. Another
system works in for Sunday. While there may be a brief periods of
mixed precipitation early Sunday morning with temperatures still 
hovering near freezing, this event should be mainly rain. A 
stronger, warmer system will move in for midweek. This should be 
all rain, with enough instability for potentially some rumbles of 
thunder on Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...The quiet and mild conditions will
continue through the morning as a cold front approaches the area.
Ahead of the front...expect another warm day with highs in the 50s
and 60s.  Clouds and wind will increase over the Southern
Appalachian Region for the afternoon in advance of the front.
Also...a few isolated light rain showers may push into northern and
possibly central areas late in the day.  The main band of scattered
showers should reach into the area this evening and continue to
slowly spread south across the MRX CWA overnight. For much of the
event...temperature profiles should be warm enough for all rain.
However...late tonight higher elevations could see temperatures fall
low enough for a mix of rain and snow...or possibly a transition to
all snow.  Precip amount should remain fairly light through the
event and little if any accumulations of snow are expected.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...Models in decent agreement
overall, but given multiple weak features during the long term
period that are often poorly handled by the models in the extended
periods, forecast confidence in the details is no better than
average for this time of year. After a dry Thursday, models want to
bring some weak isentropic lift along the nearly stationary boundary
near our southern border.  Looks like lift will be weak, so only low
chance to slight chance PoPs with this. Precip type will be close as
some frozen or freezing precip will be possible especially north,
but too early to pin down details so will use a broad brush.
Saturday should be dry then a frontal system will push in for
Sunday, bringing another chance for precip that should be primarily
rain.  A much stronger system is forecast to move in by Tuesday, and
this system looks quite warm at this time so all liquid precip is
expected.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Wednesday)...
Skies are mostly clear south and partly cloudy north as weak front
has become almost quasi stationary just to the northwest of the
Tennessee border. Warm southwest winds ahead of the front have
allowed temperatures to reach the lower to mid 60s across much of
the area with Chattanooga at 67. Tonight the front will sag south
into the forecast area then slowly sink southward through Wednesday.
Lows will be warmer overnight as clouds increase and winds will be
south to southwest. As front moves across the forecast area there
will be enough lift for a few showers. Have kept pops low all areas
Wednesday afternoon. Lower clouds will hold temperatures down across
the northeast north of the front mid 40s to lower 50s and warmer
south. Chattanooga will again be mild in the mid 60s. Rainfall
amounts will be very light. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday Night through Tuesday)...
A weak almost stationary boundary will drop south through the
region Wednesday night, bringing some light rain showers across the
eastern Tennessee Valley and Southern Appalachians. This activity
will slip south of I-40 after midnight and out of the area by
Thursday morning. After clearing occurs on Thursday, models want to
bring this boundary back north into the Southern Valley areas
overnight into Friday, bringing another round of scattered showers
along and south of I-40. This activity will exit the region Friday
night, as a brief bout of of upper-level ridging takes place Friday
night and Saturday.

The next upper-level trough will approach from the Southern Plains
Saturday Night into Sunday. This system will bring widespread
precipitation to the region, and with a warm front moving NE across
the Tennessee Valley late Saturday night into Sunday morning.
Initially, some subfreezing air in place at the surface could result
in some light freezing rain over SW VA and far NE TN early Sunday
morning. Accumulations will be light, before a warm front moves north
and switches precipitation to all rain across the area on Sunday
morning as temperatures warm into the 40s to low 50s. Another
stronger cold front will approach the region midweek as an upper-
trough shifts east from the Southern Plains. Ahead of the front, a
warming trend will occur as highs return to the 60s with sunshine
and southerly winds.

becoming stationary tonight. High and mid clouds were beginning to
increase across the northern half of the area near the frontal

Will see an increase in clouds especially northern half during the
period, but no precipitation is expected. Winds will be gusty from
the southwest today, and temps will warm to above seasonal normals
under a mostly sunny sky.  MAV temps look reasonable so will stay
close.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...Will see a series of weather
systems moving through the Southern Appalachian Region during the
extended for a rather unsettle period.  First off...a weak frontal
boundary will drop into the region late Wednesday afternoon into
Wednesday night.  Weak lift and little moisture associated with the
feature and will keep pops at 20 to 30 Wednesday night.  Higher
elevations could see a brief transitions to snow towards Thursday
morning but little to no accumulations is expected.  The boundary
briefly stalls to our south and could see isolated to scattered
showers move back in from the south late Thursday night into Friday.
Higher elevations could see a mix of rain and snow. Model confidence
lowers by the end of the period but trend is for being between
systems on Saturday for dry conditions. The next system should push
through around the Sunday time frame...providing likely pops with
showers lingering over far east...northeast locations into Monday.
During the overnight and early morning hours some northern areas and
higher elevations should expect a transition to snow.

Minor adjustments to tonight's min temps. Perhaps a foolish

tended to bump up a degree or two along the southwest portion of

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Tuesday)...
Skies are mostly sunny this afternoon as upper trough is moving out
and weak high pressure builds in tonight and Tuesday. Over the next
24 hours weak ridge will shift east tonight and Tuesday as another
weak system moves across the Great Lakes and into the Ohio Valley.
Southwest winds ahead of this system will keep temperatures warmer
tonight except across valleys of northeast Tennessee. Tuesday some
clouds will spread southeast into the forecast area but the air
mass will be dry and southwest winds will warm temperatures into
the upper 50s and lower 60s some 10 degrees above normal.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday Night through Monday)...
Active weather pattern to start the month of February. A weak
stationary front will drop south from Kentucky into the southern
Tennessee Valley Wednesday afternoon and evening, generating some
light rain (and perhaps a few flakes of snow along the mountains),
before dissipating by Thursday morning. A cooler, dry WNW flow will
ensue on Thursday, before the next upper-level storm system begins
to take shape for the weekend. There are a lot of uncertainties
regarding the exact track and timing of this system which will have
an impact on the vertical temperature profile and precipitation
type.

Initially, another clipper system will skirt the region on Friday,
bringing another round of scattered light rain to the valley (and
perhaps some light snow to the mountains). Then, after a brief bout
of ridging and dry weather on Saturday -- the next upper-level
trough will approach from the Southern Plains Saturday Night into
Sunday. This system will bring widespread precipitation to the
region, and with a warm front moving NE across the Tennessee Valley
overnight. As a result, temperatures may support snow across
portions of the region late in the night, but a transition to rain
will occur by Sunday morning as temperatures warm into the 40s to
low 50s. The greatest risk for accumulating snowfall looks to be far
NE TN and SW VA late Saturday night and Sunday morning, as well as
the Mountains throughout the day Sunday as temperature profile will
be cooler there. This definitely bears watching given some potential
for some heavier snowfall along the high terrain, but at this time,
it looks like a very limited accumulation/impact for the Valley.

.DISCUSSION...
Low level moisture has about exited the forecast area late this
morning. However enough has lingered for snow flurries to continue
across extreme northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia. Snowfall
amounts of a dusting to less than 1 inch occurred across parts of
the central and northern valley to 1 to 3 inches across parts of
the extreme northern plateau and higher elevations of southwest
Virginia and northeast Tennessee. Highest elevations from Monroe
County north to Virginia had 5 to 6 inches. Skies are already sunny
across southeast Tennessee and partly cloudy farther northeast. The
mostly cloudy skies in the northeast part of the area will gradually
clear. Temperatures look on track to reach the mid 30s northeast...colder
high elevations...to mid 40s central and near 50 southwest with
west to southwest winds helping in the warming. Updated forecast

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Lingering low level moisture in
the northwest flow will keep some flurries/snow showers around into
the morning hours.  Still could be some light and localized snow
accumulations in the advisory area, so will keep it as is for now
although would not be surprised if it needs to be cancelled a bit
early.  Will see cloud decreasing from southwest to northeast,
allowing for quite a bit of sunshine today.  Low level jet will
strengthen overnight, but will keep winds just below wind advisory
criteria in the higher elevations for now as it looks borderline.
Just some minor adjustments to MAV temps for the short term period.

.LONG TERM...(Tuesday through Sunday)...Still some model
disagreement in the long term but will keep Tuesday dry with dry
advection a no frontal boundary close enough to cause any harm.
However, a northeastern U.S. upper trough will have amplified to such
degree to force a cold frontal boundary into the region. Kept some
slight chance pops for showers on Wednesday, but opted to keep
precipitation out of the forecast through the remainder of the work
week. Will await a stronger storm system building into the Eastern
U.S. over the weekend to add probability back into the long term
period. Of course uncertainty abounds during this remote portion of
the forecast, but would need to keep a mix of rain and snow going
here due to likelihood of chilly air near the Southern Appalachian
region. Speaking of chilly air, there may not be much of that around
on Tuesday and possibly Wednesday, with highs in the 50s and 60s
before cooler, more typical early February style temperatures return.

328 PM EST Sun Jan 29 2017

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Monday)...
Numerous showers will continue across the area through the evening.
Surface obs across the area show a freezing level around 2500 ft,
and snow accumulations through the afternoon should be only in
locations above that level. The freezing level falls gradually
after 00Z, which will change all precip to snow. But moisture will
be decreasing from the west after that time, so little if any
accumulation is expected for the central and southern Valley. Cold
midlevel temps under the trough will produce some instability in SW
VA and NE TN, and overnight accumulations in that area are
expected to be in the 1 to 3 inch range. Most snow will end by
sunrise, and will carry a low PoP in the mountains into Monday
morning. With 850 mb cold advection competing with clouds
decreasing through the day, highs Monday will be in the 40s in the
Valley to mid/upper 30s north.

Overall, the forecast will not change much from the previous
forecast, and the winter weather advisory and SPS will be
unchanged.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...
Forecast uncertainty still high after upper trough moves out
Monday night and weak high pressure with drying replaces it. Ridge
out in Southwest states remains Monday night and Tuesday then
weaken by Wednesday. Upper flow will bring systems across the
northern tier states from the Pacific Northwest to the Mid
Atlantic. Surface low moving across the Great Lakes Monday night
and Tuesday will keep light precipitation north in the Ohio Valley.
Clouds will move into northern sections. The front will move south
into the eastern Tennessee Valley by Tuesday night and early
Wednesday but still expect dry conditions with all rain or snow to
the north. ECMWF model brings weak system through region late
Wednesday into Thursday but GFS is dry. Will keep forecast dry at
that time and follow next weak system of GFS over the area Thursday
night and Friday. Snow north and higher elevations and rain south.
Another dry period Friday night and Saturday before another quick
system in flow to the Northwest moves in. This system looks more
significant as a Surface low develops to the West and brings in
warmer air. There could be a brief period of snow in northern areas
and higher elevations Saturday night before changing to rain
Sunday.

1000 AM EST Sun Jan 29 2017

.DISCUSSION...
The forecast is in line with current obs, and with no change in the
forecast thinking, no update is planned at this time. Any snow
accumulations today will be highly dependent on elevation. So far,
snow has been observed in SW VA and the Cumberland Plateau. The 12Z
OHX sounding shows a freezing level around 2500 ft MSL, and this is
the level of expected snow/rain transition. The current advisory
and SPS reflect this well. The 12Z NAM has come in with higher snow
amounts in the TN Valley, but its accumulation in the Valley during
the day appears overdone given that temperatuers will be in the
lower to mid 40s.

.SHORT TERM...(Today through Monday)...The strongest in our recent
series of short waves will affect the area today and tonight.  Best
moisture and lift look to be this afternoon and early tonight,
although low level flow turns more northwesterly later tonight which
will help some orographic lift to linger late tonight into early
Monday.  Gusty southwest flow today will help keep boundary layer
temps too warm for snow accumulations most areas today, with the
exception of the higher elevations, and expect rain showers in many
valley areas at times. Temps will cool off overnight allowing more
in the way of snow showers in valley locations, but still looks like
bulk of snow accumulations will be the higher elevations. Plan to
keep snow advisory as is for now. Will make only minor adjustments
to MAV temps, which look reasonable overall.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Saturday)...Forecast
predictability a little lower than usual from about Wednesday
through the end of the long term with diverging model solutions.
Still was able to maintain a dry period from Monday night through
Thursday with a slight trending toward less amplification to the
upper level pattern. Superblend applied slight through small chance
pops at mid week as a cold front slips south across the Southern
Appalachian region. However, not a great deal of moisture is
available for lifting in the vicinity of the boundary so kept a dry
forecast going here. Trended closer to the GFS Thursday night
through the end of the forecast period with an initial short wave
pulling the frontal boundary a smidge back to the north; generating
a chance for light rain (and light snow during the colder overnight
periods) in the Thursday night through Friday timeframe. There is
disagreement in system strength and timing with a second wave
impacting the region over the weekend. Went closer to a GFS solution
here. Again, had to use rain for the daytime period with some snow
added into the cooler overnight period during the 24 hour period
Saturday into early Sunday.

.DISCUSSION...
Latest water vapor and RAP upper air analysis indicating the first
in a series of shortwave troughs is beginning to push east across
the CWA. This has brought increasing cloudiness and and an overcast
layer at about 7000-8000 ft. With dewpoints in the upper teens to
low 20s across most of the area, the light returns on radar noted
over southeast Kentucky and southwest Virginia are not reaching
the ground as pcpn at this time.

Forecast is still on track as second in series of shortwaves
currently over central Missouri pushes further SE across the area
by 12-15Z on Sunday commencing period of light snow mainly across
higher elevations of southwest Virginia and Tennessee mountains. As
surface temperatures in the valley warm during the afternoon,
expect pcpn to transition to rain across central Tennessee Valley
while areas closer to Tennesee-Virginia-Kentucky border and
locations in the northern Cumberland Plateau may continue to see
snow showers throughout the afternoon. Currently, all of southwest
Virginia and mountains of east Tennessee remain in a Winter Weather
Advisory while remainder of the central and northern Valleys along
with the northern Cumberland Plateau are still expected to see
accumulations of 2 inches or less.

Tweaked temperature grids as cloud cover has held temps up a bit across
the central and northern valleys. Additionally tweaked sky grid to
account for quicker timing of increasing cloudiness area wide.

.AVIATION...
VFR conditions will continue through the evening, but clouds will be
increasing overnight around the 5 kft level. A trough of low
pressure will be approaching the area Sunday morning, and showers
associated with it are expected at the TAF sites around 12Z. As
colder air aloft moves across the area Sunday, low-level lapse rates
will increase with CAPES increasing to 100-150 J/kg, which will
produce scattered/numerous showers. 

Mainly snow showers at TRI/TYS and rain showers at CHA. Precip
should start as snow and remain light, with vis/cigs staying VFR at
CHA and TYS. It may be slightly heavier at TRI, MVFR vis/cigs will
be forecast there.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Monday)...
The shortwave trough over IL/MO this afternoon will be crossing our
area tonight. Clouds will increase this evening with the
disturbance, but it should produce little precip in our area. It
will be followed by another vort max that is now over MN/SD, and
it should have enough moisture with it to produce light precip
Sunday morning/early afternoon, mainly across the northern half. We
will also see steepening lapse rates Sunday afternoon, to support
scattered to numerous showers. Temperature profiles initially
support snow Sunday morning before boundary layer warming in the
TN Valley changes most precip to rain by midday. With steep lapse
rates, higher elevations may remain mainly snow, and some spots in
SW VA and NE TN will likely have snow with temps in the mid 30s.
This will limit most accumulation on Sunday to the higher terrain
above 2500 ft.

Cold advection builds in Sunday evening as another shortwave
trough crosses the Ohio Valley/KY. Lift and moisture depth are
greatest across the SW VA and NE TN during the 21Z to 06Z time
frame, and temps will support all snow. Upslope winds of 20-25 kts
may enhance amounts in higher elevations. Precip will taper off
gradually on Monday morning as midlevel temps moderate with the
departure of the upper trough axis.

Total snow amounts will be highly dependent on elevation due to the
steep lapse rates Sunday afternoon and upslope wind enhancement.
Amounts of 3-5 inches are possible in the higher terrain, mainly
above 2500 ft. Lower elevations of SW VA and NE TN are expected to
be in the 1-3 inch range, with less than one inch from Morristown
to Knoxville and the Plateau. A Winter Weather Advisory will be
issued for the TN mountains and SW VA. Uncertainty is higher in
the Plateau and lower elevations of NE TN, and most of their
accumulation may not come until Sunday night, so those areas will
be kept out of the advisory for now.

.LONG TERM (Monday night through Saturday)...
Drier air and more zonal flow moves into the area for Monday night
through Wednesday. A weak upper level low moving through the Ohio
Valley will try to bring through a weak front on Wednesday. Models
disagree on amount of moisture that would be present. For
now...left out mention of any scattered light showers in
forecast...as seems there is not enough lift for any convection to
move through the area.

A low level disturbance is expected to move through beginning
Thursday afternoon...bringing a chance for scattered rain through
Saturday. With overnight temperatures Thursday night and Friday
night below freezing in areas north of I40...light snow showers are
possible each night...though no impacts are expected at this time.
Friday and Saturday...as temperatures warm to above freezing...all
snow is expected to change to rain. Temperatures through the
extended will be a couple of degrees above normal for this time of
year.

1034 AM EST Sat Jan 28 2017

.DISCUSSION...
No changes are needed to the forecast this morning. Today will be
sunny, and with a SW wind of 10-15 mph, highs will reach the upper
40s to lower 50s in the Valley. 

Looking forward to the coming snow potential, the 12Z NAM and the
06Z GFS have some large differences in amounts in the TN Valley.
The GFS seems to be an outlier with its higher amounts, and the
SREF supports the NAM. The main difference appears to come on
Sunday morning, when the GFS has colder surface temps than the NAM,
allowing more snow to accumulate that period. Since temps are
expected to be above freezing in the Valley in both models during
that time, the lower amounts of the NAM/SREF appear more
realistic. Will await the 12Z GFS before issuing any W/W/A
products, but given the long time period of snow accumulation (> 24
hours), an advisory will likely be the most appropriate product for
the northern half of the area.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Weak short wave energy
exiting the area early will move away today, and today will feature
quite a bit of sunshine and seasonable temperatures. Some weak and
quick moving short wave energy will move across our area tonight as
it moves through the base of the upper trough. GFS most aggressive
with precip tonight, but given its recent poor performance and
overforecasting snow with these weak waves will lean toward drier
NAM/ECMWF/SREF. Will carry slight chance to low chance PoPs mainly
north and central areas. This precip may start as rain or snow
showers some valley locations, but should transition to all snow
showers/flurries.  MAV temps generally look reasonable, so will stay
close.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday through Friday)...Second night of models
either not running or unavailable in awips. Previously advertised
forecast still in play with shots of short wave energy streaking
through the prevailing northwesterly flow aloft on its way across
the Southern Appalachian region. The low level airmass not really
cold enough to keep precipitation in the form of snow across much of
the valley locales; however some snow may be mixed with the rain in
the early part of the day and toward evening. Temperatures should be
cold enough in the higher terrain in parts of the Cumberland
Plateau, Southwest Virginia and along the North Carolina border
where light accumulations on the order of one inch is possible
during the day Sunday. Sunday night into Monday morning would be the
main period of accumulating snow in these terrain areas with
advisory amounts around one to three inches with possibly two to
four above four thousand feet elevation. The eastern U.S. upper
trough deamplifies a bit Monday into Tuesday but another fast moving
short wave drives southeast across the area Tuesday night into
Wednesday sprinkling a bit of rain and some mainly higher elevation
snow across Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee. We enjoy
another dry period Wednesday night into Thursday with some more
action back in the forecast to finish out the long term period as
some weak short wave energy rides through the Southern Plains into
the Southeastern states. In the cooler regime which will exist
through the week, could not entirely keep precipitation in the form
of rain.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Saturday)...
One vort max is exiting the area this afternoon, but another one is
close on its heels as a broad trough will remain over the eastern
ConUS. The shortwave trough extending from the Great Lakes to the
Ozarks will be crossing our area tonight, and is expected to bring
another shot of flurries or light snow showers as temps aloft cool
and moisture depth increases above the -10 C level. Much like we
have seen today, forcing will be weak, so there will be little
accumulation outside the highest elevations. Even in the higher
terrain, less than a half inch is expected tonight. By sunrise, the
shortwave trough axis will be to our east, and we will have
decreasing clouds through Saturday morning. Nearly full sun should
bring temps in the southern half into the upper 40s, with partial
sun holding temps in the lower to mid 40s north.

.LONG TERM (Saturday night through Friday)...
Another shortwave swinging through the trough Saturday night
through Monday afternoon will bring a couple of chances for snow
showers and light rain to the area. Confidence is low on amounts at
this time as there is some uncertainty with the models. The NAM has
been trending drier in the mid and upper levels Sunday...while
ECMWF and GFS are holding consistent with their higher QPF amounts
from run to run. Have edged a little bit closer to the GFS for snow
amounts...and will need to update snow accumulation amounts closer
to time to see how much dry air is introduced...and how much cold
air makes it into the area at the surface. For now...will settle
with an Special Weather Statement...as snow amounts fall just below
criteria for a watch at this time.

Moisture begins to increase over the area late Saturday night in to
Sunday morning. Areas north of I40 could see a dusting through the
early morning...but energy will be too weak for anything more. As
the day warms above freezing...much of the valley will transistion
to rain...with a rain/snow mix is possible in areas north of I-40.
With an upper level jet moving to the SE of the area...a brief
chance of divergence and lift is possible Sunday afternoon.
Depending on how much cold air is at the surface...could see a
couple of tenths of an inch snow accumulation Sunday afternoon
mainly in NE TN...SW VA... and the east TN mountains.

Sunday evening and night...all rain will transistion to snow with as
temperatures drop below freezing. Due to very little moisture
present overnight...areas south of I40 could see an additional
accumulation of a dusting to a couple of tenths of an inch of snow.
Areas north of I40 will have just enough energy...with enough low
and mid level moisture present...to cause the greatest amount of
snowfall accumulation during this time period. An additional 0.5 to
1.5 inches is possible Sunday evening through the very early morning
Monday. Higher elevations in east TN could see an additional 1 to 2
inches of additional accumulation. Confidence is low on total
snowfall accumulation amounts...seeing as the event is still three
days away and the models are struggling to agree.

The scattered show showers are expected to quickly move east of the
area Monday early afternoon...with more zonal flow setting up
through mid week. A weak front will move through the area...with a
chance for rain Wednesday. Right now...leaving a mention of brief
snow in the forecast early Wednesday morning...but no impacts
expected at this time. Drier air moves in for Thursday...with
another system approaching Friday.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...Some weak short wave energy
brushing by our northern areas today will bring some flurries and
snow showers mainly northern half especially during the morning.
Will carry slight chance to low chance PoPs with this feature.
Another weak short wave will move across the area tonight, with
additional scattered snow showers and flurries expected, again
mainly northern half. Will carry slight chance to low chance PoPs
with this feature as well. Cold air will remain in place through the
period in predominately westerly flow. Expect quite a bit of cloud
cover, with the most persistent cloud cover north.  No major
argument with MAV temps overall.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday through Thursday)...An Eastern United States
long wave trough will take up residence across the region through
the weekend. A couple of shorter wavelength features will be riding
out of the Midwest and across the Southern Appalachians with the
first building in Saturday night. The temperature profile should be
cold enough for some light snow, however model forecasts generate
only light accumulation; mainly in the higher terrain. However, a
stronger upper level trough will be building into the region Sunday
into Sunday night and this system looks like it will be associated
with a little deeper column of moisture and stronger lift. There
could be a dusting of snow in the lower elevations with possibly one
to two inches in the major terrain areas by Monday morning. The
chilly Eastern U.S. long wave trough will be moving away from the
area during the day Monday allowing a dry period from the afternoon
through the day Tuesday. The next cold front will be moving across
the region Tuesday night into Wednesday spreading some light
precipitation across the forecast area. The end of the long term
period ends dry behind this mid week system.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...
A 500 mb vort max in a westerly flow aloft will bring low precip
chances to northern portions of the area during this period. With
boundary layer cooling and lighter winds after sunset, cloud cover
should fill into the Valley this evening, mainly in the northern
half. Increasing moisture depth and slightly cooling temps in the
850-700 mb layer may result  in flurries across SW VA and NE TN
mountains after midnight. The passage of the vort max Friday morning
could spread flurries as far south as Knoxville, and measurable snow
accumulations will be possible in the higher elevations of SW VA and
NE TN. With steep low level lapse rates and an upslope wind,
isolated light snow showers and flurries may continue into Friday
afternoon in that area.

Long Term (Friday night through Thursday)...
A trough is expected to strengthen and move across the area Friday
night through Monday. Westerly flow present through the night
Friday night and into early Saturday will slowly shift to the
northwest...bringing a consistent stream of cooler air than
previously felt for January. Temperatures with this cooler air are
expected to remain several degrees below normal through the middle
of next week.

Around this trough...several disturbances are expected to move
through. The first affecting the area Friday night. Moisture appears
to be very shallow...with gusty winds possible...especially in the
higher elevations. Light scattered snow showers are expected through
mid morning Saturday. However...with the lack of moisture and
lift...only expect a dusting to a little over half of an inch
possible for snow accumulation...and this mainly in NE TN and SW VA.
The snow showers are expected to weaken and move east of the area by
Saturday afternoon...with a few flurries possible in far NE TN and
SW VA Saturday early afternoon. 

A stronger shortwave is expected to approach the area Sunday...with
light snow showers beginning as early as Sunday morning before
sunrise. Models differ on the amount of moisture and lift available
throughout the day...so will be able to say with more confidence
with additional model runs. In areas roughly south of
I40...temperatures are likely to be above freezing through the
afternoon Sunday...causing the scattered light snow showers in the
morning to transition to light rain in the afternoon...then back to
lgith snow overnight as temperatures drop below freezing again.
Models try to delay the freezing temperatures setting in until after
the moisture begins to move out of the area...so snow accumulations
are expected to only be a dusting to a tenth of an inch in the areas
south of I40.

North of I40...temperatures will hover around freezing or a degree
or two above freezing through the afternoon. Light snow in the
morning is expected to turn to a snow/rain mix in the afternoon
along with the warmer temperatures...then back to snow around sunset
as the temperature drops back below freezing. The greatest amount of
lift is expected Sunday morning...however...current models do not
show the lift lining up with the moisture which will be present
overnight Sunday in to Monday morning. For now...looks like a couple
of tenths of an inch snow accumulation is possible Sunday morning in
areas north of I40...with up to an inch expected in NE TN...SW
VA...and the higher elevations in east TN Sunday night in to Monday
morning. Valley locations could see a couple of tenths of an
inch...to half of an inch overnight Sunday in to Monday. 

By Monday afternoon...all activity should be east of the
Appalachians...with a more zonal flow setting up over the area.
Temperatures will slowly warm through the middle of the work
week...reaching near normal values. Wednesday...a weak trough and
front are expected to move through the OH Valley...with scattered
rain chances possible through the day and moving out of the area
Wednesday evening.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
The cold front is pushing through the area now, while the organized
showers are well ahead of the front and should be exiting the
eastern counties shortly.  Will keep some upslope light POPs in the
eastern mountains this morning, then dry this afternoon.  For
tonight, GFS MOS and Superblend both have some POPs, with the
Superblend mainly north.  SREF mainly keeps POPs north as well and
in the higher terrain. Will keep POPs closer to SREF coverage, and
with low POPs. For late evening and overnight, will populate
sprinkles/flurries for areas with 10-14% POP.  For overnight, where
those POPs are, snow totals are generally only a few tenths of an
inch, over the northern plateau, parts of SW Virginia, and in the
eastern TN Mountains, so very light amounts through Friday daybreak.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
Big changes on the way to the forecast on Friday as another cold
front will move through the Southern Appalachians. This front will
bring a shot of colder, Canadian air into the region, and signal a
period of below normal temperatures through early next week. A
large, longwave trough will prevail across the eastern CONUS
through this period, with several additional shortwave troughs/cold
fronts, bringing additional shots of colder air each time. The main
question that will need to be addressed in the coming days is: how
much moisture will accompany each front? This will determine
coverage and intensity of any NW flow snow showers that develop
over the course of the next several days.

On Friday, models are showing a little bit more lift/moisture than
the previous run. However, it appears that any accumulations will be
fairly light, with any meaningful accumulations confined to the
higher elevations of the mountains (above 2500-3000 feet) and
perhaps areas of SW VA and far NE TN. Lingering wrap around moisture
from the the departing frontal system will combine with NW wind flow
to generate some orographic snow showers along the SW VA and East TN
Mountains, with accumulations around 1 inch possible. This
moisture and a secondary shortwave trough will keep light snow
showers in the forecast along the terrain Friday night through
Saturday night. This boundary layer moisture and a stable atmosphere
will help low status in place. The clouds combined with a cold NW
wind will keep lows in the 20s each night and highs in the mid 30s
to lower 40s. 

A stronger front will then push through the region Sunday afternoon
and evening, bringing with a stronger push of colder air and more
appreciable moisture. This frontal boundary will also have some
better lift, which will help generate more widespread snow across
most of the Tennessee Valley. The fact that highs on Sunday will
struggle to climb much above freezing could help set the stage for
some light snowfall accumulations across much of the region. These
Light accumulations will be possible Sunday afternoon and through
the night as temperatures drop below freezing. Generally, up to an
inch in the Valley and higher amounts of a 2-3 inches possible along
the terrain of SW VA and East TN. Thereafter, a high pressure ridge
will then build into the region by Monday afternoon, generally
putting an end to the precipitation and allowing for clear
conditions to develop. Southerly flow will increase by Tuesday,
allowing highs to climb back into the 50s, before the next front
looks to bring moderating temperatures into the middle to end of the
work week.

Most of the showers are past our sites, with KTRI having a few more
showers thru about 07z, then most of the showers will be east.
After that, patches of light sprinkles may be about it. The cold
front is now in Middle TN about to enter E TN and should pass thru
fairly quickly with little fanfare. After the front, drier air will
start pushing into the area, so ceilings should start to rise. I've
got KCHA going SCT for much of the day, but this evening stratocu
from the Mid Miss Valley will be filling in, taking KCHA back to
BKN. Right now, have KTYS and KTRI keeping a ceiling all day

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Thursday)... 
Showers ahead of a cold front will be spreading into the area this
evening. Current coverage of showers in Middle TN is rather sparse,
and appears to be much less than the RAP and HRRR would indicate.
Still, coverage is expected to increase as the pre-frontal
convergence zone reaches the Plateau where daytime heating has been
greater, and will have likely PoPs in the forecast overnight. The
cold front moves through between 08Z and 12Z, shifting winds to the
west and advecting cooler temperatures. Broken to overcast clouds
will likely persist behind the front into Thursday, especially in
the northern half, as the midlevel trough passage comes around
midday Thursday. Northern sections may see an isolated light shower
Thursday beneath the colder midlevel temps with the passing trough.
A few snow flakes cannot be ruled out in higher elevations of SW
VA, but nothing measurable is expected before 00Z Fri. Temperatures
will be 15-20 degrees colder on Thursday compared to today.

.LONG TERM (Thursday night through Wednesday)...
Much cooler air will move in early in the extended behind and
exiting cold front. For Friday through the weekend...highs across
the lower elevations will only climb into the upper 30s and 40s
with overnight lows in the 20s to low 30s. Also...during this
period will see a couple of rounds of unsettle weather. Thursday
night into Friday night...an upper low will rotate moisture and
weak lift into the region. With the cooler air moving in...will see
a mix of rain and snow. Normally favored northwest slopes could see
minor accumulations. Saturday...a few flurries or light snow
showers may linger over far northern areas. Another system moves in
around the Sunday time frame. This system will provide our best
chance of showers during the extended. With deeper moisture and
better lift...should see a mix of rain and snow across low
elevations with any accumulations expected to be light and
generally confined to areas north of I-40. Higher elevations could
see 1 to 2 inches. A few showers may linger across northern areas
into Monday with most locations expected to be dry. Will be between
systems for dry and warmer conditions for Tuesday. Confidence low
by the end of the period...but model trend is for the next system
to be approaching the area for Wednesday. This system currently
looks rather weak and with warmer air in place...expect mainly
isolated rain showers.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
One nice day today, then a cold front moves in tonight that will
start the downward spiral of temperatures for later periods.  Looks
right now that the cooling tonight will be too late for any
measureable snow, even in the mountains, although the rain will be
starting to change-over in the mountains. Winds will get gusty up
the valley this afternoon and through this evening, but the winds
are veered too much to the southwest for a mountain wave high
wind event. 

Low level moisture will be returning, but in the early afternoon,
there may be a window in the eastern tier of Tennessee counties,
where the winds pick up but the Gulf Moisture has not yet arrived,
making fire weather parameters a little more threatening, but in a
limit area and for a limited time.  Wetter conditions lately
will help reduce the overall threat as well.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
Big changes on the way to the forecast in the wake of a strong cold
frontal passage early Thursday morning. This front will bring the
first shot of colder, Canadian air into the region, and signal a
period of below normal temperatures through early next week. A
large, longwave trough will prevail across the eastern CONUS through
this period, with several additional shortwave troughs (cold
fronts), bringing additional shots of colder air each time. The main
question that will need to be addressed in the coming days is: how
much moisture will accompany each front? This will determine
coverage and intensity of any NW flow snow showers that develop in
the coming days.

For now, it appears that any accumulations will be fairly light, with
any meaningful accumulations confined to the higher elevations of the
mountains (above 2500-3000 feet). The first opportunity may be as
early as Thursday night as lingering wrap around moisture from the
the departing frontal system will combine with NW wind flow to
generate some orographic snow showers along the SW VA and East TN
Mountains, with accumulations around 1 inch possible. Some lingering
moisture will keep light snow showers in the forecast along the
terrain Friday through Saturday night. Additionally, boundary layer
moisture and a stable atmosphere will help low status in place.
These clouds and the cold air advection taking place will keep lows
in the 20s to lower 30s each night and highs in the upper 30s to mid
40s. 

A stronger front will then push through the region Sunday afternoon
and evening, bringing with it even colder air and a little better
moisture. Highs Sunday and Monday will struggle to climb much above
freezing, with light NW flow snow showers expected along the
mountains and a good portion of the Tennessee Valley. Light
accumulations will be possible Sunday evening and night as
temperatures drop below freezing, with generally up to an inch in
the Valley and higher amounts possible along the terrain of SW VA
and East TN. Thereafter, a high pressure ridge will then build into
the region by Monday afternoon, putting an end to the precipitation
and allowing for clear conditions to develop. Southerly flow will
increase by Tuesday, allowing highs to climb back into the 50s
heading into the middle of the week.

.DISCUSSION...Forecast on track this evening with a calm and quiet
night ahead. Clouds have all but cleared across the CWA as there
are only a few clouds left across extreme NETN and portions of
SWVA. Only minor adjustments to forecast were made. Tweaked timing
of exiting clouds across the aforementioned areas. Also, dropped
min temps across SWNC by a few degrees as hourly obs were running a
few degrees cooler than forecast. New zones will be sent for temp
adjustment.

.Short Term (Tonight through Wednesday Night)...
Quiet night tonight as our low clouds erode this afternoon.
Ridging aloft moves in tonight...and cold front will move through
TN from west to east during the day Wednesday...keeping our area in
the warm sector all day...so expect high temps in the TN valley to
generally reach the 60s. Chances of rain move in from the west
after lunch...peaking with likely category pops or higher Wednesday
evening. Front will begin to clear precip from the area from west
to east after midnight Wednesday night...with only isolated to
scattered showers left east of I-81 by sunrise Thursday. H5 flow
will be wsw'erly by sunrise Thurs and temps will not quite get to
freezing at most places...so not expecting any issues when the
cold air moves in behind the tapering precip.

.Long Term (Thursday through Tuesday)...
A cold front will be approaching the Atlantic Seaboard to start
the extended portion of the forecast with cold air advecting in
behind the departing front. A long-wave trough across the Eastern
CONUS will prevail throughout much of the long-term forecast.
Several shortwave troughs will rotate through the area during this
portion of the forecast. The challenge will be the amount of lift
and moisture with each passing system. The GFS continues to be the
most bullish with each passing wave producing at least some
measurable precipitation across the region. Cooler air will be in
place with a reinforcing shot of cold air with each passing system.
Thursday night into Friday it appears the best chances for
precipitation will be in the higher elevations and locations north
of I-40. The much more conservative ECMWF even shows some light QPF
during this timeframe as well. For now, have mentioned 20-30 PoPs
due to the uncertainty and low amounts forecast. Due to the cold
air would expect much of this to be snow with any accumulations
mostly limited to the higher elevations with light amounts expected
there as well. Saturday looks to be a dry day as there is a brief
break between system.

Large discrepancies exists in the models on Sunday into Monday with
the strongest of the upper level troughs forecast. The GFS and
Canadian both indicate a phase between a northern trough diving
southward out of the Northern Plains into the Tennessee River Valley
and a southern wave moving across the Central Plains into the
Northern Gulf. This phases allows the trough to dig across the
region brining the heart of the cold air across the area. In
addition, light precipitation will spread across the region. The GFS
is the most bullish with QPF amounts of around 0.1-0.3 inches across
the area with the Canadian being around half of that. Meanwhile, the
ECMWF does not indicate this phase and the trough doesn't dig as far
south. The southern extent of the trough occurs Monday morning
across the Mid-Atlantic. This puts the forecast area on the western
periphery of the cold air advection with the moisture remaining
well to the north and east. This latest run of the ECMWF is much
different than the last run which was more in line with the current
GFS. For the forecast, have included around 30-40 PoPs Sunday into
Sunday night with mostly snow expected with 850 mb temps well below
zero  Celsius even on the warmer ECMWF. Again, there is still a good
bit of model uncertainty and the forecast is likely to change over
the next several days. Monday and Tuesday morning will be the
coldest mornings throughout the forecast period with widespread
upper teens and lower 20s. A moderating temperature trend is
forecast on Tuesday as a ridge builds in from the southwest.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
Low pressure system has exited the Southern Appalachians, but wrap
around moisture and a consistent 5-10 mph NW flow has kept low
stratus and some light sprinkles across most of the area overnight.
This activity will begin to wane around daybreak as drier air works
its way into the Tennessee Valley. Given the progged moisture in
the Boundary Layer and the inversion in place, think that clouds
will stick around for most of the moisture. However, by midday into
the afternoon, these clouds will quickly dissipate, resulting in
mostly sunny conditions by the afternoon. Highs will warm into the
low to upper 50s as winds back to the WSW later in the day and
heating is allowed to occur. A dry, and cooler night will then
occur due to the clear and calm conditions as lows drop well into
the 30s in most locations.

.LONG TERM /Wednesday through Monday/...

At the beginning of this
period a progressive pattern is on the move, with a shortwave upper
ridge overhead, but a trough out in the Plains is quickly
approaching.  At the surface, the ridge has moved to the east and a
return flow is underway with S-SW low level winds across the area. A
cold front ahead of the upper trough is approaching the Miss River.
The front should sweep through our area around Wednesday evening,
with just showers as the richer instability stays to the south. From
Wednesday night through the weekend, a very unsettled pattern
dominates, with clipper after clipper sweeping across the region.
Lift and deeper moisture are questionable in how plentiful each will
be and how far south each will extend from the main sources to the
north.  Finally, around next Monday at the end of this forecast, the
models agree that the pattern will relax somewhat with clippers
passing farther north, and finally by the time the surface ridge
will be settling into the area with very cold air.  

For changes to the initialized grids, went generally cooler than
guidance on Max Temps Friday through Monday by 2-3 degrees and
bumped up sky cover during that time period.  The only Min Temp that
was adjusted was the last grid, next Monday night, when the surface
high will be overhead, think temps will plummet, so took Mins 3-4
degrees below guidance. Keeping only guidance POPs during the
weekend, GFS is very aggressive with lift/moisture, but might be
the outlier.

.DISCUSSION...

Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a
strong closed low centered across North Carolina. Drier air can be
seen moving into the area from the west as a ridge moves in behind
the departing closed low. Current radar imagery also indicates this
drier air moving in with showers ending from southwest to
northeast. However, elevated rain chances will continue across the
higher elevations along the TN/NC line and in SW VA with good
northwesterly flow behind the exiting system. Regardless, amounts
should be light with up to an additional half an inch of rain
possible across the high terrain this evening and tonight. Winds
across the area are below advisory criteria but there have been a
couple of reports of trees down from the gusty winds and saturated
ground, therefore, will continue with the advisory as is.
Temperatures this afternoon at Newfound Gap have been in the mid to
upper 30s and expect there could be some snow mixing in for
locations above 5 kft, this evening and overnight. For now, expect
amounts of a dusting up to half an inch will be possible for these
locations above 5 kft and no winter weather products are
anticipated due to the low amounts and impacts.

Drier air will move into the Southern Appalachians on Tuesday as a
shortwave ridge builds across the region. The pattern throughout
the forecast period will remain progressive and this ridge will be
short-lived. Southerly to southwesterly flow will return to the
area as the ridge axis passes to the east Tuesday night into
Wednesday. An upper level trough will track across the Central
Plains northeastward towards the Great Lakes during this timeframe.
An associated cold front will move across the Mississippi River
Valley into the Tennessee River Valley late Wednesday. Strong warm
air and moisture advection ahead of the system will push highs on
Wednesday up into the 60s areawide with PW values into the 0.8-1.0
inch range. These values are in the 90th percentile for late-
January. The higher moisture values are in a narrow tongue ahead
of the front late Wednesday and expect the precip. will hold off
until then. In addition, not expecting any instability and have
only mentioned showers in the forecast. The timing of the system
between the models is pretty good so far with late Wednesday/early
Thursday being the best chance for precipitation although amounts
should generally be under a tenth of an inch.

Colder air will advect in behind the system late in the week with
temperatures return to near normal for late January. Both the GFS
and ECMWF indicate a series of shortwaves troughs will traverse the
Southern Appalachians late in the week and into early next week.
The GFS soundings indicate enough low-level moisture for
light precipitation during this timeframe. The ECMWF is not near
as bullish with only some light precip. on Friday with no precip.
over the weekend. With the colder air in place, there will be the
chance for a few light snow shower/flurries during this timeframe
but confidence is low at this time. Regardless, the moisture is
limited late in the forecast period and any precipitation would be
light. For now, have mentioned slight chance PoPs for much of the
extended portion of the forecast. The GFS and ECMWF both indicate a
more robust trough early next week that moves through the
northwesterly flow aloft. The GFS indicates a bit more moisture
with this system and the ECMWF keeps conditions dry. Again, have
continued with low PoPs to account for the uncertainty.

.DISCUSSION...

The main feature today will be the strong upper level and surface
low exiting the region and moving up the East Coast. The center of
the low is now just to the east of the area near Boone NC. Rainfall
rates are not overly impressive and generally less than a quarter
on an inch an hour based on radar estimates with slightly higher
amounts in the mountains. Only 0.21 inches of rain has been
measured so far at the Tri-Cities airport and 0.07 inches at McGhee
Tyson since midnight. Therefore, do not expect any widespread
flooding issues but there will be some ponding on roadways due to
the prolonged rainfall over the weekend. In addition, there are a
few rivers across the region that are elevated but are forecast to
remain below flood stage.

For the update, went ahead and moved precip. out the region just a
bit quicker than previously forecast. Current water vapor imagery
indicates dry air moving eastward across TN and this will continue
to wrap into the system as the low moves up the East Coast.
Continued with the wind advisory with strong northwest winds
forecast on the backside of the exiting low.

343 AM EST Mon Jan 23 2017

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
A strong low pressure system is slowly drifting across the Southern
Tennessee Valley this morning. This has brought with it some broad
areas of moderate to heavy rain showers. In addition, due to the
tight pressure gradient, some very gusty winds in the 40-45 mph
range have been observed across the Southern Valley and Plateau. In
fact, low pressure values of 984 mb and 987 mb have been observed
in the Chattanooga metro around midnight. All in all, a very
intense low pressure system.

The main question to the immediate forecast is rainfall chances for
the rest of the morning and later on through the day. Radar shows
training of some moderate to locally heavy bands moving into the
northern Valley and Plateau, which continue to be fed from
activity across Central North Carolina. Elsewhere, a bulk of the
precipitation has pushed north and west into Southern Kentucky and
Middle Tennessee. As the low pressure system shifts back to the
ENE, am expecting an additional round of rain across most of the
Central and Southern Valleys between 12-18Z, through total QPF
during that period is lower than expected. Given the latest model
obs and trends, feel good about higher PoPs across SW VA, far NE
TN, and the East Tennessee Mtns through this evening, with gradual
drying overnight as the low is slow to move away. As a result, the
highest storm total precipitation will be along this area as well,
with the potential for some localized flooding issues later on
today should training continue.

In addition to the precipitation, the aforementioned strong/gusty
gradient winds will persist through the day across much of the
Valley, and overnight across the Mountains. Thus, a Wind Advisory
is in effect for most of the region to account for this.

.LONG TERM /Tuesday through Sunday/...
After a prolonged period of unsettled but warm weather, conditions
will gradually dry out and give way to more seasonal temperatures
during the extended period.

To start the period, some lingering rain showers will be possible
across southwest Virginia Monday morning as the slow moving low
pressure system finally pulls away from the forecast area. Skies
will clear Tuesday into Tuesday night. Southwest flow on Wednesday
ahead of a cold front will allow one more day of mild temperatures
before cooler air settles into the region. The cold front itself
will push through Wednesday into Wednesday night, bringing
increasing clouds and the chance for some showers. 

West to northwest flow takes over behind the frontal passage for the
second half of the week as an upper level trough digs into the
eastern US. This will provide for generally dry but cooler
conditions across the southern half of the forecast area. Southwest
Virginia and northeast Tennessee will see a bit more active weather
as successive weak shortwaves ripple through the trough. These
clipper-type systems will not have very much moisture associated
with them, but it should be enough to produce some orographic snow
across the terrain of southwest Virginia and northeast Tennessee.
It's too early to start talking amounts, but any accumulating snow
should stick to the higher elevations. Have maintained slight chance
PoPs through the weekend across this area to account for the
snowfall potential. Temperatures for the second half of the week
will feature highs in the 30s and 40s and lows in the 20s and 30s.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Monday)... 
Latest water vapor and RAP upper air analysis indicate middle
level low centered over NE Louisiana will continue to move rapidly
east across central Mississippi and central Alabama before lifting
NE into western North Carolina by Monday morning. Associated
surface low located over NW Mississippi is beginning to occlude
with a new deepening sfc low now analyzed over central Alabama.
Northeast and East of this low, next wave of convection is firing
up. With some instability noted out ahead of this feature in
central Alabama, SBCAPE values approaching 1000 J/kg, expect this
activity to hold together as it approaches our SW counties by 21Z-
22Z this afternoon. With limited support for severe convection over
the SW portion of the CWA, fcst SBCAPE of 600 J/kg and weakening
shear, a few of these storms may become strong to marginally severe
with gusty damaging winds and hail possible through the evening
hours.

Hires along with all other guidance models in agreement that period
of best pcpn chances will occur from this evening into the morning
hours Monday as this low continues to deepen and shift NE into
Southern Virginia. Current MRMS pcpn rates over central Alabama
show some instantaneous pcpn rates of 2 inches or more. Overall,
latest pcpn guidance has backed off on event totals with current
forecast for about 1-2 inches area wide with some isolated mountain
locations and areas seeing a heavier rainshowers/tstm possibly
seeing 2.5 inches before it ends. Despite downward trend in pcpn
totals, will re-issue hydrological outlook statement to highlight
continued potential for possible localized flooding and flash
flooding.

As the low tracks NE on Monday, winds will increase and become
gusty particularly across the southern half of the CWA before the
gradient decreases beyond the period, Monday night. Current
forecast for winds and wind gusts remains below advisory criteria,
however, subsequent shift in track, or slight deepening may
necessitate wind advisory for higher elevations of the Appalachians
by late Monday. 

.LONG TERM (Monday Night through Sunday)... 
The forecast area will gradually dry out during the period but the
bad news is the lovely spring- like weather regime will gradually
give way to a more normal winter pattern during the latter half of
the week, as another amplified long wave trough builds in across
most of the nation. At the start of the period, the deep closed low
will move very slowly east away from the Southern Appalachians.
Therefore, rain showers will continue Monday night over the region;
eventually ending from southwest to northeast by Tuesday morning.
The dry flow behind the departing system will be northwesterly so
despite a return to some sunshine, temperatures will warm only to
the 50s for afternoon highs. However, a milder southerly return
flow will develop again later Tuesday night into Wednesday ahead of
another upper trough and cold front. Temperatures should bounce
back into the 60s on Wednesday but there will be a small chance of
rain showers later in the afternoon into the evening as some
moisture builds in ahead of the front. This second half of the
forecast will be the return to winter as a prevailing northwesterly
flow regime continues right into the weekend. This will be a
generally dry period for much of the southern half of the forecast
area but a little more active for the northern half with emphasis
in the higher terrain. It looks like about three to four weak waves
of low pressure will move southeast out of the Northern Plains and
Great Lakes in clipper fashion with just enough moisture in the
colder pattern to produce orographic snowfall across Southwest
Virginia and Northeast Tennessee. Of course, more detailed
forecasts will be in production later in the week to delineate how
this will play out, but it appears that any accumulating snow would
favor the higher terrain features Thursday through Sunday.

VFR cigs will lower to MVFR by this evening as pcpn spreads
northeastward ahead of the approaching low. As the low matures and
deepens into Monday morning, cigs will lower to IFR at all

low, winds will increase and become gusty out of the North at both
KCHA, and to a lesser extent at KTYS. IFR conditions are then
expected to prevail at KTRI/KTYS through the end of the forecast

.DISCUSSION...
Currently in a lull during this period of active weather. Last of
early morning pcpn is now exiting the area. It will be late
afternoon/early evening before the next round of pcpn begins to
impact the southern counties before spreading NE through the
evening. Although potential for strong to marginally severe weather
is possible with this next round, there will be limited CAPE with
best dynamic support and shear remaining well south of the area.
That said, did keep tstms in grids... particularly over the
southern third of the area for this afternoon and evening.
Increased max temps by a degree or two for southern third of the
area this afternoon as breaks in clouds have allowed for some
modest additional heating.

Stacked low pressure center over central Arkansas is expected to
move eastward along the TN border with MS- AL-GA before lifting NE
along the spine of the Appalachians by Monday morning. Decreased
QPF values area wide by about .15-.20 inches for remainder of the
afternoon. However, potential for fairly significant rainfall on
the order of 1.5 to 2.5 inches with locally higher amounts are
still possible tonight and Monday as this low drifts NE and
Gulf/Atlantic moisture continues to be pumped into the region.

.SHORT TERM /Today through Monday/...
Active pattern over the next 36 hours, with several rounds of
precipitation to impact the region as an upper-level low pressure
system moves across the Tennessee Valley. The first wave is
associated with a prefrontal trough currently moving through
northern Alabama and Georgia as of 3 AM. These showers and
thunderstorms will continue their march into Southeast Tennessee
during the predawn hours. Given some limited instability, good
shear, and a MCV-like feature over NE Alabama, cannot rule out a
strong to marginally severe thunderstorm -- mainly from damaging
wind gusts. Over the course of the morning hours, these showers and
isolated thunderstorms will weaken as they move across the Central
and Northern Valleys due to the lack of instability. As the
precipitation shield erodes, QPF amounts may be a little lower
than originally though along and north of I-40 during the day.

As the LLJ ramps up by the late afternoon and evening, the upper-
low will deepen as it races into Alabama and Georgia. This will
generate a second big round of showers and thunderstorms (a few of
which could be strong to marginally severe) during the 21-03z
timeframe. This activity will form along and ahead of the slow
advancing cloud front from the west. Ahead of the boundary, a deep
Gulf moisture flux will be in place -- parallel to this boundary.
This could set the stage for training later on tonight and Monday
morning, especially along the Mountains and the Central and
Northern Valleys. Additionally, PWAT values will be at/above 1.0
inches, with mild temperatures promoting a deep, warm cloud layer.
There will also be some modest instability of 500-1000 j/kg of
elevated CAPE, which will help to support more robust, organized
updrafts with the strongest clusters. Thus, a localized flash
flood/areal flood threat is expected tonight into Monday. The
threat looks to be isolated enough to hold off on a watch, but will
keep the Hydrologic Outlook going to address this. Storm total QPF
of 1.5 to 2.5 inches seems common, with high amounts at/above 3
inches possible along the East Tennessee and Western North Carolina
Mountains.

As the low shifts east across the region Monday morning, dynamic
cooling will result in a lowering of the melting level to 4500 to
5000 feet along the East Tennessee Mountains. Thus, some very light
snow accumulations are possible along the peaks at Newfound Gap,
Mt Leconte and Clingmans Dome in Great Smoky Mountains National
Park. Otherwise, the cooler air will filter in on Monday afternoon
behind this system, with breezy conditions thanks to the strong
pressure gradient. Highs will still be mild in the 50s as the true
blast of cool will not arrive until Tuesday morning. Precipitation
will taper off by the evening in the valley and over the cource of
the night in the Mountains. 

.LONG TERM /Monday Night through Saturday/...
Parent surface low will lift further northeast Monday night into
Tuesday, with rain showers gradually tapering off from southwest to
northeast through Tuesday afternoon. As cooler air funnels in early
Tuesday morning, some flakes may mix in across the highest
elevations of the Smokys. Winds will become quite breezy on the
backside of the low, especially along the Smokys where winds may
approach advisory levels Monday night. Will continue mention of
gusty winds in the HWO. Weak ridging will build in for the second
half of Tuesday, bringing a brief period of dry weather. Southwest
flow on Wednesday will warm highs back into the 60s for one more
day, before a cold front sweeps through the area Wednesday night
into Thursday and temperatures turn colder. Model solutions
continue to diverge at this point in the forecast, with the GFS
showing a much wetter frontal passage than the drier ECMWF. For
now, have broadbrushed slight chance to chance PoPs Wednesday and
Thursday in association with this feature. A few snowflakes may mix
in Thursday morning across higher elevations as colder air once
again works into the area. It will turn much cooler for the end of
the week with upper level troughing over the eastern US. A couple
weak shortwaves will ripple through this trough through the
weekend. Diving in from the midwest, there's not a lot of moisture
associated with them, but with predominately northwest flow there
should be enough for some orographically driven snowfall
accumulations across the higher elevations. Some snowflakes may mix
in at lower elevations with temperatures dipping to near freezing
at nighttime, but with temperatures rising into the upper 30s to
lower 40s in the valleys during the day no accumulation is expected
at this time.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tomorrow)... We have entered into a
fairly active weather pattern that looks to be with us through most
of the week. With it we have the threat of severe weather...mainly
hail and some damaging winds tonight and Sunday. Then we have a
heavy rainfall potential and possible flooding issues by Sunday
night and Monday. Finally we have chances of frozen pcpn at
elevations above 3500 ft by Monday morning. We gradually dry out by
mid week before next system brings pcpn, possibly in the form of
snow, back into the area by Friday morning into the weekend.

First in a series of shortwaves is now moving NE out of the area.
Water vapor indicating some drying behind this first shortwave
that HRRR picks up on keeping POPs to minimum until overnight
tonight when the next shortwave begins to push across the area.
With it, gradually increasing POPs from SW to NE overnight. With
enough instability, MUCAPE in excess of 1000 J/kg, and ample SFC-3
km shear (50+ kts at KCHA) that threat of severe weather, mainly
winds, hail will be possible in the overnight hours.

Then, by tomorrow afternoon, rather strong middle level low,
currently over Colorado/New Mexico will drive eastward toward
Northern Mississippi and Northern Alabama. Associated surface low
looks to move NE across middle TN during the day with warm frontal
boundary just reaching into out southern counties as this low
begins to rapidly occlude. With some elevated instability in place,
threat of severe hail with localized damaging winds are possible
across portions of our area mainly S of I-40. Similarly, PW values
exceeding an inch throughout the area, will help to push rainfall
totals in excess of 1 inch across the southern half of the area.

.LONG TERM (Sunday Night through Saturday)... 
As the parent surface low center further occludes Sunday into
Monday, cold air aloft will bring increase snow chances,
particularly to elevations above 3500 ft where those areas could
see up to a few inches by late Monday morning. Additionally,
deformation zone on back side of the upper low will likely keep
pcpn bands extending across SW Virginia, NE Tennessee and central
to northern portions of the Appalachian mountains which is expected
to likely add another

Guidance suggests ample moisture with this system particularly
Sunday and Monday could result in some possible flooding and flash
flooding issues as 3 day QPF totals look to be near 2 inches across
much of the valley and Plateau while the Appalachians could see 3
inches, with localized totals of over 3.5 inches. On a positive
note, pcpn totals for the exiting system look to be less than
earlier forecasted at 0.5 inches or less across the area. In lieu
of issuing any flood watch, will opt to update the Hydrological
Outlook while continuing to highlight the heavy rain potential for
the Appalachians and Gatlinburg burn scar.

Short period of mid week drying precedes the next system moving in
the area for Friday and Saturday with some prospect of frozen
precipitation possible.

.AVIATION...Moderately strong upper level trough will continue to
drive northeast through the Southern Appalachian region this
afternoon. The upper feature is moving so quickly that precip is
basically over at cha and should be complete at tys around 20-21z.
Would expect light rain to affect tri around 20-23z. Drier air is
building rapidly east behind today's system and should allow for a
return to vfr conditions for several hours. Placed some mvfr fog
development in the forecast around around 01z-04z but do wonder
if this is overforecasting visibility reduction prior to the
arrival of the main component of this weekend's active weather.
This component is a relatively deep low pressure system that will
shift east from the Southern Plains through the Lower Mississippi
Valley from this evening through mid day Sunday. Sufficient
instability and deep moisture should be available for thunderstorm
formation later tonight into Sunday morning so kept this idea
going. Stayed in an mvfr category through this period, but flight
conditions may improve to vfr around 12-14z at cha and tys for a
few hours before the next wave of showers and thunderstorms builds
east ahead of the slowing pressure system.

Latest water vapor imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicate
first in a weekend series of strong shortwave troughs is moving NE
across central Mississippi and Alabama this morning. Ahead of it, a
broad area of moderate pcpn with some embedded thunderstorms is
beginning to spread NE toward our SE TN counties with light rain
now being reported at KCHA. Latest hires models indicate that this

.SHORT TERM /Today through Sunday Night/...
A threat of severe thunderstorms, locally heavy rainfall and flooding
are possible later this afternoon/evening and again Sunday and
Sunday night. A lead shortwave trough will quickly shift northeast
into the Southern Appalachians late this morning, bringing a broad
area of scattered showers and thunderstorms across the region from
the late morning through the mid-afternoon, before exiting the far
northeastern zones late in the day.

Attention will then shift to the SW as a rapidly NE advancing warm front
will move into the southern Tennesse Valley. Depending on how much
clearing can occur behind the first wave of precipitation,
the atmosphere across the southern Plateau and Valley (and perhaps
as far north as the I-40 corridor) will be able to destabilize
somewhat ahead of the next round of storms that will roll in
during the 06-12z time period early Sunday morning. Progged CAPE
values off of the model KCHA soundings are as high as 1500 j/kg,
with strong 0-3 km speed/directional shear. This will allow for
some strong to severe thunderstorms within this warm sector.
Damaging winds and marginally severe hail are the main threats
with the strongest activity, but a very isolated tornado cannot be
ruled out (mainly along the far Southern Plateau/Valley) due to
the uncertainty of how far north the warm front will make it.

For Sunday, the aforementioned wave of showers and storms will continue
it's march through the area during the morning hours.Coinciding
with this is a strengthening LLJ along the mountains which will
lead to some breezy/gusty southerly winds during the day on Sunday.
These downslope winds will help to keep high temperatures on the
mild side despite the precipitation and cloud cover. To the west, a
deepening closed upper-low will quickly race toward the Southern
Appalachians, bringing a third and much longer duration shower and
thunderstorm event late Sunday afternoon into Sunday night. Given
the strong shear, along with some marginal instabilty in place, the
potential for strong to perhaps severe thunderstorms will exist
once again. This will particularly be true if the track of the
upper-low shifts a little more to the north.

However, the primary concern with this deepening upper-level low pressure
system is heavy rainfall and the potential for localized flash
flooding (particularly along the Great Smoky Mountains). There are
several concerns regarding this system with respect to the
heavy rainfall potential. First, a deep, moist southerly flow off
the Gulf of Mexico parallel to a slow-moving northeastward
tracking cold front. This could result in training of clusters of
showers and thunderstorms Sunday night into Monday. Also, A deep
warm cloud layer, with some appreciable instabilty to support
organized updrafts. Widespread storm total QPF amounts from
tonight through Monday show widespread 2 to 3 inches of rainfall
across much of the CWA, with locally higher amounts possible along
the East Tennessee Mountains. Though it is a little early for a
watch, we have opted to issue a Hydrologic Outlook and have
mentioned these threats in the HWO as well.


.LONG TERM /Monday through Friday/...
The deep upper low will slide further northeast into the Mid
Atlantic on Monday. Rain showers will continue across much of the
area as moisture continues to be slung around the top of the low
and back into our region. As the low lifts further north Monday
night into Tuesday, rain showers will gradually taper off from
southwest to northeast. Winds will become quite breezy on the
backside of the low, especially along the Smokys where winds may
approach advisory levels by Monday night. Will mention gusty winds
in the HWO. As cooler air funnels in Monday night, a brief period
of light snow is possible across the highest elevations of the
Smoky Mountains. Weak ridging will build in for the second half of
Tuesday, bringing a brief period of dry weather. Southwest flow on
Wednesday will warm highs back into the 60s for one more day,
before a cold front sweeps through the area Wednesday night into
Thursday and temperatures turn colder. From here, model solutions
diverge, with the GFS showing a much wetter frontal passage than
the drier ECMWF. For now, have broadbrushed slight chance to chance
PoPs Wednesday and Thursday in association with this feature. A few
snowflakes may mix in Thursday morning across higher elevations as
colder air once again works into the area. It will turn much cooler
for the end of the week as a deepening upper trough builds over
much of the country. A weak shortwave will ripple through this
trough Thursday night into Friday. There's not a lot of moisture
associated with it, but with predominately northwest flow there
should be enough for some orographically driven snowfall across the
higher elevations. Some snowflakes may mix in even at lower
elevations with temperatures dipping to near freezing Friday
morning, but no accumulation is expected in the valleys at this
time.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tomorrow)...
Visible satellite imagery indicating more breaks in cloud cover this
afternoon as the deep moisture has exited NE of the area. With
these breaks, temperatures have been able to climb into the upper
60's over southern two-thirds of the area, with Chattanooga
currently at 70 degrees and within a degree of tying a record of 71
set in 1929.

We will continue to experience a break in pcpn overnight tonight ahead
of the next active weather period. Given residual low level moisture,
we may see some localized areas of patchy fog by late tonight into
the morning hours. Otherwise, overnight lows from the upper 40's
to middle 50's will be about 15-20 degrees F above late January
normals.

For tomorrow, middle level ridge axis extends N to S along the east
coast. A shortwave trough will ride NE along the western periphery
of this ridge across our area during the day. This coupled with
increasing instability and the return of significant moisture to
the lowest 300 mb of the atmosphere will help to generate shower
activity that is expected to push from SW to NE across the area
through the day. Overall rainfall amounts with this round of pcpn
do not look to be that impressive given continued middle level dry
air holding on for most of the day. Would expect most areas to see
less than 0.25 inches in shower activity. However, the combination
of increasing instability coupled with the shortwave energy and
favorable 0-3 km directional shear fcst for the latter portion of
the period, strong to possibly severe convection could develop and
would produce locally higher rainfall amounts. Threat for strong to
possible severe looks to be mainly over the southern third of the
area during the afternoon and evening hours with greatest threat
expected to be wind, hail, and possible localized flooding.

.LONG TERM (Tomorrow Night through Friday)...
The active weather pattern continues through the long term with a
strong short wave driving northeast across the Southern
Appalachians Saturday night into Sunday, followed by a deep upper
level low Sunday into Monday. Probability will be in the
categorical range for much of the area during this period for
showers. However, strong dynamics and instability with this system
will require thunderstorms to be included in the forecast. Some of
the storms may be rather strong late Saturday night into Sunday.
The main threat with the storms will be strong and gusty winds. The
showers will taper off from slowly from west to east Monday night
into Tuesday as the deep upper low shifts northeast into the
Northeastern U.S. Some colder air will build in behind this system
and the precip may end as brief period of light snow across the
highest terrain in the Smoky Mountains. Due to the broadbrushed
nature of the superblend protocol, the only period in the remainder
of the long term with no pops will be Tuesday night as drier air
and ridging build into the region. The next upper trough and
surface cold frontal system will move across the area Wednesday
into Wednesday night in the form of rain showers. However, it will
be turning colder as a deepening upper trough develops over much of
the nation and there may be opportunities for orographically driven
snowfall as perhaps as many as three shorter wavelength features
build across the Southern Appalachians in this predominant
northwest flow regime.

.SHORT TERM /Today and Tonight/...
A negatively tilting upper-trough over the central Plains has
pushed a weak cold front and a broad area of moderate to locally
heavy showers over the eastern Tennessee Valley. The last of this
activity is currently exiting the Cumberland Plateau and is moving
into the I-75 corridor of the central/southern Valleys as of 0830Z.
Over the next 3-4 hours, this activity will spread NE across the
region, before exiting into NC/VA after 12-13Z.

Drier air will quickly shift into the region today as an upper-
level ridge axis shifts into the area by midday. Low stratus will
be slow to dissipate this morning, thanks to residual moisture
remaining trapped in the boundary layer. However, by 18z, drier air
will begin to help create some breaks in the clouds over much of
the Valley. This heating, along with some southerly winds will
help to push highs well into the mid to upper 60s in most spots. A
partly cloudy sky will linger through the evening and most of the
night, before another round of clouds increase late tonight ahead
of an approaching warm front from the SW. Another round of showers
is possible across the far south late tonight, but most of the
shower and thunderstorm activity will hold off until late Saturday
morning.

.LONG TERM /Saturday through Thursday/...
An active weekend is shaping up in the weather department across
the Southern Appalachians. Saturday should start off dry, but
clouds will increase throughout the morning hours as gulf moisture
begins to stream into the area. By afternoon, showers are likely
across much of the area with PWAT values increasing to near 1.0
inch. Enough instability will be in place across the southern half
of the forecast area to spark some afternoon thunderstorms. There
is a chance that a few storms could strengthen and become severe,
especially during the late afternoon and evening hours as a warm
front approaches the area and shear increases. Model soundings at
KCHA show a backed wind profile at the surface, strong 0-1 km speed
shear, good directional shear in the 0-3 km layer (indicative by
the looped hodograph depicted on the 00z GFS run). This shear,
combined with a NE advancing warm front could result in a very
isolated tornado threat across the S. Plateau/Valley Saturday
afternoon/evening. Will make a mention in the HWO.

An upper level closed low will rotate into the southeast US on
Sunday, bringing another chance for thunderstorms and heavy rain. At
this point, the center of the low is progged to cross to our
southeast. However, we will need to keep a close eye on this track.
If the center of the low shifts just slightly further north, this
would put portions of our forecast area in position for another
round of strong to severe storms Sunday night. Rain chances will
continue into Monday night as the low tracks across the Carolinas
and continues to sling moisture back into our area. Weak ridging
builds in for Tuesday into Wednesday, bringing a brief period of
drier conditions. From here, model solutions diverge, but the
general consensus is another cold front will bring some showers as
it pushes through the region Wednesday into Thursday. Have carried
widespread slight chance to chance PoPs for this period.

For most of the extended period, mild temperatures will prevail,
with highs in the 50s and 60s. Cooler air may finally return to the
area for the second half of next week following the
Wednesday/Thursday frontal passage.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Friday)...
Surface low center over NW Mississippi extends a warm front
eastward along the Tennessee border then SE into central Georgia.
As this low continues to move NE across middle Tennessee tonight,
the preceding warm front will lift northward across our area. Water
vapor imagery and latest SPC meso analysis of moisture transport
indicate a nice slug of moisture, south of the front, over central
Mississippi this afternoon that is being captured well by the
latest NAM12 run. Model suggests that this moisture will move NE
across our area overnight tonight as shortwave energy aloft ejects
NE ahead of a lifting middle level low located over central Kansas
today. Model forecasted PW values approaching 1.4 inches reach
climatological maximum for this time of year and further help to
support rainfall amounts of 1 to 1.5 inches across portions of SE
Tennessee through tonight. Enough instability exists as the front
moves northward that a few evening and overnight thunderstorms will
be possible. Although overall flash flood guidance across the area
remains on the order of 1.5 inches to 1.8 inches per hour, rainfall
rates may be significant enough in these showers and possible
thunderstorms to potentially cause localized flooding issues and
will need to be monitored.

Gradually improving conditions through the second half of Friday as
the first system lifts to the NE and some relatively drier air and
ridging aloft pushes into the region. Under continued unseasonably
warm regime and persistent southerly flow, forecast high temps on
Friday may flirt with records of 71 deg F set in 1929 at
Chattanooga and 71 deg F set in 1906 at Knoxville.

.LONG TERM (Friday Night Through Thursday)...
An active weekend shaping up in the weather department across the
Southern Appalachians with a couple of episodes of widespread
showers and even a decent likelihood of thunderstorms across mainly
southern parts of the forecast area. The first feature builds in
ahead of the western states long wave trough bringing showers from
southwest through northeast during the day Saturday. Sufficient
instability will be in place across western through southern parts
of the forecast area for the development of thunderstorms. There is
a chance that a couple storms could strengthen enough to produce
severe weather later Saturday into Saturday night as an even
stronger upper level short wave feature rotates into the
Southeastern United States in the form of an upper level low. This
feature also takes full advantage of the Gulf of Mexico's moisture
supply spreading more showers and even a few thunderstorms across
the forecast area later Saturday night through Sunday night. This
large pressure system shifts slowly east to the Middle Atlantic
Coast Monday night into Tuesday finally allowing some drier air to
build into the region. Model solutions diverge during the final two
days of the extended period leading to typical uncertainty during
this remote part of the forecast. It appears another upper trough
and frontal system presses into the Eastern U.S. around Wednesday
into Thursday and the superblend broadbrushes some slight and low
chance pops for rain showers in association with this system.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...

Low pressure has moved into Louisiana along old frontal boundary
and is forecast to lift slowly northeast into the Ohio Valley over
the next 24 hours. Upper level ridging over the northern Gulf of
Mexico and Florida is being flattened as closed upper level low
over the southern Plains moves into the upper Mississippi Valley.
Subtropical moisture is being lifted northeast toward southeast
Tennessee north of the front with rain now developing across the
southern Plateau and southern Valley at this hour. Short range
models show this trend continuing the next few hours then after a
brief break late this morning and early afternoon then more rain
moving in late afternoon and evening. Precipitable Water values
will be high and with the southerly flow and shortwave energy
rainfall amounts of one to two inches are possible across southeast
Tennessee tonight. Some localized flooding could occur. Enough
instability will be present for a few thunderstorms late afternoon
and evening. Highs today will be again mild in the 60s. Lows
tonight still mild with showers and storms and southerly flow. Most
locations lower to mid 50s except upper 40s northeast Tennessee
valley.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...

An active weather pattern will feature throughout the long-term
forecast with a few breaks in the precipitation from time to time. In
addition, above average temperatures will continue throughout the
forecast period with precip. all in the liquid form. 

An exiting trough to the northeast and a shortwave ridge moving
across the Southern Appalachians will start the extended forecast
period on Friday. A few lingering showers will be possible early in
the day but significant drying in the mid and upper levels should
bring any leftover precipitation to a quick end. PW values will drop
down into the 0.6-0.7 inch range Friday into Friday night. These
values are still well above normal for late January but the lack of
any upper level support will give the area a brief break in the
precipitation Friday afternoon into Saturday morning. 

A series of shortwave troughs will move through the Southern
Appalachians over the weekend keeping elevated chances for showers
and thunderstorms throughout the period. The first shortwave trough
will move into the region early Saturday with warm air and moisture
advection ahead of the trough. PW values will increase into the 0.8-
1.0 inch range on Saturday. These values are near the 90th
percentile for late January. Models also depict a secondary warm
front moving into the Southern Valley and Southern Plateau counties
during the afternoon. SBCAPE values to the south of this boundary
are as high as 1000 J/Kg with decent directional low-level shear
along the boundary with 0-1 km SRH values around 150-250 m2/sr.
Based on this, will continue with threat for strong to severe storms
in the HWO for Saturday afternoon mainly over the Southern Plateau
and Southern Valley. Expect any strong or severe storms will weaken
during the overnight period as the low level winds weaken and the
low level boundary becomes less defined. Another shortwave trough
will move across the region Saturday night and expect widespread
showers will continue with a few thunderstorms. 

An upper level closed low will move eastward across the Southeastern
U.S. on Sunday. The latest models have been further south and faster
with the track of the closed low on Sunday. In this scenario, the
track of the low would not be favorable for strong to severe storms
across the region. However, MUCAPE values will generally be < 500
J/Kg, 0-6 km bulk shear around 50-70 kts with weak low level 0-1 km
SRH only around 50-150 m2/s2. Based on this, there still appears to
be at least a threat for strong to marginally severe storms and will
continue the wording in the HWO for now. Atmospheric profiles remain
highly saturated as the closed low takes a northern turn across the
Mid-Atlantic Sunday night into Monday. Lower rain chances will
continue on Tuesday as the system tracks up the Eastern Seaboard.
Cooler temperatures are expected to start the work week thanks to
the closed low, but temperatures will still run around 8-12 degrees
above average. No PoPs are forecast for Tuesday night as another
system moves into the area by Wednesday.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight through Tomorrow Night)...
Latest surface analysis indicates a low pressure center having
formed along the tail end of a sfc front which extends across
central North Carolina southwest to coastal Texas. This low over SE
Texas today, will deepen some as it moves NE through Thursday Night
moving into the Ohio Valley by Friday morning. Middle level low
located over Western Oklahoma this afternoon will begin to lift NE
tomorrow becoming located over Iowa by Friday morning.

Under a building middle level ridge tonight, subtropical moisture 
continues to pump northeastward from the tropical East Pacific
into the SE US. Model soundings indicate enough moisture advection
that PW values approach or exceed the seasonal maxima by Thursday
night at points across the southern third of the area, while
locations further north still reach above the 90th percentile for
this time of the year. As the middle level low finally lifts NE, a
series of shortwaves eject eastward from the base of the low
providing dynamic support to produce a fairly efficient rain maker.
QPF totals in excess of 1 inch are possible over the SW portion of
the area through Thursday night while the NE corner of TN and all
of SW VA will likely remain around 0.25 inches or less as the front
is yet to push through that area by the end of the short term. With
some instability creeping into our SW counties by tomorrow evening,
a few rumbles of thunder are possible with this round of
precipitation, particularly over the southern half of the area.

Under the continued southerly flow, temperatures will remain well
above normal. Overnight lows tonight should be about 10 degrees
above normal increasing to near 20 degrees above normal for
tomorrow night...but still about 5 degrees below record high
minimum temperatures. Meanwhile the daytime high on Thursday will
approach 15 degrees above normal under rainy and cloudy skies. 


.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...

Our first system will continue to slowly exit the region to the
northeast and we will see a brief period of quiet weather to end the
work week as we head into the weekend. A good jet will help to bring
in moist on Saturday, this moist air will be pretty unstable for
this time of year and we have a good chance to see showers and
thunderstorms Saturday through Sunday. As the precipitation moves in
there will be a boundary draped across the region and it could act
to focus thunderstorm chances in our area. CAPE values in our area,
specifically the southern Tennessee Valley could be in the 1000 J/Kg
range, this in combination with good shear along the boundary could
be the ingredients needed to see strong to severe thunderstorms. 

The low moving across the Southeastern United Sates will eventually
kick out any remnant thunderstorms on Sunday into Monday and we will
continue with widespread rain chances into early next week. The low
finally exits to our east by the middle of the week and we get a
chance to dry out as drier northerly/westerly winds take over.
Another frontal boundary will make a run at the area at the end of
next week and we could see a brief bout of rain with this frontal
passage as well. 

During this entire forecast we will continue to see unseasonably
warm temperatures with highs topping out 10-15 degrees above normal.
These unseasonably warm temperatures will keep any precipitation we
see in the form of liquid throughout the entire forecast.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and tonight)...

Upper trough moving east across Ohio Valley this morning is pushing
a cold front across eastern sections of the forecast area this
morning. Light rain showers across eastern third of the region will
move out by mid morning. Some drier air will move in behind the
front with skies clearing by afternoon. The break in the clouds
will be brief this afternoon and evening as surface low in Texas
along the front moves into the lower Mississippi valley tonight.
The front to the south will begin to move back north as a warm
front with moisture overrunning it late tonight. A few showers will
develop late across southeast Tennessee. Highs today will be
several degrees cooler than Tuesday behind the front but still in
the mild mid 50s to lower 60s. Tonight with partly cloudy to
possibly clear skies early lows will drop to near freezing
northeast and mid 30s to near 40 elsewhere except southern plateau
and valley where clouds move in first lows will stay in the mid to
upper 40s.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Tuesday)...

An active pattern is expected throughout the extended forecast with
higher than normal PW values and temperatures expected throughout
much of the forecast period.

For the beginning of the extended period on Thursday morning an
upper level trough will be moving eastward across the Central and
Southern Plains. At the surface, a warm front will be located just
to the south of the area with a cold front across the Lower
Mississippi River Valley. Southeasterly downsloping flow around an
exiting high pressure to the northeast will counteract some of the
isentropic ascent ahead of the approaching warm front and pushed
PoPs back a bit with highest chances Thursday afternoon and into the
overnight hours. These downsloping winds will lead to the highest
temperatures along the foothills with highs in the low to mid 60s.
The upper level trough will take on a negative tilt later in the day
as it moves into the Tennessee River Valley. At this point, there
will be some weak instability and have mentioned a slight chance for
thunderstorms in the forecast late Thursday afternoon into early
Friday morning. Upper level drying moves into the region Friday as
the trough axis passes to the east and a shortwave ridge moves into
the area. Highs on Friday will still be well above normal with
values generally in 60s. 

The next system will move in on Saturday as strong low level warm
air and moisture advection continue into the weekend. A tropical jet
will bring in a series of shortwave trough across the Southeastern
U.S. over the weekend. Rain chances will increase through the day
Saturday with strong warm air and moisture advection. Models depict
a warm front lifting northward during the afternoon with a good
directional shear along the boundary with SBCAPE values nearing 1000
J/Kg across the Southern Valley and Southern Plateau late in the
afternoon. An upper level trough will close off across the Lower
Mississippi River Valley early Sunday. The continued warm advection
and moisture advection will push SBCAPE values up into the 500-1200
J/Kg range across the forecast area, however, there is a bit of a
capping inversion on the GFS forecast soundings. Low level shear
still remains decent around 150-250 m2/s2. The system is still
several days away but will go ahead and add the mention for strong
to severe storms to the HWO for Saturday and Sunday with the threat
on Saturday limited to the Southern Valley and Plateau. 

Cooler temperatures are expected to start the work week as the upper
level low moves overhead. This will keep chances for showers
continuing late in the forecast period. Despite the cooler air
aloft, all of the precipitation from the upper level low should be in
the form of rain. The upper level low will eventually drift to the
northeast Monday night into Tuesday with drier air moving in for the
middle of the work week.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...
Cold front will be crossing the forecast area this evening and
pushing east of the area tonight. With very little instability to
begin with, the setting sun should limit convection chances even
further, and we should not see any thunder after nightfall. Some
lingering showers are possible across the east Wednesday morning,
then drier air moves in for the remainder of the day. Skies will
clear a bit during the afternoon and we should see at least a few
peeks of sunshine. Winds will shift from the west behind the front
and gusts will diminish. Despite a cold front moving through, the
air behind it isn't too much cooler and highs tomorrow will still
be in the 50s.

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
An active weather pattern continues through this period as a trio
of closed cyclonic circulations move across the lower 48.

The first system will remain to our west, with a negatively-tilted
trough extending from its center into the TN Valley region Thursday
night. A 40+ kt LLJ will efficiently transport Gulf moisture into
our area starting late Thursday afternoon, with strong lift provided
by favorable positioning of the left exit region of a jet streak.
Some weak instability during the time of strongest lift should
provide at least a slight chance of thunderstorms for the southern
and western half of the area. Drying aloft will bring an end to rain
chances Friday morning, and with some afternoon clearing and a
continuing SW low-to-mid level flow, temps will reach the mid to
upper 60s on Friday. 

A second closed low tracks NE across the Plains on Saturday, but
stays west of the MS River. However it will keep the Gulf open to
the TN Valley, with additional moisture spreading back into the area
and bringing a chance of showers Saturday. Temperatures will
continue to be well above normal, with highs in the 60s.

A third and more significant closed low tracks across the Red River
Valley to West TN on Sunday. The GFS points toward a warm conveyor
belt with tropical connections across the Southeast, along with a
coupled jet structure over the TN Valley. If this holds, we could
see some significant heavy rainfall and possibly thunderstorms. One
caveat might be if strong convection develops along the Gulf coast
and cuts off the northerly flow of warm/moist air, which is what the
ECMWF hints at happening. Falling temps aloft as the low moves
overhead will keep showers going into Monday. Given model
consistency and agreement with the general pattern, likely PoPs are
warranted for Saturday night through Monday. At this time,
temperatures stay warm enough for all liquid precip under the closed
low. Drying with an amplifying ridge aloft will build into the area
on Tuesday.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Seeing a couple of upper level features that will be important in
the short-term portion of the forecast. Current water vapor imagery
and RAP upper air analysis indicates s shortwave trough moving
northeast into the Great Lakes region with the second shortwave
trough moving to the southeast across the Northern Plains. At the
surface, a low pressure center is directly underneath the first
shortwave trough near Chicago with an associated cold front
stretching southward towards Memphis and further southwestward
towards Houston. Current radar imagery depicts widespread showers
across Middle and Western TN and northwards into Kentucky. The area
of showers has made little progress to the east but should begin to
see that closer to daybreak as the first trough pushes more to the
east. Timing of the precipitation will be the main forecast
challenge today. The atmosphere will be highly saturated with PW
values near maximum levels observed for mid-January ranging from 1.1-
1.4 inches. Looks like the first batch of precipitation should
move through mid-morning as the first trough pushes off to the
east. It looks as though there will be a brief break in the
precipitation late this morning into early this afternoon between
the two systems. Precipitation should move in again ahead of the
front later this afternoon and evening as the second trough passes
just to the north. Models indicate some weak instability with
MUCAPE values generally <250 J/Kg. Therefore, expect there could be
a few rumbles of thunder through midnight or so. The cold front
will be approaching the mountains late in the Short-Term forecast
with cooler air moving into the Plateau and Southwest VA. The cold
air advection behind the system is not overly impressive and lows
behind the front will only drop down into the low to mid 40s across
the Plateau and Southwest VA.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday through Monday)...

High pressure tries to build south behind a cold front later
Wednesday and Wednesday evening. Drier air behind the front will
lower temperatures briefly but not clear skies significantly before
increased moisture with surface low moving up from the lower
Mississippi Valley spreads more clouds and rain from the southwest
late Wednesday night and Thursday. Increased instability...strong
low level jet...upper level divergence in warm moist air mass later
Thursday and continuing Friday ahead of this slow moving system
will allow a few thunderstorms to develop. High temperatures both
days will be in the mild upper 50s to lower 60s Thursday and lower
to mid 60s Friday. The frontal system will move east of the region
later Friday. Rain will end Friday night and be mostly dry into the
first half of Saturday. Then yet another system will move into the
Mississippi Valleys Saturday and deepening Sunday spreading another
wave of showers north from the Gulf. Temperatures still mild with a
chance of thunderstorms again Sunday possibly lingering into Monday
as this system moves slowly east. Colder air finally poised to move
in behind this system Monday night cooling temperatures into the 30s
to lower 40s

VFR conditions currently across the terminals. Southerly winds
ahead of an approaching cold front should keep fog from forming
tonight. These winds will have a downsloping component and expect
VFR conditions will continue during the overnight hours with a
small chance for MVFR ceilings at KCHA near sunrise. Current radar
imagery indicates widespread showers and a few thunderstorms across
Western and Middle Tennessee. The main aviation challenge will be
the timing of the precip. For now, it appears that showers will
move in around daybreak and persist throughout much of the day.
Instability values will increase enough by 20-22z for a few
thunderstorms and have mentioned VCTS in the TAFs. Southerly winds
will increase after 15z with some gusts into the 20 kt range.

.DISCUSSION...The forecast is progressing moderately well this
evening, but may do a slight adjustment in pops. Satellite and
radar imagery are picking up on an area of weak isentropic ascent
advancing northeast across Middle Tennessee at mid evening. The pop
on the Northern Cumberland plateau northeast through Southwest
Virginia looks rather decent to capture this area into the early
morning hours on Tuesday. Will adjust pops back incrementally
across southern and eastern sections possibly not impacted by this
area of lift and in locations that may come under the influence of
an increasing downslope component in the Great Valley. The
temperature forecast not in too bad a shape but may add a degree or
two across Southeast Tennessee where warm advection is occurring in
advance of the Mid Mississippi Valley frontal system.

.AVIATION...The Plains low pressure system will shift steadily
northeast across the Great Lakes into Southeastern Canada. An area
of deeper moisture and lift will accompany the upper level system
and surface frontal boundary as it builds toward the Appalachian
region through the day Tuesday. Multiple cloud layers will be in
place over the Great Valley through the forecast period. Would
expect that as the upper system approaches, some cross terrain flow
would help to suppress some of the lower ceilings that would
naturally form absent the Southern Appalachians. Therefore, tried
to have lots of vfr flight weather with a strengthening southerly
component to the low level flow. The best chance of deteriorating
flight condition, other than possible light to possible mvfr fog
formation later tonight, would be later in the day Tuesday with the
frontal advance. Enough instability will be present for the
possibility of some thunder as the showers move east, so kept this
in the forecast for the later afternoon hours.

250 PM EST Mon Jan 16 2017

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight through Tuesday)... 
After a foggy start to the day, temperatures continue to warm. A
break in the cloud cover across NE Tennessee and SW Virginia has
allowed sunshine to aid temperatures in climbing into the upper
60s across that area. With thicker cloud cover south, it's possible
that TRI may be the warmest of the three climate sites today.
Clouds will fill back in and lower tonight as a cold front
approaches from the west. Patches of locally dense fog are
possible again late tonight into early Tuesday, but winds
increasing ahead of the cold front should help hinder widespread
fog development tonight.

By late morning, showers are possible across the northwestern
portion of the forecast area as the cold front nears. Model
solutions still vary a bit -- with some models indicating more
moisture and showers ahead of the front than others. For now, have
likely PoPs NW and chance PoPs SE for most of the daytime hours.
Then, likely PoPs everywhere Tuesday evening into the overnight
hours to coincide with the actual frontal passage. There does
appear to be enough weak instability by midday Tuesday to support a
few rumbles of thunder, mainly across western locations and have
carried/added in a slight chance of thunder to account for this
along and just before the frontal passage. PoPs will taper off from
NW to SE late Tuesday night as the front exits the area. A 40-50kt
850mb jet will accompany the frontal passage. This will result in
some gusty winds Tuesday afternoon, especially over higher terrain,
but winds look like they should remain below advisory criteria.


.LONG TERM...(Wednesday through Monday)...
A cold front will be exiting the area Wednesday morning, and high
pressure from the surface through the midlevels will be building in
from the west through the day. Forecast soundings on Wed show a
strong inversion trapping low level moisture in the Valley, so will
lean high temperatures on the cool side of MOS guidance. Deep
moisture builds back in rapidly on Thursday as the surface
high/ridging aloft shift to the east of the mountains. PoPs
increase through the day as a trough axis over TX becomes
negatively tilted and the southerly 850 mb jet increases to 40+
kts. Favorable upper jet positioning for divergence and 850 mb
theta-E values above 320K suggest a mention of t-storms is
warranted Thursday night, at least for southern sections. Model
agreement on timing of lift gives confidence to increase PoPs to
categorical on Thursday night, lowering to chance PoPs Friday.

An active and abnormally mild pattern continues through the weekend
as the models show a deep closed low developing in the lee of the
Rockies. The GFS and ECMWF are in surprisingly good agreement with
the timing and positioning of this closed low, taking it to the Mid-
MS Valley by 00Z Monday. Thus confidence is high enough to bring
likely PoPs into the area for Sunday and Sunday night. The closed
low slowly tracks NE across the Ohio Valley on Monday, so we will
remain under its influence with scattered showers beneath the low
through the day. The question for Monday will be whether
temperatures will be cold enough for snow or rain showers. Given the
recent warmth and the lack of a strong punch of cold air behind the
closed and slow-moving upper low, will keep precip all rain to start
Day 7.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

Another foggy start to the day. Patchy dense fog currently across
the area with the worst of the fog in and around the Knoxville Metro
area. Looking at cameras across the metro, it appears that the fog
is patchy dense and a SPS is out until 10 am. Will continue to
monitor conditions this morning to determine if a dense fog
advisory is needed or not. Current radar imagery is showing little
in the way of any precipitation as a shortwave ridge builds into
the area from the west. Surface temperatures and dewpoints are
generally in the 50s across the forecast area with a surface trough
analyzed across the mountains and the stalled boundary just to the
south.

The ridge axis will pass to the east late this morning into this
afternoon. Mid-level and upper level flow will become more
southwesterly pushing the front, currently to the south, quickly
northward. Models indicate a decrease in PW values this morning and
early afternoon with values dropping in the 0.5-0.7 inch range.
These values are still above normal for mid-January but below
values observed over the last few days. Therefore, expect most of
the day will be dry with only a small chance for an isolated
shower. An upper level trough will race across the Central Plains
into the Great Lakes late today into tonight. An associated cold
front will approach the Mississippi River late in the short-term
forecast period with rain chances increasing. High temperatures
will once again be around 20 degrees above normal with strong warm
air advection. Went on the higher side of guidance with highs
being above forecast values for the last few days. The forecast
calls for cloud cover most of the day, but if the sun does break
out for an hour or so temperatures could get close to record highs.
Overnight lows will be 20-25 degrees above normal with values
generally in the 50s. Winds will be a bit stronger tonight as the
front approaches and do not expect any dense fog again.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...

The main system of concern for the extended will be a cold front
moving in early in the period. Models continue to struggle with
timing of this feature with the GFS the fastest...bringing it in on
Tuesday into Tuesday night. The NAM is a bit slower with the main
band of showers expect to move through Tuesday night. Will go with
a bit of a compromise and spread likely pops from west to east
across the area on Tuesday. Weak instabilty may develop over the
region on Tuesday in advance of the front and could see a few
rumbles of thunder...mainly over the western locations. Will
mention a slight chance of thunderstorms for this. Also...a 40 to
50 KTs 850MB jet will accompany the front and should see breezy and
gusty winds Tuesday afternoon...especially over higher terrain. The
winds look like they should remain below advisory criteria. Will
see likely pops through Tuesday night with the frontal passage.
Scattered showers will linger into Wednesday. Model consistency
quite poor though the rest of the extended and confidence low.
Overall pattern shows two different areas of low pressure moving
through for an active end of the extended period. The first low
should move through around the Thursday/Friday time frame and the
second during the weekend. Expect there will be a dry period in the
time frame but timing of this unsure. Current model trend puts the
best chance of briefly being between systems on Saturday...so will
go with a mostly dry day with only low pops along higher
elevations. Throughout the extended...temperatures are expected to
remain above normal and all precip should be rain.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Monday)...Nearly stationary frontal
boundary that has been hanging around near our northern and western
border will retreat back north during the short term period as a the
upper ridge axis moves across the area.  While plenty of low level
moisture will linger, forcing looks limited at best so will keep
southern areas dry tonight with low PoPs further north, and slight
chance PoPs all areas Monday.  May see a bit more sun Monday
especially south and central, so plan to go above the already warm
MAV temps most locations. Will stay close to MAV min temps. Will
carry patchy fog all areas tonight.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...Moist southwest flow
ahead of an approaching cold front will produce the chance for
isolated showers Monday evening into Tuesday. By Tuesday afternoon,
enough instability will be in place ahead of the frontal boundary
for some scattered thunderstorms to develop, especially over western
portions of the forecast area. While there are still some model
differences with regards to exact timing and amount of moisture, it
looks like the cold front itself will move through Tuesday night. By
late Wednesday, we should be between systems. From here, model
solutions digress and confidence lowers. Another low pressure system
will approach the area late in the workweek. Models vary a bit with
timing for this system, but consensus is greatest for rain on Friday
and have upped PoPs for this timeframe accordingly. For the weekend,
the unsettled pattern continues. With the low confidence in the
detail, will generally keep low to chance pops, but will increase
PoP late sunday as another better organized system approaches. Above
normal temperatures will continue through the forecast period,
allowing all precipitation to fall as rain.

.AVIATION...

Flight conditions have been better than forecast during the
overnight hours and have continued this trend with the latest TAF
issuance. Light showers are currently in the vicinity of KTYS and
have added VCSH there through 16z. Expect MVFR to VFR conditions
will be possible through 15-16z as well with mostly VFR conditions
expected beyond this timeframe. The surface boundary will continue
to linger across the area throughout the TAF cycle and there will
be a small chances for precip. but have kept conditions dry in the
TAFs with the exception of the ongoing VCSH at KTYS. Winds will be
light and variable throughout the TAF cycle.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

The overall pattern remains somewhat stagnant with a stalled surface
boundary bisecting the area. PW values across the region are around
an inch, which is over the 90th percentile for mid-January. The lack
of any significant forcing has kept showers isolated to scattered at
best. The main difference since yesterday morning is the lack of
widespread dense fog. There are a couple of locations below 1 mile
but it does not appear that widespread dense fog will be as much of
an issue this morning. Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper air
analysis indicate that the shortwave trough that brought in more
widespread showers to the Southern Appalchians is now over the Mid-
Atlantic. An upper level ridge currently exists across the Gulf oF
Mexico with a closed low located acrosS Baja California. Closer to
home, upper level and mid-level flow is mostly zonal with a
shortwave ridge just to the west.

For today, expect to start off with patchy fog and clouds with mild
temperatures. A few light isolated showers/drizzle will be possible
with the anomalously high PW values. The lack of any forcing will keep
any precipitation amounts light. The surface boundary will linger
across the forecast area with warmer than average temperatures
continuing with highs in the upper 50s to upper 60s. Went on the
higher sides of guidance with temperatures being much warmer than
forecast over the last couple of days. The shortwave ridge will
move into the area late today into tonight with the mid-level and
upper level flow taking on more of southwesterly direction. This
will push the front further to the north and should lead to lower
rain chances across the area late this afternoon and into tonight.
Mild overnight lows will continue with readings in the upper 40s to
low 50s.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...

The boundary that has been stalled along the northern TN border
will lift north on Monday as weak ridging develops over the area.
With a moist...warm air mass in place...could see a few isolated
showers develop Monday afternoon and evening. The main concern for
the extended period continues to be a cold front expected to move
through around the Tuesday/Wednesday time frame. Models continue to
have difficulty in timing of this feature...but the trend is for a
frontal passage Tuesday night. Could see scattered showers develop
Tuesday ahead of the main band of showers. Then...the best chance
of showers will be Tuesday night for likely pops and then scattered
showers lingering into Wednesday. Models continue to diverge
Thursday through Saturday. The GFS takes the front out of the
region quickly and puts us between systems for Thursday...then
lifts an area of low pressure through around Friday and
Saturday...providing our next chance of showers. The ECMWF keeps
the front in the area on Thursday with a short wave riding through
for additional shower activity...then brings the area of low
pressure in slightly slower for the end of the extended. With the
low confidence in the detail will keep low to chance pops for an
unsettle weather pattern in place through the end of the period. As
for temperatures...expect above normal temperatures which will
allow precip to generally fall as rain.

account for this trend. Still could be a few sprinkles and drizzle
around so the medium chance possibility of light precip still in
the works for the overnight. Tight temperature gradient trying to
press into the forecast area behind the cold front across the
Great Valley. Advection of cooler air a bit weak though and the

across the Southern Appalachians this evening. Radar imagery shows
light to moderate showers moving into the northern extent of the
Great Valley and this trend should continue with the area of rain
gradually building southward through time to impact tys. In the
moist environment, flight weather should drop into the mvfr
category from tri to cha through the overnight hours. Some ifr and
even lifr is possible as the lower layers become saturated with the
passing wave. It may not be until around mid day before ceilings
and visibility improve to higher range mvfr or vfr.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Sunday)...Nearly stationary frontal
boundary will continue to waffle near our northern and western
border for the short term period.  Plenty of low level moisture will
linger, and some weak short wave energy brushing by to our north
will help to trigger some showers especially north tonight.  Will
carry PoPs as high as categorical/likely northeast half. Will also
carry areas of fog entire forecast area for tonight. Not much
forcing apparent for Sunday, so will just carry slight chance to
chance PoPs especially in the morning. Warmth will continue. Will
stay close to MAV min temps but adjust most MAV max temps up a bit.

.LONG TERM...(Sunday night through Saturday)...The quasi-
stationary frontal boundary finally begins to lift Sunday night
into Monday as a cold front approaches from the west. As the
boundary lifts out of the area...shower coverage will lessen.

The main weather system in the extended period continues to be a
cold front moving into the area Tuesday/Wednesday. Models are
finally beginning to align on the timing of this fropa, with showers
starting Tuesday afternoon and the bulk of the precip moving through
overnight.

From here, model solutions diverge. The GFS quickly progresses the
front off the coast on Wednesday with a slightly cooler and drier
upper level NW flow moving in for Wednesday night and Thursday. In
contrast, the ECMWF progresses the front slower and shows a
secondary upper level wave channeling Gulf moisture back into the TN
and swinging through the area on Thursday. For now, have split the
difference and gone with slight chance to chance PoPs.

Both models indicate a stronger wave moving in from the south for
Friday, but timing and strength vary. For now, have stuck with
chance PoPs for this system.

Under predominately S-SW flow, temperatures will remain warm
throughout the extended period, with highs in the 50s and 60s and
overnight lows in the 40s and 50s.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

A foggy start to the day with a lingering surface boundary
stretching across the forecast area. There are a few locations
reporting visibilities around a quarter of a mile and a dense fog
advisory has been issued for the Tennessee and North Carolina
counties in the forecast area.

Current water vapor and RAP upper air analysis indicates an upper
level ridge across the Northern Gulf of Mexico and the Southeastern
U.S. Upper level and mid-level flow is mostly zonal across the
forecast area and this is why the front has stalled. Light
showers/drizzle will continue to be possible during the early
morning hours with the ample supply of moisture along the boundary.
The lack of forcing will keep precip. isolated to scattered at best.
Not seeing much movement with the boundary throughout the short-term
forecast with westerly flow aloft. Models indicate a weak shortwave
trough embedded in the zonal flow will move through the area later
this afternoon into the evening hours that will lead to a bit better
coverage of showers for areas north of I-40. Regardless,
precipitation amounts should be light with amounts generally under
a tenth of an inch. The pattern remains stagnant moving into the
overnight period with the surface boundary lingering across the
area. Expect similar conditions with light showers/drizzle possible
with patchy fog. Highs today will be much above normal with values
up into the upper 50s to low 70s and overnight lows in the mid 40s
to low 50s.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...

Will continue to see a quasi-stationary frontal boundary stalled
around the north TN border on Sunday. This pattern will keep
southerly flow and seasonally warm temperatures in place and also
provide a chance for isolated to scattered showers across the
region. The best chances of shower activity will be over northern
locations near the boundary. Around the Sunday night/Monday time
frame...the boundary is expected to lift northward as a cold front
approaches for the west. As the boundary lift out of the area...the
coverage of showers will lessen. The main system of concern for the
extended continues to be a cold front progged into the area around
Tuesday or Wednesday. Models continue to struggle with the timing
of this feature...the GFS continues to be the faster of the models
with a Tuesday/Tuesday night frontal passage...while the ECMWF
brings it in Tuesday night to Wednesday. The NAM looks like it will
trend between these two. For now...will compromise and keep chance
to likely pops in place for Tuesday and Wednesday. Model confidence
quite low by the end of the period. The trend is to generally be
between systems Thursday and will keep pops low for now...then
models do show a wave moving in from the south for another chance
of showers for Friday.

weather across most of the Southeastern U.S. The dividing line
between a much cooler airmass and a very pleasant mild early
Spring-like airmass is in position along the Cumberland Plateau
northeast into the Central Appalachians. To the immediate northern

remain while south of the boundary, including cha, tys and tri;
better flight weather is in place. Would expect several more hours
of vfr flight weather at cha and tys; although an mvfr ceiling is
certainly possible early with the frontal boundary lurking just to
the northwest. Tri may have to deal with worse conditions, starting
out with mvfr category and deteriorating to ifr later tonight into
Saturday morning. Allowed for some saturation of lower layers at
cha and tys along with some fog; mainly in an mvfr condition. The
frontal boundary may push a little farther north by mid day
Saturday allowing for an improvement to vfr conditions at cha and
tys while tri may remain mvfr through the afternoon hours. The
models try to generate a couple sprinkles across the Great Valley
during the forecast period. Probability is a little too low to

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Saturday)...Nearly stationary frontal
boundary will continue to waffle near our northern and western
border for the short term period.  Plenty of low level moisture will
linger, but models have been overly aggressive with precipitation
thus far. Still looks like best chances for rain will be near the
boundary, so will keep highest PoPs north.  However, will mostly
undercut MAV PoPs, some by quite a bit, given weak forcing.  Will
also go on the high side of most MAV temps for the short term
period, with the springlike warmth continuing.

.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)...A frontal boundary will
remain north of the MRX CWA through at least Sunday.  This will
continue the southerly flow and seasonally warm temperatures through
the weekend and also provide a chance for isolated to scattered
showers across the region...with best chances over northern
locations.  The boundary lifts a bit northward Sunday
night/Monday, resulting in lower PoPs across our forecast area.

The main weather system in the extended period will be a strong cold
front moving in around the Tuesday/Wednesday time frame. Confidence
low on timing and potential for weak instability over the region.
The GFS is much faster with the progression of this front, bringing
it through Tuesday evening and clearing it well east of the area by
Wednesday afternoon. In contrast, both the ECMWF (and, for what it's
worth, the Canadian) bring the front through midday Wednesday.  For
now...will continue with chance to likely pops spreading across the
area for Tuesday through Thursday, then tapering off through the end
of the extended.

Under predominately S-SW flow, temperatures will remain warm
throughout the extended period, with highs in the 50s and 60s and
overnight lows in the 40s and 50s.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...

The cold front currently stretches across the forecast area.
Widespread light post-frontal precipitation can currently be seen on
radar imagery and is slowly sagging southward but has been mostly
staying to the north. For this morning, have likely PoPs across the
Northern Plateau. Regardless, rainfall amounts will be light and
under a tenth of an inch. Current water vapor imagery and RAP upper
air analysis indicates an upper level trough to the north of the
Great Lakes with a ridge across Florida and the Gulf of Mexico.
Closer to home. mid level and upper flow is mostly zonal. Therefore,
expect the front will continue to slow and eventually stall across
the forecast area today. The lift along the boundary is weak and
only expect scattered showers throughout the day with light rainfall
amounts. Cold advection behind the boundary will remain to the north
and expect above normal temperatures today with highs ranging from
the low 50s across SW VA and the Northern Plateau to upper 60s in
the Southern Valley. The front lifts a bit to the north during the
overnight hours but will still bisect the forecast area. PoPs remain
in the slight chance to chance category during the overnight hours
with the best lift and support for precip to the north. Again, any
rainfall that does fall during the short-term period will be light
with amounts of around a tenth of an inch being on the high side.
Mild overnight lows are forecast with lows in the mid 40s across the
Northern Plateau and SW VA to mid 50s across the SoutherN Plateau.

.LONG TERM (Saturday through Thursday)...

A frontal boundary will remain north of the MRX CWA through at
least Sunday. This will continue the southerly flow and seasonally
warm temperatures through the weekend and also provide a chance for
isolated to scattered showers across the region...with best chances
over northern locations. The boundary lifts a bit northward Sunday
night/Monday for more isolated shower activity. The main system of
the extended will be a strong cold front moving in around the
Tuesday/Wednesday time frame. Confidence low on timing and
potential for weak instability over the region. For now...will
continue with chance to likely pops spreading across the area for
Tuesday through the end of the extended.

.AVIATION...

A slow moving cold front currently stretches across East Tennessee
with post-frontal showers in Kentucky. Models are aggressive with
IFR ceilings and visibilities overnight but current observations
sites remain VFR. Went more optimistic than the guidance with MVFR
conditions moving in around 10z and continuing throughout the TAF
cycle. Rainfall has been light and observation sites are reporting
MVFR to VFR conditions with the precip. The front will stall across
the area tonight into tomorrow but weak forcing will keep precip
scattered and have only mentioned VCSH for now.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Friday)...The cold front in the Ohio
valley will sag into our area tonight/early Friday and stall.  While
forcing will be on the weak side, with plenty of low level moisture
over our area expect some patches of light rain to move in and
linger into Friday.  Will carry likely PoPs northwest areas tonight
with chance PoPs elsewhere, then high chance PoPs most areas on
Friday. It will remain rather warm for this time of year as there
will not be much of a push of colder air this far south. MAV temps
generally look reasonable so will stay close.

.LONG TERM...(Friday night through Thursday)...Ridging will dominate
the forecast pattern through the weekend, with an area of high
pressure centered over Florida and mild SW flow across our area. A
surface front will remain stalled out north of Tennessee, which will
introduce a chance of showers to the forecast area through at least
Sunday.  Will keep chance PoPs north to slight PoPs south through
the weekend. With the mild SW flow, highs will be in the upper 50s
and 60s through the weekend. The frontal boundary lifts further
north for Monday and early Tuesday with SW flow continuing, so have
gone with highs in the 60s and just a slight chance PoP.

The next weather system to impact our area moves into the Midwest on
Monday and slowly marches east, arriving in eastern Tennessee
Tuesday night into Wednesday. This system will drag a strong cold
front through our area Wednesday/Thursday. For now, have left out
the mention of thunder, but this frontal passage could potentially
bring some thunderstorms to the forecast area.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A beautiful sub-tropical ridge
remains active over the Gulf of Mexico and Western Atlantic early
this morning and will even expand north into the Southeastern
United States through the short term period. The area of high
pressure will keep the air mass boundary separating typically cold
winter conditions north of the forecast area today. However, the
boundary will be close enough to allow for the slight chance of a
shower across the northwestern edge of the forecast area. An upper
trough over South Central Canada will shift east toward New England
through the next twenty four hours and this frontal boundary may
edge a little farther southeast into the Southern Appalachian
region generating a few showers later tonight. As advertised,
temperatures will be very pleasant warming into the mid 60s across
most of the area; a good 15 to 20 degrees above normal. Maintained
the wind advisory for the highest terrain along the North Carolina
border through mid morning today.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Wednesday)...A strong ridge will be
over northern FL through the weekend, which will provide a mild low
level SW flow across the TN Valley. It will also keep the focus of
precip to our north, near the Ohio Valley, where dynamic forcing
near the upper jet will enhance lift. Models show the surface front
drooping into our area briefly on Friday before lifting back to the
north on Saturday. But pops will be kept in the chance range due to
the lack of mid/upper level support and stable sounding profiles.
As is it tendency, the GFS seems a bit overdone on the extent of
light QPF, so the drier NAM QPF depiction is favored. This general
pattern of chance pops north to slight/no pops south persists
through Sunday. Highs will be well into the 60s for the central and
southern Valley over the weekend.

The ridge amplifies across the region on Monday as a closed low
moves into the Plains, then moves east off the GA/FL coast. This
will start to transport deep Gulf moisture into the area. As we will
be solidly in the warm sector, highs in the 60s area wide will
continue into Tuesday. A deeper trough develops over the Plains on
Wednesday, with a 50 kt LLJ and good divergence from the upper jet
moving in during the afternoon. This could be a setup for some
strong thunderstorms if the current model depictions play out. Will
have likely pops on Wednesday but refrain from mentioning thunder
this far out in the forecast.

exception of cha early in the forecast period, it appears that
there may not be enough low level saturation for the formation of

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Thursday)...Showers have lifting north of
the area leaving us in a warm moist air mass.  Little forcing for
the short term, so plan to go precip free for tonight and just
slight chance north and west areas closer to the frontal boundary
for Thursday.  Low level jet will be fairly strong through tonight,
but at this point looks borderline for a wind advisory over the
higher elevations so no wind advisory for now.  May be able to see
some sunshine Thursday leading to very springlike temperatures. Will
make some adjustments up to MAV temps both periods.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday night through Wednesday)...
Ridge off the Atlantic coast will continue to keep more significant
rainfall north of the eastern Tennessee Valley through the weekend
and beyond. Deep SW flow aloft will also keep temperatures mild
through the extended forecast. Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees
above normal. A cold front over the Ohio Valley is expected to sag
south into the northern sections of the forecast area thursday night
and friday and then become stationary across the region Friday night
through part of Sunday. Best forcing will be Thursday night and
Friday but with only light rain amounts. Friday night through early
Sunday not as confident in rainfall amounts and chances. Will keep
slight chance to low chance pops and a few hundredths of rainfall
during that time. As surface low moves from the southern Rockies
into the Plains states Sunday into Monday the front will shift north
so area is mostly dry. This system will then move into the
Mississippi Valley Tuesday increasing shower activity by late
Tuesday into Wednesday. The airmass may become unstable enough for a
few thunderstorms Wednesday afternoon ahead of the front. Rainfall
amounts through the weekend and early next week will be light.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...A moist southwest flow will
continue through the period with scattered showers occurring across
the area. However, isentropic lift will shift slowly north through
the day leaving much of Southeast Tennessee and Southwest North
Carolina dry by early afternoon. The drying trend should progress
gradually north across Southwest Virginia by early evening as
upper heights build across the southeastern states. It should be
another great day in the temperature department with highs at least
ten degrees above normal in the 50s over much of the region and
lows a toasty twenty degrees above typical mid January minimums.

.LONG TERM (Thursday through Tuesday)...A large ridge off the
Atlantic coast will be the dominant feature across the region
through the weekend. With a deep SW flow, temperatures will be
above normal through the period, and the majority of precip will
stay north of our area.

On Thursday a cold front will push into the Ohio Valley, but become
oriented parallel to the midlevel flow and stall across northern
Middle TN, southeastern KY, and southern WV.  Forcing associated
with the jet and isentropic lift over the front will result in most
precip north of the front, but high chance pops will be continued
for northern sections through Friday due to uncertainty in the
position of the front - ECMWF has it farther south than the NAM and
GFS. The forecast will lean in the direction of the drier NAM and
GFS solutions. 

The Atlantic ridge retrogrades into the Southeast states, which
should push the front farther northward and decrease rain chances.
Warm temperatures with highs in the 60s will continue over the
weekend. A closed low moves from the Rockies into the Plains on
Monday, and the ridge over the Southeast moves back offshore. The
strengthening southerly flow will begin to transport deep Gulf
moisture to the area on Tuesday, bringing a return of high chance
pops. The best forcing with this system will likely reach our area
on Wednesday.

.DISCUSSION...

Temperatures across the region have warmed significantly over the
last day or two thanks to strong warm air and moisture advection.
At the surface, a cold front stretches from the Great Lakes
southwestward into the Southern Plains. The 00z KOHX sounding
indicates PW values of 0.93 inches and expect values will rise to
near an inch across the forecast area. Current radar imagery,
indicates a few scattered thunderstorms along a line ahead of the
front across Kentucky. These isolated storms appear to be in the
area of highest shear. Based on the current trends, added a slight
chance for a rumble of thunder or two across the Northern Plateau
before midnight. In addition, adjusted low temperatures upward with
low level warm air and moisture advection keeping overnight
temperatures in the 40s to low 50s.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Wednesday)...Strong 850MB jet is moving
over the area late this afternoon and evening in advance of an
approaching frontal boundary. This jet is creating locally breezy and
gusty conditions across the Southern Appalachian Region. A wind
advisory remains in effect through 09Z for the northern Cumberland
Plateau and the GSMNP where higher terrain is experiencing winds to
advisory levels. These strong southern winds are also bringing in
warmer air and will see mild temperatures tonight and seasonally
warm highs in the 50s and low 60s across the valley on Wednesday.
The frontal boundary will push into the area tonight and spread a
band of showers across the MRX CWA for likely to categorical pops.
With the warm air continuing to moving in...this should be mainly a
rain event. By the morning...the boundary will be stretched
east/west across the area...then lift north over the area during the
day for continued likely pops in the morning with improving conditions
during the afternoon.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday night through Tuesday)...A zonal flow pattern
for Thursday with mostly dry and unseasonably mild conditions.  For
Thursday night through Sunday...a frontal boundary will become quasi-
stationary across southern Kentucky into east Tennessee. A fairly
tight temperature gradient will be across east Tennessee/
southwest Virginia with upper 40s north to the middle 60s south.

Showers can be expected along and north of this boundary keeping the
highest chances of rain across southwest Virginia/northern half of
Tennessee.

GFS/ECMWF show a short-wave trough exiting out of the southwest
United States for Sunday night through Tuesday. The ECMWF is deeper
and stronger with this wave actually producing a closed upper low
across the mid-section of the nation while the GFS is an open wave.
Obviously confidence is low on how this system evolves early next
week. Will continue with unseasonably warm temperatures a chance of
showers for now.

approaching low pressure system...an 850MB jet of 50 to 60 KTs will

become breezy...gusty across the area.  A wind advisory has been
issued for the GSMNP. Winds across the northern Cumberland Plateau
have increase and are approaching advisory criteria...so will
update the advisory to include this area as well. The advisory will
be in effect from 18Z Tuesday to 09Z Wednesday. Otherwise...could
see a few isolated showers move into far western locations late in
the day as the low pressure system advances towards the

with showers spreading across the area this evening and overnight.
Current forecast looks good and will update current forecast package

.AVIATION...An upper level trough will move from the Western Plains
northeast across the Northeastern quarter of the nation through the
forecast period. Strengthening southwesterly flow will pull a
overcast to broken layer around 4-5k feet across the Great Valley
today. The layer will start out overcast but should develop some
breaks through the middle part of the day; especially at tri where
some downsloping could eradicate the lower layer for several hours
into the early evening. Deepening moisture and increasing lift
should lead to the development of showers from southwest through
northeast through the night. Would expect flight conditions to
become mvfr and possibly ifr as the night progresses due to
lowering ceilings and decreased visibility in showers; primarily
at cha and tys. In addition, surface wind may take a while to
strengthen today at the terminals and with a very fast southwest
flow aloft, wind shear could be an issue so included this concept
through much of the day at cha and tys.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Thursday night)...
A strong low pressure system will be tracking across the northern
Plains and Great Lakes today. A strengthening southerly flow over
the area will transport warm, moist air into the TN Valley through
tonight. Today, a 50-60 kt jet at 850 mb could bring some strong
winds to the mountains, and the current Wind Advisory for the
Smokies looks on track. The Plateau will be close to advisory
criteria...closest to the jet core across Middle TN/cntrl KY...but
most spots outside the highest peaks should stay below it. Downslope
winds could produce some locally warmer temps today in the lee of
the mountains.

Isentropic lift ahead of the cold front may start to bring light
precip to the Plateau late in the afternoon, and a mid/upper level
shortwave trough passage and upper divergence will increase rain
chances area-wide after 00Z tonight. The front stalls just north of
our area, and a second shortwave trough will bring additional
showers on Wednesday morning. Thunderstorms cannot be completely
ruled out with this second shortwave passage, but instability
looks too weak to add a mention of it at this time. As a second low
pressure system tracks across the Great Lakes, a SW flow of 40-50
kts at 850 mb will continue to provide warm conditions, but we
should stay dry on Thursday as all lift and deep moisture will be
to our north. Highs will be well above normal, in the mid to upper
60s. Precip chances rise again late Thursday night for northern
sections as a cold front moves into KY.

.LONG TERM (Friday through Monday)...
 The long term period continues to look rather decent with no
airmass cold enough to allow for the mention of snow. It should be
a little unsettled with the Eastern U.S. upper trough strengthening
early in the period across the Northeastern states. This would push
a cool frontal boundary into the northern part of the forecast area
increasing the chance for showers a bit on Friday with slowly
decreasing probability into the daytime period Saturday. However,
upper ridging over the Southeastern states and the advance of a
healthy upper trough through the mountain west into the plains
should push the cool front back north of the Southern Appalachians
with just a small chance for a shower Saturday night into Monday.
The western trough and associated cold front will be pressing
toward the forecast area later Monday night into Tuesday with an
increasing chance for rain showers. Temperatures should be very
pleasant late this week into early next week running a good fifteen
degrees above normal for highs with lows around fifteen to twenty
degrees above normal.

.DISCUSSION...
Minor changes made to the forecast with this update. We should see
below freezing temperatures for the last time tonight as
temperatures continue to moderate under southerly flow. A strong
850mb jet will push through the region on Tuesday, ahead of a
frontal system for Tuesday night. This would support decent wind
gusts across the forecast area. However, the big question is
whether or not the winds will mix down to the surface. Therefore,
higher elevations will be more likely to see stronger winds, and a
wind advisory is in place for the highest elevations of GSMNP
Tuesday afternoon through Tuesday night. The surface frontal system
moves in late Tuesday, bringing the next chance for rain.

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tuesday)...Southerly winds rotating around
an exiting surface high pressures continues to pull in warmer air.
This has allowed the air mass to moderate significantly.  Lows
tonight should be only slight below normal with readings generally
in the 20s across most valley locations.  On Tuesday...the next
weather system will be advancing towards the region.  Ahead of this
system...a strong 850MB jet will push in.  This will allow for some
breezy and gusty conditions Tuesday afternoon across the Tennessee
Valley.  Higher elevations will see stronger winds.  The highest
elevations...generally portions of the GSMNP...can expect sustained
winds of 20 to 30 MPH with gusts of 40 to 45 MPH.  Therefore...will
issue a wind advisory for this area beginning Tuesday afternoon and
continuing into Tuesday night.  As for temperatures...the warming
trend continues and should see highs reach into the 40s to around 50
across most valley locations.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Monday)...Increasing
southwesterly winds into the Tennessee valley/southern Appalachians
Tuesday into Tuesday night along with fronto-genetic forcing along
a warm frontal boundary will produce likely showers Tuesday night
and Wednesday.

The warm frontal boundary will lift north Wednesday night. Upper
level flow will be west southwesterly and boundary layer southerly
for Thursday producing unseasonably warm temperatures. A weak
frontal boundary will move into the area for Friday and Friday night
producing a chance of showers, especially across the northern half
of the Tennessee/southwest Virginia. This boundary lifts north for
Saturday. For Sunday and Monday, medium range mondels are in dis-
agreement in how fast southwest United States system will move into
the Tennessee valley. GFS the slowest and ECMWF is faster. Will
follow the slower solution but confidence is low.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Extrapolation of the back edge of the overcast midlevel clouds
brings clearing from west to east between 13Z and 18Z. Throw in
some snow cover and the temperature forecast will be tricky today.
Went on the warm side of MOS guidance for the south, and the cool
side north. A mid/upper level ridge will be building over the
region today and tonight, while a southerly flow at the surface
will be strengthening as low pressure develops over the Plains.
High clouds will start to increase again tonight ahead of this
system.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...
Main story for the long term portion of the forecast will be a
frontal boundary that makes its way towards the area but then
stalls out and hangs around through the rest of the 7-day forecast.
Weak front will likely move in northwest of the area and will start
to be a focus for precipitation with the best chances in our
forecast area being across the Cumberland Plateau. Depending on how
far southeast this boundary is able to push will dictate where the
best rainfall chances will be. Models then show by the middle of
the week that the boundary gets a push back north and takes better
precipitation chances with it. By the end of the work week stronger
forcing behind the front will cause better lift along the boundary
and eventually move it more into our area as we move into the
weekend. Eventually a low moving out of Texas will overtake the
boundary and finally force it out of our area and bring with it
good chances for more rain.

During this entire time temperatures will continue to warm as we sit
south of the boundary. By Thursday we will be seeing temperatures in
the 60's which is about 10-15 degrees above normal for this time of
year. Once the warmer temperatures hit they will stick around
through at least the weekend. In addition to the warmer temperatures
there will be several impulses that move across the boundary which
could cause an increase in wind speeds, particularly in the higher
elevations.

.SHORT TERM...(Tonight and Tomorrow)...Another cold night in store but
not quite as cold as last night. Lows will still run 15 to 20
degrees below normal. A broken to overcast layer of high/mid level
clouds will move in overnight associated with an upper level jet and
weak impulse passing through. There looks to be a few hours where
temperatures/winds get close to wind chill advisory criteria across
the higher peaks of the eastern mountains. Since this is only across
the higher peaks and values are borderline, will opt out of issuing
an advisory at this time. 

A much more pleasant day in store for tomorrow. Clouds will begin to
clear by late morning, heights slowly begin to rise, and weak
southerly flow returns to the lower levels. Because of this, temps
will climb into the mid and upper 30s north of I-40 and upper 30s to
lower 40s south of I-40.

.LONG TERM...(Monday night through Sunday)...With warmer air
continuing to push into the area...lows Monday night will be near
seasonal norms. The warming trend will continue through the work
week with temperatures becoming quite mild. We transition into a
more active weather pattern on Tuesday as a frontal boundary
approaches from the west. Could see a few isolated showers develop
ahead of this boundary and move into the area late in the
afternoon. By this time...the temperatures should be warm enough
for mainly rain at all but the highest elevations. The main band of
showers will push in Tuesday night and Wednesday for likely to
categorical pops. The continued southerly flow and warmer air
moving in will allow this to be mainly a rain event. Models
continue to show differences in the details through the rest of the
extended and confidence remains low. However...the overall weather
patten remains unsettled with the boundary expected to stay over
the region through Thursday for continue isolated to scattered
showers. High temperatures at this point will be in the 50s and 60s
for all rain. The trend is for the boundary to lift north of the
area around the end of the week. May see a brief break in precip
but details and exact timing on this timing is in flux and have
kept chance pops in place for the end of the work week.
Then...another front should be approaching the area late in the
period for the next chance of showers.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Cloudy skies and light flurries will persist into the early morning
across SW VA and parts of NE TN as a 500 mb channeled vort max
crosses the area. Clearing should ensue behind it around 15Z. Wind
chills overnight have been below -5 in a few spots, and the
Advisory will be continued. However, winds have barely above the 10
mph requirement, and well below wind advisory criteria. The wind
advisory will be dropped. Patches of black ice will continue to
make for tricky road conditions, and the SPS for this will be
continued. Highs today will remain below freezing area wide, but
full sun in the afternoon should provide melting of remaining icy
spots on roads. High clouds will increase tonight as the upper jet
streak dives into the Southeast states ahead of a building ridge. 

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...
Finally we will get above freezing in most locations for the first
time since late last week. Warming trend will begin the first of
the week as the warmer air to our south is transported into our
area. Low level jet will move over the area ahead of an approaching
front and could bring strong winds to the higher elevations in our
region. We will keep an eye on this as parts of the higher
elevations of the Southern Appalachian Mountains could briefly hit
wind advisory criteria on Tuesday. Boundary will try and push
through the area and we could see some precipitation along the
boundary. Models have come in a bit slower with the arrival of the
boundary which should hopefully help keep snow away and any precip
in the form of pure rain except maybe in the highest elevations.
Rain chances continue into the middle of the week before the
boundary moves out of our area.

Late in the work week my confidence starts to decrease as models are
still in disagreement with what to do with our next system. Both the
GFS and ECMWF show a frontal boundary getting stalled somewhere in
the vicinity, but the ECMWF stalls it out over our area with
precipitation smeared out. While the GFS keeps a tighter
precipitation gradient and stalls the boundary out over Western
Tennessee/Kentucky. Wherever this boundary stalls will see good
precipitation. ECMWF then kicks the associated low pressure out
through the Great Lakes region and moves precipitation out by early
next week. On the other hand the GFS shows a more broad trough that
slowly moves through the Central part of the U.S. and keeps
precipitation chances going for longer. Once again I will keep
precipitation chances going through much of the end of the
week/weekend to account for the discrepancies in the long term
models.

.DISCUSSION...
Adjusted tonight's low temperatures down a few degrees over the
northeastern portions of the CWA to account for current
temperatures trends and the latest short term guidance.
Otherwise...only minor tweaks were made with this update. The two
biggest concerns tonight are dangerously cold wind chills across
the mountains and hazardous driving conditions due to black ice
anywhere there is snowmelt and slush remaining from the snowfall
earlier today. With northwest winds picking up tonight, a wind
advisory is in effect for the eastern mountains through early
Sunday afternoon. Elevations above 3 to 4 thousand feet will see
sustained winds of 25 to 30 mph.

.AVIATION...
Generally VFR flight conditions expected throughout the forecast
period with high pressure building in from the west. A brief period
of MVFR cigs is possible at TRI late tonight/early Sunday morning
as a very weak upper level wave pushes through NE TN and increases
cloud cover. Light winds are expected throughout the night and

.SHORT TERM (Tonight and Tomorrow)...A bitterly cold night ahead
as surface higher pressure begins to build in and skies continue to
clear. This will be the coldest night we've had in quite some time.
Most areas will see lows in the single digits, which is around 20
degrees below normal. Wind chill advisory continues across the
eastern mountains until 16z Sunday. A wind chill advisory will begin
at 00z tonight for Cherokee and Clay NC, as well as Washington and
Russell County VA and go through 16z Sunday. The NAM show NW winds
really picking up tonight at 850mb, with winds from 40 to 50 kts.
Because of this, a wind advisory will go into effect for our eastern
mountains starting at 00z tonight and go through 21z on Sunday.
Elevations above 3K to 4K feet will see sustained winds from 26 to
30 mph.

Some area roadways will likely become hazardous overnight due to
black ice forming. Will issue a special weather statement to
highlight this concern.

Surface high pressure continues to build over the area tomorrow.
High pressure and clear skies will allow temps to warm up into the
mid to upper 20s for most areas.

.LONG TERM(Sunday Night through Saturday)...Cold air remains in
place Sunday night for one more very cold night...lows will be in
the teens and single digits.  A warming trend develops over the
region on Monday with temperatures finally reach above freezing for
all but the highest elevations.  The next system moves in around
Tuesday/Tuesday night.  If any precip reaches into the area Tuesday
morning...expect a mix of rain and snow.  However...the main band of
showers should push in late Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday night...
and temperatures at this point should be warm enough for all rain.
Additionally...a strong 850MB jet will accompany the system and
winds...especially over higher terrain...will become breezy and
gusty. The main frontal boundary moves in on Wednesday for
continued shower activity. Models diverge through the rest of the
extended and confidence low. However...overall should remain in a
rather unsettle weather pattern as a frontal boundary remains
across the region through around Thursday...followed by a cold
front moving in around Friday night into Saturday.

.SHORT TERM (Today and tonight)...
Snow is winding down across the area, and only our northeastern
counties will see additional accumulation in the next few hours.
However, TDOT reports that roads across much of the TN Valley remain
slick and snow-covered, and with temperatures in the teens and 20s
through the day, conditions may not improve much until the clouds
break late in the late morning/early afternoon once the mid/upper
trough axis moves through. 

The WSW will be updated to scale back the warning to an advisory in
areas that will not get more accumulation but still have hazardous
travel conditions - this includes SW VA, most of the TN Valley, the
Smokies, and SW NC. The advisory for the Plateau counties will be
canceled. The Warning will be maintained for the NE TN mountains
where an additional half to one inch accumulation will be possible
through 15Z. 

The main issue through tonight will be the bitterly cold
temperatures and wind chills. Much of the area will have single-
digit low temps tonight. In addition, winds in the mountains will be
near 10 mph, bringing wind chills down to the -8 to -12 range. Will
extend the current Wind Chill Advisory for the mountains through
Sunday morning. The remainder of the Advisory will remain the same.

.LONG TERM (Sunday through Friday)...
Over the weekend we will see very cold temperatures continue
behind our main winter system. Drier air from the north will keep
temps down and clearing skies in the overnight hours will allow for
good radiational cooling bringing overnight lows into the single
digits in some places on Sunday night/Monday morning. Winds will
finally swing around to the southwest on Monday and we will begin a
warming trend through the rest of the week. Many places will
finally get above freezing on Monday for the first time since
before the snow fell.

A frontal boundary will move through on Tuesday and if it gets here
a bit ahead of schedule we could see some brief light snow before we
switch over to all liquid. But the current models and the forecast
depict the precipitation starting late enough that it will be all
rain. After that forecast confidence decreases since the long term
models diverge in how to handle our next round of precipitation.
Models hint at a stalled boundary somewhere north/west of us, but
can't agree on what would happen south of that boundary, or if/when
it gets a nice shove and pushes on through our area. Will go ahead
and paint broad strokes of precipitation chances across several days
towards the end of the week and into the weekend, but these will
definitely be tightened up as the event draws closer. In addition
current temperature forecast shows that any precipitation that does
occur at the end of the week would remain all liquid.

.AVIATION...
Snow has ended at CHA, and VFR conditions will likely prevail
through the rest of the TAF period there, although a few moments of
MVFR cigs could be possible. Generally IFR conditions can be
expected at TYS and TRI as snow continues for the next several
hours, with snow tapering off and vis/cigs rising to MVFR between
10-13Z. Clouds are expected to clear out quickly thereafter, with
VFR conditions through most of the late morning and the afternoon.
Winds today will be from the north at 10-15 kts at all sites. A few
gusts near 20 may be possible but should be infrequent.

.DISCUSSION...
Tweaked temperatures and dewpoints a bit to account for current
trends. Also adjusted snowfall onset times a bit based on current
radar, observations, and short term model progs. Seeing increased
forcing and continued good moisture flow over southeastern TN and
southwestern NC and increased snowfall forecasts accordingly. Could
easily see 1"/hour rates in this area through early Saturday, with
upslope-enhanced snowfall rates potentially reaching 2"/hour in
the higher elevations of the Smokys. Expanded Winter Storm Warning
another tier of counties west to include Meigs and Hamilton
counties -- there will be a sharp snowfall gradient somewhere in
this general vicinity, but the impacts of even 2 inches of snow
with subfreezing temperatures continuing throughout the day
Saturday will be significant. Also expanded the wind chill advisory
another tier of counties east across the remainder of the
Cumberland Plateau for Saturday.

Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Morristown TN
339 PM EST Fri Jan 6 2017

.SHORT TERM /THIS EVENING THROUGH SATURDAY/...
A very complex forecast this afternoon as a significant winter
storm continues to approach the region from the southwest. There is
still a great deal of uncertainty with the exact track of this
system, which will have a big impact on total snowfall. What is
certain is that most areas will likely see an inch or two of snow
at minimum, with areas along and west of the I-75 corridor
potentially seeing a few to perhaps several inches more. The
development of the wintry precipitation tonight is tied to a fast
moving longwave trough over the Southern Plains that will quickly
shift into the MS/TN Valleys overnight. This will bring a broad
area of snow, with some bands producing locally heavier snow
squalls along the mountains.

The area most likely to experience these conditions will be the
East Tennessee and Southwest North Carolina Mountains and their
surrounding foothills, where between 3 to 8 inches of snow will be
common by Saturday morning. In the Valley the forecast is much
tricker. Models are still showing a plume of moisture moving in
late this evening through the overnight hours. Highest confidence
is counties along and east of the I-75 and I-81 corridors where a
Winter Storm Warning is in place. There, amounts in the 3 to 5 or 3
to 6 inch range are possible overnight. However, there will be a
very sharp gradient as you head west as drier air moves on the back
side. Locations along the Plateau may only see an inch, but it may
quickly increase as you head east of I-75. A Winter Weather
Advisory is in effect for all other locations. 

Regardless of how much snow accumulates, the subfreezing
temperatures in place will allow any snow that falls to stick,
creating very hazardous travel conditions on untreated and
secondary roads. Travel is discouraged if it can be avoided
overnight.

Drier air will quickly move in from the west by sunrise as winds
increase. This will dip wind chills along the mountains of East TN,
SW VA and the Plateau to dangerously cold levels (in the -5 to -10
degree range). Thus, a Wind Chill Advisory has been issued for
those areas from 09-18z on Saturday. Bitter cold highs are expected
under northerly flow with subfreezing air in place, only peaking in
the teens and 20s. Needlessly to say, secondary roads will remain
hazardous through most of the day tomorrow. 

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...
At the beginning of this period the Winter Storm will be away to the
east as the upper trough, and very cold air will be pumping into the
region.  By this time the snowfall will be done, but the cold temps
will remain through the rest of the weekend, with widespread single-
digit low temps Sunday and Monday mornings.  Finally on Monday, the
entire area should rise above freezing, and temperatures should turn
warmer for the remainder of the week.  

The forecast is slightly touch-and-go with respect to precip type on
Tuesday.  Temperatures Tuesday morning are forecast to go below
freezing, and precip will be moving in during the day, but it looks
like the precip will probably start after temperatures warm above
freezing. So, right now not expecting any hazards in the forecast
next week. Even the return flow next week is not expected to induce
enough instability for thunderstorms ahead of a weak front around
Wednesday.

Weaker parts of winter storm now affecting area, but still some low
ceilings and visibilities at times. Another round of weak precip is
moving into the KCHA area now. However, this afternoon should show
slow weakening to the precip overall, except near KTRI where some
new precip might develop late this afternoon. Tonight the core of
this storm system will be trudging through the Southeastern States,
with our area being on the western edge. KCHA has the best chance
tonight of missing more of the effects of this storm--only lowering
VSBY to 3SM there, whereas KTRI will likely get swallowed up by the
storm late tonight--have VSBY going down to 1SM there.

A new band of snow has developed further to the south and west over
Northern Alabama and Southern Middle Tennessee. This will push
into the Southern Plateau and Valley over the course of the late
morning and mid afternoon hours. As such, we have updated the
Winter Weather Advisory to begin NOW for these areas! Light
snowfall accumulations are expected, between 1/2 an inch to 1 inch.
However, the subfreezing temperatures will create slick roads. Use
extreme caution if you must travel!

Area Forecast Discussion...UPDATED
National Weather Service Morristown TN
936 AM EST Fri Jan 6 2017

.DISCUSSION...
Updated forecast to include a Winter Weather Advisory for the
entire area generally along and north of the Interstate 40 corridor
due to a very light, but troublesome band of snow that is moving
north and east over the northern Plateau, and eventually portions
of the Central and Northern Valley. The HRRR in particular has had
a good handle on this band and shows it gradually weakening over
time as it moves into the TRI metro by early-mid afternoon.
However, a quick half inch to inch of snow is expected over this
area, which combined with the subfreezing temperatures will create
some hazardous travel conditions on secondary roads as well as
untreated primary roads. This includes the evening rush hour
commute! Elsewhere, along the Southern Plateau and Valley (into SW
NC), light snow is expected to accumulate by the late afternoon
and evening where an Advisory begins there as of 21z. Overall, it
cannot be stated enough the importance for motorists to take any
snow accumulation seriously and use extra caution when traveling,
especially by the evening rush hour commute. Another round of
heavier snow is expected overnight...and all other Advisories and
Warnings through Saturday morning remain in effect until Saturday
morning. Please see the WSW and HWO products for more information
on this event.

National Weather Service Morristown TN
338 AM EST Fri Jan 6 2017

.SHORT TERM (Today through Saturday morning)...
Through this morning and early afternoon, only very light snow or
flurries are expected as the column will have adequate moisture but
weak to no lift. With only a slight chance of any measurable liquid
precip and high temperatures near or slightly above freezing, no
snow accumulations over a tenth are expected through mid afternoon.

Lift will start to increase late in the afternoon as the amplifying
midlevel trough moves into the MS Valley region and the entrance
region of the jet become positioned over the Southern Appalachians.
Frontogenetic forcing ramps up in the 03-06Z time frame, although
the NAM and GFS have some differences in positioning, with the GFS
being a bit more S and E with its QPF. So although their amounts in
our eastern sections fairly close, there are some large
differences in snow amounts for the Plateau, SW VA, and western
Valley. This is the area of lowest confidence. The SREF mean has the
highest amounts and is a bit concerning, showing a couple inches
more than the 00Z NAM and several more than the 00Z GFS. The 06Z
run of the NAM has come in with slightly lower amounts than the 00Z
run, lending confidence to undercutting the SREF amounts. Precip
should begin to taper off from 09Z to 15Z with the passage of the
midlevel trough axis, with only additional light accumulations east
Saturday morning.

Storm total snow amounts are expected to be in the 4-7 inch range
for SW NC, the TN mountains, and foothills - this is an expansion
westward from the previous warning. The timing of the current
warning will be moved later to start at 00Z. The rest of the area -
along and west of I-81 and along and west of a line from Morristown
to Cleveland - will be in an advisory for 1-3 inches.

.LONG TERM (Saturday afternoon through Thursday)...
With the snow moved out of our area by Saturday afternoon the
biggest weather story will be the very cold temperatures through
the rest of the weekend. Drier winds out of the north will help to
funnel in unseasonably cold air and clear out the skies through the
second half of the weekend. These will combine to give us
temperatures overnight in the single digits/low teens across most
of the area (about 20 degrees below normal for this time of year).
Daytime won't bring much relief temperature-wise with most
locations staying below freezing throughout the entire weekend.
Luckily winds should be pretty light at the surface so the wind
chill values won't be dramatically lower than the observed
temperatures this weekend.

Many places will finally get above freezing for the first time on
Monday, and it wouldn't suprise me if some places experience over
100 hours of continuous sub-freezing temperatures leading into
Monday. Luckily the warming trend will continue through the rest of
the week with many places forecasted to be in the upper 50's by the
end of the work week. With the gradual warming we will also get our
next chance for precipitation. A front will sweep through the area
in the middle of the week and bring a good chance for precipitation.
Temperatures will have warmed up enough to where any precip that
does occur should be all liquid. Can't rule out some brief switch
over to snow in the highest elevations in the overnight hours, but
the vast majority will just see rain. Also of note with this front
will be the winds ahead of the front as a strong low level jet moves
over us. We could see some breezy winds in the higher elevations and
some of it will translate down into the valley, making the overnight
wind chill temperatures Wednesday morning unpleasant.

Another slow moving system could move through at the end of the work
week, but models are in disagreement with timing/location of this
one. At this point it looks warm enough that any precip that does
occur will still be in the form a just rain.

National Weather Service Morristown TN
349 PM EST Thu Jan 5 2017

.SHORT TERM /Tonight through Friday Night/...
A very complex storm system will impact the region over the next 36
hours, bringing widespread winter weather impacts to the Tennessee
Valley and Southern Appalachian region. The initial clipper system
tonight will not have much in the way of appreciable moisture with
it, through there will be some added lift along the mountains of SW
Virginia. Some locally higher amounts of 1 to 3 inches of snow are
possible there overnight, but generally 1/2 to 1 inch is expected
across much of the rest of the Valley (generally I-40 north). This
system will quickly exit the region leaving subfreezing, arctic
air in it's wake.

Another winter storm system will quickly approach the region from
the south and west, bringing light snow into the eastern Tennessee
valley as early as 18z Friday. This precipitation is progged to
overspread the area over the course of the afternoon and evening
and confidence is increasing that a widespread heavy snow event
will occur. There will be a sharp cut-off point, which will highly
be dependent of the track of this system and where the jet sets up.
However, feel confident that the east TN/west NC mountains will see
warning conditions and have upgraded to a warning there.

How much the valley gets is less certain. However, there is a
decent possibilty of 2 to 5 inches occurring across a broad area
(borderline warning criteria), beginning late Friday afternoon
through Saturday morning). Regardless of how much snow occurs the
subfreezing temperatures will create treacherous road conditions
on any untreated surfaces (even with 1-2 inches of snow). Given the
model fluctuations, have gone with a Watch for the Valley and a
Warning for the Mountains for now and will let the evening/midnight
shifts take another look at it. Am more confident about the Plateau
seeing less snowfall and have gone with an Advisory there. For more
information on the impacts of this storm system, please see the
Winter Storm Watch/Warning/Advisory (WSW) product and the Hazardous
Weather Outlook (HWO).

One last note, the closest Analog for this event is the January 28,
2014, winter storm that dropped 2-4 inches of snow across the
region, and created treacherous road conditions on untreated
surfaces to the subfreezing temperatures.

.LONG TERM /Saturday through Thursday/...
At the beginning of this period the Winter Storm will be exiting the
area, the upper trough will be on top of us, and cold surface high
pressure will be building into the area.  Saturday morning there
will likely be some lingering snow showers in our eastern counties,
with light accumulations--mainly less than 1/2 inch--once again main
confined to the counties along the TN/NC state line.

The surface ridge will be nosing into the area by Sunday
morning...making for lighter and lighter winds to enhance
radiational cooling.  Will go about a category colder than the blend
min temps for Sunday morning, closer to the GFS MOS mins. The ridge
should move the rest of the way over the area during the day on
Sunday.  As the ridge slides east, early next week, a southerly
return flow sets in that should show a fairly quick warm-up.  

The next cold front looks to push through the area around mid-week.
Looks like a deep low pressure with this system that on the surface
looks like it might have some wind with it, but for us, it tracks so
far north, that the faster winds will be to the north as well. Might
have some gusty southwest winds for one 12 hour period, just ahead
of the front.  Looks like precip will be mainly in a band along the
front.  Models not showing much instability surging north ahead of
the front, but as deep as the low is, it is worth keeping up with
low level moisture trends for chances of thunder--will just keep as
showers for now.  Also, even on the cold side of this precip, right
now it looks like all liquid as the cooling happens after the
moisture has eroded away to our east.

National Weather Service Morristown TN
1038 AM EST Thu Jan 5 2017

.DISCUSSION...
Light radar returns moving into the Cumberland Plateau at this
hour, but drier air at the surface preventing any precipitation
from reaching the ground thus far. Except this trend to continue
though the mid-afternoon in those areas, before cold air advection
and some better moisture begin to initate light snow after 21z.
After sunset, temperatures will completely drop below freezing and
remain there through the night. Any snow that falls will be able to
accumulate, including on untreated roads. Still, am not expecting
any accumulations across the Valley and metro before 00z and the
evening rush hour commute. Areas along the Kentucky border along
the N. Plateau and southwest Virginia could see some light
accumulations and impacts on secondary roads between 21-00z.
Please see the Winter Weather Advisory for more information.

.SHORT TERM...(Today and Tonight)...
Clouds will increase across the forecast area this morning, ahead
of a clipper system that will push through the area this evening
through Friday morning. High temperatures today will reach the
upper 30s across the Cumberland Plateau and southwest Virginia, the
lower 40s across the Tennessee Valley, and the mid 40s near the
TN/GA line before colder air rushes in behind the arctic front.

Rain showers will change over to snow this evening across the
northern Plateau and Cumberland Mountains, then snow showers will
spread further south overnight. With overnight lows in the 20s,
snow will accumulate and cause some travel difficulties --
especially on untreated roadways. Total snowfall through Friday
morning will range from 1-3 inches (with locally higher amounts)
across northeast TN and southwest VA to 0.5-1 inches across the
northern Tennessee Valley to a few tenths south of I-40.

.LONG TERM...(Friday through Wednesday)...
As the first snow maker leaves the area tonight, a second system
starts to wind up in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Models have been
consistently showing this system for the last several days, but
location is everything, and that is where the models have been a bit
more inconsistent with it. ECMWF has been fairly steady over the
last several days with sfc low moving along the northern Gulf coast
Friday and moving off the SE coast Friday night. GFS and NAM have
also been depicting low in the northern Gulf, but the track has been
a bit further south. Models coming a bit more in line this morning
on the track which brings wintery precipitation right to our eastern
and southern doorsteps. Presently there is consensus among the SREF,
GFS, ECMWF, and NAM that snow will be primarily confined to the
extreme eastern portion of the area and southwest North Carolina.
Similarly, snowfall totals look to be on the order of 1-2 inches in
northeast Tennessee increasing to 2-3 inches over the southern third
of this area. Going back to the fact that location is everything,
a slight change in the surface low track could have significant
implications on snowfall in our area. A bit further south and the
area in northeast Tennessee would see nearly nothing, a bit further
north and portions of the East Tennessee Valley could see some
accumulations overnight Friday into Saturday morning. Certainly
need to keep a close watch on the model handling of this system
over the next run or two.

System quickly shifts east by Saturday afternoon with skies clearing
behind it by Saturday evening. Then the arctic cold takes hold with
temperatures struggling to get above freezing across much of the
area through Sunday. A gradual warming trend starts Monday where
most of the area will reach into the upper 30s under full sun. Next
system approaches the area Tuesday night with decent agreement btwn
GFS and ECMWF on track and timing for now. With this system,
temperatures will continue to warm through Wednesday with prospects
of more rain as this system passes through on Wednesday

320 PM EST Wed Jan 4 2017

.SHORT TERM /Tonight and Thursday/...
Drier air quickly moving into the region this afternoon, creating a
mostly clear sky overnight. This will allow temperatures to drop
into the low to mid 20s over much of the region due to the good
radiational cooling. Some mid to high clouds will move in late
tonight into Thursday morning ahead of an arctic front that is
progged to move east into the region late Thursday afternoon and
evening. Some peaks of sunshine will allow highs to warm into the
40s ahead of this boundary, but colder air will quickly filter in
behind it. Latest forecast has the boundary pushing into the
northern Plateau and Cumberland mountains between 18-21z, quickly
changing any light rain with it to snow for the evening commute.
This trend will continue into the evening hours and after sunset as
these broad areas of snow will overspread the area. A Winter
Weather Advisory has been issued for the Northern Plateau and
Cumberland Mtns from 21z Thursday to 12z Friday and across much of
the rest of the area from 00-12z (addressed below).

.LONG TERM /Thursday Night through Wednesday/...
A clipper system will dive southeast from the Northern Plains
tonight and will be cross the Southern Appalachian region Thursday
night into Friday morning. This is a fast moving upper trough but
should have enough sub-freezing air and enough moisture to produce
some accumulating snow across much of the MRX forecast area.
Typically greater snowfall accumulation is expected on the higher
terrain features including the Cumberland Plateau, Southwest
Virginia, and the mountains along the Tennessee and North Carolina
border. In these areas, snowfall totals should be at least one to
two inches, although some of the higher terrain across Southwest
Virginia could pick up two to four inches. Would expect amounts
around one inch in the Tri-Cities area by daybreak Friday with
totals around one half to one inch across the Great Valley from
around Knoxville northeast into the Tri-Cities region. Of course,
this would cause some travel difficulties with overnight snowfall
and temperatures dropping into the 20s. Although the deeper
moisture and lift would be exiting early in the day Friday, enough
lower level moist air and cold air advection should be in place to
keep some light snow or flurries going through mid day. The next
system that will have a minor impact on our forecast area will be a
short wave driving east through the Lower Mississippi Valley Friday
night and across the Southeast Atlantic Coastal states by Saturday
morning. The forecast ideology utilized a compromise between the
weaker and farther east GFS and the stronger ECMWF which features a
deepening surface low much closer to the Southeast Atlantic coast.
In this scenario, most of the deep moisture and short wave lift
will be south and east of the MRX forecast area. Thus, used a thin
stripe of pops aligned along the far East Tennessee mountains with
the highest probabilities at 50 percent for light snow on the
mountain terrain. This system moves out quickly with skies clearing
by Saturday afternoon. A dry regime persists for a rather lengthy
period behind the departing storm system. The forecast area should
enjoy more sun than clouds from Saturday afternoon through Tuesday
afternoon. However, it will be very cold with a northerly flow
pulling arctic air into the region well into Monday. Highs will not
make it above freezing for most of the area through the weekend,
but will recover to at least the mid to upper 30s on Monday.
Another upper trough and surface frontal system will be pressing
into the Eastern U.S. Tuesday night into Wednesday which should
help boost high temperatures back into the 40s on Tuesday and lower
to middle 50s on Wednesday. Of course, more rain will be in the
forecast during this final part of the extended as it is lifted
ahead of the system cold front.

slowly drop through the day as the sky begins to clear over
portions of the Plateau. The wildcard will be clouds along and
south of I-40 and east of I-81 which may be slower to erode and
shift east (which will keep temperatures warmer). Some light
showers will also continue along the spine of the mountains through
18z or so, before tapering off. By this evening, the sky will
become mostly clear and the mercury will quickly dip into the low

Cold front continues to push east through the forecast area
early this morning. Rain showers will quickly taper off this
morning and cloud cover will become scattered as cooler, drier air
moves in behind the front. With the cooler air moving in, afternoon
temperatures will be steady or slowly falling. Cloud cover will

Forecast confidence is growing as models continue to come into
alignment over the upcoming snow event late Thursday through Friday.
Although there are still some discrepancies between accumulation
amounts, timing and areal extent of the frozen pcpn looks to be
increasing in consensus among the models. 

Most of Thursday should be dry area wide as cold air pushes in.
Temperatures will struggle to climb into the middle 30s during the
day over SW Virginia and northern portions of the Cumberland
Plateau. By afternoon, the leading edge of the arctic airmass pushes
into northern areas as shortwave trough passes along the TN-KY-VA
border. As that passes larger scale trough axis begins to push into
the area early Friday. Result is increasing clouds with pcpn to
develop by late afternoon. With a very dry airmass at the surface,
expect much of the pcpn to start and stay as snow, even though
initial sfc temps may be above freezing. Biggest disparity in
guidance is on amounts, particularly over SW VA. However, all
solutions seems to agree that there will be more moisture available
from Thursday night through Friday to see snow totals of 2-3 in SW
VA. Expect highest elevations of SW VA to see up to 3 inches of snow
while the rest of that area gets around 2 inches over the course of
the 30 hour event. E(Thursday through Wednesday)...

For Saturday, models are in general agreement on the track of
developing Gulf low expected to move east across the northern Gulf
coast then NE thereafter. ECMWF has the more northern low track and
therefore the greater pcpn amounts in our SW NC counties. GFS soln
is much further south tracking across central Florida before turning
up the coast, and that solution is much drier for our area. Tended
to lean a little more toward the ECMWF solution for now as there are
enough GFS Ensemble members keeping the system further north hinting
at a possible solution which lies closer to the ECMWF at this time.
Therefore keeping chance POPS over the eastern half of the area
early Saturday before shifting chance POPS to just mountains of east
TN and SW NC by Saturday afternoon. 

Beyond Saturday, good model agreement on cold and dry weather
through Tuesday with gradual warming ahead of the next sensible
weather maker approaching the area on Wednesday.lsewhere in the

moves in behind the front. With the cooler air moving in, afternoon
temperatures will be steady or slowly falling. Cloud cover will
increase from the west again tonight, ahead of our next weather
system. With the colder airmass firmly in place, lows will dip
into the 20s across the area.

.LONG TERM...(Thursday through Wednesday)...
Forecast confidence is growing as models continue to come into
alignment over the upcoming snow event late Thursday through Friday.
Although there are still some discrepancies between accumulation
amounts, timing and areal extent of the frozen pcpn looks to be
increasing in consensus among the models. 

Most of Thursday should be dry area wide as cold air pushes in.
Temperatures will struggle to climb into the middle 30s during the
day over SW Virginia and northern portions of the Cumberland
Plateau. By afternoon, the leading edge of the arctic airmass pushes
into northern areas as shortwave trough passes along the TN-KY-VA
border. As that passes larger scale trough axis begins to push into
the area early Friday. Result is increasing clouds with pcpn to
develop by late afternoon. With a very dry airmass at the surface,
expect much of the pcpn to start and stay as snow, even though
initial sfc temps may be above freezing. Biggest disparity in
guidance is on amounts, particularly over SW VA. However, all
solutions seems to agree that there will be more moisture available
from Thursday night through Friday to see snow totals of 2-3 in SW
VA. Expect highest elevations of SW VA to see up to 3 inches of snow
while the rest of that area gets around 2 inches over the course of
the 30 hour event. 

For Saturday, models are in general agreement on the track of
developing Gulf low expected to move east across the northern Gulf
coast then NE thereafter. ECMWF has the more northern low track and
therefore the greater pcpn amounts in our SW NC counties. GFS soln
is much further south tracking across central Florida before turning
up the coast, and that solution is much drier for our area. Tended
to lean a little more toward the ECMWF solution for now as there are
enough GFS Ensemble members keeping the system further north hinting
at a possible solution which lies closer to the ECMWF at this time.
Therefore keeping chance POPS over the eastern half of the area
early Saturday before shifting chance POPS to just mountains of east
TN and SW NC by Saturday afternoon. 

Beyond Saturday, good model agreement on cold and dry weather
through Tuesday with gradual warming ahead of the next sensible
weather maker approaching the area on Wednesday.

.DISCUSSION...
The approaching cold front is just reaching Scott County at the
moment. Projecting its movement takes it east of our area by 08Z.
Radar shows no precip upstream and behind the front. So with the
front's exit, measureable rainfall should end, although the models
maintain low level moisture and produce a few hundredths to a
tenth into Wednesay morning. This is likely overdone given the lack
of moisture depth by 12Z and the exit of forcing for lift. PoPs
will be cut back after fropa to just slight chances and isolated
sprinkles. No other changes are needed.

.SHORT TERM (Today into tomorrow)...
Scattered drizzle is still present in a few locations across the
area today, but any rain that is coming out of these clouds is
minimal. Low clouds will stick around through the rest of today and
into tomorrow. Trough will swing through tonight and shift winds to
out of the northwest and we could see a bit more precipitation
along the higher terrain because of this. If any precipitation is
able to be squeezed out of the atmosphere it will most likely fall
in the form of rain, but a few of the highest elevations could see
a brief switch over to light snow overnight. Colder air will
intrude behind the trough and knock back temperatures about 10 - 15
degrees tomorrow when compared with today. 

.LONG TERM...(Wednesday night through Tuesday)...
Models are in better agreement today than this time yesterday, but
while the differences are more subtle they are still important for
our sensible weather. Forecast confidence has improved but is still
below normal for this time of year given poor run to run
consistency. Should be dry Wednesday night into early Thursday,
then some weak forcing and moisture convergence along the leading
edge of the arctic air moving into the area will bring clouds and
some light precip later Thursday through Thursday night/early
Friday. Much of this precip is likely to be snow, especially
Thursday night into Friday. Right now it looks like amounts will be
light if any accumulation occurs, and there is quite a bit of
forecast uncertainty whether any accumulation will occur. ECMWF is
more amplified than the GFS with a trailing short wave for later
Friday and Friday night, pulling more moisture back north into our
area along with additional light snow. Ensembles are split on this,
so no boost to forecast confidence there. Will carry slight chance
to chance PoPs Friday and Friday night given the spread in
solutions. Will mention the possibility of accumulating snow in the
HWO. Models in decent agreement for drier weather for the weekend
through Tuesday, with some warming by the end of the period.

.SHORT TERM (Today through Wednesday)...
Surface low center approaching Middle TN TN this morning will
continue to track NE toward KY today and then into NW PA tonight.
Current water vapor and RAP 500 mb analysis indicates shortwave
trough over the mid-state area continues to push NE this morning.
Majority of pcpn with this system has pushed N and E of the area
with a dry slot punching NE up the East TN Valley this morning. An
area of showers is developing in area of weak instability and lift
SE of this negatively tilting shortwave. Expect these showers to
continue NE with the shortwave this morning.

With some enhancement to the pressure gradient over East TN as
this system moves NE, winds have remained on the order of 5 mph
across much of the area. This mixing should reduce prospects of
area wide fog for morning so removed mention of it and replaced
with patchy fog in sheltered and low-lying areas instead.

As low moves NE, sfc trough swings across the area finally shifting
winds from S to SW. With plenty of moisture left in the lowest 300
mb, chance POPs remain area wide through the day. By tonight, trough
has exited and cold front moves across the area finally shifting
winds out of the NW as the atmosphere starts to dry out and pcpn
begin to decrease across the southern half of the area.

As the shortwave lifts NE, zonal flow returns by this evening with
a weak impulse moving rapidly eastward along the TN/KY border on
Wednesday. This impulse will help to keep clouds and slight chance
POPS over the northern third of the area and particularly SW VA
into Wednesday afternoon.

Cold air finally starts to push into the area on Wednesday with
daytime highs expected to return to near normal. Although the cold
air arrives to late in this event to produce any threat of frozen
pcpn, some of the higher elevations in SW VA and NE TN may see a
few, a very few, flakes of snow late Wednesday before the dry air
rushes in.

.LONG TERM (Wednesday Night through Monday)...
Models continue to have large differences for the extended
forecast period, resulting in a relatively low-confidence forecast.
Both the GFS and the ECMWF indicate a weak shortwave dragging a bit
of moisture across the region late Thursday into early Friday.
However, the GFS keeps most of the precipitation north of our
forecast area, while the ECMWF shows moisture sinking further
south. Bottom line is light snow showers are possible Thursday
night into Friday morning, especially across the north. Have
limited POPs to 30 or less due to uncertainty on how far south the
moisture will make it.

The 00Z ECMWF shows a more significant winter event for Friday night
into Saturday morning. In contrast, the 00Z GFS also indicates the
potential for snow, but brings the snow in closer to daybreak
Saturday, and keeps the best moisture south of our forecast area.
Additionally, both model solutions continue to vary greatly from run
to run. Ensembles are not providing much additional clarity, so for
now will go with a low confidence forecast with slight chance POPs
from Friday afternoon through Saturday evening. Sunday and Monday
look dry as the upper level trough swings east and surface high
pressure builds overhead, but northwest flow will help colder air
remain in place with highs in the 30s and lows in the teens.

.SHORT TERM (Today through tomorrow)...
Overnight rain has moved out of the area and will be quickly
replaced by more showers and thunderstorms moving in from the
southwest. There is enough instability to see storms to our
southwest, but instability is less impressive once you get into
East Tennessee. However we will get a good low level jet to help
with keep storms together that form to our southwest. In our
southwest counties some of these storms could be strong with breezy
winds and maybe some small hail being the main threat... However
widespread severe weather is not expected at this time.

Storms will continue through the evening into the overnight hours
and eventually exit the area to our northeast. With decent
precipitation expected this evening/night (generally 0.5 - 1 inch
expected) we could see patchy fog develop as well.

.LONG TERM (Tuesday night through Monday)...
Models in only fair agreement early on, and model
agreement/consistency quickly becomes poor after that. Forecast
confidence is average early but becomes quite low, especially from
Thursday on. Colder air will be moving in Tuesday night and
Wednesday, and expect some rain showers lingering across the area
especially near a secondary cold front that pushes through
overnight Tuesday night. Things get much more interesting/difficult
for Thursday through the weekend. The GFS brings the next weak
short wave energy along with a surge of even colder air Thu, with
some light snow possible especially north, then has a big winter
event Friday night through Saturday night. ECMWF has the initial
energy later, more late Thursday into early Friday, then is dry for
the weekend. Ensembles not providing too much clarity, so for now
will lean toward the more consistent ECMWF solution and go with a
low confidence forecast of slight chance/low chance PoPs focused
around Thu night and then carry slight chance PoPs Friday through
Sat night. Much of this precip, if it indeed occurs, may be in the
form of snow. Dry forecast for Sunday and Monday for now.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Warm front extends westward across northern Georgia and Alabama
then SW into central Louisiana and Texas. Current water vapor
imagery and RAP upper air analysis indicates a weak shortwave
lifting NE across North Georgia and the Southern Appalachians this
morning while a rather strong shortwave trough is shifting eastward
across Texas. As the weak shortwave exits the area to the NE, we
should see some breaks in pcpn ahead of the next system later
today. Latest hires models agree with pcpn winding down area wide
through late morning with only some persistent low clouds and
drizzle through the remainder of the afternoon.

Things begin to wind up again by this evening as the Texas shortwave
starts to lift NE. An associated surface low center develops over
NE Texas later this morning and moves NE up the Ohio Valley by
tomorrow morning. Ahead of this system, as low to middle level flow
becomes increasingly SW, plenty of moisture and warm air is pumped
into the area. Forecasted high temperatures this afternoon will run
about 15 degrees above normal while model forecasted PW values
across the area are reaching 1.3 inches, putting them near maximum
observed values for early January. As the warm front pushes NE into
the evening and overnight, instability increases and threat of
thunderstorms, some possibly strong, will expand south to north
across the area through tonight. Although axis of greatest
instability and support for severe storms lies generally to our SW
and over portions of Middle TN, our Southern TN Valley and Plateau
counties are in an SPC marginal risk for today. Similarly, best
moisture also lies west of the area over Middle TN, but still
expect to see anywhere from 0.5 inches to near 1.0 inches of pcpn
over the next day with greatest rainfall totals expected in the
southern third of the area, further putting a dent in the ongoing
drought over that area.


.LONG TERM (Tuesday through Sunday)...
Surface low and cold front expected to be moving across northeast
Tennessee and southwest Virginia Tuesday morning. Strong winds
aloft out ahead of the front and warm moist airmass will still keep
air mass somewhat unstable Tuesday morning so continued chance of
thunderstorms. Later Tuesday a secondary cold front and a more
significant colder air mass approaches. Showers will decrease in
the early afternoon and then increase again late ahead of the
front. Much colder Tuesday night with lows close to freezing at
highest elevations. There may be a little snow mixed in by morning
but no accumulations expected. The air mass will be drying out with
the precipitation ending during the morning.

Cooler and drier air mass continues Wednesday night but model blends
bring a weak system into the region Thursday and Thursday night.
Still expect a chance of rain or snow although may not be
significant. This system to move east Friday with drier and colder
temperatures. Then for Saturday another weak system with a slight
chance for snow. Still uncertainty that it will be significant. There
are major timing and strength differences with these systems late in
the week. The ECMWF model brings first system across the region
mainly Thursday night and Friday then drying out for the weekend but
GFS has a weak Thursday system then a much stronger system moving in
Saturday and Saturday night. Confidence is low for the last 3 to 4
days of the forecast. However temperatures will be much colder from
Thursday on...mainly mid 30s to lower 40s lower elevations and upper
20s to lower 30s higher elevations to night time lows in the 20s
lower elevations and teens higher elevations.

.AVIATION...
Expect vsby/cigs at both KCHA/KTYS to remain IFR to LIFR for the
first half of the TAF cycle. KTRI may see showers overnight drop
vsby to MVFR briefly but should remain predominately VFR through
late afternoon with aid of downsloping winds. Conditions improve
to MVFR by morning at KTYS and afternoon at KCHA ahead of next
swath of pcpn expected late afternoon at KCHA and early evening at
KTYS. All terminals will continue to see deteriorating conditions
late in the TAF period with IFR conditions possible by evening.

.Discussion...Main weather feature of concern continues to be a warm
front stretched from central Alabama northeastward into the
Carolinas.  This boundary will slowly lift northward...but should
remain south and east of the MRX CWA through the night. However...it
will still influence area weather with continued cloudy skies and
patchy drizzle and fog across the region.  Scattered showers
associated with to front will slowly move northward and this
activity is expected to push into the area tonight with likely to
categorical pops across south and east locations with only chance
pops north and west. All looks good in the current forecast...will
update to remove late afternoon period and evening wording.

Vis and cigs will continue to be an issue at CHA and TYS through
the night. LIFR conditions are expected to be predominant at both
sites until midday tomorrow. Some improvement may come in the
afternoon, but antoher round of rain is expected to arrive near the
end of the TAF period. At TRI, downslope winds have kept vis and
cigs VFR, and this is expected to conintue through the TAF period.

.SHORT TERM (This Afternoon through Monday)...

A mild cloudy drizzly day to start the New Year with a warm front
located to the south of the area stretching from W-E from Central
Alabama eastward to the Carolina Coast. Current water vapor and RAP
upper air analysis indicate a weak upper level trough moving across
the Central Plains stretching southward into the Southern
Mississippi River Valley. Light showers/drizzle will continue
throughout the afternoon and evening as low level isentropic ascent
will persist to the north of the advancing warm front.

Mid-level and low-level flow will become southwesterly ahead of the
approaching trough. Moisture and warm air advection will increase PW
values into the 1.1-1.3 inch range, which are near the maximum
values observed for early January. The best lift and moisture will
be across the mountains where the highest PoPs are featured. The
warm front will continue to progress northward during the overnight
hours but should remain to the south of the forecast area. Due to
this, went ahead and removed the mention of thunder to the overnight
forecast. 

A surface low will track from South Texas to the Mississippi Delta
on Monday as another shortwave trough races across the Southern
Plains. Expect there could be a brief break in the precipitation
Monday morning as the system exits late tonight before the next
system arrives late Monday. Models indicate a 35-45 kt low level jet
by the end of the day with the front pushing into the Southern
Valley. With this, there will be some limited instability (SBCAPE
values < 250 J/Kg). Due to this, included a small area of
thunderstorm Monday afternoon across portions of the Southern
Valley. Overall, rainfall amounts for the short-term period will
range from around 0.25-0.75 inches with amounts over an inch
possible across the mountains. 

.LONG TERM (Monday night through Saturday)...

Trough will be moving right over us by Monday night, and we will
continue to see thunderstorms in area. We will continue to see
moderate CAPE in the southwest counties and some minor shear to
where we could see thunderstorms with a few potentially strong ones
continue into the evening. After the low moves through winds will
swing around to the northwest by Wednesday afternoon. Most of the
precipitation will dry up after the front passes through on
Wednesday when temperatures begin to cool down quickly. However...
there might be enough moisture lingering around for some light
snowfall in the higher elevations Wednesday night into Thursday
morning. Any accumulations would likely be relegated to the highest
elevations and generally only a few tenths of an inch or less. 

Much colder weather will then persist over the area the rest of the
week and through the weekend. Quiet and cool weather will continue
till the end of the week where models begin to diverge a bit. GFS is
still sticking with it's dry solution through the work week while
the ECMWF is showing a weak system moving through and bringing a
round of cold rain/snow. However the ECMWF is continuously changing
it's tune while the GFS has been a bit more consistent in it's
solution. With that being said, have hedged closer towards the drier
GFS for the end of the work week, but will continue with slight
chances of precipitation on the chance the ECMWF is the correct
solution. Long term models then agree that the weekend will likely
be dry, but remain cold with high temperatures topping out in the
20's or 30's.

LIFR conditions currently at KCHA and KTYS with MVFR conditions at
KTRI. Low level isentropic ascent will continue throughout the TAF
cycle to the north of a warm front. Expect similar conditions will
continue throughout the TAF cycle with light showers/drizzle
possible as well. There is the possibilty for VFR conditions late
in the TAF cycle but have continued with IFR to LIFR conditions for
now.

.DISCUSSION...

A warm front stretches E-W across Central Alabama and Central
Georgia. Widespread cloud cover with light showers/drizzle exists
across the forecast area with strong low level isentropic lift to
the north of the warm front. Expect this will continue throughout
the day with temperatures and dewpoints slowly increasing as the
front nudges northward. The temperatures and dewpoints are in good
shape but did expand the timeframe for the drizzle/fog throughout
the remainder of the morning into the afternoon.

Terminals continue in or near IFR conditions for the next several
hours as fog/drizzle continues to hamper cigs/vsby. Expect a 6-8
hour window this afternoon and early evening where all terminals
will reach MVFR in light afternoon winds and a lull in pcpn with
the current system. Deteriorating cigs/vsby return overnight as
next wave of pcpn coupled with calm/light winds and fog bring back
IFR flight conditions to all terminals.

.SHORT TERM (Today and Tonight)...
Surface cold front extending SW across the Ohio Valley into NW
Arkansas this morning will become nearly stationary as it sags SE
toward Middle TN tonight. Southeast of this front, well defined
stationary boundary with juicy dewpoints to 60 degrees south of it,
extends east to west from south Alabama into east Texas. Meanwhile
water vapor imagery indicates shortwave trough over northern
Mexico this morning that will gradually lift NE in an amplifying
eastern US ridge, toward the Southern Appalachians by Monday
morning.

As the Texas shortwave lifts NE toward the area, flow aloft will
continue to become increasingly SW through the deep layer. This
will lead to continued cloudy skies and periods of rain and
rainshowers through tonight. As flow aloft shifts more SW tonight,
deep moisture will move in from the western Gulf Of Mexico. As it
does, models indicate PW values reaching to near 1.4 inches over
the southern third of the area by Monday morning, putting them near
the climatological maximums for early January. Then as the Texas
shortwave moves through tonight, a rather sharp gradient of QPF
will set up along and south of the southern border counties of TN
and SW NC in the area of best combined dynamics and moisture.
Although much of the area will see pcpn amounts on the order of 0.1
to 0.3 inches as this system moves NE tonight, the most favored
area will remain south of the TN and NC borders through Monday
morning where WPC pcpn estimates reach 0.5 to 1.0 inches over
northern GA. By late tonight, under continued warming, instability
begins to increase over the southern third of the area. Although
CAPE values are just starting to climb toward 100 J/Kg, did put
mention of isolated thunder in that area as elevated instability is
beginning to develop.

Persistent southwest flow under cloud cover is going to keep
temperatures near constant in the upper 40s to middle 50s across
most of the area through tonight which is near the climatological
maximums for January... but about 20 degrees above the
climatological minimums for early January.

.LONG TERM (Monday through Saturday)...
A Stationary Front is expected to be just to the south with a
surface trough over the Ohio and western Tennessee Valleys early
Monday. A significant shortwave is expected to eject out of the
Southwest states and move rapidly northeast toward the Great Lakes.
A secondary surface low is expected to move northeast out of Texas
into the Tennessee Valley by Monday evening. The stationary
boundary to the south will bring deeper moisture north. The
atmosphere will destabilize and thunderstorms will be possible
Monday and Monday evening. Temperatures will warm into the lower to
mid 60s. There is a slight risk of severe storms just to the
southwest in northern Alabama afternoon and evening and a few
strong storms southern Tennessee Valley and Cumberland Plateau
counties. The main threat would be damaging winds. As the surface
low moves northeast Monday night into Tuesday widespread showers
will continue as well as mild southwest flow. High rain chances
continue Monday night and then decrease Tuesday. Temperatures will
not drop much Monday night and likely be a few degrees warmer
Tuesday but the threat for storms will shift east. There still
could be a storm or two across forecast area but more significant
threat will shift northeast with surface low.

At midweek rain moves out by Wednesday as Higher pressure tries to
move in from Northwest and much colder air mass. Thursday and
Thursday night GFS model shows a weak system bring a little snow and
rain to the region moving through a cold northerly flow aloft with
the ECMWF wetter and more moist and lasting through Friday. Will
keep rain and snow chances in for both days. Warmed temperatures
slightly above model blend but with north to northwest flow
temperatures will struggle to reach freezing mountains and be mostly
30s elsewhere. Saturday will keep most areas dry with just slight
chance of rain or snow eastern border. Temperatures will be slightly
warmer south but still cold north.
