WEAKENING THE RIDGE OVER WEST COAST AND RETROGRADING IT INTO THE
PACIFIC. THEY ALL AGREE ON SWINGING THE UPPER LOW OFF THE CA COAST
ESE INTO SOCAL BY FRIDAY. THIS WILL LOWER HEIGHTS OVER CENTRAL
COASTAL CA AND INCREASE THE LIKELYHOOD OF COOL ONSHORE FLOW AS THE
SURFACE TROUGH SHIFTS INLAND THIS EVENING. BOTH OF THESE FACTORS WILL
COMBINE TO KEEP TEMPERATURES SEASONALLY COOL. THE ONSHORE FLOW WILL
ALLOW THE STRATUS AND FOG CURRENTLY OFF THE COAST TO INTRUDE MORNINGS
AND EVENINGS...BUT SHOULD NOT PENETRATE FAR INLAND DUE TO WEAKNESS OF
THE ONSHORE FLOW. THE VISIBLE SATELLITE DATA SHOWS THE STRATUS AND
FOG PUSHING INTO THE SALINAS VALLEY AND ALONG THE COAST FROM MONTEREY
BAY SOUTH AND A SECOND AREA OFF THE GOLDEN GATE. A WEAK OFFSHORE 
GRADIENT...0.5 MB OFFSHORE FROM SACRAMENTO TO SFO...IS SLOWLY

HAZY SUNSHINE AND MILD TEMPERATURES CONTINUED TODAY...WITH HIGHS OF
67 IN SANTA ROSA...68 IN DOWNTOWN SF...AND A WARM 76 AT THE WFO IN
MONTEREY.  THESE BALMY TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO COME TO AN END
HOWEVER AS BUILDING SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN PACIFIC
TURNS THE LOW LEVEL FLOW MORE ONSHORE OVER THE NEXT 12 TO 24 HOURS. 
ALREADY REFLECTING THIS...OFFSHORE WINDS AT THE TWO RAWS SITES IN
THE OAKLAND HILLS HAVE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY THIS EVENING AND ARE
NOW AT THEIR LOWEST VALUES IN SEVERAL DAYS.  TEMPERATURES ARE THUS
EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY RETURN TOWARDS SEASONAL NORMALS OVER THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS.

ONLY OTHER CONCERN IN THE SHORT TERM IS THE UPPER LOW NOW CENTERED
ABOUT 600 KM WEST OF SFO.  MODELS HAVE AGREED ON SYSTEM MOVING
BACK TOWARDS THE CALIF COAST BUT HAVE VARIED WIDELY IN THE DETAILS. 
CONSENSUS OF NEW 00Z MODEL RUNS IS FOR THE 500 MB LOW CENTER TO BE A
FEW HUNDRED KMS OFFSHORE FROM SFO AT 12Z THURS WITH A CENTRAL HEIGHT
OF APPROX 566 DM.  LATEST MODELS THEN PROJECT THIS WEAK SYSTEM TO
MOVE SOUTHWARDS OFFSHORE RATHER THAN INLAND.  GIVEN THE MORE OFFSHORE
TRACK...THE VERY LIMITED ABOVE BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE...AND THE
WEAKER INTENSITY THAN INDICATED BY YESTERDAYS MODEL RUNS...DO NOT
EXPECT IT TO BRING ANY PRECIP TO OUR CWA.  AFTER ALL MODEL RUNS ARE
IN MIDNIGHT SHIFT MAY WANT TO REMOVE SLIGHT CHANCE PRECIP ON FRIDAY
PRESENTLY INDICATED FOR OUR SOUTHERN ZONES.

IN LONGER TERM...WELL ADVERTISED MAJOR CHANGE IN WEATHER PATTERN
STILL ANTICIPATED TO OCCUR.  MODELS VARY RADICALLY ON DETAILS...
HOWEVER...SO IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY OUTLOOK TIMING AND
INTENSITY.  SOME INDICATION OF THIS IS GIVEN BY THE FOLLOWING MODEL
FORECAST 500 MB HEIGHTS FOR SFO ALL VALID AT 12Z SUNDAY 2 JAN...
560 DM FROM THE 00Z TUES MRF...572 DM FROM THE 12Z TUES NOGAPS...
570 DM FROM THE 12Z TUES ECMWF...AND 547 DM FROM THE 12Z TUES UKMET. 
ASSOCIATED MODEL INDICATIONS OF WEATHER ON SUNDAY THUS RANGE FROM THE
NOGAPS SOLUTION SUGGESTIVE OF DRY AND MOSTLY SUNNY WEATHER THROUGHOUT
OUR CWA TO THE UKMET SOLUTION CONSISTENT WITH COOL SHOWERY CONDITIONS
AND A LOW SNOW LEVEL.  IN AFTERNOON ISSUANCE OF ZONES DECIDED TO GO
WITH A COMPROMISE OUTLOOK FOR SUNDAY OF COOLER WITH A CHANCE OF

37N/131W THIS AFTERNOON AND WAS MOVING SLOWLY NORTHWESTWARD. THIS
LOW IS FORECAST TO BEGIN MOVING SLOWLY EASTWARD TONIGHT WHICH WILL
CAUSE A SLIGHT CHANGE IN OUR CURRENT WEATHER PATTERN OVER THE NEXT
FEW DAYS. AS THE LOW MOVES EASTWARD THE OFFSHORE GRADIENT WILL
CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AND BECOME MORE ONSHORE ON WEDNESDAY. THIS ONSHORE
FLOW WILL ALLOW SOME COASTAL LOW CLOUDS AND FOG TO DEVELOP AND FOR
DAYTIME TEMPERATURES TO BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER. THIS SYSTEM IS

CHANGES EXPECTED IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD. MODELS VARY ON SOLUTIONS

OFF LOW LIES OFF THE NORTHERN CA COAST NEAR 37N/130W. THIS LED TO
ANOTHER CLEAR...COOL NIGHT WITH JUST A FEW PATCHES OF FOG. SOME LOW
CLOUDS WERE ALONG THE CALIFORNIA COAST BUT HAVE SINCE MOVED
OFFSHORE. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT BASIN IS CAUSING
OFFSHORE FLOW AND BREEZY NORTHEAST WINDS THROUGH THE EAST BAY
HILLS. SO LITTLE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL PATTERN SINCE YESTERDAY AND
EXPECT ANOTHER CLEAR AND UNSEASONABLY WARM DAY TODAY. THE CUT OFF
LOW IS RETROGRADING NORTHWESTWARD AT THIS TIME BUT IS FORECAST TO
BEGIN OPENING UP AND MOVING SLOWLY EASTWARD TONIGHT. THIS CUT OFF LOW
HAS VERY LIMITED MOISTURE. MAIN INFLUENCE THIS WILL HAVE ON CENTRAL
CA WEATHER WILL BE TO DECREASE THE EASTERLY GRADIENT AND INCREASE THE
ONSHORE FLOW...INCREASE THE COASTAL LOW CLOUDS AND COOL TEMPERATURES
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. MODELS VARY WIDELY ON THE EXTENDED FORECAST.
NOGAPS/ECMWF ARE THE WEAKEST WITH THIS LOW AND HAVE IT JUST STRETCH

ALMOST NEVER HAPPENS EVEN IN SUMMER OR FALL  EVEN SIGHTED THE FIRST
CHERRY BLOSSOMS MON AFTN.  WE WILL ENJOY ANOTHER BALMY DAY TDA.  THE
CUTOFF LOW HAS MOVED RAPIDLY WWD OFFSHORE...AS FORECAST BY MODELS
YESTERDAY...AND TOOK MUCH OF THE COASTAL STRATUS WITH IT.  EXCEPT FOR
THE USUAL FOG AT SANTA ROSA...SKIES ARE CLEAR AND WILL STAY THAT WAY
TDA.  OTHERWISE CONDITIONS ARE ABOUT THE SAME AS 24 HOURS AGO...WITH
A 7.8 MB OFFSHORE PRESSURE GRADIENT WMC-SFO.  LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES
...850 MB TEMPS...AND 500 MB HEIGHTS ARE ALL EXPECTED TO REMAIN
UNCHANGED...SO PERSISTENCE TEMPS WILL BE A GOOD FORECAST TDA.

THINGS WILL PROBABLY START TO CHANGE ON WED.  WITH THE CUTOFF FAR
OFFSHORE...AROUND 37/130 ON THE ETA/AVN...THE ELY FLOW ALOFT THAT WE
HAVE HAD FOR A WEEK OR SO WILL END...GIVING WAY TO A WLY FLOW MOVING
IN UNDER THE CUTOFF.  OFFSHORE GRADIENTS WILL WEAKEN WED MRNG...AND
END IN THE AFTN ALLOWING AT LEAST A WEAK SEABREEZE TO DEVELOP.  THIS
SHOULD RESULT IN LOWER MAX TEMPS EVEN THOUGH THE 850 MB TEMPS AND LOW

BE ON THE COAST...TEMPS SHOULD DROP BACK TO NEAR NORMAL HERE IN

MORE WIDESPREAD LOW STUFF WED NGT ON THE COAST AND LOCALLY INLAND.  

THE MODELS ARE STILL IN DISARRAY BEYOND WED.  THE MRF...WHICH EARLIER
WAS BRINGING THE CUTOFF ASHORE A DAY SOONER THAN MOST OTHER MODELS...
IS NOW KEEPING IT OFFSHORE A DAY LONGER.  IT MOVES THE SYSTEM ONSHORE
FRI...WITH PRETTY GOOD DYNAMICS INCLUDING STRONG THICKNESS

THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER SCENARIO HERE WITH THE USUAL
PATCHY DENSE FOG IN SONOMA COUNTY...COASTAL CRUD FROM PT REYES N...
AND A MODERATE OFFSHORE FLOW AT LOW LEVELS.  WMC-SFO GRADIENT WAS
8.6 MB AT 09Z...THE ETA HAS BEEN OVERFORECASTING IT BY A FEW
MILLIBARS LATELY.  FT ORD PROFILER SUGGESTS A LITTLE COOLING ALOFT. 
WILL CONTINUE WITH A BASIC PERSISTENCE FORECAST...MAXES SHOULD DROP
1-3 DEGREES IN MOST AREAS.  WE MAY SEE OUR STREAK OF 8 STRAIGHT DAYS
IN THE 70S END HERE IN MONTEREY...NOT A BAD STRETCH OF WEATHER FOR
DEC.  DONT TELL THE TOURISTS...BUT IN NON-EL NINO YEARS ITS NICER
HERE IN THE WINTER THAN IN THE SUMMER.  THE MAIN CHANGE ON TUE WILL
BE THE END OF THE OFFSHORE FLOW AS THE CUTOFF MOVES ASHORE AND THE
ELY FLOW WEAKENS AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT.  THE RESULTANT POORER
MIXING SHOULD SEND MAXES DOWN A DEGREE OR TWO AGAIN...ESPECIALLY NEAR

THE ETA AND AVN/MRF CONTINUE MOVING THE CUTOFF RAPIDLY WWD ON TUE...
WITH THE LOW REACHING 37/131 BY 00Z WED.  THE EURO/UK/CANADIAN ALL
TRACK THE CUTOFF SLOWER AND FARTHER S.  THESE MODELS THEN KICK THE
SYSTEM EWD ABOUT A DAY FASTER THAN THE MRF.  THE MRF DOESNT MOVE THE

ON THE OTHER MODELS.  ALTHOUGH THE FASTER WWD MOVEMENT IS THE
MINORITY OPINION AMONG THE MODELS...ITS BEEN VERIFYING BETTER THE
LAST TWO DAYS AND WILL LEAN TOWARD IT IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD.  IN ANY
CASE THERE WONT BE ANY DEEP MOISTURE FOR RAIN...BUT THE MRF SOLUTION
WOULD GENERATE AN ONSHORE FLOW AND ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FOR MUCH
MORE EXTENSIVE FOG/STRATUS.  THE OTHER MODELS WOULD KEEP THE LOW
STUFF MUCH SPARSER.  FOR NOW WILL USE A GENERIC SUMMER FORECAST OF

ALL MODELS IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT MOVING CUTOFF LOW...CURRENTLY 
OVER EASTERN ARIZONA...WNW TO NEAR LAS VEGAS BY THIS TIME SUNDAY AND 
THEN FURTHER WNW TO THE CENTRAL CA COAST BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. SPEED 
OF WESTWARD MOVEMENT IS FASTER THAN IN PREVIOUS MODEL RUN AND FASTER 
TIMING WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR WEATHER MONDAY. CURRENTLY...IR 
SATELLITE SHOWS BROAD BAND OF MOISTURE MOVING ACROSS MEXICO FROM THE 
SW...THEN N OVER NEW MEXICO ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE UPPER LOW. 
DEEPENING UPPER LEVEL TROF OVER CENTRAL U.S. IS FORECAST TO DIVERT 
MOST OF THAT MOISTURE TO THE E AND LEAVE THE CUTOFF WITH A LIMITED 
DEEP-LAYER MOISTURE SUPPLY AS IT HEADS WEST. THEREFORE...WILL ACCEPT 
MODEL SOLUTION OF NO PRECIP FOR OUR AREA AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES 
ACROSS OUR REGION ON MONDAY. DO EXPECT QUITE A BIT OF MID AND HIGH 
LEVEL CLOUDS TO ACCOMPANY UPPER LOW AND THIS WILL MEAN COOLER TEMPS 
FOR MONDAY. 

MEDIUM RANGE MODELS KEEP UPPER LOW OVER OR NEAR CENTRAL CA INTO 
EARLY WEDNESDAY AND THEN MOVE IT EAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY. WITH 
A CUTOFF LOW...ANY MOVEMENT FORECAST MORE THAN 100 HOURS IN ADVANCE 
SHOULD TREATED WITH A GOOD DEAL OF SKEPTICISM. SO FOR NOW WILL

...REINFORCED SLIGHTLY BY A DEVELOPING ELY FLOW ALOFT AS THE CUTOFF

A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTER WEST OF SAN FRANCISCO MOVED WESTWARD
AWAY FROM THE MAINLAND TODAY AND THIS HAS ALLOWED THE LARGE AREA OF
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT BASIN TO BECOME THE DOMINANT FEATURE
OVER THE DISTRICT. THE RESULT IS THAT THE OFFSHORE FLOW HAS INCREASED
AS EVIDENCED BY THE WINDS AT OAKLAND NORTH OVER THE EAST BAY HILLS AT
1100 FOOT ELEVATION. AT 7 PM THE WINDS WERE NORTHEAST 15 MPH WHEREAS
24 HOURS EARLIER IT WAS ONLY 3 MPH. SATELLITE PICTURES SHOW LOW
CLOUDS/FOG ALONG THE COAST NORTH OF POINT ARENA BUT THE LOW
CLOUDS/FOG ARE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING CLOSE TO THE OUR COAST.
WITH THE STRONGER OFFSHORE FLOW THIS EVENING...EXPECT MOST OF THE LOW
CLOUDS/FOG TO STAY OFFSHORE. THERE IS STILL A SLIGHT HINT OF A
SEABREEZE DOWN AT THE SURFACE AS THE COASTAL BUOYS IN OUR FORECAST
AREA HAVE NORTHWEST WINDS AND THE OAKLAND AND SALINAS ASOS HAVE
REPORTED LIGHT WESTERLY WINDS. AS A RESULT AREAS OF REDUCED
VISIBILITIES FROM LIGHT FOG WILL DEVELOP TONIGHT AND INTO CHRISTMAS
DAY. DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS ENOUGH MOISTURE AT THE SURFACE FOR
VISIBILITIES TO GO BELOW A COUPLE OF MILES.

STRONG UPPER LEVEL RIDGE CONTINUES OVER THE EASTERN PACIFIC. AN UPPER
LOW IS CENTERED OVER NORTHERN MEXICO WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH
EXTENDING FROM THE LOW OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. MODELS EXTEND THIS
TROUGH NORTHWARD LATER TONIGHT AND ON CHRISTMAS DAY. AS MENTIONED IN
THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...THIS KIND OF SYNOPTIC SITUATION IS RARE AND
THE EFFECTS ON THE WEATHER OVER THE DISTRICT IS UNCERTAIN. ONE
POSSIBILITY IS TO PROVIDE SOME LIFTING OF THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE
CREATING A MARINE LAYER IN WHICH SOME STRATUS MAY FORM. FOR NOW WILL
GO WITH JUST PATCHY FOG. MODELS FORECAST THIS UPPER LOW TO RETROGRADE
OVER THE WEEKEND. MODELS DIFFER BY THE POSITIONING OF THE UPPER LOW
IN 48 HOURS BUT THE AVN MODEL SEEMS THE BEST SOLUTION MOVING THE
UPPER LOW SLOWEST AND PLACING IT OVER ARIZONA. MID AND UPPER LEVEL
WINDS WILL GRADUALLY TURN TO THE NORTHEAST AND THIS WILL HELP TO KEEP
THE OFFSHORE FLOW GOING AT THE LOWER LEVELS INTO NEXT WEEK. NONE OF
THE MODELS SHOW ANY STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENTS AT ANYTIME IN THE LOWER
LEVELS SO WINDS OVER THE EAST BAY HILLS SHOULD REMAIN BELOW ADVISORY
CRITERIA. THE RIDGE WILL BE PUSHED NORTH AND THE 500 MB HEIGHTS WILL
LOWER OVER OUR DISTRICT SO TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON A SLIGHT COOLING
TREND THIS CHRISTMAS WEEKEND GETTING CLOSER TO THE NORMAL VALUES FOR
THIS TIME OF YEAR AFTER BEING WELL ABOVE NORMAL THE PAST FIVE DAYS. 

LONG RANGE MODELS EVENTUALLY BRING THE UPPER LOW INTO CENTRAL
CALIFORNIA BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK BUT THERE IS VERY LITTLE
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM SO IT WILL CONTINUE DRY WITH ONLY
SOME MID AND HIGH CLOUDS. BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK A SHORT WAVE BREAKS
DOWN THE RIDGE AND MOVES INTO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST BUT IT WILL STILL
BE TOO FAR NORTH TO BRING US ANY HOPE OF RAIN. AFTER THE SHORT WAVE
MOVES INLAND ANOTHER STRONG RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE EASTERN PACIFIC AND
WILL KEEP US DRY THROUGH THE NEW YEAR PERIOD. POPS ZERO. W PI

UP IN THE E BAY HILLS RAWS SITES AS YESTERDAYS STRONG NE WINDS HAVE

GRADIENT IS STILL STRONG OFFSHORE...12.7 MB AT 16Z...THE SFO-SAC
GRADIENT IS FLAT.  SO...EXPECT AN AFTN SEABREEZE NEAR THE OCEAN.  THE

FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE DAY...RECORD HIGH TEMPS WERE SET ACROSS 
MUCH OF THE REGION TODAY. A COUPLE OF WEATHER FACTORS NECESSARY FOR 
RECORD WARMTH AT THIS TIME OF YEAR WERE IN PLACE TODAY. ONE...LARGE 
SCALE SUBSIDENCE WARMING ALOFT PRODUCED BY A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGE WITH AXIS JUST TO OUR WEST. TWO...AT THE 
SURFACE...STRONG HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH AND EAST PROVIDED THE 
NECESSARY BRISK OFFSHORE WINDS IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE...HELPING TO 
MIX WARM AIR ALOFT TO THE SURFACE. THIS SYNOPTIC PATTERN WILL CHANGE 
ENOUGH OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS TO ALLOW FOR SOME COOLING. 
HOWEVER...THE PATTERN WILL HOLD WELL ENOUGH FOR MILD...DRY WEATHER 
TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK.

IN THE SHORT TERM...WITH THE LOWER TROPOSPHERIC OFFSHORE GRADIENT 
RELAXING NEAR THE COAST THIS EVENING...WINDS HAVE DECREASED AND ARE 
CURRENTLY LIGHT AND VARIABLE NEAR SEA LEVEL AND SUBSTANTIALLY WEAKER 
IN THE EAST BAY HILLS. CONSEQUENTLY...CURRENT TEMPS ARE RUNNING ANYWHERE 
FROM 5 TO 25 DEGREES BELOW WHERE THEY WERE THIS TIME YESTERDAY 
EVENING. MOST DRAMATIC COOLING IS IN THE VALLEYS OF THE N SFO BAY 
REGION. THEREFORE...EXPECT TEMPS TONIGHT TO FALL TO MORE SEASONAL 
LEVELS. ALSO...LIGHT WINDS AND COOLER TEMPS COULD RESULT IN SOME 
PATCHY VALLEY FOG LATER TONIGHT. WITH TEMPS STARTING OUT MUCH COOLER 
TOMORROW...AND WITH A WEAKER OFFSHORE GRADIENT AND LESS ROBUST LOW 
LEVEL MIXING...HIGH TEMPS TUESDAY WILL BE SOMEWHAT COOLER...LIKELY 
REMAINING IN THE 60S. IN ADDITION...A SHORTWAVE TROF ALOFT DROPPING 
FROM N TO S THRU THE GREAT BASIN WILL RESULT IN A SLIGHT DECREASE IN 
HEIGHTS AND TEMPS ALOFT AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE SLIGHT COOLING TREND. 
ALTHOUGH HEIGHTS ALOFT INCREASE A BIT AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY...EVEN 
LIGHTER LOW LEVEL FLOW SHOULD MEAN AN ADDITIONAL FEW DEGREES OF 
COOLING. 

DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD...ALL MEDIUM RANGE MODELS BUILD THE UPPER 
RIDGE TO OUR N...INTO THE PAC NW AND NRN ROCKIES...WHILE A WEAK

RECORD HIGHS WERE ALMOST COMMON AROUND THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AS 
DOWNSLOPE WINDS AND ADIABATIC HEATING DROVE TEMPERATURES INTO THE 
MID AND UPPER 70S. SOME OF THE AFTERNOONS HIGHS REPRESENTED ALL TIME 
HIGHS FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER.

NE WINDS AT 850 MB AND A 1035 MB HIGH PRESSURE CENTER NOW OVER 
WESTERN OREGON ARE CONTINUING THE WARM DOWNSLOPE TREND. AT 8PM 
TEMPERATURES WERE STILL RANGING FROM AS MUCH AS 77 DEGREES IN NAPA 
AND THE 70S IN SURROUNDING NORTHERN VALLEYS TO THE 60S IN THE SAN 
FRANCISCO BAY AREA. CERTAIN PROTECTED AREAS MONTEREY COUNTY AND SOUTH HAD 
REACHED THE UPPER 40S AS IS MORE TYPICAL OF THE SEASON HERE.

THESE WINDS WILL BE SLOW TO DIE DOWN AND WILL CONTINUE LONGEST IN 
THE NORTHERN COUNTIES OF OUR FORECAST AREA.  THE ETA MODEL FORECASTS 
850 MB WINDS TO DROP FROM 30 KT TO 15 KT BETWEEN 06-12Z TODAY AND 
THIS SHOULD ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO APPROACH THE COOLER MINIMUMS 
FORECAST...WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  WILL 
RAISE SOME FORECASTED TEMPERATURES TONIGHT.

MODELS ARE REASONABLY CONSISTENT.  ALL BUILD THE HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT 
NORTHWARD TO OFFSHORE OF OREGON...WHILE DIGGING COLDER AIR INTO THE 
MID SECTION OF THE UNITED STATES.  THIS COLDER AIR IN THE MOUNTAIN 
AND PLAINS STATES WILL RIDE BACK TO THE AREA ON THE SUBSIDING AIR 
AROUND THE HIGH FROM BRITISH COLUMBIA TO COLORADO. I BELIEVE THIS 
IS THE MAIN REASON THAT THICKNESS VALUES IN THE MODELS DROP SLOWLY 
THROUGH THE WEEK.  1000-500 MB THICKNESSES IN SAN FRANCISCO DROP 
FROM 5680M AT 00Z MON TO 5500M 00Z SUN AFTER CHRISTMAS.

A WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS NRN CA WILL MOVE THRU THE CENTRAL COAST
LATER THIS AM. SOME PATCHY DRIZZLE MAY ACCOMPANY ITS PASSAGE...BUT
OTHERWISE THE FRONT SHOULD BE DRY. THE INCREASED LOW CLOUDS SHOULD
BURN OFF BY AFTERNOON MOST AREAS...BUT WINDS WILL INCREASE OUT OF THE
N. NORMALLY THIS WOULD INDICATE COOLER WEATHER MOVING IN...BUT BOTH
UPPER LEVEL HEIGHTS AND THICKNESSES REMAIN HIGH. THEREFORE THIS PM
TEMPS WILL LIKELY BE ONLY A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN FRI...ALTHOUGH 
THE STRONGER WINDS MAY MAKE IT FEEL COLDER. THE ERN PACIFIC HIGH WILL
RIDGE WELL INLAND INTO THE PACNW ON SUN AND ALLOW TEMPS TO REBOUND
QUITE NICELY AS THE WINDS DIMINISH. ALL OF NEXT WEEK--INCLUDING THE
WEEKEND--SHOULD BE DRY AND MILD...WITH TEMPS IN THE 60S AND 70S. SOME

THE WEATHER PATTERN OVER OUR FORECAST AREA IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO
WHAT WE SAW 24 HOURS AGO.  THE FLAT SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT HAS
ALLOWED FOG TO FORM ON THE COAST N OF SANTA CRUZ...BUT IT HASNT MOVED
INLAND.  THE INCOMING FRONT HAS SPREAD LIGHT RAIN S TO ARCATA BUT IS
GETTING WEAKER AND WEAKER AS IT ATTEMPTS TO MOVE INTO OUR PREVAILING
RIDGE.  IT IS STRICTLY A LOW LEVEL PHENOMENON IN CA AND BELIEVE ITS
EFFECT ON OUR FORECAST AREA WILL BE SIMPLY TO GENERATE A WEAK MARINE
PUSH OVERNIGHT...POSSIBLY SENDING THE LOW CLOUDS A FEW MILES INLAND. 
BY MIDDAY SAT THE FRONT WILL BE GONE AND A STRONGER NW-SE GRADIENT
WILL DEVELOP AS WINDS ALOFT STRENGTHEN AND VEER FROM WNW TOWARD NLY.
THE MODELS BARELY COOL OUR REGION ON SAT...500 MB HEIGHTS AND
1000-500 MB THICKNESSES ARE FORECAST TO BE ABOUT THE SAME AS TDA. 
THE 1000-850 MB THICKNESS VALUES AND 850 MB TEMPS ARE FORECAST TO
DROP SLIGHTLY...BUT EXPECT MAXES TO COOL ONLY 2-4 DEGREES IN MOST
AREAS.  UPDATED ZONES TO INCREASE COASTAL FOG/LOW CLOUDS TNGT/SAT
MRNG...AND RAISED MONTEREY COUNTY MAXES TO FALL INTO THE ABOVE RANGE.

ALTHOUGH THE WEATHER HAS BEEN PLEASANT ENOUGH OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS
...IT WILL GET EVEN BETTER NEXT WEEK.  BY SUN 500 MB HEIGHTS AND 850
MB TEMPS ARE FORECAST TO BE EVEN HIGHER THAN TODAYS VALUES...AND A
STRONGER OFFSHORE FLOW WILL DEVELOP IN THE WAKE OF TNGTS SHORT WAVE. 
BRISK NE WINDS SHOULD KICK UP IN THE E BAY HILLS SAT NIGHT.  SUN AFTN
WE WILL SEE A N-NELY FLOW BOTH AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT...AND THE
ETA FORECASTS THE WMC-SFO GRADIENT TO INCREASE TO 14 MB OFFFSHORE... 
COMPARED TO 2 MB THIS AFTN.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW BETTER LOW LEVEL
MIXING AND RAISE MAX TEMPS ABOVE TODAYS MILD VALUES.  CURRENT ZONES
MAY NOT HAVE THEM HIGH ENOUGH AND MID SHIFT MAY WANT TO EDGE THEM UP
A FEW DEGREES.  WE MUST BE CAREFUL NOT TO WISHCAST IN A SITUATION
LIKE THIS...BUT IT SURE LOOKS LIKE CONDITIONS WILL DEVELOP ALONG
LINES SIMILAR TO DEC 16 LAST YEAR...WHEN MAXES REACHED THE 70S OVER
MOST OF OUR DISTRICT IN AN OFFSHORE PATTERN ONLY SLIGHTLY STRONGER
THAN THE ONE FORECAST FOR SUN.  

IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD THE MODELS CONTINUE WITH A VERY WARM RIDGE AND
A MODERATE TO STRONG OFFSHORE FLOW THRU AT LEAST WED.  CHRISTMAS WEEK
WILL SEE SOME NICE BEACH WEATHER IN OUR DISTRICT.  THE MRF NOW HOLDS
OUR RIDGE FIRMLY IN PLACE THRU BOXING DAY (DEC 26).

OFF THE NRN CA COAST ALL DAY...BUT THE EVENING FOG PRODUCT SATELLITE
PIX HINT AT THIS AREA EDGING FARTHER OFFSHORE THIS EVE...WHICH IS
LOGICAL CONSIDERING OUR WEAK OFFSHORE FLOW.  FOG SHOULD BE MINIMAL
AGAIN TNGT DUE TO A PAUCITY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE.

THE MAIN CHANGE IN THE LOCAL WEATHER TODAY WAS THE STRONG WARMING
ALOFT.  THIS SHOWED UP WELL ON THE OAKLAND EVENING RAOB...WHICH NOW
HAS A DISTINCT INVERSION TOPPED AT ABOUT 3000 FEET.  ABOVE THIS LEVEL
TEMPS WARMED 8-12 DEGREES F DURING THE PAST 24 HOURS.  IF WE COULD

A WHOLE IS FORECAST TO HEAT UP A LITTLE MORE.  HOWEVER...WITH THE
FLAT PRESSURE GRADIENTS AND THE WEAK SUN AS WE APPROACH THE WINTER
SOLSTICE...THE MIXING MAY BE HARD TO COME BY.  IF WE DONT GET THE
MIXING...HAZE WILL INCREASE UNDER THE INVERSION.  THE AFTERNOON
FORECAST WARMS MOST PLACES UP A FEW DEGREES THU/FRI AND WILL LET THAT
RIDE FOR NOW.  ONE SPOT TO WATCH FOR POSSIBLE GOOD WARMING BY FRI IS
THE AREA IN AND NEAR THE SALINAS VALLEY.  THE SURFACE PRESSURE
PATTERN IS FORECAST TO FAVOR A BRISK SELY DRAINAGE WIND DOWN THE

WARM INTO THE 70S IN THAT AREA.

UPDATING TEMPS ON THE SWING SHIFT IS NOT GOOD...BUT MID SHIFT MAY
WANT TO EDGE SOME MAXES UP A BIT AFTER LOOKING AT ALL THE NEW DATA.

DEGREES C AT 850 MB OVER SFO.  IF THAT AIR WERE TO MIX EVEN MOIST
ADIABATICALLY DOWN TO THE SURFACE THE MAX TEMPS COULD REACH 70...SO
THE POTENTIAL FOR WARMTH WILL BE THERE.  MOST SITES IN THE REGION
HAVE RECORD DAILY MAXES AROUND 70 OR A LITTLE HIGHER SO SUCH TEMPS
WOULD NOT BE UNPRECEDENTED.

IN THE LONGER RANGE THE EXISTING EXTENDED FORECAST IS DRY THRU SUN. 
THE UK AND CANADIAN MODELS CERTAINLY INDICATE THAT...BUT THE MRF
BRINGS AN INSIDE SLIDER SHORT WAVE INTO NRN CA FRI NIGHT WHICH COULD
BRING A FEW SHOWERS TO OUR COASTAL AREAS...SOMEWHAT LIKE THE SUNDAY

ALSO...WARMING ALOFT WILL RESULT IN A WEAK INVERSION. THUS...VALLEY 
FOG FORMATION IS MORE LIKELY IN THE NORTH AND EAST BAY VALLEYS TONIGHT.

WEDNESDAY SHOULD BE A WARMER DAY...PARTICULARLY NEAR THE COAST WHERE 
A WEAKER NOCTURNAL INVERSION WILL BREAK EARLIER THAN IN INLAND AREAS 
AND ALLOW SOME WARMER AIR ALOFT TO REACH THE SURFACE. LIGHT WINDS 
AND MORNING LOW LEVEL INVERSIONS WILL MEAN HAZY CONDITIONS ACROSS 
MUCH OF THE SFO BAY AREA WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY.

THE CURRENT MRF BRINGS A SHORTWAVE TROF OVER THE TOP OF OUR RIDGE ON 
FRIDAY AND THEN DIGS IT INTO UTAH ON SATURDAY...RESULTING IN COOLER 
AND BREEZY WEATHER ON SATURDAY FOR OUR DISTRICT. OTHER MEDIUM RANGE

FALLEN ALONG THE NORTHERN WASHINGTON COAST OVER THE PAST THREE HOURS
SHOWS VALUES OF ROUGHLY HALF OF THAT PROJECTED RAINFALL RATE. THIS

YESTERDAYS FAST MOVING SYSTEM HAS LEFT THE STATE WITH ITS
RESIDUAL EFFECTS LIMITED TO A FEW SHOWERS OVER THE TAHOE AREA AND
SOME CLOUDS OVER EXTREME SOUTHEASTERN CALIFORNIA. UNDER MOSTLY
CLEAR SKIES...TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE BAY AREA AND CENTRAL COAST
HAVE COOLED INTO THE 30S IN MANY AREAS WITH PRE-DAWN READINGS
EXPECTED TO DIP INTO THE MID 30S. SATELLITE FOG PRODUCT SHOWING
SOME FOG AND LOW CLOUDS LURKING ABOUT...THUS SOME PATCHY FOG MAY BE
POSSIBLE IN SOME VALLEY LOCATIONS THIS MORNING. LATER IN THE DAY...
SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO TIGHTEN ACROSS MOST OF
CALIFORNIA AS HIGH PRESSURE NOSES INTO SOUTHERN OREGON AND LOW
PRESSURE DIVES INTO THE DESERT SOUTHWEST. THIS WILL PRODUCE GUSTY
NORTHERLY WINDS STRONGEST IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA...BUT
ALSO GUSTY OVER THE EAST BAY HILLS AND ALONG THE COAST. THE GRADIENT
ACROSS THE WEST COAST LOOSENS BY SATURDAY AS THE LOW MOVES EASTWARD
INTO NEW MEXICO AND THE SURFACE HIGH HEADS INTO UTAH. THE NEXT
POSSIBLE RAIN PRODUCER FOR OUR AREA IS NOT DUE UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF
THE WEEK. MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT AS TO
TIMING OF THIS TROUGH WITH SOME VARIATIONS AS TO INTENSITY. THE ECMWF
AND THE NOGAPS FEATURE HIGHEST HEIGHTS OVER THE AREA ON MONDAY...WITH
THE MRF AND CANADIAN FEATURING A SOMEWHAT DEEPER TROUGH AND PRECIP
PROGGED AS FAR SOUTH AS THE BAY AREA. AS AN AMALGAMATION...WILL

THE TROUGH AXIS IS NOW MOVING THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CA AND
HEADING INTO THE SIERRA NEVADA. THE FRONT HAS MOVED WELL EAST OF
THE AREA INTO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN SIERRA NEVADA.
WHAT WE ARE LEFT WITH ARE SOME INSTABILITY SHOWERS IN THE COLD AIR

THE MAIN COLD POOL OF AIR IS MOVING ONTO THE NORTH COAST SO DO NOT
EXPECT ANY THUNDERSTORMS THIS FAR SOUTH. FREEZING LEVELS WERE NOT AS
LOW AS PREDICTED AND SNOW LEVELS APPEAR TO BE ABOVE 4500 FEET WHICH
IS ABOVE ANY OF THE BAY AREA PEAKS...BUT A BRIEF FLURRY IS STILL
POSSIBLE IN THE COLD SHOWERS THIS EVENING ON THE MOUNTAIN TOPS. A

SHOWERS AND INCREASE THE NORTHERLY FLOW. WINDS SHOULD START TO SWITCH
DIRECTION AND INCREASE FROM THE NORTH OVERNIGHT AS SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE PACNW AND GETS SUPPORT FROM AN UPPER LEVEL

SCENARIO WILL BE A BRIEF BURST OF HEAVY RAIN IN MOST AREAS...FOLLOWED
BY SHOWERS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...CONTINUING INTO THE EVENING
ESPECIALLY S OF SFO.  WINDS ARE JUST PICKING UP ALONG THE SONOMA
COAST...AND MOST AREAS WILL SEE A BRIEF PERIOD OF STRONG SE WINDS
JUST AHEAD OF THE FRONT...FOLLOWED BY A TENTATIVE SHIFT TO WLY...WITH
STRONGER NW WINDS SETTING IN DURING THE AFTERNOON AS SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE BUILDS IN AND A STRONG NWLY FLOW ALOFT BECOMES ESTABLISHED
OVER OUR REGION.  JUST GOT A SPOTTER REPORT OF SMALL HAIL IN
CLOVERDALE...IN NRN SONOMA COUNTY...AND WILL ADD IT TO THE NRN ZONES
FOR TDA.  NOT SURE ABOUT THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL...ETA FORECASTS
LIFTED INDEX VALUES TO STAY ABOVE PLUS 4 WHICH IS NOTHING SPECIAL. 
THE SATELLITE PIX DO NOT INDICATE ANY STRONG ENHANCEMENT IN POST
FRONTAL SHOWERS AT THIS TIME BUT WE WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON
THINGS...A VORTCENTER FORECAST TO DROP DOWN THE BACK SIDE OF THE
UPPER TROF TO AROUND SFO AT 00Z COULD STIR UP CONVECTION LATER TODAY.  

ALTHOUGH WE WILL SEE BRIEF HEAVY RAIN...GUSTY WIND...AND SMALL HAIL
OUT OF THIS SYSTEM...THE MOST SIGNIFICANT WEATHER COULD WIND UP BEING
HIGH WINDS IN THE E BAY HILLS FRI AFTN/NIGHT.  THE ETA AND AVN
FORECAST A STRONG...DEEP CYCLONIC NNELY FLOW TO DEVELOP DURING THAT
TIME FRAME...AN IDEAL SETUP FOR STRONG WINDS IN THE HILLS.  THIS MAY
EVENTUALLY REQUIRE SOME HIGHLIGHTS IN LATER FORECASTS...IT APPEARS
THAT GUSTS TO 60 MPH OR MORE ARE NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION FRI NIGHT.

AS A WEAK TEMPERATURE INVERSION HAS DEVELOPED CLOSE TO THE GROUND PER

SHOWER ACTIVITY SHOULD END. BRISK NORTHWEST WINDS HAVE DEVELOPED AS 
EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON AND WILL CONTINUE INTO EARLY EVENING.

HOWEVER...ONLY A FEW SHOWERS HAVE BEEN REPORTED.  THE MODELS DONT
FORECAST ANY SIGNIFNICANT DYNAMICS OVER OUR REGION...OMEGA STAYS N AS
DOES THE JET MAX.  WE MAY BE ABLE TO SQUEEZE A FEW MORE SHOWERS OUT
OF THE LOW STUFF FROM SFO N THIS MRNG AS THE NEXT BATCH OF MOISTURE

WEAK SHORTWAVE TROF MOVING INTO THE PAC NW THIS AFTERNOON IS 
SPREADING SIGNIFICANT CLOUD COVER OVER THE NRN HALF OF CA. 
HOWEVER...PRECIP HAS BEEN CONFINED TO THE FAR NORTH COAST. MORE 
SUBSTANTIAL SHORTWAVE SEEN ON SATELLITE NEAR 48N/135W IS MOVING 
QUICKLY EWD THIS AFTERNOON. MODELS GENERALLY IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
DROPPING THIS FEATURE SE TONIGHT WITH A MID-LEVEL VORTICITY CENTER 
JUST OFF THE OREGON/CA BORDER BY 12Z AND A 100 KT 300 MB NWLY JET 
CUTTING ACROSS NWRN CA BY 18Z. WITH GOOD UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT AND 
RELATIVELY MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE AHEAD OF IT...BELIEVE THERE IS AT 
LEAST A GOOD CHANCE OF PRECIP IN THE NRN PORTION OF OUR FORECAST 
AREA LATER TONIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING. SO HAVE BUMPED UP POPS A BIT 
AND INTRODUCED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AS FAR SOUTH AS SANTA CRUZ AND 
SANTA CLARA COUNTIES.

BOTH AVN AND ETA BRING IN SIGNIFICANT RH BELOW 500 MB TONIGHT AND 
LEAVE IT THERE THROUGH MUCH OF TUESDAY. THEREFORE DONT EXPECT MUCH 
CLEARING UNTIL AFTERNOON. LATER ON TUESDAY...A MODERATE NWLY SURFACE 
GRADIENT DEVELOPS ALONG WITH STRONG NWLY FLOW ALOFT...RESULTING IN 
BRISK NW WINDS AT THE SURFACE DURING THE AFTERNOON. STRONGEST WINDS 
LOOK TO BE ALONG COASTAL SECTIONS AND FURTHER SOUTH...WHERE SURFACE 
GRADIENT IS TIGHTEST. SKIES WILL CLEAR WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BUT BREEZY 
CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL LONG ENOUGH INTO THE EVENING TO PREVENT 
FOG FROM FORMING IN MOST AREAS. MOSTLY SUNNY WEATHER IS EXPECTED ON 
WEDNESDAY AS THE REGION IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF AN UPPER LEVEL 
SHORTWAVE RIDGE AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM. THIS NEXT SYSTEM IS 
FORECAST TO INITIALLY FOLLOW THE SAME PATH AS THE MON NIGHT/TUESDAY 
SYSTEM. HOWEVER...THIS ONE WILL DIG MUCH DEEPER ALONG THE COAST AND 
BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE ROBUST WITH SIGNIFICANT COLD AIR BEHIND IT. 
THE MRF/AVN HAS BEEN CONSISTENT WITH TIMING AND STRENGTH OF THIS ONE 
AND AM RELATIVELY CONFIDENT THAT BY LATE THURSDAY RAIN WILL HAVE 
SPREAD OVER MOST OF THE AREA. WITH 1000-500 MB THICKNESSES FORECAST 
TO DROP TO 534 DM OR LESS ACROSS THE AREA BY THURSDAY EVENING...ITS 
POSSIBLE WE MAY SEE A DUSTING OF SNOW ON BAY AREA PEAKS.

MRF...EURO AND NOGAPS DEVELOP A CUTOFF OVER SRN CA/ARIZONA THURSDAY

AREAS OF FOG AND LOW CLOUDS HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE SFO BAY AREA AS LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE HAS INCREASED AND LIGHT WINDS PREVAIL.  WITH A FAST
WLY FLOW DEVELOPING...AREAS OF CLOUDS WILL RACE ACROSS OUR REGION
TDA.  THE ETA AND AVN SHOW TWO IMPULSES MOVING INTO THE N BAY.  THE
FIRST COMES IN LATE THIS AFTN...WITH A WEAK OMEGA FIELD EXTENDING S
TO SFO ON THE AVN.  THE ETA SHOWS NO OMEGA THAT FAR S BUT DOES
CONTINUE TO INCREASE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...SO A FEW SHOWERS COULD FALL
N OF THE GOLDEN GATE THIS AFTN AND S THRU SFO THIS EVE.  THE SECOND
IMPULSE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAIN INCOMING SHORT WAVE...CURRENTLY
PASSING 48/148 ON THE WATER VAPOR LOOP.  THIS ONE IS TIMED TO MOVE
ASHORE AROUND 12Z TUE AND WILL BRING ANOTHER THREAT OF RAIN TO THE N
BAY LATER TNGT/TUE MRNG.  AGAIN THE AVN FORECASTS THE OMEGA FIELD
FARTHER S THAN THE ETA.  THE ETA NEVER FORECASTS RAIN AS FAR S AS OUR
AREA...BUT ITS HAD A STRONG NLY BIAS ON QPF LATELY.  BY TUE AFTN THE
MAIN SHORT WAVE WILL BE OUT OF OUR AREA TO THE SE AND WE WILL BE
UNDER A STRONG CYCLONIC NWLY FLOW FOR A COOL...BREEZY AFTERNOON.

THE NEXT SYSTEM CONTINUES TO BE MORE INTERESTING.  THE MRF...EURO...
AND NOGAPS AGREE THAT IT WILL BE STRONG...COLD...AND FAIRLY WET WHEN
IT SWOOPS INTO CA FROM THE NW WED NGT/THU.  THE NOGAPS IS QUITE A BIT
FASTER THAN THE MRF AND EURO THOUGH SIMILAR IN INTENSITY.  BY FRI
MRNG THESE MODELS ALL SET UP A STRONG...DEEP CUTOFF TO OUR SE WHICH
WOULD GIVE US A BRISK NELY OFFSHORE FLOW THAT DAY.  THESE CONDITIONS
MAY LAST THRU SAT...ESPECIALLY IF THE MRF OR NOGAPS VERIFY.  THE EURO
MOVES THE CUTOFF EWD FASTER THAN THE OTHER TWO MODELS.  

HOWEVER...ALL MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE NOT UNANIMOUS ON THIS STORM. 
THE CANADIAN CONTINUES TO BE THE WEAKEST BY FAR...FORECASTING A FAST
MOVING SHORT WAVE NO STRONGER THAN THE TUE SYSTEM.  THE UK IS ALSO
FASTER AND WEAKER THAN THE MRF/EURO/NOGAPS THOUGH NOT AS MUCH SO AS
THE CANADIAN.  WILL GO WITH THE EURO/MRF WHICH HAVE THE BEST TRACK
RECORDS IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD AND HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT HANDLING THIS
STORM.  THESE MODELS GIVE OUR REGION A MODERATE RAIN EVENT...MOSTLY
DURING THE DAY THU...WITH COLD...BLUSTERY CONDITIONS AND LOW SNOW
LEVELS.

JUST ON SPECULATION...THE 8-10 DAY MRF FINALLY SETS UP A TYPICAL
HARSH WINTER WEATHER PATTERN...WITH A STRONG ARCTIC HIGH OVER ALASKA/
NWRN CANADA...A DEEP 500 MB LOW IN THE GULF OF ALASKA...AND A LONG...
POTENTIALLY WET SWLY FETCH INTO CA AROUND THE S SIDE OF THE LOW. 
TOMORROWS RUN COULD HAVE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BUT ITS WORTH

CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING A BEAUTIFUL LATE AUTUMN DAY WITH PLENTY 
OF SUNSHINE...LIGHT WINDS AND MILD TEMPERATURES. SOME HIGH CLOUDS 
PRECEDING THE OFFSHORE WEATHER SYSTEM ARE BEGINNING TO MOVE ACROSS 
NORTHERN CA THIS AFTERNOON. SATELLITE SHOWS THIS SYSTEM CONTINUES 
TO WEAKEN AS IT APPROACHES THE COAST. SYSTEM IS LOSING ITS 
BAROCLINICITY AS COLD AIR BEHIND FRONT MODIFIES. ALSO...AVN SHOWS 
SYSTEM SPLITS AND BECOMES MORE DISORGANIZED WITH TIME. FRONT COULD HOLD 
TOGETHER LONG ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS FROM SAN 
FRANCISCO NORTHWARD LATER TONIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING. MODELS RAPIDLY 
DIMINISH QPF AS THE FRONT MOVES INLAND SUNDAY MORNING...SO IF THERE 
IS ANY MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION IN OUR AREA...IT WILL MOST LIKELY BE 
NEAR THE COAST IN SONOMA COUNTY. SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS FORECAST 
TO STICK AROUND THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE DISTRICT THROUGH MIDDAY 
SUNDAY...BUT WITH TROF AXIS PASSING INLAND BY NOON...CLEARING SHOULD 
OCCUR IN MOST AREAS DURING THE AFTERNOON. UPPER RIDGE OVER THE 
REGION SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY WILL BE RATHER FLAT AND DIRTY AND 
QUITE A BIT OF HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS IS EXPECTED. 

A FAST MOVING SHORTWAVE TROF WILL DROP OUT OF THE GULF OF ALASKA AND 
INTO THE PAC NW MONDAY NIGHT/TUESDAY MORNING. IT APPEARS THIS SYSTEM 
WILL BE A LITTLE MORE ORGANIZED. HOWEVER...CONSIDERING ITS MAIN 
ENERGY WILL BE FOCUSED WELL TO OUR N...CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTHERN 
PORTION OF OUR DISTRICT IS SUFFICIENT. TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY LOOKS DRY. THEN...BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY...THE MEDIUM 
RANGE MODELS BRING A MORE IMPRESSIVE SYSTEM INTO OUR DISTRICT...ONE 
THAT COULD PRODUCE RAINFALL OVER THE ENTIRE AREA BY THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON. MODELS VARY QUITE A BIT ON INTENSITY AND TIMING OF THIS 
MIDWEEK SYSTEM. CONSIDERING THIS IS OUT AT DAY FIVE...WILL KEEP

ITS A QUIET MORNING ACROSS OUR REGION.  WINDS HAVE DIED DOWN EXCEPT
FOR A FEW GUSTS IN AND NEAR THE HILLS...BUT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS
SPARSE AND LITTLE OR NO FOG WILL DEVELOP.  AS OF 2 AM NONE HAD SHOWN
UP ON THE OBS OR THE SATELLITE PIX.  SUNSHINE WILL BE ABUNDANT TDA
WITH TEMPS ABOUT THE SAME AS YESTERDAY.  

THE NEXT SYSTEM IS APPROACHING 140W.  ITS WELL DEFINED ON THE WATER
VAPOR PIX BUT IS STILL EXPECTED TO LOSE STRENGTH AS IT APPROACHES THE
COAST.  THE MODELS ARE IN CLOSER AGREEMENT WITH IT NOW...THE AVN IS
SPLITTING IT MUCH LESS THAN ON THAT MODELS 2 PREVIOUS RUNS.  THE AVN
BRINGS THE TROF AXIS THRU SFO AROUND 18Z SUN.  THE ETA IS ABOUT 3
HOURS SLOWER.  BOTH MODELS SUGGEST THAT ANY WEAK DYNAMICS WITH THE
SYSTEM...INCLUDING OMEGA AND THICKNESS DIFFLUENCE...WILL DEVELOP TNGT
AND BE OVER BY MIDDAY SUN.  THUS WILL PUT A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS
IN THE N BAY AND S DOWN THE SAN MATEO COAST LATE SAT NIGHT AND SUN
MRNG...WITH DRYING AFTER THAT.  THERE WILL ALSO BE A RIGHT REAR JET
QUAD MOVING THRU OUR FORECAST AREA EARLY SUN MRNG.  MOISTURE...EVEN
AT LOW LEVELS...IS FORECAST TO BE SPARSE WITH THIS SYSTEM BY THE TIME
IT GETS HERE...ESPECIALLY S OF SFO.  

IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...MON WILL BE A DRY DAY...THOUGH WITH A
DIFFLUENT ANTICYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT OVER A FLAT RIDGE...THE RIDGE COULD
BE QUITE DIRTY WITH A LOT OF MID/HIGH CLOUDS.  THE MODELS CONTINUE TO
DIVERGE AFTER THAT.  THE NOGAPS...UK...AND MRF BRING AN INSIDE SLIDER
THRU OUR REGION MON NGT/TUE MRNG THAT WOULD GIVE A CHANCE OF RAIN TO
MOST OF OUR REGION...MUCH LIKE SEVERAL RECENT SYSTEMS OF THIS TYPE. 
THE EURO/CANADIAN FORECAST A MUCH WEAKER SYSTEM THAT WOULD GIVE US
NO RAIN THREAT.  FOR NOW WILL FORECAST SOME CHANCE OF RAIN S TO SJC
ON TUE BUT LOW POPS...A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE WET AND DRY MODELS.

THE MODELS TAKE SIMILARLY DIVERGENT PATHS WITH A POTENTIALLY STRONGER
SYSTEM DUE IN JUST PAST THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WED NGT/THU.  AGAIN THE
EURO AND CANADIAN ARE WEAKEST AND FASTEST...WHILE THE UK...MRF...AND
NOGAPS FORECAST A MUCH STRONGER SYSTEM THAT WOULD BRING US A DECENT

WINDS IN MANY PLACES.  SURFACE GRADIENTS ARE NOT TOO STRONG...E.G.
4.6 MB ACV-SFO AT 1 PM...SO WINDS ARE MOSTLY IN THE 15-25 MPH RANGE. 
THE WINDS WILL DIMINISH TNGT AS THE SURFACE HIGH MOVES FROM THE
PACIFIC NW SEWD INTO THE GREAT BASIN...BUT DEWPOINTS ARE LOW AND THE
GROUND IS FAIRLY DRY SO DOUBT WE WILL SEE MUCH FOG...A FEW PATCHES
MIGHT DEVELOP IN THE DELTA AND AROUND SANTA ROSA BUT THATS ABOUT ALL.

FORECAST TO STAY ABOUT THE SAME ON SAT BUT WITH LESS SURFACE MIXING 
...MAXES WILL PROBABLY DROP A COUPLE DEGREES.  WE WILL STAY MOSTLY
SUNNY UNDER THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE TOMORROW.

THE NEXT SYSTEM DUE IN ON SUN IS STILL FAR OFFSHORE...JUST PASSING
150W ACCORDING TO THE WATER VAPOR PIX.  THE MODELS CONTINUE TO OFFER
DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS FOR THIS SYSTEM.  THE NEW AVN RUN SPLITS IT
SHARPLY...EVEN MORE SO THAN LAST NIGHTS MRF.  WITH THIS SOLUTION THE
SYSTEM WOULD FIZZLE OUT BEFORE REACHING THE COAST.  THE NGM FORECASTS
MUCH LESS SPLIT...AND THE ETA KEEPS THE TROF INTACT THRU 12Z SUN AS
IT APPROACHES SHORE AND WOULD PROBABLY GIVE AT LEAST THE N BAY SOME
LIGHT RAIN ON SUN.  OTHER MODELS ARE SIMILARLY AT ODDS.  GIVEN THE
MODEL UNCERTAINTIES...AND THE FACT THAT IT WILL BE A WEAK SYSTEM IN
ANY CASE...WILL THROW A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN N OF SAN JOSE ON
SUN AND WAIT FOR BETTER MODEL AGREEMENT.  

AS MENTIONED THIS MRNG...AN INSIDE SLIDER IS STILL ON TRACK TO MOVE
THRU OUR REGION ON TUE AND IT COULD BRING A FEW SHOWERS TO MOST OF

MODEL RUNS.  IN CONTRAST TO EARLIER 12Z MODEL FORECASTS AND 00Z
FORECAST FROM AVN...PRECIP THIS EVENING HAS THUS FAR BEEN CONFINED TO
THE VERY FAR NORTH COAST OF CALIFORNIA.  THIS CAN GET TRICKY AS
NARROW PRECIP BAND CAN EXTEND SIGNIFICANTLY FARTHER SOUTH THAN MODELS
INDICATE DUE TO MODEL HORIZONTAL RESOLUTION LIMITATIONS.  A GOOD
EXAMPLE OF THIS IN FACT WAS PROVIDED BY THE SYSTEM THAT CAME THROUGH

DIFFERENT FROM EARLIER AVN AND MRF RUNS AND NOW SUGGESTS HIGH

A TROUGH MOVED RAPIDLY THROUGH CENTRAL CA OVERNIGHT AND IS LOCATED
OVER NEVADA AT THIS TIME. THE WEAK COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
SYSTEM BROUGHT RAIN TO THE BAY AREA AND CENTRAL COAST. RAINFALL
TOTALS WERE GENERALLY LIGHT AND RANGED FROM 1/2 INCH IN THE NORTH
BAY MOUNTAINS TO LESS THAN 1/10 INCH IN MONTEREY COUNTY. THE FRONT
HAS NOW MOVED WELL EAST...BUT A FEW BANDS OF LIGHT SHOWERS ARE STILL
MOVING THROUGH THE AREA THIS MORNING. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD
OVER CA TODAY AND AS THE FLOW BECOMES NORTHWESTERLY THE SHOWERS WILL
END THIS MORNING AND SKIES WILL BE CLEARING THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THE
NEXT IN THE SERIES OF STORMS IS CURRENTLY LOCATED OFF THE PACNW
COAST. THE ETA MODEL HAS BEEN UNDER-FORECASTING THE SOUTHERN EXTENT
OF RAIN THE LAST FEW DAYS AND THE AVN IS AGAIN THE PREFERRED MODEL.
IT APPEARS THIS SYSTEM WILL STAY FURTHER NORTH THAN PREVIOUS FEW
SYSTEMS...SO RAIN LIKELY IN THE NORTH BAY ON THURSDAY WITH THE CHANCE
OF RAIN DROPPING OFF DRAMATICALLY TO THE SOUTH. THIS TROUGH IS
FORECAST TO MOVE THROUGH CENTRAL CA DURING THE DAY THURSDAY...BUT
THIS WILL BE THE LAST SHOT OF RAIN FOR AWHILE. ALL MEDIUM RANGE
MODELS BASICALLY AGREE ON BUILDING A FAIRLY STRONG RIDGE OVER CA ON
FRIDAY WHICH LASTS BEYOND THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

THE LONG AWAITED COLD FRONT IS NOW MOVING THROUGH CENTRAL CA. AT 11Z
IT WAS LOCATED ALONG A LINE FROM OROVILLE-FAIRFIELD-MOUNTAIN VIEW-
SANTA CRUZ AND MOVING EASTWARD. RAIN HAS FALLEN THROUGHOUT THE BAY
AREA AND CENTRAL COAST WITH THIS FRONT...BUT RAINFALL TOTALS HAVE
NOT BEEN THAT SIGNIFICANT. THE MOUNTAINS OF SONOMA COUNTY HAVE
RECEIVED AROUND 1 1/2 INCHES WITH THE LOWER ELEVATIONS OF THE BAY
AREA RECEIVING 1/4 TO 3/4 INCHES WITH LESS THAN 1/4 OF AN INCH DOWN
TO MONTEREY COUNTY. THE RAIN HAS ENDED IN THE NORTH BAY AND PENINSULA
AND WILL END IN THE EAST BAY AND MONTEREY BAY AREAS IN THE NEXT HOUR
OR SO. A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS ARE STILL POSSIBLE THIS MORNING BUT
MOST OF THE AVAILABLE COLD AIR HAS BEEN ENTRAINED INTO THE NEXT
SYSTEM. THE NEXT SYSTEM IS JUST PASSING 130W AND MOVING RAPIDLY
TOWARD THE COAST HELPED ALONG BY A STRONG UPPER LEVEL JET. THIS
SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH CENTRAL CA THIS AFTERNOON AND WILL
BRING ANOTHER SHOT OF RAIN TO THE BAY AREA NORTHWARD WITH SHOWERS TO
THE SOUTH. PREFER THE FASTER AVN MODEL AS ITS CURRENT MOVEMENT OF
THIS SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE MORE ACCURATE THAN THE ETA. THIS SYSTEM IS
FORECAST TO MOVE THROUGH RAPIDLY TONIGHT ALLOWING A RIDGE TO BUILD
OVER THE STATE ON WEDNESDAY. THEN ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES
THROUGH THE NORTH ON THURSDAY. THIS SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE WEAKER AND
MORE NORTH AND EAST SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN NORTH BAY
WITH MUCH LOWER POPS TO THE SOUTH. BEYOND THURSDAY...MODELS BUILD A

NOT MUCH OF A STORM FOR OUR FORECAST AREA.  FAIRLY HEAVY RAIN HAS
FALLEN TO THE N...1-2 INCHES AT MOST SPOTS N OF PT ARENA...BUT IN OUR
REGION ONLY VENADO IN NWRN SONOMA COUNTY HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT RAIN...A
LITTLE LESS THAN AN INCH.  AS OF 8 PM THE RAIN WAS FINALLY PICKING UP
IN THE REST OF THE N BAY WITH HEAVY RAIN REPORTED IN SANTA ROSA...BUT
THE RAIN HAD JUST STARTED TO SPREAD INTO SAN FRANCISCO AND WAS MAKING
ONLY SLOW PROGRESS.  ACCORDING TO THE MODELS OUR AREA SHOULD BE IN
THE RIGHT REAR QUAD OF THE JET NOW AND SATELLITE PIX DO SHOW SOME
CLOUD ENHANCEMENT...BUT RAIN WAS VERY PATCHY UNDER THE ENHANCED AREAS
AND APPEARED TO BE FALLING MAINLY NEAR THE BACK OF THE FRONTAL BAND. 
THUS...ANY HEAVY RAIN THAT DOES FALL IN OUR FORECAST AREA WILL BE
BRIEF.  ITS STILL PROBABLE THAT SOME RAIN WILL FALL OVER AREAS FROM
MRY BAY N TNGT AS THE BACK EDGE OF THE FRONTAL BAND MOVES THRU...BUT
AMOUNTS WILL BE MOSTLY LIGHT S OF THE GOLDEN GATE.  

THE UPSTREAM TROF ACTING AS A KICKER...PASSING 43/138...APPEARS TO BE
COLLECTING ALL THE COLD AIR IN THE VICINITY.  CELLULAR CLOUDS ARE 
DISAPPEARING BETWEEN THIS SYSTEM AND OUR INCOMING FRONTAL BAND...AND
THERE WILL BE VIRTUALLY NO RESIDUAL SHOWERS AFTER TNGTS BAND PASSES
THRU.  MOST AREAS SHOULD SEE SOME SUN ON TUE THRU MIDDAY.  THE KICKER
IS GETTING BETTER ORGANIZED WITH TIME AND IS BEING ENHANCED BY A
STRONG NWLY JET ROUNDING THE BOTTOM OF THE TROF.  THE ETA FORECASTS
THE JET ACTION TO WEAKEN AS THE KICKER APPROACHES THE COAST AROUND
MIDDAY TUE...BUT THE MODEL FORECASTS RATHER STRONG THICKNESS
DIFFLUENCE TO CONTINUE AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM.  THERE IS ALSO A GOOD
POOL OF COLD AIR WITH IT AS SHOWN BY THE IR AND WATER VAPOR SATELLITE
PIX.  

THIS SYSTEM WILL ALSO BE TRICKY WITH RESPECT TO BOTH TIMING AND SWD
EXTENT OF PRECIP.  THE ETA NOW FORECASTS IT TO SPREAD RAIN ONLY INTO
THE N BAY BEFORE 00Z WED...AND FORECASTS NO RAIN AT ALL S OF SANTA
CRUZ.  PAST EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THESE COLD SYSTEMS MOVING IN
FROM THE NW ARE OFTEN DECEPTIVELY STRONG AND DROP RAIN FARTHER S THAN
ANTICIPATED.  WILL BUY THE SLOWER TIMING OF THE MODEL AND DELAY THE
ONSET OF RAIN FROM THE TUE SYSTEM...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO BRING LIKELY
SHOWERS AT LEAST AS FAR S AS MONTEREY TUE NIGHT.  THE ETA FORECASTS
GOOD POSTFRONTAL LOW LEVEL MOISTURE OVER OUR ENTIRE COAST LATE TUE
NIGHT...AND THE MOIST NWLY LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL BE CONDUCIVE TO
SENDING SHOWERS INTO MONTEREY BAY.  WOULDNT BE SURPRISED TO SEE MANY
AREAS S OF SFO GET MORE RAIN FROM THE TUE SYSTEM THAN FROM TONIGHTS. 
HOWEVER...SRN MONTEREY COUNTY APPEARS TO BE OUT OF THE MIX EXCEPT FOR
POSSIBLY A FEW LATE NIGHT/EARLY MRNG SHOWERS FROM EACH SYSTEM.  

GOING ON...SIMILAR DOUBTS EXIST CONCERNING THE NEXT SHORT WAVE.  THIS
ONE IS FORECAST IN ON THU...PROBABLY IN THE PM.  THE EURO MODEL IS
WEAKER...THUS DRIER...THAN THE MRF...WHICH IS WEAKER THAN THE UK AND
CANADIAN MODELS.  THE CURRENT FORECAST HAS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN
DOWN TO SAN MATEO COUNTY AND WOULD BE A LITTLE DRY IF THE WETTER

PROCESSING OF 12Z ETA MODEL IS BEHIND SCHEDULE THIS MORNING SO WILL 
RELY MOSTLY ON SATELLITE/RADAR DATA FOR SHORT TERM FORECASTING.  
ALTHOUGH STRONG WARM ADVECTION IS OCCURRING AHEAD OF THE OFFSHORE 
SYSTEM...MOIST LAYER IS NOT DEEP ENOUGH TO PRODUCE PRECIPITATION IN

THOUGH PRECIP WILL MOSTLY HOLD OFF UNTIL UPPER TROF MOVES CLOSER TO

EDGE OF THIS FRONTAL BAND IS STILL OVER A HUNDRED MILES OFF THE 
SONOMA COUNTY COAST. SOME LIGHT WARM ADVECTION PRECIP IS POSSIBLE 
ACROSS THE NORTH BAY COUNTIES THIS MORNING...BUT MAIN RAIN BAND 
LOOKS AS THOUGH IT WONT ARRIVE IN THE NORTH BAY AREA UNTIL AROUND 
MIDDAY...THE SOUTH BAY UNTIL LATE AFTERNOON...AND THE MONTEREY AREA

THE MODELS QPF FORECAST GENERALLY FOLLOWS THE OMEGA FIELD.  THE AREA
FROM MONTEREY S NEVER DOES GET MUCH OMEGA OR QPF ON THE NEW ETA...AND
THE PRECIP THERE IS DELAYED TIL MON EVE ON THE NEW AVN.  AS A RESULT
WILL UPDATE THE ZONES FROM SFO S TO DELAY THE RAIN A LITTLE.  THE N

TAPER OFF MARKEDLY TO THE S WITH LITTLE OR NO RAIN S OF BIG SUR.

THE TRAILING SYSTEM WAS LOCATED NEAR 54/131 AT 04Z...ABOUT AS TIMED
BY THE 12Z AVN RUN.  THIS SYSTEM WILL KICK THE LEAD TROF INLAND ON

S TO SANTA CRUZ BY 00Z WED.  EVENTUALLY RAIN WILL FALL OVER ALL OF

OF SFO WILL PROBABLY OCCUR TUE NIGHT WHICH IS BROKEN OUT IN THE

INDICATE EVENTS WILL UNFOLD RATHER SLOWLY THE NEXT TWO DAYS.  THE TUE
SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY FORECAST TO SOAK THE N BAY MUCH MORE THAN OTHER
PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT THESE SYSTEMS SWOOPING DOWN FROM THE
NW OFTEN SPREAD GOOD RAIN MUCH FARTHER S THAN THE MODELS INDICATE...

BROAD SWATH OF HIGH CLOUDS OVER OUR DISTRICT TODAY ALONG WITH LIGHT 
AND VARIABLE WINDS IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE COMBINED TO KEEP LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE FROM MIXING OUT ACROSS MOST OF THE BAY AREA TODAY. 
THE RESULT WAS A COOL DAY WITH LOTS OF CLOUDS AND SOME FOG AND HAZE. 
SOUTHERLY FLOW AHEAD OF ADVANCING SYSTEM LIKELY WONT BE STRONG 
ENOUGH EARLY ENOUGH TONIGHT TO SCOUR OUT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SO 
EXPECT FOG FOR MUCH OF THE NIGHT. HOWEVER...MID AND HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDS WILL PREVENT FOG FROM GETTING VERY THICK.

OFFSHORE SYSTEM CONTINUES TO DIG AND UPPER TROF AXIS IS NOW 
APPROACHING 140W. UPPER FLOW PATTERN IS BECOMING MORE MERIDIONAL AND 
SO EXPECT EWD PROGRESSION OF SYSTEM TO BE RATHER SLOW...LIKELY 
SLOWER THAN THE MODELS PREDICT. CURRENTLY...TROF POSITION IS FURTHER 
W THAN AVN FORECAST. ETA/AVN AND NOGAPS ALL PRODUCE STRONG WARM 
ADVECTION OVER OUR AREA TONIGHT...PARTICULARLY IN THE N...AND SOME 
LIGHT RAIN IS POSSIBLE AS A RESULT. WARM ADVECTION IS 
ENHANCED...ALONG WITH OROGRAPHICS...ON MONDAY AS COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES COAST. MODELS SHOW A 40 KT 850 MB SLY FLOW IN THE N SFO 
BAY AREA BY 18Z MONDAY. ALSO AT 18Z...THE SURFACE GRADIENT FROM SFO 
TO ACV IS AROUND 8 MB. GUSTY SOUTHERLY WINDS ARE EXPECTED BY 
MIDDAY...BUT PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH TO WARRANT A WIND ADVISORY. COLD 
FRONT IS FORECAST TO PUSH INTO THE BAY AREA ON MONDAY AFTERNOON. 
THIS IS LIKELY A BIT FAST AND PROBABLY WONT SEE FRONTAL PASSAGE 
UNTIL SOMETIME DURING THE EVENING. RAIN COULD BE HEAVY AT TIMES FROM 
MID AFTERNOON THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS...ESPECIALLY IN THE N BAY 
WHERE OMEGA VALUES ARE HIGHEST.

THE INITIAL UPPER WAVE IS FORECAST TO MOVE INLAND OVERNIGHT MONDAY 
NIGHT AND RAIN WILL CHANGE TO SHOWERS AND TAPER OFF BY TUESDAY 
MORNING. THEN...THE NEXT WAVE BRINGS A SECONDARY SHOT OF RAIN IN 
TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND TUESDAY NIGHT. THIS SECOND RAIN EVENT WILL 
MOVE MORE QUICKLY AND HAVE LESS MOISTURE TO WORK WITH SO QPF VALUES 
WILL BE LIGHTER.

A WEAK UPPER RIDGE BUILDS ON WEDNESDAY...BUT BY THURSDAY BOTH THE 
MRF AND NOGAPS DRIVE A SYSTEM THROUGH THE PAC NW...FLATTEN THE 
RIDGE...AND BRING A CHANCE OF RAIN TO THE NRN PART OF OUR DISTRICT. 
THE RIDGE IS FORECAST TO REBUILD FRIDAY. FRIDAY LOOKS LIKE THE BEST 
CHANCE WE HAVE THIS WEEK FOR DRY WEATHER ACROSS OUR ENTIRE DISTRICT.

THERE IS A MIX OF HIGH AND LOW CLOUDS THIS MORNING ACROSS THE 
DISTRICT WITH LIGHT FOG IN MANY AREAS. ACCORDING TO THE 12Z OAK 
SOUNDING AND PILOT REPORTS...THE LOW CLOUD DECK IS MUCH THINNER THIS 
MORNING (1000 FEET THICK OR LESS) COMPARED TO YESTERDAY MORNING. 
GIVEN THAT...WOULD EXPECT EARLIER CLEARING OF LOW CLOUDS TODAY. 
HOWEVER...MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS STREAMING OVER THE AREA FROM THE 
SW WILL LIMIT SOLAR HEATING AND DELAY CLEARING OF LOW CLOUDS. IN 
ADDITION...WINDS ARE LIGHT IN THE LOWEST 3 THOUSAND FEET WHICH MEANS 
VERY LITTLE MIXING OF WARMER/DRIER AIR ALOFT INTO THE MARINE LAYER. 
SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL INCREASE ALOFT LATE TODAY AHEAD OF APPROACHING 
SYSTEM...BUT NOT IN TIME TO HELP WARM TEMPS TODAY. SO...TEMPS LOOK 
AS THOUGH THEY SHOULD BE SIMILAR TODAY COMPARED TO SATURDAY WITH 
PERHAPS A FEW DEGREES OF WARMING WHERE THE SUN DOES MAKE A BRIEF 
APPEARANCE THIS AFTERNOON. WARMING WILL BE HARD TO COME BY NEAR THE 
SAN PABLO AND N SFO BAYS...WHERE A WEAK DRAINAGE WIND OUT OF THE

A RIDGE LIES OVER CA THIS AFTERNOON WHICH IS KEEPING THE MOIST ZONAL
FLOW OVER EXTREME NORTHERN CA AND INTO THE PACNW. BUT THIS RIDGE IS
DIRTY SO HIGH CLOUDS HAVE BEEN MOVING SOUTHWARD OVER CENTRAL CA
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. MODELS PREDICTED WARMING ALOFT TODAY BUT IF THIS
OCCURRED IT HAS NOT TRANSLATED DOWN TO THE SURFACE. TEMPERATURES
HAVE REMAINED FAIRLY COOL WITH HIGHS TODAY BARELY MAKING IT OUT OF
THE 50S. WITH DEW POINTS IN THE 40S EXPECT SOME VALLEY FOG TO FORM
LATE TONIGHT...BUT WITH LIMITED GROUND MOISTURE AND THE HIGH CLOUDS
IT SHOULD ONLY BE PATCHY. THE RIDGE OVER CA WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS WHICH WILL KEEP THE RAIN WELL TO THE NORTH
AND DAYTIME TEMPERATURES MAY EVEN WARM A FEW DEGREES. SKIES WILL BE
CLEAR EXCEPT FOR THE OCCASIONAL HIGH CLOUDS AND TEMPERATURES WILL BE
COOL BUT NEAR NORMAL. SO A PLEASANT HOLIDAY WEEKEND IN STORE. FOR
LATE IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD MEDIUM RANGE MODELS START TO DIVERGE.
MRF/ECMWF DEVELOP A DEEP TROUGH OFF THE WEST COAST OVER THE WEEKEND
AND THEN MOVE THE TROUGH EASTWARD THROUGH CA ON MONDAY. OLD NOGAPS
HAS THIS TROUGH WEAKER AND FASTER...BUT QUICK LOOK AT THE NEW RUN
SEEMS TO BE MORE IN LINE WITH THE MRF/ECMWF. PREFER THE SLOWER...

A QUIET WEATHER PERIOD IS IN STORE FOR OUR FORECAST AREA AS WE WILL
BE SNUG UNDER A RIDGE WHILE STORMS ROAR ONSHORE FAR TO THE N.  SOME
HIGH CLOUDS WILL MOVE IN FROM TIME TO TIME...ESPECIALLY IN THE N BAY 
...BUT THATS ALL FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS.  THE MAIN QUESTION IS HOW
MUCH WARMING WE WILL SEE.  THE ETA/AVN RAISE 850 MB TEMPS ABOUT 5
DEGREES C OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS WHICH WOULD TRANSLATE INTO 8-10
DEGREES F WARMER MAXES...BUT WITH THE WEAK LATE NOVEMBER SUN AND
WINDS TOO LIGHT TO GENERATE GOOD MIXING MOST PLACES WILL PROBABLY SEE
ONLY ABOUT HALF THAT WARMING AT THE SURFACE.  SOME COASTAL SPOTS
COULD HEAT UP MORE...WELL HAVE A BETTER IDEA ON THAT AFTER WE SEE
WHAT HAPPENS TDA.  FOR NOW WILL WARM MAXES UP A COUPLE DEGREES EACH
DAY WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS BY THU.  THERE WILL PROBABLY BE SOME
PATCHY FOG IN THE INTERIOR VALLEYS BUT THE GROUND IS TOO DRY TO
GENERATE A LOT.

OUR REGION WILL REMAIN BENIGN THRU THE REST OF THE WEEK AS WELL.  ALL
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS LOWER THE 500 MB HEIGHTS ON FRI/SAT AND WE SHOULD
SEE MORE CLOUDINESS AND SLIGHTLY COOLER MAX TEMPS THOSE DAYS...BUT IT
DOESNT APPEAR ANY SIGNIFICANT RAIN WILL SPREAD THIS FAR S.  THE N BAY
COULD GET A FEW SPRINKLES AND THATS ALL.  THE MODELS BEGIN TO DIVERGE
ON SUN.  THE MRF/EURO/UK DIG A DEEP TROF BETWEEN 130/140W THAT DAY...
BACKING THE FLOW OVER CA TO SWLY.  THIS WOULD KEEP OUR REGION DRY ON
SUN AS WELL.  THE CANADIAN AND ESPECIALLY THE NOGAPS HAVE A MORE
PROGRESSIVE PATTERN AND FORECAST THE TROF TO MOVE MORE RAPIDLY EWD
WITH LOWER AMPLITUDE.  WILL GO WITH THE MAJORITY SOLUTION...IT WAS
ADVERTISED ON THE PREVIOUS TWO RUNS OF THE MRF SO GOOD CONTINUITY HAS
DEVELOPED ON THAT MODEL.  BEYOND THE EXTENDED PERIOD THINGS COULD GET
INTERESTING AS THE MRF BRINGS THE TROF ASHORE FULL BLAST ON MON WITH
A GOOD RAIN FOR US...FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER HEFTY SHOT OF MOISTURE ON

DEGREES F HIGHER THAN LAST EVENING. CONSEQUENTLY...OVERNIGHT LOWS 
ARE NOT EXPECTED TO DIP TO LAST NIGHTS CHILLY LEVELS. SOME HIGH 
CLOUDS MOVING INTO CENTRAL CA WILL ALSO HELP HOLD UP TEMPS A

FORMING LATER TONIGHT. THE TEMP/DEWPOINT SPREAD IS CURRENTLY ONLY 1

STRONG WARM ADVECTION AND STEADY RAINS WILL DEVELOP OVER THE PAC NW

NIGHT...THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS FORECAST TO SAG S INTO NRN CA AND 
THE AVN AND CANADIAN MODELS DROP SOME LIGHT PRECIP ACROSS THE

REMAIN QUITE HIGH OVER THE AREA (ABOUT 576 DM) INTO FRIDAY MORNING 
SO AM RELUCTANT TO INTRODUCE A CHANCE OF PRECIP AND WILL MENTION 
ONLY VARIABLE CLOUDS IN THE N BAY THAT DAY. 

BY SATURDAY...MOST MEDIUM RANGE MODELS BEGIN TO DIG A LONGWAVE TROF 
OUT AT ABOUT 140-150W. AS THIS TROF DIGS OVER THE ERN PACIFIC...HEIGHTS 
RISE OVER THE WEST COAST AND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND ASSOCIATED 
PRECIP MOVE WELL N OF OUR DISTRICT ONCE AGAIN. NEXT CHANCE OF PRECIP 
WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL THE TROF MOVES TOWARD TOWARD THE COAST. MODELS 
VARY ON TIMING OF THIS EASTWARD MOVEMENT. IF MRF IS CORRECT IN 
DEVELOPING A CLOSED UPPER LOW...ONSET OF PRECIP WILL BE LATER RATHER

THE NEXT FRONTAL SYSTEM IS RACING TOWARD THE COAST.  AFTER HOLDING
TOGETHER ALL DAY...IT IS BEGINNING TO BREAK UP AS IT APPROACHES THE
SHORELINE.  HOWEVER...IT STILL APPEARS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING SOME
SHOWERS...AND HAS JET DYNAMICS ON ITS SIDE.  THE NEW ETA SHOWS A 105
KT 300 MB JETMAX ROARING ASHORE THIS EVE...WITH ITS SNOUT MOVING
RIGHT THRU SAN FRANCISCO AT 06Z.  THIS PUTS THE N BAY IN THE LEFT
FRONT QUADRANT OF THE JET...A FAVORABLE AREA FOR SHOWER GENERATION.  
BEHIND THE FRONTAL BAND IS A LARGE AREA OF COLD AIR CELLULAR CLOUDS
WHICH UNDOUBTEDLY CONTAIN SHOWERS.  THESE WILL MOVE INTO OUR FORECAST
AREA IN THE 05Z-10Z TIME FRAME LATER TNGT.  THE NEW ETA SHOWS A
CORRESPONDING PERIOD WITH LOW LEVEL WLY ONSHORE WINDS...WHICH SHOULD
HELP GENERATE OROGRAPHICALLY INDUCED SHOWERS.  THESE ARE COVERED IN
THE AFTN ZONES AND WILL LEAVE THE FORECASTS ALONE FOR NOW.

BY 12Z SUN THE FRONT WILL HAVE PASSED THRU OUR FORECAST AREA AND THE
LOW LEVEL WINDS WILL VEER TO NWLY...THEN TO NLY SUN AFTN/NIGHT.  THE
SHOWERS SHOULD END OVER LAND BY DAWN AS THE VEERING WINDS WILL STEER
THEM PARALLEL TO THE COAST RATHER THAN ONSHORE...THEN WE WILL SEE
PRONOUNCED DRYING AND STABILIZING OF THE AIRMASS SUN AFTN AS RIDGING
BEGINS AND THE WINDS TEND TOWARD OFFSHORE.  WITH A DEEP CYCLONIC NWLY
FLOW...SUN AFTN LOOKS BRISK AND BREEZY THROUGHOUT OUR FORECAST AREA. 
THE ETA FORECASTS AN OFFSHORE FLOW TO SET UP SUN NGT AS THE LOW LEVEL
FLOW CONTINUES TO VEER TO THE NE...SO MON SHOULD BE A FINE DAY WITH
CLEAR SKIES AND WARMER TEMPS.  THE ETA EVEN DRIES OUT THE LOW LEVELS
OF THE ATMOSPHERE ON MON.

THE 3-5 DAY OUTLOOK IS IN DOUBT.  THE CURRENT FORECAST IS FOR DRY
WEATHER TUE-THU...BUT THE NEW ETA AND THE OLD AVN RUN FORECAST A LOW
AMPLITUDE BUT WELL DEFINED SHORT WAVE TO MOVE THRU OUR AREA MON NGT. 
THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS THEN MOVE A STRONGER SHORT WAVE THRU ABOUT
TUE NGT/WED MRNG.  WOULDNT BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOME LIGHT PRECIP OFF
AND ON THRU WED...ESPECIALLY IN THE N BAY...BUT TIMING WILL BE VERY
DIFFICULT IN THE FAST ZONAL FLOW.  DUE TO TIMING AND INTENSITY
UNCERTAINTIES...WILL NOT CHANGE THE EXTENDED FORECAST NOW BUT THE MID
SHIFT PROBABLY WILL AFTER LOOKING AT ALL THE NEW MEDIUM RANGE MODELS. 
ALL MODELS DO BUILD THE RIDGE OVER CA IN MUCH STRONGER FASHION
STARTING THU.  THE OLD EURO BROUGHT ANOTHER SHORT WAVE INTO CA ON
THAT DAY...BUT THE NEW RUN HAS JOINED THE OTHER MODELS IN PASSING
THIS FEATURE WELL TO OUR N OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE.  THANKSGIVING

ZONAL FLOW HAS SET UP OVER CA WITH A SERIES OF WEAK SHORTWAVES
MOVING THROUGH THE FLOW. THE FIRST SHORTWAVE MOVED THROUGH CENTRAL
CA LAST NIGHT AND BROUGHT A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS. THE SECOND ONE IS
MOVING THROUGH CENTRAL CA RIGHT NOW AND IS ALSO BRINGING A FEW
LIGHT SHOWERS...MAINLY TO THE SOUTH BAY AT THIS TIME. THE THIRD
SHORTWAVE IS A VERY NARROW ROPE-LIKE FRONT CURRENTLY OFFSHORE. THIS
WILL MOVE THROUGH THE BAY AREA THIS EVENING AND WILL PROBABLY ALSO
BRING A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS. MODELS HAD A VERY POOR HANDLE ON ALL OF
THESE FEATURES SO TIMING IS BASED ON EXTRAPOLATION FROM SATELLITE
IMAGES. BY SUNDAY A WEAK RIDGE STARTS TO BUILD OVER CA...BUT SHOULD
BE STRONG ENOUGH TO END THE SHOWER ACTIVITY ALL TOGETHER. WITH LOTS
OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE EXPECT AREAS OF VALLEY FOG TO FORM AGAIN
TONIGHT. ON SUNDAY A STRONG UPPER LEVEL JET MOVES OVER CA AND HIGH
PRESSURE BEGINS TO BUILD IN AT THE SURFACE OVER THE PACIFIC
NORTHWEST. THE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO WILL CAUSE BREEZY...COOL
NORTHERLY WINDS TO DEVELOP ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY. THIS WILL KEEP
THE FOG FROM BECOMING WIDESPREAD SUNDAY NIGHT BUT SOME PATCHES ARE
STILL POSSIBLE IN THE WIND SHELTERED AREAS. THE RIDGE IS FORECAST TO
BUILD THROUGH THE WEEK WHICH SHOULD KEEP THE RAIN NORTH OF CENTRAL CA
THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD.  STS/SFO/LVK/SJC 2000  MRY 0000  C COX

THE TROUGH THAT MOVED THROUGH CA ON FRIDAY HAS MOVED INTO THE GREAT

THROUGH NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CA OVERNIGHT AND BROUGHT A FEW LIGHT
SHOWERS TO THE AREA. A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS ARE STILL POSSIBLE THIS
MORNING MAINLY OVER THE HILLS AND IN THE NORTH BUT SHOULD END IN
THE NEXT FEW HOURS. ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE IS NEAR 41N/133W AT THIS

EARLY THIS AFTERNOON BUT DO NOT EXPECT ANY SHOWERS TO REACH AS FAR
SOUTH AS THE BAY AREA. LOTS OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LEFT BEHIND THE
FRONT ON FRIDAY AND AS SKIES CLEARED AREAS OF DENSE VALLEY FOG FORMED
OVERNIGHT. THIS FOG SHOULD DISSIPATE WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS AND WE
WILL BE LEFT WITH A MIXTURE OF LOW...MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS AND
SUNSHINE. MODELS SHOW A RIDGE BUILDING OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS BUT
KEEP IT OFFSHORE. THIS WILL ALLOW A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES TO MOVE OVER

MAKE IT FAR ENOUGH SOUTH TO BRING RAIN TO CENTRAL CA SO WILL KEEP THE

FORECAST THE HIGH PRESSURE TO BE EVEN STRONGER OVER CA WHICH COULD

CONSIDERABLE LOW CLOUDINESS REMAINS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA IN THE
WAKE OF FRIDAYS COLD FRONT. A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS ARE ALL THAT REMAIN
OF A DYING SECONDARY COLD FRONT WHICH WAS MOVING ONTO THE SONOMA
COAST AT 300 AM. SOME DENSE FOG HAS ALSO DEVELOPED AROUND THE SFO 
BAY AREA...AND MAY BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD TOWARDS SUNRISE. MINOR
PERTURBATIONS IN THE WLY FLOW ALOFT WILL NOT ALLOW THE LOWER
ATMOSPHERE TO DRY OUT UNTIL LATER THIS PM AND EVENING WHEN THE FLOW
BECOMES MORE NWLY. SO WILL LIKELY SEE A FEW BRIEF SHOWERS/SPRINKLES
THIS MORNING...BUT THEY SHOULD LEAVE ONLY A TRACE OF RAIN. LOW LEVEL
THICKNESSES WILL CONTINUE TO DROP A BIT MORE THRU THE WEEKEND PER

CHILLS IN SOME COASTAL LOCATIONS. BUNDLE UP AND ENJOY THE SUNSHINE.

A COLD FRONT IS MOVING THROUGH NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CA THIS
AFTERNOON. THIS FRONT WAS MOVING RAPIDLY EASTWARD THIS MORNING BUT
HAS SLOWED DOWN DURING THE DAY AS THERE HAS BEEN SOME DEVELOPMENT
BEHIND THE FRONT. RAIN CONTINUES TO MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH THE
BAY AREA AND THE CENTRAL COAST THIS AFTERNOON. THERE ARE MODERATELY
STRONG SOUTH WINDS OF 25-35 MPH ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM WHICH
IS CONDUCIVE TO AN OROGRAPHICLY INDUCED RAIN EVENT. THUS RAINFALL
TOTALS HAVE VARIED WIDELY BASED ON TOPOGRAPHY. THE FAVORED SPOTS...
LIKE THE MOUNTAINS OF SONOMA COUNTY AND THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS
HAVE RECEIVED 1 1/2 TO 2 1/2 INCHES OF RAIN ALREADY. OTHER AREAS
WHERE A SOUTHERLY WIND IS ACTUALLY DOWNSLOPE...LIKE MONTEREY AND THE
SANTA CLARA VALLEY...HAVE RECEIVED MUCH LESS. AS OF 2 PM MONTEREY
HAD ONLY RECEIVED .01 INCHES. AT 2 PM THE BACK EDGE OF THE FRONT
LIED ALONG A LINE FROM SAC-MRY TO WELL OFFSHORE. RAIN HAS TAPERED
OFF BEHIND THIS LINE. LOTS OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LEFT BEHIND THE
FRONT SO SKIES WILL REMAIN CLOUDY THROUGH THE EVENING WITH SCATTERED
SHOWERS IN THE UNSTABLE AIR...BUT AS THE TROUGH AXIS PASSES TO THE
EAST SKIES SHOULD CLEAR AND SHOWERS WILL TAPER OFF OVERNIGHT. WIND
SHIFTS HAVE NOT OCCURRED WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE SO WINDS WILL STAY
MOSTLY SOUTHWEST THIS EVENING BUT DECREASE IN SPEED BEFORE BECOMING

BUILDING OVER THE EASTERN PACIFIC ON SATURDAY. SEVERAL WEAK

THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH HAS MOVED EASTWARD INTO THE GREAT BASIN AT
THIS TIME. A WEAK SHORTWAVE RIDGE IS BUILDING OVER CA BETWEEN THIS
SYSTEM AND THE NEXT. THIS RIDGE IS DIRTY SO LOTS OF HIGH CLOUDS ARE
MOVING OVER CA THIS EVENING. COOLER AND DRIER AIR MOVED INTO CA
WITH THIS LAST SYSTEM SO EXPECT COOL TEMPERATURES TONIGHT BUT
BUILDING 500 MB HEIGHTS WILL WARM TEMPERATURES ON THURSDAY A FEW
DEGREES OVER WEDNESDAYS HIGHS. WEAK PRESSURE GRADIENTS OVER CA
WILL KEEP WINDS LIGHT SO SOME PATCHY VALLEY FOG MAY FORM OVERNIGHT.
THE NEXT SYSTEM TO AFFECT CA IS AN UPPER LEVEL LOW CURRENTLY CENTERED
NEAR 45N/143W. THE COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM IS MOVING
EASTWARD AND IS FORECAST TO BRING RAIN TO CENTRAL CA DURING THE DAY
FRIDAY. THE TROUGH AXIS WILL MOVE EAST OF CA ON SATURDAY SO SOME

BUOY 27...IT APPEARS THE SURFACE COLD FRONT IS NEAR THE LEADING EDGE 
OF FRONTAL RAIN BAND...ALTHOUGH CLOUDS FILLING IN AHEAD OF FRONTAL 
BAND ARE OBSCURING FRONTAL FEATURES ON SATELLITE. ESTIMATED LOCATION 
OF FRONT AND LEADING EDGE OF RAINFALL AT THIS TIME SUGGESTS THAT THE 
SLOWER ETA MODEL HAS A BETTER HANDLE ON TIMING. ANOTHER FACTOR 
SUPPORTING THE SLOWER ETA MODEL IS THE ORIENTATION OF UPPER LEVEL

PACIFIC COLD FRONT AND ASSOCIATED CLOUD MASS CONTINUE TO APPROACH
CALIFORNIA FROM THE WEST.  AT 9 PM PDT LEADING EDGE OF FRONTAL CLOUD
BAND APPROX 200 MILES WEST OF SAN FRANCISCO AND MOVING EAST AT 15 TO
20 MPH.  REPORTS FROM BUOY 59 APPROX 350 MILES WEST OF SFO FROM 1900
AND 2000 UTC MONDAY SHOW COLD FRONT ITSELF AT VERY FORWARD EDGE OF
ASSOCIATED CLOUD MASS...WHILE LATER BUOY AND SHIP REPORTS INDICATE
SECONDARY TROUGH WITHIN REGION OF COLDEST CLOUD TOPS FARTHER BACK IN
THE BAND.

SIMPLE EXTRAPOLATION WOULD SUGGEST A MID MORNING START TO THE PRECIP
IN THE HEART OF THE BAY AREA...SPREADING SOUTHWARD OVER OUR CWA
DURING THE DAY.  THERE ARE A COUPLE OF COMPLICATIONS HOWEVER. 
FIRST...IR SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS LOWER LEVEL CLOUDINESS FILLING IN
AHEAD OF THE MAIN FRONTAL BAND.  THIS COULD LEAD TO INITIATION OF
DRIZZLE OR EVEN LIGHT RAIN PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF THE FRONT
ITSELF...ESPECIALLY GIVEN MODEL FORECASTS OF MODERATELY STRONG WARM
ADVECTION AND ASSOCIATED ASCENT.  SECOND...ETA AND TO SOME DEGREE THE
NGM SUGGEST WAVE DEVELOPMENT WILL OCCUR ALONG FRONT PRIOR TO ARRIVAL
AT THE COAST.  THIS WOULD RESULT IN SLOWER EASTWARD PROGRESSION AND A
LATER START TO THE RAIN.  THE AVN...WHICH IS MUCH WEAKER WITH THIS
WAVE FEATURE...HAS THE EARLIEST START TO THE PRECIP OF THESE THREE
MODELS.  THROUGH 9 PM THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS IN THE SATELLITE
IMAGERY OF WAVE DEVELOPMENT INITIATING.

NET RESULT IS THAT PRECIP SHOULD START BETWEEN 5 AND 9 AM TUES IN
THE NORTHERN THIRD OF OUR CWA...BETWEEN 9 AM AND NOON IN THE CENTRAL
THIRD INCLUDING SFO...OAK...SJC AND THEN SOUTHWARD OVER THE SOUTHERN
THIRD DURING THE AFTERNOON.  WILL MAKE MINOR UPDATES TO ZONES
ACCORDINGLY...AS WELL AS INTRODUCE SOME PATCHY FOG AS VISIBILITIES
ALREADY DOWN TO 3 MILES AT STS AND TEMPS GETTING CLOSE TO DEW POINTS
AT SEVERAL OTHER LOCATIONS.

SSMI PRECIP ESTIMATES FROM 0018 UTC INDICATE ONLY GENERALLY LIGHT
PRECIP WITH FRONTAL BAND OVER THE OCEAN...BUT PRECIP IS EXPECTED TO
ENHANCE WITH TOPOGAPHIC INTERACTION AS MAKES LANDFALL.  ROUGH
ESTIMATE OF STORM TOTAL PRECIP AMOUNTS THROUGH MIDDAY WEDNESDAY WOULD
BE FROM AS MUCH AS 2 INCHES IN FAVORED LOCATIONS IN HILLS OF SONOMA
AND MARIN COUNTIES AND SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS...TO BETWEEN 0.5 AND 1.0
INCHES IN THE SFO...OAK AREA TO 0.25 TO 0.5 INCHES IN THE SOUTHERN
INTERIOR OF OUR CWA.  BOTH AVN AND ETA BRING LIFTED INDICES DOWN TO
NEAR ZERO LATE TUES AFTERNOON AND EVENING SO WILL KEEP CHANCE OF
THUNDERSTORMS IN FORECASTS.

IN LONGER TERM...PRECIP WITH THIS SYSTEM SHOULD END WEDNESDAY MORNING
WITH SKIES CLEARING DURING THE DAY AS A SHORT WAVE RIDGE MOVES IN. 
LONGER RANGE MODELS ARE PRETTY CONSISTENT WITH THIS BEING A
SHORT-LIVED FEATURE...HOWEVER...AS SHOW NEXT SYSTEM AND ASSOCIATED

A FAIRLY TYPICAL MEDIUM STRENGTH WET SEASON STORM IS APPROACHING. 
SATELLITE PIX SHOW A COMMON CLOUD PATTERN WITH PREFRONTAL SUBSIDENCE
CLEARING FROM SFO S...PERSISTENT CLOUDS IN THE N BAY AHEAD OF THE
WARM FRONT...THEN A JUICY SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT OUT AROUND 130 W
WITH CONTINUOUS CLOUD ENHANCEMENT ALONG THE FRONTAL BAND.  THE MAIN
FORECAST PROBLEM WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL BE TIMING.  THE CONSENSUS IS
THAT THE STORM WILL MOVE A LITTLE SLOWER EWD THAN PREVIOUSLY FORECAST
...MORE IN LINE WITH THE ETA MODEL WHICH IS ABOUT 6 HOURS SLOWER THAN
THE AVN.  THERE WILL BE LITTLE OR NO RAIN IN OUR FORECAST AREA TNGT
...MAYBE A FEW LATE SHOWERS IN THE N BAY ASSOCIATED WITH THE WARM
FRONT.  THE MODELS HINT AT THIS WITH A FAIRLY WEAK OMEGA FIELD.  THE
ETA AND AVN BRING A MUCH STRONGER FIELD INTO THE N BAY BY TUE AFTN
BUT THE ETA DELAYS THE ONSET OF SIGNIFICANT RAIN S OF SFO UNTIL TUE
EVE.  THIS MAY BE A BIT TOO SLOW AND WILL USE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN
THE ETA AND AVN...SPREADING THE RAIN ACROSS THE BAY AREA TUE AFTN BUT
DELAYING CATEGORICAL POPS FROM MRY S UNTIL TUE NGT.  

THE BEST CHANCE FOR HEAVY RAIN APPEARS TO BE IN THE N BAY ON TUE...
AND IN THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS TUE PM UNDER A STRONG SLY OROGRAPHIC
FLOW.  DYNAMICS WITH THIS SYSTEM ARE DECENT BUT NOT GREAT...IT WILL
HAVE A NEGATIVE TILT CONFIGURATION BUT ONLY WEAK TO MODERATE UPPER
LEVEL AND THICKNESS DIFFLUENCE...WITH MODERATELY COLD AIR ALOFT.  TUE
NGT THE STORM IS FORECAST TO PRETTY WELL SPLIT FROM THE MAIN JET AND
HEAD DOWN THE CNTRL CA COAST...AND WE WILL HAVE A WET NIGHT HERE IN
MRY.  THE ETA FORECASTS LIFTED INDEX VALUES TO DROP TO NEAR ZERO OVER
OUR REGION TUE EVE SO WE COULD SEE A THUNDERSTORM OR TWO POP UP WITH
THE FRONTAL PASSAGE.  BY WED MRNG MOST PRECIP SHOULD BE OVER EXCEPT
FOR SOME LINGERING SHOWERS...MOSTLY IN MRY COUNTY.  

THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS HAVE ALSO BEEN BICKERING...BUT THEY PRETTY
WELL AGREE THAT THU WILL BE DRY.  ANOTHER TROF WILL APPROACH THE
COAST ON FRI...WITH THE EURO SOMEWHAT SLOWER AND DEEPER THAN THE
UK/MRF/CANADIAN.  IN GENERAL THIS SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO SPLIT MORE
EMPHATICALLY THAN OUR CURRENT STORM.  FOR NOW WILL USE THE MRF
SOLUTION AND BRING A FAIRLY LIGHT RAINFALL THRU OUR FORECAST

ON TUE WITH VIRTUALLY NONE S OF SFO THRU THAT AFTN.  IF THIS FORECAST
VERIFIED OUR CURRENT ZONES WOULD BE TOO FAST IN MOVING THE RAIN INTO

MOVING QUICKLY NE INTO NORTHERN CA. ASSOCIATED SHOWER ACTIVITY HAS 
DIMINISHED AND MOVED MOSTLY OUT OF OUR FORECAST AREA. A FEW 
LINGERING MORNING SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE NORTH SFO BAY AREA

INCREASE AND SOME WARM ADVECTION RAIN WILL BEGIN ACROSS THE N SFO 
BAY AREA...AND PERHAPS AS FAR S AS MONTEREY BY DAYBREAK TUESDAY. 
THEN...DURING THE DAY TUESDAY...A MODERATELY STRONG COLD FRONT WILL 
PUSH ONSHORE AND RAIN WILL SPREAD OVER THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. 
FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE OMEGA VALUES IN THE N BAY AND GOOD OROGRAPHICS IN 
THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS MAY PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN IN THOSE

THE UPPER LEVEL LOW CURRENTLY LOCATED NEAR 33N/128W WILL CONTINUE TO
MOVE TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST. THE CLOUDINESS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
SYSTEM HAS FILLED IN ANY EARLIER BREAKS IN THE CLOUD DECK LATE AS IT
APPROACHES THE CALIFORNIA COAST. BEHIND THIS SYSTEM...AN UPPER LEVEL
TROUGH DEVELOPING AROUND 148W WILL STRENGTHEN AS IT MOVES TOWARDS THE
WEST COAST. AS THIS TROUGH APPROACHES...THE UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL OPEN
UP AND BECOME PART OF THE GENERAL FLOW ALOFT AS A SHORT WAVE TROUGH.
BOTH THE AVN AND ETA MODELS AGREE WITH THIS OCCURRING BY 06Z TONIGHT.
MOST OF THE ENERGY WITH THIS SHORT WAVE SHOULD BEGIN TO MOVE THROUGH
THE AREA BY 06Z TONIGHT...WHEN THE PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN
ALONG THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST. THE PRECIPITATION WILL SPREAD
FURTHER INLAND OVERNIGHT. RAINFALL AMOUNTS SHOULD BE LOW WITH THIS
SYSTEM...LESS THAN A QUARTER INCH...BUT AREAL COVERAGE SHOULD BE
EXTENSIVE. MOST OF THE ENERGY WITH THIS SHORT WAVE SHOULD MOVE OUT OF
OUR AREA BY LATE MONDAY MORNING...ALLOWING US TO DRY OUT INTO THE
AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES ON MONDAY SHOULD REBOUND SLIGHTLY FROM SUNDAY
SINCE WE WILL SEE SOME WEAK RIDGING OVER OUR AREA AND THE POSSIBILITY
OF A FEW PEEKS OF THE SUN...SOMETHING MANY AREAS DID NOT SEE ON
SUNDAY. BY LATE MONDAY...THIS WEAK RIDGING WILL BREAK DOWN IN
RESPONSE TO THE NEXT PACIFIC STORM EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE AREA ON
TUESDAY. PRECIPITATION SHOULD RETURN TO THE AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT ON
TUESDAY AS THE FRONT APPROACHES. THE MOST FAVORABLE DYNAMICS WITH
THIS SYSTEM SHOULD STAY TO OUR NORTH...HOWEVER WITH THE AMOUNT OF
UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE...MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AND 700MB OMEGA
FORECASTED OVER OUR AREA BY THE AVN AND ETA EXPECT IT TO RAIN ON
TUESDAY OVER THE ENTIRE AREA. ALSO...TEMPERATURES WILL BE RATHER COOL
ON TUESDAY. THE AVN IS FORECASTING 1000 TO 500 MB THICKNESSES TO DROP
BELOW 550 DM OVER SAN FRANCISCO BY 00Z TUESDAY...AND LEVELS THEM OFF
TO AROUND 543 DM BY MIDNIGHT WEDNESDAY. 

IN THE EXTENDED THE FOCUS IS ON THE EXIT OF TUESDAYS SYSTEM BY LATE
WEDNESDAY MORNING AND THE ARRIVAL OF OUR NEXT CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION
ON FRIDAY. THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH THE
TIMING OF TUESDAYS SYSTEM. RAIN SHOULD BE TAPERING OFF TO SHOWERS
WEDNESDAY MORNING. THEN A SHORT-LIVED RIDGE WILL DEVELOP ON THURSDAY

A DEEP LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS CENTERED OVER THE GULF OF ALASKA. THE
MOIST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TROUGH LIES OVER CA
AND BROUGHT LIGHT RAIN TO PARTS OF THE BAY AREA TODAY. THE NORTH BAY
RECEIVED MOST OF THE RAIN BUT ONLY 1/4 INCH OR LESS. ONLY A FEW
HUNDREDTHS FELL FURTHER SOUTH DOWN TO SAN MATEO AND ALAMEDA COUNTIES
WHILE THERE WAS NO RAIN FURTHER SOUTH THAN THAT. THIS MOIST
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL REMAIN FAIRLY STATIONARY THIS EVENING SO A
FEW LIGHT SHOWERS ARE STILL POSSIBLE BEFORE MIDNIGHT...BUT MAINLY
OVER THE NORTH BAY. THE TROUGH IS FORECAST TO BEGIN DEEPENING AND
DIGGING SOUTHWARD TONIGHT. THIS WILL ALLOW THE STRONG HIGH PRESSURE
OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. TO BUILD NORTHWESTWARD AND PUSH THE MOIST
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW BACK OFFSHORE. ETA IS STRONGEST WITH THIS PATTERN
AND SHOWS NO RAIN IN THE BAY AREA THROUGH FRIDAY. AVN/NGM NOT AS
OPTIMISTIC AND SUGGEST THE MOIST FLOW MAY BRING SOME RAIN TO THE
NORTH BAY ON FRIDAY. SO WILL INCLUDE A CHANCE OF RAIN IN THE NORTH
BAY FOR FRIDAY...OTHERWISE CENTRAL CA WILL EXPERIENCE JUST A MIXTURE
OF MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS. MEDIUM RANGE MODELS CONSISTENT IN
DEVELOPING THE TROUGH OFFSHORE THIS WEEKEND BUT SIMILARITIES END
THERE. NOGAPS/MRF/UK/AVN ALL HAVE A CUT OFF LOW DEVELOP AT THE BASE
OF THE TROUGH ABOUT 400-600 NM SOUTHWEST OF POINT CONCEPTION LATE
FRIDAY/EARLY SATURDAY. WHERE AS THE UK/CANADIAN DEEPEN THE TROUGH BUT
DONT ACTUALLY CUT IT OFF AND ARE MORE PROGRESSIVE WITH IT. THIS MAKES
FOR A TRICKY FORECAST FOR THE WEEKEND AS MODELS ARE NOTORIOUS FOR
THEIR POOR HANDLING OF POSITION AND MOVEMENT OF CUT OFF UPPER LEVEL
LOWS. IF THE MRF POSITION IS THE MOST ACCURATE THEN RAIN IS POSSIBLE
ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY BUT IF THE NEW RUN OF
THE AVN IS CORRECT RAIN WOULD REMAIN WELL OFFSHORE. IF THE CUT OFF
STAYS OFFSHORE FOR SEVERAL DAYS...WHICH THEY ARE APT TO DO...THE
WHOLE EXTENDED COULD BE DRY. TOO EARLY TO TELL WHICH MODEL WILL BE

HOW FAR S THIS RAIN WILL SPREAD.  THE AVN FORECASTS NICE THICKNESS
DIFFLUENCE JUST N OF THE BAY AREA ON WED WITH A DECENT OMEGA FIELD
AND PLENTY OF MOISTURE...BUT THESE PARAMETERS ARE MARGINAL IN THE N

VIGOROUS COLD FRONT PASSED THROUGH THE SAN FRANCISCO AND MONTEREY BAY 
AREAS THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. STRONG GUSTY WINDS...GUSTING 
AS HIGH AS 56 MPH AT PIGEON POINT AND 46 MPH AT THE SALINAS 
AIRPORT...PRECEDED THE FRONT. A BAND OF VERY HEAVY RAIN FELL WITH 
THE FRONT. RAIN RATES EXCEEDING AN INCH AND A HALF PER HOUR WERE 
NOTED IN THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS LATE THIS AFTERNOON. BECAUSE IT IS 
EARLY IN THE RAINY SEASON AND THE GROUND IS DRY...NOTHING MORE THAN 
STREET FLOODING WAS REPORTED.

CURRENTLY...THE SURFACE FRONT HAS PASSED THROUGH ALL BUT THE FAR 
SOUTHERN PORTION OF OUR FORECAST AREA AND ONLY AREAS OF LIGHT 
POST-FRONTAL RAIN ARE BEING REPORTED. AN UPPER LEVEL JET MAX HEADING 
TOWARD SOUTH-CENTRAL CA IS ENHANCING THE FRONT S OF OUR AREA AND A 
VORTICITY MAX OFF CAPE MENDOCINO IS PRODUCING A LARGE AREA OF 
SHOWERS WHICH ARE HEADED TOWARD POINT ARENA. IN BETWEEN...THERE IS 
VERY LITTLE POST- FRONTAL SHOWER ACTIVITY. HOWEVER...UPPER LEVEL 
FLOW IS CYCLONIC AND A MOIST ONSHORE FLOW WILL CONTINUE THRU THE 
NIGHT. SO EXPECT PERIODS OF LIGHT RAIN OR SHOWERS TO CONTINUE 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE NIGHT. SOME HEAVIER SHOWERS ARE 
POSSIBLE...PARTICULARLY IN THE N SFO BAY AREA IN CLOSER PROXIMITY TO 
THE VORTICITY CENTER. BOTH THE ETA AND AVN MOVE THE UPPER TROF AXIS 
INLAND BY 18Z ON MONDAY. BY AFTERNOON OUR FORECAST AREA SHOULD BE IN 
AN AREA OF SUBSIDENCE AND SHOWER ACTIVITY SHOULD DROP OFF AND SKIES 
WILL BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY. IF SKIES CLEAR SUFFICIENTLY MONDAY 
NIGHT...SOME LATE NIGHT VALLEY FOG IS LIKELY.

BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...BOTH AVN AND NOGAPS SAG THE NEXT FRONT 
SOUTH INTO THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE SFO BAY AREA. N BAY POPS MAY 
BE A BIT LOW FOR THE FORTH PERIOD BUT HAVE HELD OFF ON UPDATES TO 
THAT PERIOD IN EVENING UPDATE. MAIN CHANGE IN EVENING ZONE FORECAST 
UPDATE WAS TO POPS IN SECOND PERIOD. BASED ON SATELLITE AND MODEL 
DATA BELIEVE SHOWERS WILL BE SCATTERED AND NOT WIDESPREAD ON MONDAY. 
BEYOND WEDNESDAY...MODELS DIVERGE WITH THE MRF MOVING A SHORTWAVE 
TROF QUICKLY TO THE ENE AND DIGGING A DEEP TROF OFFSHORE. THE NOGAPS 
DRIVES THE MAIN TROF THROUGH CENTRAL CA ON FRIDAY WITH A NEARLY 
ZONAL FLOW TO FOLLOW. THE ECMWF IS CLOSER TO THE MRF. WORDING OF 
EXTENDED PORTION OF CURRENT ZONES IS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE

WATER VAPOR SATELLITE LOOP SHOWING THE EASTERN PACIFIC TROUGH
CONTINUING TO DIG SOUTHWARD THIS EVENING...TO ABOUT 30N AT 830
PM...WITH THE TROUGH AXIS AT ABOUT 137W. THE TROUGH HAS BEEN SLOWLY
SHIFTING EASTWARD THE LAST FEW HOURS AFTER MAKING VERY LITTLE
EASTWARD MOVEMENT EARLIER TODAY. THE NEWEST MODEL DATA MOVE THE
TROUGH EASTWARD OVERNIGHT TO BE NEAR ABOUT 128W BY MIDDAY ON SUNDAY.
THIS WILL BE WHEN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CLOUDS WILL OCCUR
FROM NORTH TO SOUTH WITH LIGHT RAIN POSSIBLE NORTH SAN FRANCISCO BAY
COUNTIES BY MIDDAY AND THEN SWEEPING SOUTHWARD THROUGHOUT THE
AFTERNOON WITH RAIN POSSIBLE IN THE MONTEREY BAY AREA BY SUNSET. THE
JETSTREAM THAT HAS BEEN DIGGING THE TROUGH SOUTHWARD TONIGHT WEAKENS
BY MIDDAY SUNDAY AND THE TROUGH ALSO WEAKENS QUITE A BIT BY LATE
AFTERNOON SUNDAY. THIS WILL HELP A MORE RAPID EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF
THE TROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. THE MODELS PROJECT THE TROUGH AXIS TO BE
INLAND BY MIDDAY MONDAY SO WE CAN EXPECT DECENT CLEARING BY MONDAY
AFTERNOON BUT LIKELY RESIDUAL SHOWERS AROUND UNTIL LATE AFTERNOON. BY
MONDAY NIGHT SHORTWAVE RIDGING TAKES OVER FOR SIGNIFICANT CLEARING
AND COOLER TEMPERATURES FROM SUNDAY NIGHT. THIS SYSTEM IS NOT
ANYTHING MAJOR AND RAIN AMOUNTS SHOULD RANGE FROM A QUARTER TO A HALF

HAS RECENTLY LEVELED OFF AS HEIGHTS ALOFT INCREASE MARGINALLY IN 
RESPONSE TO DIGGING TROF OVER THE EASTERN PACIFIC. BUT LAYER IS 
ALREADY DEEP ENOUGH THIS EVENING TO ALLOW LOW CLOUDS/FOG TO MOVE

BIG DROP IN TEMPS. 

A DEEP UPPER TROF CURRENTLY OVER THE GULF OF ALASKA WILL BE THE 
ANCHOR FOR A DEVELOPING SYSTEM THAT WILL BRING RAIN TO MOST OF OUR

THE PROGS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON BRINGING THE NEXT SYSTEM WELL
NORTH OF OUR AREA ON SUNDAY. IT WILL FLATTEN THE RIDGE OVER CA
BRINGING LOWER HEIGTHS AND THICKNESS WITH WEST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW
ALOFT. THE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT BASIN WILL WEAKEN AND SLIDE
EAST AS THE NEXT SYSTEM PUSHES INTO THE NW TONIGHT AND SUNDAY.  THE
GRADIENT IS STILL LIGHT OFFSHORE...SFO-SAC -.5 MILLIBAR AT 21Z...SO
EASTERLY WINDS WILL CONTINUE THIS EVENING. THE WINDS WEAKEN AND ALLOW
A CHANCE OF PATCHY DENSE FOG TONIGHT UNDER THE OTHERWISE CLEAR SKIES.
SUNDAY AND MONDAY THE CONTINUED CLEAR SKIES AND HIGH HEIGHTS AND
THICKNESS WILL CONTINUE HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE HIGH 70S TO LOW 80S.
LOWS SHOULD BE IN THE 40S TO 50S EXCEPT SOME UPPER 30S IN THE NORTH
BAY. THE INVERSION WILL BE VERY SHALLOW DUE TO SUBSIDENCE AND ANY FOG
THAT DEVELOPS LIKELY WILL BE DENSE. THE APPROACHING FRONT IS TAPPING
TROPICAL MOISTURE AND SOUNDER PRECIPATABLE WATER IS MORE THAN AN
INCH. THE NEWS IS IT SHOULD STAY WELL NORTH OF CENTRAL COASTAL CA.
THE CLEAR SKIES WILL KEEP DAYTIME TEMPERATURES NEAR OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE
NORMAL THROUGH MONDAY. THE CHANCE OF FOG INCREASES AS THE OFFSHORE
FLOW DIMISHES SO HAVE INCREASED THE COVERAGE OF THE FOG TO AREAS
SUNDAY NIGHT TO MONDAY MORNING. THERE IS A DIVERGENCE OF THE MODELS
ON THURSDAY WITH THE MRF SHOWING MORE TROUGHINESS AND THEREFORE A
CHANCE OF PCPN IN N CA. THE OTHERS MODELS THAT KEEP THE FLAT RIDGE.
WILL NOT INTRODUCE PCPN INTO AREA ON THURSDAY TILL SEE SOME MORE
MODEL RUNS. SO WILL CONTINUE TO SEE CLEAR SKIES WITH NIGHT AND
MORNING FOG WITH MILD TEMPERATURES THRU THURSDAY.   ALL POPS ZERO.

HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE CONTINUES OVER CA SO CLEAR SKIES THROUGHOUT THE
STATE AGAIN TONIGHT. WITH DEW POINTS DOWN INTO THE UPPER 30S AND 40S
THIS SHOULD BE A COOL NIGHT...BUT SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS BUILDING
OVER THE GREAT BASIN PRODUCING WEAK OFFSHORE FLOW OVER CA. THUS LIGHT

IN THE SANTA CLARA AND SALINAS VALLEYS. THE EAST AND SOUTHEASTERLY
WIND IS KEEPING TEMPERATURES FROM DROPPING BELOW THE UPPER 40S AND

OFFSHORE FLOW IS FORECAST TO WEAKEN TONIGHT WHICH MAY ALLOW SOME FOG
TO DEVELOP IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS SUNDAY. WITH THE HIGH PRESSURE
OVER THE STATE THE INVERSION WILL BE SHALLOW AND ANY FOG THAT
DEVELOPS LIKELY WILL BE DENSE. THE RIDGE WEAKENS A BIT ON SUNDAY AS A
SYSTEM PASSES TO THE NORTH BUT SHOULD HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON CENTRAL

SATELLITE AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SHOW CLEAR SKIES NOW PREVAIL
THROUGHOUT OUR CWA.  THROUGH THE EARLY EVENING TEMPERATURES HAVE
REMAINED MILD...BUT WILL BE LOCALLY A BIT CHILLY BY DAWN ESPECIALLY
IN THOSE VALLEY LOCATIONS WHERE WINDS BECOME LIGHT.  EXPECT WARMER
TEMPERATURES FRIDAY AS MODELS SHOW SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LOWER
TROPOSPHERIC TEMPERATURES IN CONJUNCTION WITH LOW LEVEL FLOW BECOMING
MORE OFFSHORE.  SOUNDINGS AT OAK FROM BOTH THE 00Z ETA AND 00Z NGM 
RUNS SHOW 8C OF WARMING AT 850 TO 900 MB BETWEEN 00Z THURS AND 
00Z FRI.  FORECASTS APPEAR ON TRACK...NO UPDATES PLANNED.

THE BIG STORY TODAY HAS BEEN THE VERY LARGE WAVES IMPACTING OUR
COASTAL ZONES.  8 PM BUOY REPORTS SHOW 17 TO 23 FOOT SWELLS...THOUGH
THESE ARE LOWER THAN EARLIER TODAY.  THE PT ARENA BUOY REPORTED A 30
FOOT SWELL AT 17Z.  THE RELATIVELY LONG APPROX 17 SECOND PERIOD
INDICATES THE RELATIVELY HIGH ENERGY AND DISTANT SOURCE OF THESE
WAVES.  PRESENT WAVE MODEL FORECASTS...CONSISTENT WITH EARLIER RUNS
AND OBSERVATIONAL TREND...INDICATE THAT THE PEAK OF THIS EVENT
OCCURRED EARLIER TODAY...WITH CONTINUED DECREASE IN WAVE HEIGHTS NOW
EXPECTED.  EPISODE WAS WELL COVERED BY APPROPRIATE WATCHES AND
WARNINGS.  AM PRESENTLY KEEPING COASTAL FLOOD WARNING IN EFFECT FOR
SANTA CRUZ COUNTY FOR FLOODING RESULTING FROM BREACHED SEAWALL IN
CAPITOLA AS WAVES...THOUGH DECREASING...WILL STILL BE ANOMALOUSLY
HIGH THROUGH FRIDAY.  AM ALSO KEEPING THE HEAVY SURF ADVISORY...BUT
AM CANCELLING THE COASTAL FLOOD WATCH ELSEWHERE AS WAVE HEIGHTS NOW
INSUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE SUCH FLOODING AND FURTHER DECREASE EXPECTED.

OTHERWISE VERY NICE AUTUMN WEATHER AND MILD DAYTIME TEMPERATURES 
EXPECTED THROUGH THE WEEKEND...BUT WITH A PROGRESSIVE INCREASE IN
NIGHT AND MORNING FOG IN THE VALLEYS AS THE AIR MASS STABILIZES AND
NOCTURNAL RADIATIONAL COOLING REMAINS STRONG.  DONT EXPECT MORE THAN
A FEW PATCHES OF VALLEY FOG LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY FRIDAY
MORNING...BUT SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT MORE EXTENSIVE LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND
EARLY SATURDAY MORNING.  AS THE INVERSION WILL LIKELY BE GROUND BASED

CONTINUING TO MOVE EASTWARD AND IS FAIRLY STRONG FOR THIS TIME OF
YEAR. THE COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW MOVED THROUGH NORTHERN
CA WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND IS MOVING THROUGH CENTRAL CA

LOWER ELEVATIONS. AT 3 AM THE BACK EDGE OF THE COLD FRONT...WHERE THE
HEAVIEST RAIN IS LOCATED...WAS PASSING THROUGH SOUTHERN SANTA CRUZ
AND SANTA CLARA COUNTIES AND WORKING ITS WAY SOUTHEASTWARD. THE RAIN
HAS TAPERED OFF BEHIND THE FRONT BUT A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS ARE
STILL POSSIBLE THIS MORNING. IN ADDITION...THIS SYSTEM ALSO CAUSED
VERY LARGE SWELLS TO DEVELOP OVER THE EASTERN PACIFIC. THESE LARGE
SWELLS ARE EXPECTED TO REACH THE CALIFORNIA COAST LATER TODAY. HIGH
PRESSURE IS FORECAST TO BUILD OVER CA THIS AFTERNOON AS THE TROUGH
MOVES EASTWARD. THE COMBINATION OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING AT THE
SURFACE AND A STRONG NORTH-SOUTH UPPER LEVEL JET WILL ALLOW SKIES TO
CLEAR BUT WINDS TO BECOME BREEZY FROM THE NORTHWEST BY MIDDAY. WINDS

WEAK COLD FRONT BROUGHT LIGHT RAIN TO NORTHWESTERN CA TODAY. THIS 
FRONT DISSIPATED RAPIDLY AS IT MOVED S AND E AND ONLY MID AND HIGH 
LEVEL CLOUDS REMAIN AS THE UPPER FRONT MOVES ACROSS OUR FORECAST 
AREA. COOLER AIR ALOFT BEHIND THE FRONT SHOULD ACT TO DESTABILIZE 
THE LOWER LEVELS ENOUGH TO PREVENT DENSE FOG FORMATION TONIGHT. 
HOWEVER...THERE LIKELY WILL BE SOME FOG AND LOW CLOUD DEVELOPMENT 
ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT AS FRONT ISNT STRONG ENOUGH TO MIX DRIER AIR 
INTO THE LOWER LEVELS. NEXT...MORE VIGOROUS...SYSTEM BEGINNING TO 
TAKE SHAPE OUT ALONG 145W. THE ETA HAS COME MORE IN LINE WITH THE 
AVN AND BOTH FORECAST LIGHT RAIN AS FAR S AS SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BY 
LATE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND SOUTH ACROSS OUR ENTIRE FORECAST AREA

FORECAST TO PUNCH IN BEHIND FRONT ON WED NIGHT. TAKING THOSE 
VARIABLES INTO ACCOUNT...THINK THERE COULD VERY WELL BE SOME LIGHT

SEVERAL REPORTS OF DENSE FOG THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST AREA THIS
MORNING PROMPTED ISSUANCE OF A DENSE FOG ADVISORY UNTIL MID MORNING.
DENSE FOG HAS BEEN REPORTED IN FREMONT AND PALO ALTO AND AT THE REID-
HILLVIEW...MONTEREY AND SALINAS AIRPORTS. VISIBILITIES HAVE BEGUN TO
IMPROVE ACROSS THE AREA...BUT SOME LOCATIONS CONTINUE TO REPORT
VISIBILITIES OF LESS THAN A QUARTER MILE SO WILL CONTINUE ADVISORY
UNTIL ITS 930 AM EXPIRATION TIME. 

IN THE SHORT TERM...TEMPS TODAY SHOULD BE A LITTLE COOLER THAN
YESTERDAY. ALTHOUGH 12Z OAK SOUNDING SHOWED AN INVERSION HEIGHT
SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY MORNING...TEMPERATURE OF THE AIRMASS ABOVE THE
INVERSION IS A FEW DEGREES COOLER. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE FORT ORD
PROFILER DATA. ALSO...MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS FROM FRONT MOVING
ONTO THE NORTHERN CA COAST WILL STREAM OVER THE N SFO BAY AREA BY
THIS AFTERNOON AND ACT TO HOLD TEMPS DOWN THERE. THIS INITIAL FRONT
DOES NOT APPEAR STRONG ENOUGH TO PRODUCE RAINFALL IN OUR FORECAST
AREA TODAY. HOWEVER...NEXT SHORTWAVE TROF AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE
FRONT APPROACHING 140W WILL BE STRONGER AND THE NORTHERN PORTION OF
OUR AREA COULD VERY WELL SEE SOME RAIN OUT OF THAT LATE WEDNESDAY.

THE RIDGE OVER CA IS WEAKENING AS A SHORT WAVE TROUGH MOVES TOWARD
THE PACNW. THE COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY
OFF THE NORTHERN CA COAST. THIS FRONT WILL WEAKEN AS IT MOVES INLAND
SO DO NOT EXPECT ANY RAIN FARTHER SOUTH THAN MENDOCINO COUNTY AS IT
MOVES THROUGH TODAY. FOR CENTRAL CA...THE MARINE LAYER REMAINS FAIRLY
SHALLOW AT THIS TIME BUT IS RISING RAPIDLY. THEREFORE THE AREAS OF
LOW CLOUDS SHOULD BE SPREADING LOCALLY INLAND THIS MORNING BUT SOME
AREAS OF DENSE FOG ARE STILL OCCURRING. ANOTHER STRONGER SYSTEM IS
RIGHT BEHIND THE FRONT CURRENTLY OFF NORTHERN CA. THIS SYSTEM WILL
MOVE THROUGH THE AREA OVERNIGHT WEDNESDAY. THIS SYSTEM IS STRONG
ENOUGH THAT THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN DOWN TO THE NORTH BAY
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. BUT MOST OF THE ENERGY STAYS NORTH SO
WILL NOT INCREASE POPS BEYOND THAT. AFTER THIS SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH
MODELS SHOW A RIDGE BUILDING BACK OVER CALIFORNIA FOR THE WEEKEND.

NO UPDATE PLANNED. AT 9 PM THE FOG PRODUCT SHOWS THE CENTRAL COAST
IS NEARLY CLEAR DUE TO PREFRONTAL SUBSIDENCE FROM WEAK COLD FRONT TO
NEARING THE N BAY COUNTIES. WE WILL SEE SOME MIDDLE AND HIGH CLOUDS
FROM THE WEAK FRONT TONIGHT AND THEN THE CLOUDS WILL DISSAPATE AS THE
FRONTAL BOUNDRY CONTINUES TO THE SE AND WEAKENS ON SUNDAY. THE
FRONTAL SUBSIDENCE IS NOT LIKELY TO SUPPRESS ALL COASTAL CLOUDS. THE
FRONT WILL NOT TOTALLY MIX OUT THE MARINE LAYER...BUT IT SHOULD
BECOME MUCH SHALLOWER.  A GOOD ONSHORE FLOW CONTINUES WITH THE
PRESSURE GRADIENT SFO-SAC OF 2 MILLIBARS AT 03Z. SUBSIDENCE MAY NOT
BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PREVENT NEW AREAS OF STRATUS FROM DEVELOPING LATE
TNGT. WITH THE WEAK FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE AREA SOME COASTAL
LOCATIONS REMAIN CLEAR ALL NIGHT WHILE SOME INLAND VALLEYS SUCH AS
THE N BAY ARE CLOUDY.  THE FORECAST WILL BE FOR AREAS OF LOW
CLOUDS...BUT NOT MORE WIDESPREAD AT THE COAST.  THEN CLEARING BY SUN
MORNING AFTER FROPA AS SUBSIDENCE INCREASES.

BY MIDDAY SUN...WE WILL SEE SOME WARMING AND PROBABLY A SLIGHTLY
WEAKER AND LATER SEABREEZE.  WILL FORECAST WARMER HIGHS ON SUN.  THE
PATTERN IS FORECAST TO CHANGE LITTLE ON MON SO NOT MUCH CHANGE IN
CONDITIONS.  

IN THE EXTENDED THE PROGS SHOW A FLAT RIDGE THAT WILL BE DIRTY AT
TIMES IN THE N BAY. WILL FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY WEATHER THERE...BUT
RAIN WILL STAY N OF OUR AREA.  POPS ZERO.  MORRILL

A LONG WAVE TROF NEAR 138 W WILL ROTATE QUICKLY INTO THE PACIFIC
NORTHWEST BY SATURDAY NIGHT BUT WILL LEAVE A VERY WEAK TROUGH OR CUT
OFF LOW WEST OF SAN DIEGO. AVN HAS THIS FEATURE MOVING TO YUMA
ARIZONA BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. RAIN IS NOT EXPECTED WITH THIS TROUGH AS
FAR SOUTH AS SONOMA COUNTY. 

THE HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE THAT HAS LIMITED ONSHORE FLOW WILL
LEAVE THE GREAT BASIN TODAY. THIS ACCOUNTS FOR BOTH THE DEEPENING
MARINE LAYER AND GENERALLY LOWER TEMPERATURES TODAY AND TONIGHT AS
WELL AS INCREASED WIND FLOW THROUGH THE GOLDEN GATE. THE MARINE LAYER
CONTINUES TO DEEPEN AND THE STRATUS BASES HAVE LIFTED ACCORDINGLY TO
5 TO 11 HUNDRED FEET WITH TOPS NEARING 2000 FEET. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK INTO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST ON SUNDAY.
THE MARINE LAYER SHOULD STOP GROWING...THOUGH IT WILL PROBABLY NOT
DIMINISH...AND TEMPERATURES WILL RECOVER.

APPROPRIATELY TEMPERATURES ARE SHOWN COOLING TODAY ON THE
ETA...MRF AND AVN. THE 1000-850 MB THICKNESS VALUES ARE LOWEST SUNDAY
MORNING OF ANY VALUES THIS WEEK OR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT...1363-1366
METERS DEPENDING ON THE MODEL. SO EXPECT SUNDAY MORNING TO BE FAIRLY
COOL WITH A WEAK WARMING TREND THROUGH TUESDAY. ANOTHER TROUGH WILL

AS THE WEAK BUT LARGE OFFSHORE TROF MOVES TOWARD THE COAST...THE
SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN OVER OUR FORECAST AREA HAS SHIFTED TO A MORE
SUMMERLIKE ONSHORE FLOW.  THE MARINE LAYER IS DEEPER...1000-1500 FEET
AT FT ORD AND OAK...AND AT 03Z THE SFO-SAC GRADIENT WAS 2.3 MB
ONSHORE AFTER BEING FLAT THE PAST SEVERAL EVENINGS.  AS A RESULT THE
STRATUS WILL BE MORE WIDESPREAD TNGT...MOVING FARTHER INLAND...AND
THERE SHOULD BE LESS DENSE FOG ALONG THE COAST.  MAX TEMPS COOLED OFF
TDA IN MOST AREAS...DRAMATICALLY AT SOME SPOTS NEAR THE OCEAN...AND
MAXES SHOULD BE A LITTLE COOLER AGAIN SAT AS OUR TROF IS KICKED
INLAND BY THE EWD MOVING STRONGER SYSTEM CURRENTLY BETWEEN 140/150. 
THIS LATTER TROF MAY BRING A FEW SHOWERS TO EXTREME NRN CA BY SAT
NIGHT...BUT NOT AS FAR S AS OUR FORECAST AREA.  FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE
OF THE KICKER...ALL MODELS REBUILD THE RIDGE OVER CA STARTING ON SUN
AND CONTINUING THRU THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK.  THIS WILL PUSH THE
STRATUS BACK TO THE BEACHES AND COMPRESS THE MARINE LAYER AGAIN...
THOUGH A WELL DEFINED OFFSHORE FLOW IS NEVER FORECAST BY THE MODELS. 
STRONG OFFSHORE FLOW HAS BEEN UNUSUALLY HARD TO COME BY THIS OCTOBER.

SEABREEZE AND COOLER TEMPS NEAR THE COAST. THE AVN AND ETA JUMP MORE

DIVES DOWN THE EAST SIDE OF THE RIDGE OVER THE ROCKIES. THE SURFACE
HIGH WILL STRENGTHEN ONCE AGAIN OVER THE GREAT BASIN IN RESPONSE.
LOOKS LIKE WELL BE BACK TO OFFSHORE PATTERN RELATIVELY SOON ONCE
AGAIN - ALTHOUGH AT THIS TIME IT IS NOT PROGGED TO HAVE QUITE THE
STRENGTH OF THIS LAST EPISODE.

AS FOR THE EXTENDED - IT STILL LOOKS RELATIVELY QUIET ALONG THE WEST

WEEK. AT THE SURFACE...A STRONG RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE PACIFIC
NORTHWEST WHILE A THERMAL TROUGH SETS UP NEAR THE CALIFORNIA COAST.
BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON THE NORTH TO SOUTH GRADIENT IS FORECAST BY THE
AVIATION AND ETA MODELS TO BE ABOUT 10 MB FROM ARCATA TO SAN
FRANCISCO. THE ONSHORE GRADIENT THIS EVENING IS STILL ABOUT 2 MB INTO
SACRAMENTO WITH WINDS OF 15 TO 25 MPH COMING IN THROUGH THE GOLDEN
GATE INTO THE SFO BAY. EXPECT THE WINDS TO START TO SHIFT MORE
NORTHERLY OVERNIGHT AND THEN NORTH TO NORTHEASTERLY BY LATE FRIDAY AS
THE OFFSHORE PATTERN DEVELOPS. WE SHOULD SEE DAYTIME HIGHS ON FRIDAY
INTO THE 90S IN THE WARMEST INLAND LOCATIONS AS THE WARMER AIRMASS
DEVELOPS OVER THE AREA. THE MODELS BUILD THE SURFACE RIDGE FROM THE
PACIFIC NORTHWEST INTO THE GREAT BASIN THROUGH SATURDAY AND THE WIND
PATTERN SHOULD SHIFT TO A MORE EAST TO SOUTHEASTERLY COMPONENT. THIS
WILL LIKELY MEAN SLIGHTLY WARMER HIGHS SATURDAY WITH A GOOD CHANCE OF
TEMPERATURES AT THE COAST REACHING INTO THE LOWER 80S. THE MODELS DO
NOT HINT THAT THE PATTERN EVEN COMES CLOSE TO BREAKING DOWN THROUGH
SUNDAY EITHER...SO MORE OF THE SAME TEMPERATURES THEN AS WELL. WHILE
IT MAY BECOME A LITTLE WARM WELL INLAND THIS WEEKEND I WOULD
DEFINITELY AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS METEOROLOGIST ON SHIFT THAT IT IS
SHAPING UP TO BE A GREAT BEACH WEEKEND ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST. THE
CURRENT FORECAST PACKAGE HAS THE SITUATION SET UP NICELY SO NO

THE CUTOFF IS APPROACHING PT CONCEPTION...MOVING ESEWD AND
ACCELERATING A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE WATER VAPOR PIX.  THE MODELS
HAVE HANDLED IT PRETTY WELL THE PAST 24 HOURS.  RADAR ECHOES ARE JUST
GRAZING EXTREME SWRN MRY COUNTY AND SHOULD BE WELL CLEAR OF OUR

SHOWERS IN THE EVENING ZONES.  THE CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CUTOFF

FORECAST AREA BY MIDNIGHT.  BELIEVE THAY WILL NOT BE REPLACED BY LOW
CLOUDS AS THE N-S GRADIENTS ARE INCREASING...6.1 MB ACV-SFO AT 20Z. 
THIS IS THE START OF A MODERATE OFFSHORE PATTERN.  LIGHT NE WINDS
ARE ALREADY DEVELOPING IN THE E BAY HILLS AND SHOULD GRADUALLY
INCREASE TNGT/FRI AS THE CUTOFF MOVES FARTHER FROM OUR AREA AND IS
REPLACED BY A N-NE FLOW ALOFT ON THE E SIDE OF A BIG...STRONG RIDGE.
BY SAT AFTN THE AVN AND ETA FORECAST 8-10 MB N-S GRADIENT FROM ACV TO
SFO...WITH 10-12 MB OFFSHORE WMC-SFO.

THIS RIDGE WILL DOMINATE OUR WEATHER THROUGH AT LEAST THE MIDDLE OF
NEXT WEEK.  1000-500 MB THICKNESSES AND 850 MB TEMPS ARE FORECAST TO
BE SIMILAR TO THOSE WE HAD LAST WEEKEND...SO EXPECT TEMPS TO BE ABOUT
THE SAME FROM THE COASTAL VALLEYS INLAND...I.E. MAXES SHOULD REACH 90
IN MANY SPOTS.  AS USUAL HOT CONDITIONS WILL BE MARGINAL ON THE COAST
BUT IF THE AVN IS CORRECT THERES A CHANCE THAT OFFSHORE FLOW COULD
PERSIST ALMOST ALL DAY ON SAT...SENDING MAXES WELL UP INTO THE 80S AT
THE BEACHES.  IF NOT ON SAT...IT COULD HAPPEN ON SUN AS THE AVN
FORECASTS A STRONG SELY FLOW THAT MRNG THAT WILL PROBABLY PERSIST

DAY AND THE ONSHORE GRADIENT HAS HELD AT ABOUT 1 MB. AVIATION AND ETA
MODELS MOVE THE THERMAL TROUGH...CURRENTLY INLAND CALIFORNIA...TO
THE COAST OVERNIGHT WHICH WILL KEEP THE LOW CLOUDS CONFINED TO THE

ONSHORE FLOW INCREASES. BEFORE THIS HAPPENS THOUGH THE DAYTIME HIGHS
FOR WEDNESDAY SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO INCREASE A FEW DEGREES OVER
TODAYS READINGS BEFORE THE AFTERNOON SEABREEZE SETS IN. THE UPPER
LEVEL CUFOFF LOW THAT HAS BEEN SITTING TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE AREA
CONTINUES THROUGH WEDNESDAY BEFORE THE MODELS MOVE IT EASTWARD AS AN
ELONGATED TROUGH. WITH THE INCREASE IN ONSHORE FLOW AND THE UPPER LOW
MOVING OVER THE AREA EXPECT AN INCREASE IN THE MARINE LAYER BY

THE ONSHORE PATTERN STRENGTHENS EVEN MORE THURSDAY AS A STRONG N-S
GRADIENT SETS IN AND LASTS THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THIS SHOULD LOWER OUR

ONLY ABOUT 1000 FEET DEEP.  SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENTS ARE LIGHT N-S
EKA-SFO-SBA...AND MODERATE ONSHORE FROM SFO-SAC...1.8 MB AT 09Z.  THE
WMC-SFO GRADIENT WAS A WEAK 2.5 MB OFFSHORE AT THAT TIME.

THE MODELS ARE FORECASTING THE N-S GRADIENT TO INCREASE SOMEWHAT TDA
BUT IT WILL STILL NOT EXCEED 3-4 MB ACV-SFO AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS
ONLY WEAKLY INTO THE PACIFIC NW.  THIS MEANS WE WILL HAVE SOME
ONSHORE FLOW ALL DAY.  THE AIRMASS IS FORECAST TO WARM A COUPLE

THE GOLDEN GATE NORTHWARD WEDNESDAY BUT LITTLE CHANGE SOUTH.


IN EXTENDED PERIOD...

ECMWF/NOGAPS/MRF ALL SHOW SFC RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD INTO PACIFIC
NORTHWEST ON THURSDAY AND INTO THE GREAT BASIN FRIDAY AND SATURDAY TO
PRODUCE OFFSHORE FLOW FOR DISTRICT. ANOTHER AREA OF LOW PRESSURE
BEGINS MOVING INTO PACIFIC NORTHWEST ON SATURDAY HELPS TO WEAKEN AND
PUSH THE RIDGE EASTWARD. 500 MB PATTERNS GENERALLY AGREE WITH THIS
SFC SCENARIO IN BRINGING SOME TYPE OF UPR TROUGH THROUGH THE WEST
COAST LATE THURSDAY...BUT EACH MODEL DIFFERS IN STRENGTH OF TROUGH
(PORTION OF TROUGH IS ACTUALLY LOW PRESSURE AREA CURRENTLY BEING CUT
OFF THE COAST NOW). STILL WITH THE SCENARIO BELIEVE WARM TEMPERATURES
WILL CONTINUE THURSDAY. THEN A COOLING TREND FRIDAY...AND WARMING
TREND AGAIN ON SATURDAY. STILL TIMING OF TEMPERATURES TRENDS VERY

THE WARM RIDGE IS HOLDING TENACIOUSLY OVER CA.  THERE IS A WELL
DEFINED CUTOFF LOW CENTERED NEAR 38/135.  IT APPEARS THIS SYSTEM IS
STRETCHING OUT FROM NE TO SW AS IT APPROACHES OUR RIDGE...WITH ALL
SIGINFICANT MOISTURE FROM IT STAYING N OF OUR FORECAST AREA.  THE 
SHORT WAVE CROSSING 50/140 IS FORECAST TO KICK OUT SOME ENERGY FROM
OUR CUTOFF TO THE NE TDA...WHILE THE MAIN SYSTEM SETS UP NEAR 35/132
IN A WEAKENED STATE.  

OUR SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN HAS ASSUMED A WEAK SLY SURGE
CONFIGURATION...WITH A SLIGHT S-N GRADIENT SBA-SFO.  THERE IS A WEAK
ONSHORE GRADIENT SFO-SAC.  THE FT ORD PROFILER SHOWS THAT THE MARINE
INVERSION IS WEAK...SHALLOW...AND POORLY DEFINED...THOUGH THE AIR
ALOFT HAS COOLED SLIGHTLY.  A STRATUS FIELD HAS DEVELOPED S OF PT SUR
AND PUSHED SLUGGISHLY NWD BUT IS HAVING TROUBLE MOVING N OF THAT
SPOT.  THE MODELS INDICATE THAT AS THE PORTION OF ENERGY LIFTING OUT
OF OUR CUTOFF PASSES THRU THE PACIFIC NW TDA...HIGH PRESSURE WILL
REBUILD TO SOME EXTENT OVER THAT AREA...INCREASING THE N-S GRADIENT
DOWN OUR COAST AGAIN THIS AFTN/TNGT.  THIS SHOULD CAUSE THE ALREADY
WEAK SLY SURGE TO FIZZLE OUT AND SHOULD CONFINE FOG/STRATUS TO AREAS
FROM PT REYES S...AND IT MAY NOT SPREAD N OF SFO.  

BOTTOM LINE IS A LITTLE COOLING TDA DUE TO THE SLIGHTLY STRONGER
ONSHORE FLOW AND SLIGHT AIRMASS COOLING...BUT MAXES SHOULD ONLY BE
DOWN 2-5 DEGREES EXCEPT IN SOME AREAS WITHIN ABOUT 5 MILES OF THE
OCEAN WHERE TEMPS COULD DROP AS MUCH AS 10 DEGREES.  WITH THE SURFACE
HIGH STRENGTHENING TO OUR N AGAIN ON TUE AND THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE
REBUILDING...MAXES SHOULD EDGE UP A FEW DEGREES AGAIN.  

IN THE MEDIUM RANGE...ALL MODELS EXCEPT THE CANADIAN KEEP THE CUTOFF
AT OR W OF 130W THRU WED AND MAINTAIN THE STRONG RIDGE OVER CA.  THUS
WED SHOULD BE ANOTHER VERY WARM DAY WITH ONLY A VERY SHALLOW MARINE
INVERSION AND WEAK ONSHORE FLOW.  AN APPROACHING INSIDE SLIDER TYPE
SHORT WAVE IS FORECAST TO DROP TOWARD THE GREAT BASIN/NRN ROCKIES ON
THU AND FINALLY KICK THE REMNANTS OF THE CUTOFF INLAND...WHICH SHOULD
RESULT IN COOLING OVER OUR AREA.  BY THIS TIME ALL MODELS EXCEPT THE
NOGAPS WEAKEN THE CUTOFF SUBSTANTIALLY.  ON FRI/SAT OUR AREA IS
FORECAST TO BE IN A NWLY FLOW ALOFT AS THE SLIDER PASSES TO THE E AND
S.  MODELS DIFFER IN THE STRENGTH AND CYCLONIC CURVATURE OF THE FLOW
BUT AT ANY RATE DRY WEATHER WILL CONTINUE...WITH TEMPS COOLER THAN

...3.9 MB ACV-SFO AT 09Z AND ONLY 0.4 MB SFO-SBA.  THERE IS A
MODERATE OFFSHORE GRADIENT OF 5 MB WMC-SFO...WITH A FLAT GRADIENT
FROM SF0-SAC.  EXCEPT FOR THE WEAKENING SFO-SBA GRADIENT THIS SETUP
IS LITTLE CHANGED FROM 24 HOURS AGO.  

THE MODELS FORECAST A SOMEWHAT STRONGER WLY FLOW ALOFT TODAY WITH
SLIGTLY LOWER 500 MB HEIGHTS...AND A MORE FAVORABLE ONSHORE PRESSURE
PATTERN IS ANTICIPATED TO DEVELOP THIS AFTN THAN YDA.  THUS...WILL
FORECAST SOME COOLING IN COASTAL AREAS ALTHOUGH CONDITIONS AT PRESENT
DONT INDICATE IT.  THE MARINE LAYER AT FT ORD IS ONLY 400-800 FEET
DEEP RIGHT NOW BUT SHOULD DEEPEN SOMEWHAT THIS AFTN IF THE MODELS ARE
ON THE RIGHT TRACK.  WELL INLAND THERE WILL BE ONLY MINIMAL COOLING. 
ON MON THE MODELS COOL THE AIRMASS A LITTLE MORE AND CONTINUE A WEAK

BUT TEMPS WILL STILL BE PLEASANT WITH 70S IN MOST SPOTS NEAR THE
OCEAN AND 80S INLAND.  AS FAR AS THE COASTAL CRUD IS CONCERNED...SOME
COULD FORM AT THE SHORELINE TNGT/MON MRNG DUE TO THE SLIGHTLY

HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN PACIFIC AND NORTHWESTERN UNITED STATES
CONTINUES TO PLOW A WIDE SWATH OF CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE REGION. A
FEW ALTOCUMULUS MOVING EAST OVER THE FORECAST AREA WILL BETRAY THE
PASSING OF A SLIGHT UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH...BUT NOTHING ELSE
OF CONSEQUENCE WILL OCCUR FROM ITS PASSAGE. MODELS ARE RELATIVELY
CONSISTANT...HOLDING A THERMAL TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA
VALLEY DURING THE DAY AND MOVING IT OFFSHORE OR NEAR SHORE DURING THE
EARLY MORNING HOURS.  THIS PATTERN CONTINUES THROUGH MONDAY...WITH
THE ATTENDANT OFFSHORE FLOW AND PAUCITY OF STRATUS ALONG THE COAST.
A SUBSIDENCE INVERSION ALSO BECOMES APPARENT BEGINNING JUST AFTER
SUNSET WITH TEMPERATURES AT 2000 FEET REMAINING AT OR ABOVE 82 DEG
F WHILE SURFACE TEMPERATURES NEAR SEA LEVEL AND IN PROTECTED VALLEYS
WILL DROP INTO 50S AND UPPER 40S.  SUNDAYS HIGHS WILL BE SIMILAR TO
SATURDAYS REFLECTING THE CONTINUATION OF THE HIGH PRESSURE OVER
CANADA AND THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES...SUNNY SKIES AND WEAK AFTERNOON

BOTH THE UK AND THE ECMWF MODELS WANT TO FORM A 5650 M CUT OFF LOW 
BETWEEN 135-131 W 35N WHILE THE MRF AMPLIFIES A SHORT WAVE INTO A CUT
OFF TO 140W BY 12Z MONDAY OF ONLY 5720 M. I FAVOR THE LATTER
INTERPRETATION AS THE MODEL PICKS UP THE ORIGIN OF THE DISTURBANCE
RATHER THAN SIMPLY RECOGNIZING IT AFTER THE FACT. ALSO A LOW OF THE
MAGNITUDES OF THE PREVIOUS MODELS WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY SOME
PRECIPITATION...WHICH IS NOT LIKELY THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. THIS LOW
IS EXPECTED TO SLIDE DOWN TO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BIGHT AREA BY
FRIDAY AFTERNOON. THE FACT THAT THE LOW WILL GO SOUTH FAVORS A
FORECAST OF LITTLE CHANGE IN TEMPERATURES HERE DURING THE WEEK...ONCE
A MODEST COOL DOWN OCCURS ON MONDAY. TEMPERATURES MONDAY WILL COOL AS

WARMING ALOFT...WITH THE MARINE LAYER REMAINING VERY SHALLOW...ONLY

THESE CONDITIONS INDICATE IT WILL BE ANOTHER HOT DAY ACROSS OUR

TOPPED OUT AROUND 80 ON FRI.  THE OFFSHORE GRADIENT IS FORECAST TO BE
REINFORCED SOMEWHAT TODAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE

WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO A LITTLE COOLER INLAND TEMPERATURES ON SUNDAY
ESPECIALLY IN THE COASTAL VALLEYS. STILL TOUGH TO TELL AT THIS TIME

PATTERN AND AIRMASS WARMING...EXPECT INLAND LOCATIONS TO SEE HIGHS
2-5 DEGREES HIGHER TDA...PUTTING THEM UP NEAR 90 INLAND.  THE MODELS
FORECAST THE SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN TO FLATTEN BY MID AFTN WHICH

ALOFT IS FORECAST TO INCREASE AND BACK TO SWLY IN ADVANCE OF A
STRONGER SHORT WAVE APPROACHING FROM THE W.  THIS SHOULD PRODUCE A

A MODERATE OFFSHORE FLOW PREVAILS OVER OUR FORECAST AREA.  AT 09Z THE
ACV-SFO GRADIENT WAS 5.1 MB N-S...WITH A FLAT GRADIENT SFO-SAC AND
8.7 MB OFFSHORE WMC-SFO.  THE FORT ORD PROFILER SHOWED GOOD WARMING
ALOFT WITH A VERY SHALLOW LOW LEVEL INVERSION...ONLY ABOUT 500 FEET
DEEP.  WITH THE OFFSHORE PATTERN AND AIRMASS WARMING...EXPECT INLAND
LOCATIONS TO SEE MAXES 2-5 DEGREES HIGHER TDA...PUTTING THEM UP NEAR
90 IN SPOTS LIKE SANTA ROSA AND LIVERMORE.  THE MODELS FORECAST THE
SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN TO FLATTEN BY MID AFTN WHICH WILL ALLOW A
SEABREEZE TO KICK IN...THOUGH IT WILL BE WEAK AND LATE.  THIS SHOULD
HOLD COASTAL TEMPS DOWN SOMEWHAT...THOUGH THEY WILL BE PLEASANTLY UP
IN THE 70S IN MOST PLACES.  WITH THE STRONG...SHALLOW MARINE
INVERSION EXPECTED TNGT WE COULD SEE PATCHY FOG RETURN TO THE COAST
...MAINLY S OF THE GOLDEN GATE WHERE THE N-S GRADIENT WILL BE VERY
WEAK OR NONEXISTENT.

BY LATE SAT THE MODELS FORECAST A LOW AMPLITUDE SHORT WAVE TO SWEEP
THRU THE PACIFIC NW.  THIS WILL CAUSE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE TO
REBUILD OVER THAT AREA...REINFORCING OUR OFFSHORE GRADIENT.  THUS SAT
WILL BE ANOTHER SUNNY...WARM DAY...EXCEPT FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED
PATCHY COASTAL FOG.  BY SUN THE FLOW ALOFT IS FORECAST TO INCREASE
AND BACK TO SWLY IN ADVANCE OF A STRONGER SHORT WAVE APPROACHING FROM
THE W.  THIS SHOULD INDUCE A STRONGER ONSHORE FLOW WHICH WILL COMBINE
WITH LOWER 500 MB HEIGHTS TO BRING US SOME COOLING THAT DAY... 
ESPECIALLY NEAR THE OCEAN.

IN THE LONGER RANGE WE HAVE A WIDE CHOICE OF MODELS...EVEN WITHOUT A
NEW MRF RUN.  THE NOGAPS BRINGS THE SUN SHORT WAVE THRU NRN CA
RAPIDLY THAT EVENING WITH FAIRLY LOW AMPLITUDE...WITH RIDGING
REBUILDING BY MON AFTN.  THE CANADIAN IS SLOWER AND DEEPER BUT STILL
SWEEPS THE SYSTEM THRU AS AN OPEN TROF BY 12Z MON FOLLOWED BY
RIDGING.  ON THE OTHER HAND...THE EURO TURNS THIS SYSTEM INTO A
CUTOFF LOW WHICH GENERATES A LONG PERIOD OF SWLY FLOW ALOFT BEFORE
PLODDING INSIDE 130W BY WED...WITH LOWER HEIGHTS AND A SELY FLOW OVER
OUR REGION.  THE UK ALSO CUTS OFF THE SYSTEM BUT LANGUISHES IT WELL W
OF 130 THRU WED...MAINTAINING A STRONG RIDGE OVER CA THRU THE
EXTENDED PERIOD.  SINCE WE HAVE BEEN IN A PATTERN WITH A W COAST
RIDGE...AND THE LAST SYSTEM SPLIT TO SOME DEGREE AS IT PASSED THRU...
A SOLUTION LIKE THE CANADIAN MODEL...ONLY A LITTLE STRONGER AND

FROM MRY BAY S...WITH DECREASING STRATUS. HOWEVER...FROM SFO N THE

MAINTAIN A MASSIVE STRATUS FIELD THAT WILL SURGE INLAND AGAIN TNGT. 
MOISTURE IS SPARSE ABOVE THE MARINE LAYER WITH THIS SYSTEM AND EXPECT
NO RAIN WITH IT EXCEPT POSSIBLY SOME COASTAL DRIZZLE.  THERE IS A
GOOD SWLY JET WITH THE TROF BUT THE AIRMASS IS TOO DRY FOR THE JET TO
GENERATE ANYTHING EXCEPT CIRRUS.  ON TUE AFTN WE SHOULD SEE MOST
STRATUS DISPERSE AS COLD ADVECTION ALOFT WEAKENS THE MARINE INVERSION
SUBSTANTIALLY.  

THE KICKER...THE TROF MOVING OUR CURRENT SYSTEM NEWD...IS A MUCH
STRONGER SYSTEM.  IT WILL APPROACH THE NRN CA COAST TUE EVENING WITH
STRONG POSITIVE VORTICITY ADVECTION (PVA).  THE ETA FORECASTS A

WATER VAPOR SATELLITE LOOP SHOWS SHORTWAVE RIDGE ALOFT OVER CA HAS
SHIFTED INLAND AND CLOSED UPPER LOW OFFSHORE HAS BEGUN TO LIFT TO THE

FORECAST...PARTICULARLY THE AVN. 12Z NAVY COAMPS MODEL AND 00Z ETA
HAVE A SLOWER...AND MUCH BETTER HANDLE ON TIMING AND WILL FOLLOW
THEIR GUIDANCE.

WHAT SLOWER MOVEMENT MEANS IN THE SHORT TERM IS A DELAY IN THE
DEEPENING OF THE MARINE LAYER. REGARDLESS...NOW THAT RIDGE AXIS HAS
MOVED INLAND...MARINE LAYER WILL BEGIN TO DEEPEN AND CONTINUE TO DO
SO THROUGH MONDAY. THERE ARE ALREADY SIGNS ON THE FT ORD PROFILER
THAT THIS PROCESS IS UNDERWAY. AS LOW MOVES NE...SWLY FLOW WILL
INCREASE AT ALL LEVELS. INCREASING SWLY FLOW COINCIDENT WITH A
DEEPENING MARINE LAYER MEANS VERY EFFICIENT TRANSPORT OF MARINE AIR
INLAND DURING THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS. SO EXPECT SLOW CLEARING OF LOW
CLOUDS DURING THE DAY...ESPECIALLY IN THE N SFO BAY AREA WHERE SLY
FLOW WILL ENHANCE MARINE AIR INFLUX. WITH LATER CLEARING AND STRONG
MARINE PUSH...EXPECT TEMPS TO BE COOLER IN MOST AREAS ON MONDAY. WILL
ADJUST ZONES TO REFLECT THIS.

AS LOW OPENS UP INTO OPEN WAVE AND MOVES INLAND MONDAY NIGHT...SOME
LIGHT PRECIP IS POSSIBLE ON THE NRN CA COAST. BUT COAMPS AND ETA
MODELS CONFINE MEASURABLE PRECIP TO COASTAL AREAS N OF PT ARENA...SO
WILL KEEP POPS AT SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE FAR NRN PORTION OF DISTRICT.
ANY PRECIP THAT FALLS WILL MOST LIKELY BE IN THE FORM OF DRIZZLE NEAR
THE COAST AS MARINE LAYER DEEPENS.

BETTER CHANCE OF MEASURABLE PRECIP COMES ON TUESDAY NIGHT AS RATHER
IMPRESSIVE SYSTEM NEARING 150W/45N MOVES INTO THE PAC NW AND DRAGS A
COLD FRONT ACROSS NRN CA. AVN/MRF ARE MORE ROBUST WITH THIS SYSTEM

TOWARD S-N GRADIENTS AS THE CUTOFF LOW CURRENTLY NEAR 38/140 BEGINS
TO MOVE EWD...KICKED BY A STRONG TROF CURRENTLY S OF THE ALEUTIANS. 
THIS PATTERN SHOULD RESULT IN A LITTLE ADDITIONAL COOLING IN MOST

TEND TO CLEAR LOW CLOUDS OUT HERE.  

THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS DIFFER WIDELY ON HANDLING THE EJECTION OF
THE CUTOFF.  THE AVN IS STRONGEST AND FASTEST...DEEPENING IT AND
MOVING IT ONTO THE NRN CA COAST BY MON AFTN.  IT FORECASTS A PERIOD
OF FAVORABLE DYNAMICS IN FAR NRN CA MON MRNG WITH STRONG THICKNESS
DIFFLUENCE AND A GOOD JETMAX PASSING THRU THAT AREA.  THE OTHER
MODELS ARE DIFFERENT.  THE NOGAPS IS SLOWER THAN THE AVN...THE UK AND
CANADIAN ARE WEAKER...AND THE EURO IS WEAKER AND SLOWER.  A BLEND OF
THESE SOLUTIONS...A LITTLE WEAKER AND SLOWER THAN THE AVN...WOULD
GIVE THE FAR N A CHANCE OF SHOWERS...NOTHING VERY SIGNIFICANT...LATE
MON/EARLY TUE AND WILL USE THAT IN THE EXTENDED FORECAST.  THE
TRAILING KICKER IS MOVED THRU NRN CA AS A LOW AMPLITUDE TROF ON TUE
BY ALL MODELS EXCEPT THE UK...WHICH LAGS IT BEHIND AND FORECASTS IT

COAST AND EVEN OFFSHORE REMAINS SOUTH OF THE GOLDEN GATE. STRATUS IS
EXPECTED TO ADVANCE UP TO POINT REYES TONIGHT...BUT MOST GRADIENTS
ACROSS THE STATE ARE WEAK. THE SURFACE TROUGH UP THROUGH 850 MB IS
CLOSE TO THE COAST AND IS FORECAST TO EXTEND TO BEYOND THE COAST
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW.  THIS SHOULD ASSIST THE NORTHWARD ADVANCE OF

THE MRF FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON...IT IS TYPICALLY A WET MODEL AND THE
ATMOSPHERE HAS BEEN DRY. THE ARIZONA MONSOON HAS SHUT OFF AND NO

LOW PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE OF 1019.9 MB IS NOW OVER CONCORD
CALIFORNIA. WINDS ARE CALM OR VERY LIGHT OVER ALL OF OUR FORECAST
AREA. STRATUS ALONG THE COAST EXTENDED AS FAR NORTH ALONG THE COAST
AS THE SAN FRANCISCO PENINSULA. SMOKE WAS ALSO A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE
WEATHER SCENARIO TODAY...VISIBILITIES WERE ONLY 5 MILES IN SALINAS
AND SEVERAL OTHER STATIONS AROUND THE AREA WERE REPORTING SMOKE
LAYERS.

THE LATEST MODELS ARE SHOWING THE REX BLOCK FORMING IN THE GULF OF 
ALASKA AND SOUTH ALONG 140 WEST AS ADVERTISED YESTERDAY. THIS
ALIGNMENT OF UPPER HIGH NORTH OF AN UPPER LOW WILL CAUSE THE JET AT
MID AND UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO SHUNT NORTHWARD SO THAT
BY FRIDAY THE STRONGEST WINDS WILL BE JUST INLAND AND PARALLEL TO
COASTAL CANADA. OF COURSE REX BLOCKS ALSO PUSH SOME OF THE FLOW SOUTH
OF THE LOW CAUSING SOME WEAK RIDGING TO CONTINUE OVER CALIFORNIA.
PRESSURES AT THE SURFACE OVER CALIFORNIA ARE DIFFUSE AND WEAK WITH A
STRONG HIGH NEAR QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLAND AND LOW PRESSURE OSCILLATING
BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN INLAND AND NORTH COASTAL CALIFORNIA. THESE
WEAK GRADIENTS AND OFFSHORE TENDENCIES FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILL
ONLY ALLOW SLOW ADVANCE OF THE STRATUS LAYER NORTHWARD AND CONTINUE
THE VERY WARM TEMPERATURES INLAND. ALTHOUGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE
SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN YESTERDAY THEY WILL REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL.  

REX BLOCKS ARE FAIRLY STABLE CONFIGURATIONS FOR THE ATMOSPHERE...SO
CHANGE WILL BE SLOW AND AIR QUALITY WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO
DETERIORATE SOMEWHAT TODAY AND TOMORROW...ESPECIALLY WITH FOUR PLUS
MAJOR FIRES IN THE STATE. THE MRF CONTINUES TO DEVELOP THE CUTOFF LOW
THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...BUT MOVES IT BETWEEN POINT ARENA AND CAPE

ABOUT HALF MOON BAY SOUTHWARD BUT WITH LITTLE EVIDENCE OF ANY
NORTHWARD ADVANCEMENT.  CONDITIONS AT SFO AT 03Z VERY SIMILAR TO LAST
NIGHT WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN SFO TO SAC PRESSURE GRADIENT WHICH
REMAINS NEARLY FLAT.  WINDS AT LAS TRAMPAS RAWS SITE IN EAST BAY
HILLS STILL OFFSHORE THOUGH NOT QUITE AS STRONG AS AT THIS TIME
YESTERDAY.  FT ORD PROFILER ALSO SHOWS LITTLE CHANGE FROM THIS TIME
YESTERDAY EVENING.

HAVE ONLY JUST RECEIVED OUTPUT FROM 00Z RUNS OF ETA AND NGM...SO
LITTLE TIME TO CAREFULLY EXAMINE.  ETA SUGGESTS DRAMATIC INCREASE IN
ONSHORE PRESSURE GRADIENT THURSDAY AFTERNOON WHILE NGM INDICATES
WEAKER ONSHORE FLOW.  OVERALL INDICATION IS THAT COOLING MAY BE LESS
DRAMATIC THAN PRESENT FORECASTS INDICATE.  COULD WELL BE ONE OF THOSE
DAYS WHERE DOWNTOWN SFO WARMS RAPIDLY IN THE MORNING HOURS WITH TEMP
PEAKING BY NOON AND THEN COOLS WITH ONSET OF SEA BREEZE IN

AVOID POSSIBLE FLIP-FLOP IN FORECASTS...HOWEVER...WILL REFRAIN FROM
UPDATING ZONES AT THIS TIME AND LET MIDNIGHT SHIFT CONSIDER SITUATION
FROM VANTAGE OF ALL NEW MODEL OUTPUT AND WEATHER OBSERVATIONS OVER

INCREASE IN ONSHORE FLOW.  DETAILS OF EVOLUTION SUNDAY AND MONDAY
VARY SIGNFICICANTLY BETWEEN LONGER RANGE MODELS WITH NOGAPS BRINGING

TAIL OF TROUGH IN REGION OF CENTRAL CALIF.  BOTH MODELS...AND
ECMWF...THEN SUGGEST SUBSEQUENT UPPER TROUGH TO APPROACH FROM WEST
EARLY PART OF THE WEEK...BUT SPEED AND INTENSITY VARY DRAMATICALLY.

PRESSURE GRADIENTS ARE ALMOST FLAT UP AND DOWN THE NRN/CNTRL CA COAST

GREAT BASIN TO THE COAST.  THE MARINE LAYER AT FT ORD IS A LITTLE
DEEPER THAN 24 HOURS AGO BUT STILL VERY SHALLOW...500-1000 FEET ON
THE PROFILER.  STRATUS HAS CREPT UP TO PT REYES BUT IS BOGGING DOWN

VERY TOUGH IN COASTAL AREAS.  FOR EXAMPLE...AT 1 AM IT WAS 52 DEGREES

THE MARINE LAYER HAS DEEPENED THE PAST SEVERAL HRS ON THE CENTRAL

RESPECTIVELY. THE THERMAL TROF WHICH WAS NEAR THE COAST EARLIER THIS

INLAND ON THU PER ETA. 1000-850 MB THICKNESSES ARE FORECAST TO RISE
SOMEWHAT WED...THEN FALL THU AS BUILDING HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE ERN

WOULD BRING EVEN COOLER AIR TO THE AREA AT THAT TIME. THIS COOLER AIR
WOULD LAST INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...AFTER WHICH TIME AN EVEN STRONGER

FOG HAS PROGRESSED NORTHWARD UP THE COAST TODAY ABOUT AS THE MODELS
HAD FORECAST. SO WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW MODEL GUIDANCE ON
DEVELOPMENT OF SLY FLOW AT THE COAST WHICH WOULD BRING FOG AS FAR N
AS PT ARENA AND BEYOND OVERNIGHT. WITH HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE ALOFT
REMAINING STRONG...MARINE LAYER WILL CONTINUE TO BE SHALLOW AND
INLAND ADVANCE OF FOG WILL BE LIMITED. ALSO...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
OVER THE GREAT BASIN REMAINS STRONG AND OFFSHORE TENDENCIES WILL
CONTINUE INTO WED MORNING...KEEPING SEABREEZES LIGHT AND CONFINED TO
THE AREAS VERY CLOSE TO THE OCEAN. GRADIENT FROM NEVADA TO THE COAST
HAS RELAXED SOMEWHAT AND WINDS IN THE EAST BAY HILLS HAVE DIMINISHED.
HOWEVER...SOME TIGHTENING OF THE GRADIENT OVERNIGHT SHOULD INCREASE
THE EASTERLY WINDS A BIT BEFORE THEY DROP OFF ON WEDNESDAY. SLY WINDS
AND COASTAL FOG WILL MEAN COOLER TEMPS ON WED FOR AREAS NEAR THE
COAST AND ALL COASTAL VALLEYS OPEN TO SLY FLOW. MOST INLAND AREAS
WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY MARINE AIR ON WEDNESDAY AND WILL CONTINUE
VERY WARM. BY THURSDAY...SHORTWAVE TROF WILL DROP INTO THE PACIFIC NW

WILL DEVELOP OVER THE ENTIRE REGION. CONSEQUENTLY...COOLING WILL
OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT THURSDAY.

DISTRICT THIS MORNING. ALTHOUGH N-S GRADIENT FROM ACV TO SFO HAS
RELAXED A BIT SINCE YESTERDAY...THE E-W OFFSHORE GRADIENT FROM WCM TO
SFO IS AT A WHOPPING 17.3 MB. THIS OFFSHORE GRADIENT WILL ALLOW WARM
AIR TO REACH ALL THE WAY TO THE OCEAN NORTH OF MRY BAY ONCE AGAIN
TODAY. HOWEVER...DONT EXPECT MAX TEMPS TO BE ANY WARMER THAN
YESTERDAY AS FT ORD PROFILER AND RIDGE TOP TEMP SENSORS INDICATE
SLIGHTLY COOLER AIRMASS ALOFT. EASTERLY WINDS IN THE E BAY HILLS
CONTINUE TO GUST IN EXCESS OF 40 MPH...BUT THESE SHOULD EASE OFF THIS
AFTERNOON AS GREAT BASIN SURFACE HIGH SHIFTS A BIT EAST AND GRADIENT
RELAXES. GRADIENT IS FORECAST TO INCREASE A BIT AGAIN TONIGHT...BUT
DONT EXPECT WINDS IN E BAY HILLS TO INCREASE TO LEVELS OF THE PAST
COUPLE OF NIGHTS ALTHOUGH WINDS IN THE HILLS OF MONTEREY AND SAN
BENITO COUNTIES WILL INCREASE A BIT AS GRADIENT INCREASES FURTHER S.

PRIMARY FORECAST CONCERNS TODAY AND WEDNESDAY IS SOUTHERLY SURGE OF
FOG UP THE COAST AND TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS. PERSISTANT MONTEREY
COUNTY COAST FOG BANK HAS EDGED A LITTLE FURTHER N OVERNIGHT AND HAS
MADE IT AS FAR N AS THE OUTER MONTEREY BAY. WINDS AT BUOY 42...MRY

SHALLOW MARINE LAYER WILL BE MINIMAL TODAY...MAINLY AFFECTING COASTAL

ACV-SFO.  THE WMC-SFO GRADIENT HAD STRENGTHENED TO 15.8 MB...THIS
GRADIENT IS OVERDONE SOMETIMES BY THE MODELS BUT THEY ARE DOING WELL
ON IT THIS TIME.  OTHER GRADIENTS...SFO-SAC...SFO-SBA...AND MRY-SBA

THE NRN EDGE OF THE STRATUS HAS CONTINUED TO HANG AROUND THE BIG
SUR-MRY BAY AREA FOR OVER 24 HOURS.  CURRENTLY ITS EDGING SLOWLY

COULD MOVE N TO THE SAN MATEO COAST TDA BUT PROBABLY NO FARTHER.  THE
GOOD SOUTHERLY SURGE IS STILL ON TAP FOR TNGT/WED...AND BY MIDDAY WED
THE CRUD SHOULD PASS PT REYES AND WILL PROBABLY GO AS FAR N AS PT

SANTA CRUZ AND SANTA ROSA.  THE SEABREEZE WILL BE WEAK AND LATE AGAIN

NEARLY THE SAME COASTAL PATTERN AS YESTERDAY. ST/FOG HAS DRIED OUT
SWD ALONG THE COAST TO POINT SUR UNDER A VERY SHALLOW MARINE LAYER.
THE FOG WILL LIKELY TURN AROUND AFTER MIDNIGHT AND MOVE BACK TO THE N

HEIGHTS CHANGE VERY LITTLE OVER THE CENTRAL COAST THRU WED...ALTHOUGH
A SURFACE HIGH IS FORECAST TO BUILD AND MOVE INTO THE NRN ROCKIES 
TUE AM. THIS WILL RESULT IN NE WINDS OF 15 TO 30 MPH CONTINUING IN
THE E BAY HILLS INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON BEFORE THE HIGH WEAKENS.
MODERATE NW WINDS OVER THE CENTRAL COAST WATERS ARE FORECAST TO
BECOME LIGHT SLY TUE PM AS A WEAK SLY SURGE DEVELOPS. THE OLDER AVN
MOVES THIS SURGE NWD TO POINT ARENA BY WED PM...00Z ETA NOT AVAILABLE

UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT AND A MODERATELY STRONG

DISTRICT TODAY. THE ONLY EXCEPTION WAS COASTAL MONTEREY
COUNTY...WHERE A NEUTRAL GRADIENT ALLOWED FOG TO HUG THE COAST AND
KEEP TEMPS FROM RISING MORE THAN A FEW DEGREES OVER YESTERDAY.
PRIMARY FORECAST CONCERNS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS IS WEAKENING OF
OFFSHORE FLOW...DEVELOPMENT OF SOUTHERLY FLOW ALONG THE COAST...AND
TIMING OF RESULTANT COOLING AT THE COAST AND SUBSEQUENT COOLING
FURTHER INLAND. OFFSHORE GRADIENT FORECAST TO REMAIN STRONG THROUGH
TONIGHT...BUT THEN BEGIN TO WEAKEN ON TUE. ALSO...WITH LOW PRESSURE
TROF MOVING OFFSHORE TONIGHT...SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL BEGIN TO DEVELOP.
ALREADY SEEING SLY WINDS ALONG THE SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY COAST. ETA
AND AVN DEVELOP SLY FLOW AS FAR N AS SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BY TUE
AFTERNOON AND THEN NORTH TO SONOMA COUNTY BY EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING.
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT REMAINS FIRMLY IN CONTROL THROUGH
WEDNESDAY...SO AREAS UNAFFECTED BY MARINE INFLUENCE WILL CONTINUE
VERY WARM. CHANGES IN SURFACE GRADIENTS WILL BRING SOME COOLING NEAR

MORE PRONOUNCED COOLING ALONG THE ENTIRE COAST ON WED WITH SOME
COOLING INTO THE COASTAL VALLEYS...PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH EXPOSURE

ON THE 12Z OAK SOUNDING IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO YESTERDAY MORNING...WE
HAVE A STRONGER OFFSHORE PATTERN IN PLACE. CURRENTLY THE OFFSHORE
GRADIENT IS A HEALTHY 12 MB FROM WCM TO SFO. IN ADDITION...THE
SFO-SAC GRADIENT HAS RECENTLY TURNED OFFSHORE (0.5 MB). TEMPS ARE
GENERALLY RUNNING A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN AT THIS TIME YESTERDAY
AND NE WINDS IN THE EAST BAY HILLS ARE GUSTING IN EXCESS OF 40 MPH.
BECAUSE TEMPS OFF THE SURFACE ARE VERY SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY...DONT
EXPECT MORE THAN A DEGREE OR TWO OF WARMING WELL INLAND.
HOWEVER...NEAR THE COAST...WARMING WILL BE MORE
PRONOUNCED...ESPECIALLY IN THE SRN PORTION OF THE DISTRICT WHERE

THE BATTLE BETWEEN ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE FLOW GOES ON.  IN MOST SPOTS
THE OFFSHORE IS WINNING.  AT 09Z...THE WMC-SFO GRADIENT WAS A HEALTHY
9.2 MB...NOT QUITE AS MUCH AS THE 12 MB FORECAST BY THE AVN BUT STILL
STRONG.  THE ACV-SFO GRADIENT WAS ABOUT 8 MB.  THE FORT ORD PROFILER
SHOWED A VERY SHALLOW MARINE LAYER...ONLY ABOUT 500 FEET DEEP.  AND
NE WINDS WERE BLOWING ABOUT 15-30 MPH AT SEVERAL SPOTS IN THE E BAY
HILLS.  MORE MARGINAL SIGNS WERE A CONTINUING ONSHORE GRADIENT SFO-
SAC...ABOUT 1 MB...AND ONLY 5 KTS OF N WINDS AT TRAVIS.  STILL...
THESE PARAMETERS ARE AS GOOD OR BETTER FOR OFFSHORE FLOW THAN AT THIS
TIME YESTERDAY MRNG...SO EXPECT ANOTHER CLEAR...HOT DAY OVER MOST OF
THE FORECAST AREA.  THE WARMTH OF THE AIRMASS IS FORECAST TO CHANGE
LITTLE SO EXPECT TEMPS AROUND PERSISTENCE WELL INLAND...WITH COASTAL
VALLEYS AS WARM AS THEIR INLAND COUNTERPARTS DUE TO THE WEAK...LATE
SEABREEZE.  TEMPS ON THE IMMEDIATE COAST WILL BE TRICKY.  IN MOST
AREAS...EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN COOLER THAN THE INTERIOR DUE TO THE
LACK OF A STRONG LOW LEVEL OFFSHORE FLOW.  TO GET THE COAST HOT WE
WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN OFFSHORE GRADIENT FROM SAC TO SFO...AND AN ELY
COMPONENT TO THE WINDS ALOFT.  HOWEVER...IT SHOULD GET PRETTY WARM
AT THE WFO HERE IN MONTEREY...ABOUT A MILE INLAND AND SHELTERED FROM
THE SEABREEZE BY THE RIDGE BETWEEN CARMEL AND MONTEREY.  WE HAVENT
HIT 90 HERE SINCE NOV 2 1997...BUT JUST MIGHT TURN THE TRICK TODAY
AND/OR TUE.  SOME FOG REMAINS ON THE COAST S OF POINT SUR.  THE
MRY-SBA GRADIENT IS ONLY ABOUT 1 MB N-S.  THE ETA AND AVN SUGGEST A
LITTLE STRONGER NLY PUSH WILL DEVELOP THIS AFTN...SO EXPECT THE FOG
TO CLEAR THROUGHOUT MRY COUNTY DURING THE DAY.
  
ONE FEATURE WE ARE WATCHING IS A SHORT WAVE DROPPING SEWD THRU CNTRL
B.C.  THE MODELS FORECAST THIS TO REINFORCE THE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
IN THE GREAT BASIN TNGT/TUE...SO TUE WILL PROBABLY SEE THE BEST
OFFSHORE FLOW OF THIS WARM SPELL.  HOWEVER...BY TUE AFTN THE LOW
LEVEL FLOW IS FORECAST TO TURN DECISIVELY SE ON THE CNTRL CA COAST. 
THIS SHOULD SET UP A SOUTHERLY SURGE FOR TUE NIGHT/WED WHICH WILL
BRING FOG AND MARINE AIR BACK UP THE COAST.  EXPECT DRASTIC COOLING
AT SANTA CRUZ ON WED WITH A GOOD DROP AT OTHER COASTAL LOCATIONS AS
WELL.  IN THIS MORNINGS FORECAST WE ARE BANKING ON THE B.C. SHORT
WAVE TO ENHANCE THE OFFSHORE FLOW TNGT AND DELAY THE SLY SURGE 12-24
HOURS.  IF THE B.C. FEATURE FIZZLES OUT WE COULD SEE THE SURGE BEGIN
TNGT BUT DUE TO MODEL UNANIMITY WE WILL DELAY IT TIL TUE NGT.  

IN THE LONGER RANGE...THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ALL KEEP A WARM RIDGE
OVER CA THRU THU...THOUGH WITH BETTER ONSHORE FLOW.  AFTER THAT THE
MRF DRIVES ANOTHER INSIDE SLIDER SEWD THRU THE GREAT BASIN...WHICH
WOULD REJUVENATE THE OFFSHORE FLOW ALBEIT WITH COOLER AIR.  THE OTHER
MODELS...EURO/UK/CANADIAN/NOGAPS...HANDLE THIS SLIDER DIFFERENTLY...
MOVING IT MORE SLOWLY AND KEEPING IT FARTHER N...WITH A CONTINUING
ZONAL FLOW OVER CA.  THIS WOULD KEEP AN ONSHORE COMPONENT TO OUR FLOW
THRU THE EXTENDED PERIOD.  THE MRF COULD OUTFOX THE OTHER MODELS AND
VERIFY...ITS FORECAST IS A CONTINUATION OF THE CURRENT PATTERN WHICH
IS A COMMON ONE AT THIS TIME OF YEAR...BUT FOR NOW WILL GO WITH THE

NICE DAY THROUGHOUT THE CWFA TODAY WITH TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM 4
TO 14 DEGREES WARMER THAN YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME. MORNING FORECAST
UPDATE WARMED TEMPERATURES...BUT NOT ENOUGH. RECEIVED REPORTS
EARLIER FROM THE CITY OF TEMPERATURES NEARING 80 DEGREES...BUT A
LIGHT SEABREEZE HAS SINCE COOLED THE DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO SENSOR
OFF TO 67 LAST HOUR. 

SUBSIDENCE AND DRYING INFLUENCE FROM THE NORTH IS FINALLY
DETERIORATING THE COASTAL STRATUS. VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS
THAT IT IS COMPLETELY CLEAR FROM PT REYES NORTHWARD WITH THE SOUTHERN
CLOUDS RAPIDLY DIMINISHING AS WELL. HOWEVER...THERE ARE SOME LOW
CLOUDS SPLOOSHING INTO THE MARINA AREA IN MONTEREY BAY AT THIS
TIME...BUT SHOULD NOT PERSIST. AS HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES OVER THE
REGION FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS...AND WITH THE THERMAL TROUGH EXPECTED
TO LINGER NEAR THE COAST THROUGH MONDAY...THE AREA WILL REMAIN MOSTLY
STRATUS-FREE...EXCEPT RIGHT AT THE COAST...MAINLY SOUTHERN AREAS.
TEMPERATURES WILL BE AS WARM OR A TAD WARMER TOMORROW ACROSS THE
BOARD WITH SIMILAR TEMPS ON TAP FOR MONDAY. MINIMUM TEMPS TONIGHT
WILL ALSO BE ON THE MILD SIDE AS THICKNESSES ARE FORECAST TO INCREASE
SOMEWHAT OVER THE AREA.

MEDIUM RANGE PROGS ARE A LITTLE SLOWER IN BREAKING DOWN THE UPPER

OF THE HIGHS A TAD AND ALSO SPRUCE UP SOME OF THE SKY CONDITIONS.

PERHAPS MORE CRITICAL WILL BE DEVELOPING OFFSHORE WINDS TODAY AND
TOMORROW. 12Z PROGS...AT LEAST WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF THEM...DEFINITELY
HAVE AN OFFSHORE COMPONENT TO THE WIND FORECAST FOR TODAY. SIMILAR
TO YESTERDAY...THE NGM IS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THEIR INTERPRETATION
GIVING NEARLY 30 KT OF NORTHEASTERLY WIND TO THE SFO BAY AREA BY
TONIGHT. BOTH THE ETA AND MESO ETA SEEM MORE REASONABLE IN THEIR
PLACEMENT OF THE THERMAL TROUGH...AND KEEP WINDS LIGHT AND MORE OUT

AN INTERESTING WEATHER NOTE...VISIBLE SATELLITE LOOPS THIS AFTN
SHOWED A SMOKE PLUME FROM THE FOREST FIRE UP IN TRINITY COUNTY 
STARTING OUT MOVING DUE S...THEN TURNING MORE TOWARD THE SW AS IT
MOVED SOUTHWARD PAST POINT ARENA.  THE ETA MODEL FORECAST WINDS FOR
925...850...AND 700 MB VALID AT 00Z SAT INDICATED A SLIGHT VEERING
WITH HEIGHT...WHICH MESHED NICELY WITH THE TRAJECTORY OF THE PLUME AS
IT MOVED SWD AND PRESUMABLY ROSE HIGHER INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

IN OTHER WEATHER NEWS...THE FORT ORD PROFILER AND OAK EVENING RAOB
INDICATE THE MARINE LAYER CONTINUES 1200-1500 FEET DEEP.  THE N-S
PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN ACV AND SFO IS INCREASING...5.2 MB AT 03Z. 
A GRADIENT OF THIS MAGNITUDE USUALLY KEEPS THE STRATUS OUT OF SFO
BAY.  EARLY RETURNS ON THIS ARE MIXED...ON THE ONE HAND THE CLOUDS
ARE CLEARING OFF THE SONOMA COAST AS THEY SHOULD DO IN A
STRENGTHENING NLY FLOW...BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY REMAIN IN THE BAY
OVER THE BERKELEY HILLS PER FOG PRODUCT PIX.  THE AFTN ZONES HAD
AREAS OF CRUD IN THE BAY OVERNIGHT AND WILL NOT CHANGE.  

THE NEW ETA MATCHES PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS IN RAISING 500 MB HEIGHTS
OVER OUR REGION THIS WEEKEND.  THE ETA FORECASTS AN ONSHORE FLOW
AGAIN SAT AFTN BUT THE SEABREEZE SHOULD KICK IN LATER IN THE DAY...
ALLOWING WARMING IN MOST AREAS.  INCREASING 850 MB TEMPS AND 1000-500
MB THICKNESSES ALSO FOLLOW THIS TREND.  WITH THE MARINE LAYER
COMPRESSING AND THE ACV-SFO GRADIENT CONTINUING TO INCREASE...DONT
EXPECT ANY STRATUS IN THE BAY SAT NIGHT.  BY SUN MRNG THE MODELS MOVE
THE SURFACE THERMAL TROF TO THE COASTLINE...EDGING IT ONLY GRUDGINGLY
INLAND BY LATE AFTN.  THIS WOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO SOAR EVERYWHERE
EXCEPT THE IMMEDIATE COAST.  EVEN MONTEREY MIGHT GET WARM FOR A FEW
HOURS.  ITS A VERY MARGINAL SITUATION WITH TEMPS A SURE BET TO GO
INTO THE 90S IN CONCORD AND LIVERMORE...BUT ITS A MUCH TOUGHER CALL
FOR PLACES LIKE SAN JOSE.  AT ANY RATE...IT WILL BE A WARM SUNNY
WEEKEND THROUGHOUT OUR REGION EXCEPT FOR FOG PATCHES AT THE
COAST...MAINLY S OF SAN FRANCISCO.

THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE BREAKING DOWN THE RIDGE MORE WEAKLY AND
SLOWLY THAN THE PREVIOUS DAYS RUNS.  MON WILL BE ANOTHER WARM DAY...
FOLLOWED BY SOME COOLING TUE/WED ACCORDING TO THE MRF/EURO CONSENSUS
BUT WITH TEMPS REMAINING A LITTLE ABOVE NORMAL THRU WED.  THE NOGAPS

LINGERING OVER THE SAN FRANCISCO AND BERKELEY AREAS. MORE INTERESTING
PHENOMENA APPARENT ON SATELLITE ARE SMOKE PLUMES FROM VARIOUS FIRES
...KIRK FIRES...BIG BAR FIRE...AND TIRE FIRE. IN FACT...SMOKE FROM
THE TIRE FIRE COULD MAKE FOR SOME HAZY CONDITIONS IN SAN JOSE AND
NEIGHBORING SOUTH BAY COMMUNITIES THIS THE WEEKEND AS SURFACE FLOW
BECOMES LESS ONSHORE...BUT MORE ON THAT LATER. AS FOR THE S KIRK
FIRE...THE PLUME IS NOW BLOWING OFFSHORE. SINCE THIS FIRE IS WELL
ABOVE THE INVERSION LAYER...THESE OFFSHORE CONDITIONS ARE NOT BEING
REALIZED NEAR THE SURFACE AS BUOYS SOUTH OF SAN FRANCISCO INDICATE
LIGHT WESTERLY WINDS.

12Z MODELS AGREE IN BUILDING UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE FAR EASTERN
PACIFIC AS THE UPPER LOW SCOOTS SOUTHWESTWARD. AT THE SURFACE...HIGH
PRESSURE BUILDS TOWARD THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST WITH A THERMAL TROUGH
OVER INTERIOR CALIFORNIA. BY LATE SATURDAY...AND EARLY SUNDAY...THIS
THERMAL TROUGH EDGES ALONG THE COAST AS THE HIGH SPILLS INTO
WASHINGTON AND OREGON. THIS WILL SET UP A DECENT NORTH/NORTHEAST
PRESSURE GRADIENT FOR THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE STATE WITH AN
OFFSHORE WIND AS FAR SOUTH AS THE NORTH BAY COUNTIES. THE REST OF THE
COASTAL PORTIONS OF OUR CWFA WILL SEE LESS ONSHORE OR MORE NORTHERLY
WINDS...BUT NOT AS STRONG AS OVER EXTREME NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AS FAR
AS OUR USUAL FOG/LOW CLOUDS REGIEME...EXPECT THE USUAL LOCATIONS TO
CLOUD UP OVERNIGHT TONIGHT...BUT WE SHOULD SEE AN EARLIER BURNOFF
TOMORROW. AS FOR SUNDAY...I THINK THE REDUCED ONSHORE FLOW WILL KEEP
THE LOW CLOUDS MORE CENTRALIZED NEAR THE COAST.

MEDIUM RANGE MODELS MOSTLY AGREE IN LOWERING HEIGHTS OVER THE WEST
COAST IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD AS A LONG-WAVE TROUGH SETTLES IN OVER
THE INTERIOR U.S. THE NOGAPS...HOWEVER...BEGINS TO DEVIATE WITH TIME
AND BRINGS THE UPPER LOW EASTWARD BACK TOWARDS THE WEST COAST. THIS

YESTERDAY AS IT STARTS TO COMPRESS A LITTLE UNDER WARMER AIR ALOFT
STARTING TO SET IN. THE NEAR TERM MODELS CONFIRM THIS WITH A WARMING

FORECAST AREA.  OAK RAOB SHOWS NELY WINDS FROM 6000 MSL ON UP AT 00Z
AND WE WILL BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A DRY NELY FLOW ALOFT THRU FRI. 
HOWEVER...THE MODELS DONT FORECAST THIS OFFSHORE FLOW TO REACH THE
SURFACE ON FRI...AND WE SHOULD HAVE THE USUAL AFTN SEABREEZE.  AT 03Z
THE SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENTS WERE ORDINARY WITH 3.0 MB N-S ACV-SFO
AND 2.5 MB ONSHORE SFO-SAC.  THE MARINE LAYER IS ABOUT 1500 FEET DEEP
ON THE FORT ORD PROFILER.  STILL...WITH SLIGHT WARMING ALOFT AND
HIGHER 500 MB HEIGHTS FORECAST...WE SHOULD SEE MAXES RISE A FEW
DEGREES ON FRI.  THERES A CHANCE THAT THE MAXES IN THE N BAY MAY RISE
ABOVE THE CURRENT FORECAST VALUES...BUT WILL LET THE MID SHIFT PONDER
THAT.  

ON SAT THE MODELS CONTINUE TO RAISE THE 500 MB HEIGHTS AND THE
1000-500 MB THICKNESSES...AND SUGGEST A LATER SEABREEZE WITH THE
THERMAL TROF SETTING UP ALONG THE COAST EARLY THAT MRNG BEFORE MOVING
INLAND BY EARLY AFTN.  THIS WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL WARMING.  
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE ADVERTISED WARMING TREND MAY BE STRONGER
THAN ADFVERTISED...BUT SINCE IT IS CURRENTLY FORECAST AND I HAVE
LOUSY LUCK UPDATING TEMPS ON THIS SHIFT...WILL LET THE TEMPS RIDE AND
HAVE THE MID SHIFT TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT ALL THE NEW MODELS.  COASTAL
STRATUS SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE PLENTIFUL S OF SFO THRU SAT MRNG BUT
MAY DECREASE FARTHER N WHERE THERE IS A MORE NLY COMPONENT TO THE LOW
LEVEL FLOW DUE TO HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO THE PACIFIC NW.

THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS PRESENT A VARIETY OF OPTIONS.  IN GENERAL THE
UK...MRF...AND NOGAPS ALL FORECAST AN INSIDE SLIDER PATTERN FOR THE
FIRST HALF OF NEXT WEEK...WITH DRY SHORT WAVES DROPPING INTO THE WRN
U.S. FROM THE NW.  THE MRF ORIENTS THESE FARTHER W AND HAS LOWER 500
MB HEIGHTS OVER CA...BY 00Z WED THE UK FORECASTS 500 MB HEIGHTS 110 M
HIGHER AT SFO THAN THE MRF WITH THE NOGAPS IN BETWEEN.  THE EURO SETS
UP A ZONAL FLOW ACROSS THE NRN U.S. WITH VIRTUALLY NO TROFING S OF
LAT 42...THE NRN BOUNDARY OF CA.  THE EXTENDED BLENDED THE THREE
TROFIER MODELS WITH A LEAN TOWARD THE MRF...MAINLY BECAUSE WE HAVE
HAD A TROF OVER US MOST OF 1999 SO WHY STOP NOW.  THE END RESULT WILL
BE DRY WEATHER...WARM ON SUN THEN COOLER AND BREEZY BUT STILL
PLEASANT.  THE 6-10 DAY MRF MAINTAINS THE INSIDE SLIDER PATTERN WITH

900 PM PDT WED SEP 22 1999

OUR FORECAST AREA IS IN A 500 MB SHEAR ZONE BETWEEN SWLY WINDS TO
THE S...AND ENELY WINDS TO THE N.  THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT CONVECTION
NEARBY AT 03Z WAS OCCURRING OFFSHORE TO THE W OF SAN MATEO COUNTY IN
THE ENE FLOW.  NOT ONLY WAS THIS AREA JUST N OF THE SHEAR ZONE AT 500
MB...BUT WINDS DIRECTLY ABOVE IT FROM 250 MB ON UP WERE SWLY SO THERE
WAS BOTH CYCLONIC AND VERTICAL SHEAR IN THE VICINITY.  THE WATER
VAPOR LOOPS INDICATED THE CENTER OF THE CUTOFF LOW WAS NEAR 32/125. 
ANOTHER FACTOR THAT COULD BE ENHANCING THE OFFSHORE CONVECTION IS A
SHORT WAVE MOVING NE TO SW THRU NRN CA...DEPICTED WELL ON THE NEW ETA
AND ON THE WATER VAPOR LOOPS.  THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS COULD
FIRE UP A FEW SHOWERS IN THE SFO BAY AREA TNGT AND WILL LEAVE POPS
IN.  AFTER THE SHORT WAVE PASSES...A CONFLUENT NELY FLOW IS FORECAST
OVER THAT AREA ON THU WHICH SHOULD SUPPRESS CONVECTION AND BEGIN A
PRONOUNCED WARMING/DRYING TREND.  S OF THE SFO BAY AREA THE MODELS
FORECAST SOME UPPER DIFFLUENCE TO CONTINUE THRU TNGT...ENDING BY THU
MRNG WHICH SHOULD KILL THE SHOWER THREAT IN THE MRY BAY AREA.  SINCE
THE SHEAR ZONE WILL PERSIST NEAR SRN MRY COUNTY THU AFTN A FEW
SHOWERS MAY DEVELOP THERE AT THAT TIME...WHICH IS COVERED IN THE AFTN
ZONES.  BY THU NIGHT THE SHOWER THREAT SHOULD BE GONE THROUGHOUT THE
FORECAST AREA AS FAVORABLE DYNAMICS END.  

IN MORE ROUTINE MATTERS...THE MARINE LAYER DISAPPEARED AT FORT ORD
FOR A FEW HOURS THIS AFTN BUT HAS REDEVELOPED ABOUT 1000 FEET DEEP. 
THE ONSHORE FLOW IS MODERATE...2.6 MB SFO-SAC AT 03Z...SO EXPECT
AREAS OF STRATUS ALONG THE COAST TNGT BUT ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE
INLAND DUE TO THE SHALLOW MARINE LAYER.

IN THE LONGER RANGE THE MRF...EURO...AND UK MODELS AGREE IN MOVING
THE CUTOFF TO THE SW OUT OF OUR AREA BY FRI...PUTTING A FLAT RIDGE
OVER NRN/CNTRL CA WITH HIGH 500 MB HEIGHTS AND A STRONGER N-S
PRESSURE GRADIENT DOWN THE COAST.  THIS WILL SET US UP FOR A WARM
SPELL THRU THE WEEKEND WITH LOTS OF SUN...PROBABLY EVEN ON THE COAST. 
HOWEVER...THE MODELS ALSO AGREE ON LOWERING 500 MB HEIGHTS AGAIN ON

UPPER LOW CIRCULATION ON WATER VAPOR NEAR 31N 126W MOVING SLOWLY
EAST. CURRENTLY A BAND OF LIGHT SHOWERS IS MOVING NORTH OVER MONTEREY
AND SAN BENITO COUNTIES...SPREADING OUT SLOWLY. MOST OF THE SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSHOWERS HAVE CLEARED THE BAY AREA.  IT WAS A VERY
INTERESTING LINE OF ACTIVITY MOVING OUT OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. 

MODELS DO AGREE TO TAKE LOW EAST THEN BACK TO THE SOUTH AND
SOUTHWEST...EXCEPT AVN. AN UNUSUALLY STRONG EARLY SEASON JET IS
CROSSING THE PACIFIC ALONG 40 NORTH. THE ENERGY IS JUST ENTERING THE
SYSTEM OFF THE PACIFIC NW. THIS SHOULD DRIVE THIS SYSTEM INTO THE
PACIFIC NW AND DEVELOP THE NE/SW RIDGE AND SQUEEZE THE UPPER LOW TO
THE SOUTH. PREFER THE MRF SOLUTION. THE FLOW DOWN THE BACK SIDE OF
THE LOW SEEMS STRONG AND IT SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE TO THE SOUTH.
THIS SHOULD DRY THINGS OUT TOMORROW. 

IN THE SHORT TERM WE DEAL WITH LOTS OF RESIDUAL MOISTURE. AREA OF E/W
BAND OF SHOWERS ON THE NORTH SIDE SHOULD PERSIST INTO THE EVENING AND
POSSIBLY MOVE AS FAR NORTH AS SANTA CRUZ COUNTY. THERE APPEARS TO BE
TOO MUCH EASTERLY FLOW AT MID LEVELS ACROSS THE NORTHERN SAN JOAQUIN
VALLEY INTO THE BAY AREA TO ALLOW THIS BAND TO MOVE MUCH FARTHER
NORTH. WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN THE SOUTH
INTO TOMORROW...OTHERWISE THINGS SHOULD CLEAR UP.  
 
IN THE LONGER RANGE MODELS INCREASE HEIGHTS OVER THE WEEKEND AND
STILL BRING IN TROUGH ALONG WEST COAST BY MID WEEK. WITH TYPHOON IN
WESTERN PACIFIC SLOWLY RECURVING...WEST OF 160E...AND LOTS OF WARM
MOIST AIR BEING FORCED INTO THE ZONAL JET ACROSS THE PACIFIC. THIS

HELPING TO ADVECT MOISTURE FROM OLD TS HILARY NWWD INTO OUR FORECAST

EVE.  KEY ELEMENTS INCLUDE UPPER WIND AND THICKNESS DIFFLUENCE...
GOOD POSITION NEAR THE LEFT FRONT QUADRANT OF THE SWLY JET (FROM THE

BELOW FROM ABOUT US 101 E.  THE LAST TWO RUNS OF THE ETA HAVE
FORECAST HEALTHY PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES...WELL OVER AN INCH OVER
OUR ENTIRE FORECAST AREA FROM SANTA ROSA S ON WED.  

HAVING SAID ALL THAT...THE FIRST BATCH OF SHOWERS/TSTMS THAT MOVED
NWWD INTO MONTEREY COUNTY THIS EVENING FIZZLED OUT.  THERE WERE A
COUPLE LIGHTNING STRIKES...AND PROBABLY SOME SHOWERS IN THE WILDS OF

BEST DYNAMICS FORECAST TO DEVELOP AFTER 06Z TNGT AS A VORT LOBE

NO SIGNS OF MIXING OUT.  THE ONSHORE GRADIENT IS FAIRLY WEAK...ABOUT

AFTERNOON SATELLITE LOOP SHOWING THE MOVEMENT OF THE MID AND UPPER
LEVEL MOISTURE AS IT DEVELOPS OVER THE SIERNEV AND WRAPS AROUND THE
UPPER LOW SITUATED NEAR THE LAKE TAHOE AREA. SOME OF THIS MOISTURE IS
WORKING ITS WAY INTO THE BAY AREA BUT HAS NOT BEEN A PROBLEM TODAY.
TEMPERATURES ARE RUNNING VERY SIMILAR TO FRIDAY MOST AREAS. THE
ONSHORE GRADIENT IS RELATIVELY WEAK AT ABOUT 1.5 MB AND THE NORTH TO
SOUTH GRADIENT IS JUST PLAIN FLAT. THE COASTAL STRATUS HAS FINALLY
CLEARED TO THE COASTLINE BUT IS FIRMLY ENTRENCHED ALL ALONG THE

LOW JUST OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST NEAR 125W AND 36N CHANGES THROUGH

DOMINATE FEATURE AS PART OF A BAGGY TROUGH OVER THE DISTRICT THAT

SOME...SO EXPECT THE DEVELOPMENT WE ARE SEEING TODAY TO TAPER OFF A
LITTLE ON SUNDAY. IN THE EXTENDED THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS RETROGRADE
THE UPPER LOW OFF THE COAST A LITTLE FURTHER TO THE SOUTHWEST THROUGH
MIDWEEK AS A RELATIVELY FLAT UPPER RIDGE BUILDS INTO OREGON AND
WASHINGTON. A MORE PRONOUNCED RIDGE DEVELOPS OVER THE DESERT

YESTERDAY IN MANY LOCATIONS DUE TO SMOKE FROM THE FOREST FIRES. THE

PERSISTANCE HAS BEEN THE THEME THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND IT LOOKS

WITH A STRONG 4.1 MB ONSHORE PRESSURE GRADIENT SFO-SAC AT 03Z.  AS A

SHIELD AHEAD OF THE TROF AXIS APPROACHING THE NWRN CA COAST. 
HOWEVER...THE LAST VISIBLE SAT PIX INDICATED MOST OF THIS CLOUDINESS

POSSIBLY SOME COASTAL DRIZZLE.  THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF COLD
ADVECTION WITH THIS SYSTEM...AND THE SCENARIO OF MIXING OUT THE

AFTERNOON WITH BY BRISK NW WINDS.  THE COOLING TREND WILL CONTINUE
ALTHOUGH THIS WILL BE MITIGATED SOMEWHAT BY THE ABUNDANT PM SUNSHINE.

SEE SOME DRIZZLE NEAR THE OCEAN ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT AS MARINE LAYER

ADVECTION ALOFT WILL WIPE OUT THE MARINE INVERSION. BY MONDAY
AFTERNOON...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OFFSHORE AND A FAIRLY

LOSS OF INVERSION AND BREEZY CONDITIONS WILL HELP CLEAR MOST LOW
CLOUDS DURING THE AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...A MUCH COOLER AIRMASS...AS

THE COLD FRONT NOW 250 NM W OF CAPE MENDOCINO IS CONTINUING TO MOVE
TOWARD THE CALIFORNIA COASTLINE AT ABOUT 11 KNOTS EVEN AS IT LOSES
STRENGTH THIS FAR SOUTH. THE TROUGH ALOFT IS PROGRESSING MUCH AS
FORECAST AND SHOULD ARRIVE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MONDAY AFTERNOON.
PRESENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SHOULD EXPERIENCE
CONSIDERABLY COOLER TEMPERATURES MONDAY...BUT THE SOUTHERNMOST
DESERTS MAY NOT FEEL SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS UNTIL TUESDAY.  WATER VAPOR
SATELLITE SHOWS EXTREMELY DRY CONDITIONS OVER NORTH AND CENTRAL
CALIFORNIA...THIS DRYNESS WILL PREVENT ANY SHOWERS FROM GROWING
SUNDAY ESPECIALLY WITH SOME SUBSIDENCE EXPECTED AHEAD OF THE FRONT. 
A FEW SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE SUNDAY NIGHT EXTENDING INTO THE NORTHERN
INTERIOR OF CALIFORNIA MONDAY AND TUESDAY AS THE FRONT AND TROUGH
PROGRESS INLAND...BUT MODELS SUGGEST THAT MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY WILL
REMAIN NORTH OF THE OREGON BORDER.

WINDS AROUND THE FRONT ARE WEAKER THAN THE STRONGER NW WINDS AHEAD
AND BEHIND IT SO IT IS WELL MARKED IN SSMI SURFACE WIND PRODUCTS AS
WELL AS SATELLITE PICTURES. WINDS OFFSHORE CONTINUE TO BE NEAR SMALL
CRAFT ADVISORY LEVELS...BUT MODELS DO NOT INCREASE THEM UNTIL TONIGHT
WHEN GALE GUSTS ARE POSSIBLE. THIS WOULD SEEM TO CONTRADICT WHAT IS
ACTUALLY HAPPENING...THAT THERE IS A COASTAL JET OF NW WINDS
PRECEDING THE SUBSIDENCE AND WEAKER WINDS JUST AHEAD OF THE
FRONT...WHICH SHOULD BE FELT DURING THE DAY TODAY ALONG THE COAST
WITH INCREASING WINDS LATER TONIGHT AFTER PASSAGE.  

IN THE EXTENDED OUTLOOK...MODELS ARE NOT CONSISTENT FROM RUN TO RUN.
THE MRF FROM FRIDAY SHOWED THE COLDEST AIR UNDER A CUT OFF LOW NEAR
CAPE MENDOCINO WITH THICKNESS VALUES DECREASING UNTIL FRIDAY.  THE
PRESENT FORECAST...AND A MORE LIKELY SCENARIO...IS THAT OF A THERMAL
TROUGH FORMING WITH RISING HEIGHTS AND THICKNESSES BEGINNING TUESDAY
AND SLOW WARMING THROUGH FRIDAY. THE TROUGH AT THE SURFACE WILL
EXTEND OFFSHORE FRIDAY CREATING A SITUATION THAT OFTEN BRINGS STRATUS
SURGES BACK UP THE COAST. THE UPPER LEVEL SCENARIO ALSO SEEMS BEST
HANDLED BY THE MRF SINCE THE EURO MODEL MOVES OUT WHAT HAS BEEN A
VERY PERSISTENT WEST COAST TROUGH MORE QUICKLY THAN PREVIOUS TROUGHS
HAVE BEEN LEAVING. THEREFORE EXPECT THE MARINE LAYER TO BE
SUBSTANTIALLY MIXED OUT DURING THE FRONTAL PASSAGE AND TO BUILD BACK
IN TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. INVERSION MAY BE QUICK TO BUILD BACK WITH

ABOUT AS FAR INLAND AS LAST NIGHT WHEN IT REACHED LIVERMORE. 
HOWEVER...WHILE THE AIRMASS WARMED DURING THE DAY TDA...IT WILL COOL
DURING THE DAY ON SUN AS THE LARGE OFFSHORE UPPER LEVEL TROF BEGINS
APPROACHING THE COAST.  THE ETA/AVN BOTH FORECAST A SOMEWHAT STRONGER
ONSHORE FLOW TO DEVELOP SUN AFTN COMPARED TO TODAY.  THUS...EXPECT
SEVERAL DEGREES OF COOLING SUN WITH MAXES 3-8 DEGREES LOWER THAN

THERE ARE SEVERAL WEATHER FACTORS TO CONSIDER THIS MRNG.  THE MARINE
LAYER IS VERY SHALLOW...1000 FEET AT MOST PER FORT ORD PROFILER AND
TEMPS IN THE E BAY HILLS.  WITH A WEAK ONSHORE FLOW CONTINUING...WE
ARE SET FOR ANOTHER HOT DAY INLAND.  HOWEVER...IT APPEARS THERE WILL
BE ENOUGH ONSHORE GRADIENT TO KEEP THE COAST COOL.  A COMPLICATING
FACTOR IS A HINT OF A SOUTHERLY SURGE FORECAST BY THE AVN TO DEVELOP
THIS AFTN...THOUGH THE ETA DOESNT REALLY FOLLOW SUIT.  AT 08Z THERE
WAS STILL A MODERATE N-S GRADIENT ALONG THE COAST FROM ACV-SFO-SBA
...BUT LOW CLOUDS WERE MOVING NWD ANYWAY AND HAD SPREAD INTO MARIN. 
GIVEN THIS DEVELOPMENT...AND THE FORECAST NEWD MOVEMENT OF THE
OFFSHORE CUTOFF LOW WHICH WILL ENHANCE SLY FLOW ALOFT...EXPECT THE
SURGE TO PICK UP STEAM THIS AFTN AND SPREAD MARINE AIR INTO THE USUAL
N BAY CITIES...NAPA AND SANTA ROSA...THAT GET IT BEST WITH S WINDS. 
THUS THOSE SPOTS WILL PROBABLY SEE AN EARLY CAP ON HEATING AND HAVE
MAXES SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER THAN ON WED.  ALSO...SANTA CRUZ MAY REMAIN
SOCKED IN ALL DAY WITH THIS PATTERN.

THE EJECTING CUTOFF FURTHER COMPLICATES THE SITUATION.  THIS SYSTEM
IS NOT VERY COLD BUT HAS SOME DYNAMICS...ETA FORECASTS STRONG UPPER
DIFFLUENCE ASSOCIATED WITH IT TO SPREAD OVER AT LEAST THE SRN PART OF
OUR FORECAST AREA TDA.  THERE IS ALREADY A GOOD CLOUD SHIELD MOVING
NWD AND THIS WILL SPREAD MID/HIGH CLOUDS OVER MUCH OF OUR FORECAST
AREA TDA...ESPECIALLY S OF SFO.  THERE COULD EVEN BE MORE ACTION THAN
THAT AS LIGHTNING INDICATORS SHOW A FEW BOLTS EMANATING FROM AN AREA
OF OFFSHORE CONVECTION AT THIS TIME.  SO...KEPT A RISK OF SHOWERS/
TSTMS OVER THE MOUNTAINS TDA AND THIS EVENING.  THE CUTOFF WILL EJECT
NEWD OUT OF OUR FORECAST AREA TNGT/FRI MRNG...RETURNING US TO A MORE
NORMAL PATTERN WITH A DRY SWLY FLOW ALOFT AS A WARM AIRMASS REMAINS
OVER THE REGION.  TEMPS ON FRI SHOULD BE A LITTLE COOLER THAN TODAY
AS THE INCREASING WLY COMPONENT OF THE FLOW ALOFT WILL ENABLE MARINE
AIR TO MOVE INLAND MORE STRONGLY.  EXPECT THE COOLING TREND TO COME
TO A HALT SAT AS THE WEATHER PATTERN STABILIZES.  

FARTHER OUT IN THE EXTENDED THE MODELS HAVE DIFFERING SOLUTIONS.  THE
EURO NOW HOLDS A STRONG RIDGE OVER THE W COAST THRU TUE AND DROPS AN
INCOMING TROF W OF 130 WHILE CUTTING IT OFF.  THE UK RACES THE SAME
SYSTEM RAPIDLY OVER THE RIDGE...ITS LONG GONE BY MON AM.  THE
CANADIAN RETAINS THE MOST STRENGTH IN THE TROF AND FORECASTS IT TO
MOVE SLOWLY EWD...APPROACHING THE COAST BY MON AFTN.  THE UK IS
ALMOST CERTAINLY TOO FAST...GIVEN THE PROPENSITY OF TROFS TO MOVE
SLUGGISHLY OFF THE W COAST AT THIS TIME OF YEAR.  WILL LEAN TOWARD
THE CANADIAN AS ITS THE MOST CONSISTENT MODEL COMPARED TO ITS
PREVIOUS RUN AND IS CLIMATOLOGICALLY LOGICAL.  MRF IS DELAYED THIS
MRNG.  POPS ZERO.  MARKKANEN

SURGE WILL LIKELY TAKE AWHILE LONGER TO BE FELT IN THE CENTRAL COAST
ZONES. HAVE THEREFORE TAKEN TEMPS UP A BIT FROM THE EARLIER
FORECAST...BUT STILL LOWER THAN WED MAX TEMPS SINCE THE INCREASE IN

STRATUS IS MOVING UP THE SALINAS VALLEY AS FAST AS EVER THIS MRNG...
BUT IS NOT PENETRATING FAR INLAND IN THE SFO BAY AREA.  ONE REASON
FOR THIS IS THE 4.1 MB SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT ACV-SFO AT 08Z...
GOOD FOR MOVING THE CRUD STRAIGHT UP THE SALINAS VALLEY BUT A VERY
MARGINAL GRADIENT FOR STRATUS IN SFO BAY.  THE STRENGTH OF THIS
GRADIENT IS BEING UNDERFORECAST BY A COUPLE MILLIBARS BY THE AVN AND
ETA MODELS.  THE MARINE LAYER IS QUITE SHALLOW...1000-1200 FEET
DEEP...WHICH WILL INHIBIT INLAND MOVEMENT OF MARINE AIR.  WITH THE
AIRMASS WARMING ALOFT TDA AND THE ONSHORE FLOW BECOMING SLIGHTLY
WEAKER...EXPECT INLAND MAXES TO GO UP 5 DEGREES OR SO IN MOST AREAS. 
USUALLY WITH THIS TYPE OF PATTERN THE STRATUS CLEARS OFF THE COAST
FROM SFO NWD...AND WORDED FORECASTS THAT WAY WHILE LEAVING PATCHY
CLOUDS AROUND THIS AFTN FROM THE SAN MATEO COAST S.  

THERE IS A CUTOFF LOW NEAR 34/127.  THIS SYSTEM IS MOVING SLOWLY
ESE...AND SHOULD LIFT OUT TO THE NE THU/THU NIGHT.  THIS WILL
PROBABLY BRING AN INFLUX OF MARINE AIR INTO OUR FORECAST AREA FROM
THE SW...WHICH WOULD RESULT IN GOOD COOLING AT PLACES LIKE SANTA
ROSA...NAPA...AND SANTA CRUZ.  HOWEVER...THE ETA IS MUCH WEAKER WITH
THIS SOUTHERLY SURGE PATTERN THAN THE AVN AND WILL ONLY DROP MAXES IN
THOSE CITIES 3-6 DEGREES ON THU DUE TO THE MODEL INCONSISTENCY.  WITH
NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE WARMTH OF THE AIRMASS OTHERWISE...MAXES
ELSEWHERE ON THU SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO WEDNESDAYS NUMBERS.  THE AVN
FORECASTS A DIFFLUENT FLOW ALOFT OVER OUR REGION AS THE CUTOFF LIFTS
OUT...AND LIFTED INDICES ARE EXPECTED TO DROP TO NEAR ZERO OVER THE
COASTAL MOUNTAINS THU AFTN.  WITH THIS IN MIND...AND MONSOON MOISTURE
GATHERING OVER NWRN MEXICO READY TO SURGE NWWD ON THE DEVELOPING SELY
FLOW ALOFT...WILL RETAIN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVER THE COASTAL
MOUNTAINS FOR THU AFTN.  THE ETA HAS WEAKER DYNAMICS AND IS SPARSE
WITH MOISTURE BELOW 700 MB...GOOD REASONS TO NOT GO OVERBOARD ON
SHOWER FORECASTS.

IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...THE THU CUTOFF IS FORECAST TO BE WELL OUT OF
OUR AREA BY FRI AND THE RIDGE WILL REBUILD SOMEWHAT...RESULTING IN
WARMER TEMPS.  THE MRF KEEPS THIS PATTERN INTACT THRU SUN.  AFTER
THAT IT MOVES A DEEP CUTOFF LOW TOWARD NRN CA.  ITS STILL OFFSHORE BY
NEXT TUE...WHEREAS THE PREVIOUS MRF RUN HAD THE SYSTEM ONSHORE NEAR
SISKIYOU SUMMIT BY THAT TIME.  THE EURO IS FASTER BUT WEAKER WITH THE
SYSTEM THAN THE MRF...BRINGING IT INTO FAR NRN CA BY MON.  THE UK IS
EVEN FASTER AND WEAKER THAN THAT AND JUST HAS THE SYSTEM GRAZE
EXTREME NRN CA ON SUN ON ITS WAY TO THE NE.  THE CANADIAN FORECASTS A
SIMILAR PATTERN TO THE MRF WITH THE TROF STILL OFFSHORE ON SUN.

HAVE AS WELL DEFINED A VORT CENTER AS THE ETA BUT INCREASES MOISTURE

CENTERED OFFSHORE NEAR 36/128.  THIS SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO STAY IN

THE MORNING SATELLITE DATA SHOWS THE STATUS LYING JUST OFF SHORE
ALONG THE CENTRAL COASTAL AREA. IT IS BEING HELD AT BAY BY A WEAK
OFFSHORE  FLOW AND AN EASTERLY FLOW AT 1000 FEET SHOWN BY THE FT ORD
PROFILER. WITH RESULTING CLEAR SKIES AND OFFSHORE WINDS TODAY SHOULD
BE A GOOD HOT DAY TO BE OUTDOORS. HOWEVER...THIS EVENING SEEMS STILL
TO BE IN QUESTION AS THE GRADIENT SLACKEN AND WIND SHIFTS TOWARD THE
SOUTH IN MOST AREAS. THIS WILL LIKELY BE ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE CLOUDS
TO MOVE INTO ALL COASTAL AREAS TONIGHT...BUT NOT PENETRATE FAR
INLAND. MONDAY IT SHOULD RETURN TO THE COASTAL STRATUS PATTERN.WITH
SOUTHERLY FLOW WHICH SHOULD BRING MORE STRATUS TO THE COAST AND LOWER
TEMPERATURES AT COASTAL LOCATIONS. INLAND VALLEYS WILL LIKELY STAY
WARM UNTIL SOUTHERLY FLOW CAN BRING THE COOLER AIR INLAND. THIS IS
DUE TO A WEAK UPPER LEVEL LOW OFF THE SFO AREA AND THE ASSOCIATED
WEAK TROF ALONG THE CA COAST. THE UPPER LOW IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE
TO HANG OFF THE COAST UNTIL MONDAY NIGHT TO TUESDAY MORNING WHEN IT
BEGINS TO SLOWLY MOVE NE OVER THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE. ALL POPS ZERO.

PRESENT INDICATORS POINT TO A WARM DAY ACROSS THE ENTIRE DISTRICT
TODAY. OFFSHORE FLOW HAS SWEPT LOW CLOUDS WELL AWAY FROM THE COAST
AND SKIES ARE CLEAR IN ALL LOCATIONS. TEMPS AT LOWER ELEVATIONS ARE
RUNNING ABOUT FIVE DEGREES WARMER THAN THIS TIME YESTERDAY
MORNING...WHILE AT RIDGE TOP LOCATIONS TEMPS ARE RUNNING AS 10 TO 20
DEGREES WARMER. FT ORD PROFILER INDICATES AS MUCH AS 10 DEGREES C
WARMING AT 500 METERS ABOVE THE SURFACE. SURFACE TROF HAS MOVED TO A
POSITION ALONG THE IMMEDIATE COAST. FLOW CONTINUES OFFSHORE WITH
FT ORD AND RADAR VAD WIND PROFILERS INDICATING N-NE FLOW ABOVE 1500
FEET. ALTHOUGH MODELS SHOW A REVERSAL IN LOW LEVEL FLOW TO A SLY
DIRECTION BY LATE IN THE DAY...THAT CHANGE WILL LIKELY NOT OCCUR SOON
ENOUGH TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT ON TEMPS TODAY. CONSEQUENTLY...HAVE WARMED
TEMPS IN MOST AREAS TODAY OVER YESTERDAY. 

UPPER LEVEL PATTERN WILL CHANGE LITTLE THROUGH MONDAY WITH A WEAK
LOW FORECAST TO CONTINUE NEAR THE CENTRAL CA COAST. NEED TO LOOK FOR
CHANGES NEAR THE SURFACE TO DETERMINE TEMPERATURE AND CLOUD COVER
FORECAST. THE AFOREMENTIONED SLY FLOW WILL BRING STRATUS AND FOG BACK
TO THE COAST OVERNIGHT TONIGHT...BUT LACK OF A SIGNIFICANT ONSHORE
FLOW WILL PREVENT MUCH INLAND ADVANCEMENT. HOWEVER...SLY FLOW IS
FORECAST TO INCREASE ON MONDAY...PUTTING MOST COASTAL AREAS IN A
FAVORABLE PATTERN FOR LOW CLOUDS AND COOLER TEMPS AND COOLING OFF
INLAND AREAS WITH SRN EXPOSURE TO THE OCEAN. FURTHER INLAND AND IN
LOCATIONS WITH OROGRAPHIC BARRIERS TO THE S...TEMPS WILL COOL VERY
LITTLE ON MONDAY AS THICKNESS VALUES SHOW ONLY SLIGHT DECREASES.

WEAK UPPER LOW IS FORECAST TO MOVE TO THE NE AND OUT OF THE AREA
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUE...BUT WILL BE QUICKLY REPLACED BY A SIMILAR
FEATURE ON WEDNESDAY. OVERALL SYNOPTIC PATTERN WILL STAY ABOUT THE
SAME WITH A RIDGE OVER THE SWRN U.S. AND A WEAK LOW OFF THE CENTRAL

FORECAST FOR NEXT TWO DAYS...ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO TEMPERATURES

SHOWS THE MARINE LAYER...WHICH HAD BEEN WELL BELOW 1000 FEET
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON...HAS DEEPENED OVERNIGHT AND IS NEARING 1500
FEET. IN ADDITION...EXTENSIVE LOW CLOUDS AND FOG ARE PRESENT ALONG
THE COAST FROM MARIN COUNTY SWD. ALL THIS POINTS TO A COOLER DAY
TODAY...ESPECIALLY NEAR THE COAST. ON TUESDAY...AS UPPER LOW MOVES
INLAND AND FILLS...HEIGHTS INCREASE OVER THE DISTRICT AND LOCATIONS
WELL INLAND COULD WARM ONCE AGAIN. HOWEVER...MARINE LAYER NEAR THE
COAST WILL BE WELL ESTABLISHED BY THEN AND CONTINUED ONSHORE FLOW
SHOULD MEAN A FEW ADDITIONAL DEGREES OF COOLING AT AND NEAR THE
COAST. INSTABILITY WILL REMAIN EAST AND NORTH OF OUR DISTRICT TODAY
AND CONVECTION WILL BE LIMITED TO THE NRN MOUNTAINS AND SIERRA.

STRONG NORTHERLY FLOW DEVELOPED OVER NORTHERN CA THIS MORNING.
CURRENTLY...THE SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT IS 6MB FROM ACV-SFO. THIS
IS STRONG ENOUGH TO CLEAR THE LOW CLOUDS FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY. 
IN ADDITION TO CLEARING OUT THE LOW CLOUDS THIS NORTHERLY FLOW HAS
ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO BE AROUND 5-15 DEGREES WARMER TODAY THAN
YESTERDAY. THE NORTHERLY GRADIENT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP THE
LOW CLOUDS OUT OF THE SFO BAY TONIGHT AND MAYBE EVEN MONTEREY BAY.
THE STRONG NORTHERLY FLOW IS FORECAST TO WEAKEN ON SUNDAY WHICH WILL 
ALLOW MORE ONSHORE FLOW AND MARINE INFLUENCE SO EXPECT A RETURN OF
THE STRATUS DEVELOPING AT THE COAST AND SPREADING INLAND SUNDAY
NIGHT. THUS...THE TREND IS FOR AREAS IN THE NORTH BAY WHICH ARE MOST
AFFECTED BY THE NORTHERLY FLOW TO ACTUALLY COOL A FEW DEGREES ON
SUNDAY. ALL OTHER AREAS SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER AS THE
1000-500MB THICKNESSES INCREASE DUE TO WARMING IN THE LOWER LAYERS.  
A SHORT WAVE TROUGH IS MOVING INTO NORTHERN CA AT THIS TIME. THIS
TROUGH IS FORECAST TO BECOME AN UPPER LEVEL CUTOFF LOW TONIGHT THEN
REMAIN FAIRLY STATIONARY OVER THE CENTRAL CA COAST THROUGH MONDAY
MORNING. THE MRF WANTS TO KEEP THIS WEAK UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER CENTRAL

MODERATELY STRONG N-S SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT ALONG THE NRN CA
COAST EARLY THIS MORNING HAS RESULTED IN BRISK WINDS OVER THE COASTAL
WATERS N OF THE GOLDEN GATE WHICH IN IN TURN HAS CLEARED MUCH OF THE
LOW CLOUDINESS. THIS N-S GRADIENT IS ALSO ACTING TO KEEP LOW CLOUDS
FROM MOVING VERY FAR INLAND...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE N BAY.

MOST ENERGY WITH THE TROF IS FORECAST TO MOVE QUICKLY EWD INTO WRN
CANADA TODAY...WHILE A SRN SPLIT IN THE FLOW WILL ALLOW A WEAK TROF
TO SAG OVER CA AND STALL THROUGH SUNDAY. APPROACH OF UPPER TROF HAS
DEEPENED THE MARINE LAYER A BIT OVERNIGHT WHICH...COMBINED WITH A
MODERATE ONSHORE FLOW FROM SFO SWD...WILL RESULT IN SLIGHT COOLING IN
MOST AREAS TODAY. HOWEVER...THE N SFO BAY AREA...WITH VERY LITTLE
MORNING CLOUDS AND AN INCREASINGLY OFFSHORE FLOW FORECAST AT 850

CONSIDERABLY TONIGHT AND BY SUNDAY MORNING A WEAK OFFSHORE FLOW WILL
BE IN PLACE OVER MOST OF THE SFO BAY AREA WITH A WEAK ONSHORE TO
NEUTRAL GRADIENT FROM MONTEREY BAY SWD. ALONG WITH A WARMING
AIRMASS...THIS WILL MEAN WARMING OVER MOST OF THE AREA ON SUNDAY WITH

RISES IN 1000-850 THICKNESS THE NEXT TWO DAYS. BUT THIS TIME THE
TREND IS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AS THERE ARE NO MORE MAJOR UPPER

BE ENOUGH TO REVERSE THE RISE IN TEMPS FROM FRI TO SAT THOUGH.

THE N-S SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT HAS SHARPENED DURING THE NIGHT...
AND AT 09Z WAS 3 MB ACV-SFO.  THIS IS A STRONGER GRADIENT THAN WAS
FORECAST BY THE MODELS.  THE RESULTING BRISK NW WINDS ALONG THE COAST
HAVE SWEPT MOST STRATUS AWAY ALONG THE SHORELINE...BUT ON THE OTHER
HAND THE LOW CLOUDS HAVE MOVED INTO MUCH OF THE SFO BAY AREA...AS FAR
INLAND AS LIVERMORE.  THE MARINE INVERSION CONTINUES ABOUT 2500 FEET
DEEP AND IS NOT TOO STRONGLY DEFINED DUE TO COOL AIR ALOFT...WHICH IS
PROBABLY ANOTHER REASON FOR THE PATCHY NATURE OF THE STRATUS FIELD. 
WITH YESTERDAYS SHORT WAVE SHEARING OUT OF CA TO THE NE AND 500 MB
HEIGHTS FORECAST TO RISE SOMEWHAT...EXPECT THE MARINE LAYER TO BECOME
A LITTLE SHALLOWER AND BETTER DEFINED TDA AND FRI.  THEORETICALLY
THIS MEANS MAX TEMPS WILL RISE INLAND...WITH LITTLE CHANGE ALONG THE
COAST AS THE OFFSHORE STRATUS FIELD BECOMES MORE EXTENSIVE AND
UNIFORM.  WILL TREND FORECASTS ALONG THIS SCENARIO.  

IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...THE AVN FORECASTS A WEAK UPPER TROF TO
CONTINUE OVER CA ON SAT BUT SURGES SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE INTO THE
PACIFIC NW AND INCREASES THE ACV-SFO GRADIENT TO 6 MB.  THIS WOULD
REALLY GET RID OF THE STRATUS THAT AFTERNOON AND RESULT IN STRONG
WARMING THROUGHOUT NRN CA AND OVER INLAND AREAS OF CNTRL CA.  AFTER
THAT...THE UPPER TROF IS FORECAST TO DEVELOP INTO A WEAK OFFSHORE
CUTOFF.  SOME MODELS...INCLUDING THE MRF...SET UP A SSELY FLOW
THROUGH ALL OF CA BY SUN...WHICH WOULD RAPIDLY IMPORT THE NEARBY
MONSOON MOISTURE THRU THE SIERRA INTO THE FAR NRN CA MOUNTAINS. 
OTHER MODELS INCLUDING THE CANADIAN AND NOGAPS ARE MUCH MORE
RELUCTANT TO ELIMINATE THE WLY COMPONENT OF THE FLOW ALOFT OVER CA ON
SUN/MON AND WOULD KEEP THE MONSOON E OF OUR DISTRICT EXCEPT POSSIBLY
FOR A LITTLE MOISTURE INFILTRATING THE SRN SIERRA/TEHACHAPIS.  WILL
BLEND THE TWO SOLUTIONS IN THE EXTENDED AND START A RISK OF

UPPER LOW CENTERED NEAR LAKE TAHOE AT THIS TIME AND IS MOVING SLOWLY
TO THE NE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO AS WEAK SHORTWAVE APPROACHING
THE PAC NW MOVES INLAND AND PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL KICK. SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS AND SIERRA NEVADA
DIMINISHED AFTER SUNSET. A FEW SPRINKLES OR LIGHT SHOWERS ARE STILL
POSSIBLE IN THE NORTH SFO BAY AREA THRU THE EVENING HOURS IN AREA OF
WRAP AROUND MOISTURE SO WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THOSE AREAS
DURING THE FIRST PERIOD. CONSIDERABLE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WAS LEFT IN
WAKE OF UPPER LOW AND 00Z OAK SOUNDING SHOWS A SATURATED LAYER UP TO
3500 FT. MODERATE ONSHORE FLOW IS BRINGING THE DEEP LAYER OF LOW
CLOUDS WELL INLAND. WITH SUCH A DEEP LAYER OF LOW CLOUDS...CLEARING
WILL BE SLOW ON WEDNESDAY AND IT LIKELY WILL NOT CLEAR AT ALL IN SOME
COASTAL AREAS. SO...EVEN THOUGH HEIGHTS RISE QUICKLY THRU TOMORROW
AFTERNOON...TEMPS WILL SHOW ONLY MODEST INCREASES. WEAK UPPER LEVEL
RIDGING WILL OCCUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY THURSDAY AND THIS
SHOULD ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL WARMING. HOWEVER...12Z AVN SHOWED THE
NEXT SHORTWAVE TROF PUSHING TOWARD THE COAST BY LATE IN THE DAY
THURSDAY. THIS COULD MEAN A STRONG MARINE PUSH THURSDAY AFTERNOON
WHICH WOULD HOLD DOWN WARMING THAT DAY. WILL WAIT FOR FULL SUITE OF
MODEL RUNS BEFORE MAKING ANY ADJUSTMENT TO TEMP FORECASTS.

MEDIUM RANGE MODELS KEEP A TROFFY PATTERN IN PLACE THRU THE EXTENDED
PERIOD. THE MRF SLOWLY INCREASES HEIGHTS THRU THE WEEKEND...SO WE
COULD SEE A SLOW WARMING TREND. BUT OVERALL...TEMPS WILL CONTINUE
BELOW NORMAL.  STS 2000 SFO 1000 SJC/MRY/LVK 0000          DYKEMA

UPPER LEVEL LOW CIRCULATION CONTINUES OVER THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY
AREA. VERY LITTLE PRECIPITATION THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA SO FAR
TODAY...MOST WELL TO THE NORTH AND EAST AS EXPECTED BASED ON MODEL
DYNAMICS AND MOISTURE PROJECTED FROM EARLY TODAY. THE SHORTTERM
MODELS AGREE ON MOVING THE UPPER LOW NORTHEAST OVERNIGHT BUT LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS EXTENSIVE THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA AND ALONG
THE COAST. TOPS CURRENTLY AT 3K FEET PLUS. WITH WRAPAROUND MOISTURE
FROM THE UPPER LOW MOVING ACROSS THE BAY AREA THIS AFTERNOON WILL
INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF AN EVENING SHOWER NORTH BAY COUNTIES AND
PERHAPS DOWN TO SAN FRANCISCO AS THE UPPER LOW TRANSITIONS. ON
WEDNESDAY THINGS START TO LOOK UP. MODELS IN AGREEMENT WITH NICE
HEIGHT RISES WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AND SOME DRYING OF THE
ATMOSPHERE...ALTHOUGH THE MARINE LAYER WILL STILL BE A FACTOR AND
ONSHORE FLOW MODERATE. FOR US THIS SHOULD MEAN A LITTLE WARMING
THROUGH THURSDAY BUT THE NIGHTTIME/MORNING LOW CLOUDS WILL BE BACK IN
CYCLE. BY LATE THURSDAY THE SHORTTERM MODELS DEVELOP A TROUGH OFF THE
CENTRAL COAST WHICH SHOULD INCREASE THE MARINE LAYER AND THE
POSSIBILITY OF A DRIZZLE SITUATION AGAIN.  ALSO TEMPERATURES SHOULD
COOL SLIGHTLY FROM WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AS WE HEAD INTO THE
WEEKEND. ON FRIDAY THE CANADIAN AND NOGAPS MODLES DEVELOP A DECENT
AMPLITUDE TROUGH OVER THE WEST COAST...DROPPING 500 MB HEIGHTS TO
NEAR 575 FOR THE BAY AREA. THE MRF DEVELOPS A BROADER AND WEAKER
TROUGH ON FRIDAY. CONSIDERING THE DEVELOPMENT BY THE SHORTTERM MODELS
OF THE TROUGH OFF THE COAST LATE THURSDAY...TEND TO LEAN TOWARD THE
CANADIAN/NOGAPS SOLUTION. FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEKEND THE
MIDRANGE MODELS ARE ALL MORE IN AGREEMENT...KEEPING A BROAD TROUGH
OVER THE WEST COAST WITH 500 MB HEIGHTS ABOVE 580. THIS LIKELY WILL
MEAN BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH SUNDAY.

FRANCISCO BAY AREA...MAKING A SLIGHT NEWD MOVEMENT THE LAST FEW
HOURS. THE MARINE LAYER HAS PUMPED UP AND IS 2500 TO 3000 FEET FROM
1500 TO 2000 FEET LAST NIGHT. THE MAIN CONCERN TODAY IS SHOWER
POTENTIAL. WATER VAPOR LOOP SHOWS MAIN MOISTURE DEVELOPMENT N AND E
OF THE LOW WHICH IS WHERE THE BEST DYNAMICS IS. HOWEVER SOME OF THE
SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE BANDS ARE WRAPPING AROUND THE LOW AND MOVING
WEST OVER THE NORTH BAY COUNTIES. BELIEVE IT PRUDENT TO UP POPS FOR
THE NORTHERN COUNTIES FOR A BETTER CHANCE OF LIGHT SHOWERS TODAY AND
WILL UPDATE THE ZONES ACCORDINGLY. MODELS CONTINUE TO MOVE THE UPPER
LOW NE THROUGH TONIGHT BUT KEEP LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ABUNDANT OVER THE
AREA. THEREFORE WILL PLAY DOWN THE SHOWER THREAT AFTER TONIGHT BUT
CONTINUE THE STRATUS REGIME. NO OTHER CHANGES TO THE MORNING PACKAGE
AND WILL KEEP THE SLIGHT EDGE UP IN TEMPS FOR WEDNESDAY AS THE LOW
MOVES TO THE NORTHEAST. FOR THE EXTENDED...THE MRF BRINGS A TROF THRU

WATER VAPOR PIX SUGGEST THE CENTER OF THE CUTOFF LOW IS NEAR BIG SUR
AND MOVING NEWD A LITTLE FASTER THAN THE ETA FORECAST...MORE IN LINE
WITH THE AVN.  THE MODELS HAVE BEEN DOING QUITE WELL WITH THE
DEVELOPMENT AND MOVEMENT OF THIS SYSTEM OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS.  THE
LOW IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO MIX OUT THE MARINE LAYER...WHICH IS WELL
DEFINED AND AROUND 1500-2000 FEET DEEP AS SHOWN BY THE FT ORD
PROFILER.  HOWEVER...THERE ARE GOOD DYNAMICS ON THE E AND N SIDES OF
THE LOW IN AN AREA OF STRONG THICKNESS DIFFLUENCE...AND CONVECTION IS
OCCURRING IN THESE AREAS.  FRESNO JUST HAD A TSTM AND TIPPED THE
BUCKET ONCE.  GIVEN THE NEWD MOVEMENT OF THE CUTOFF AND CURRENT
EVENTS...THE BEST DYNAMICS WILL REMAIN N AND E OF OUR FORECAST AREA
TDA AND DONT EXPECT ANY TSTMS IN OUR REGION.  HOWEVER...THE AIRMASS
IS FORECAST TO REMAIN MODERATELY UNSTABLE WITH LIFTED INDEX VALUES
AS LOW AS ZERO THIS AFTN IN THE DELTA...AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS
FAIRLY ABUNDANT AND FORECAST BY THE ETA TO INCREASE A LITTLE THIS
PM.  SO ITS CERTAINLY WISE TO RETAIN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVER
OUR FORECAST AREA THRU THIS EVENING.  AFTER THAT THE CUTOFF WILL
ACCELERATE NEWD OUT OF CA AND THE SHOWER THREAT WILL END.  WITH A
GOOD MARINE LAYER IN PLACE WE SHOULD SEE EXTENSIVE STRATUS AGAIN
TNGT...WITH CLEARING TO THE COAST WED AFTN AND SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPS
INLAND.

IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...THE MRF BRINGS YET ANOTHER TROF THRU NRN/
CNTRL CA THU NIGHT/FRI WITH A WEAK...LOW AMPLITUDE TROF LINGERING
OVER OUR DISTRICT THRU THE WEEKEND.  THE EURO AND CANADIAN MODELS
ARE SLIGHTLY WEAKER WITH THE INITIAL SYSTEM BUT THEN KEEP MUCH OF ITS
ENERGY IN PLACE OVER THE W COAST SAT/SUN IN THE FORM OF A BAGGY TROF
WITH LOWER 500 MB HEIGHTS THAN THE MRF FORECAST.  SINCE WE HAVE HAD A
TROF OVER CA MOST OF THE TIME FOR MANY MONTHS NOW...SEE NO REASON
TO DOUBT THE EURO/CANADIAN SOLUTION AND WILL KEEP INLAND TEMPS A
LITTLE BELOW NORMAL THRU THE WEEKEND.  THE SYSTEM MAY BE STRONG
ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A FEW SPRINKLES NEAR THE OREGON BORDER ON FRI...BUT
NOTHING AS WIDESPREAD AS GENERATED BY THE CURRENT CUTOFF.

SHORTWAVE TROF ROTATING UP EASTERN SIDE OF OFFSHORE CUTOFF LOW
PRODUCED WIDESPREAD MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS OVER NRN AND CENTRAL
CA...AS WELL AS A HEALTHY OUTBREAK OF CONVECTION OVER THE SIERRA
EARLIER THIS EVENING AND EVEN A FEW SPRINKLES IN THE SAN FRANCISCO
BAY AREA. BASED ON WATER VAPOR SATELLITE LOOP...CUTOFF APPEARS TO BE
BEGINNING ITS SLOW ENE MOVEMENT AS FORECAST BY THE MODELS. CUTOFFS
USUALLY MOVE EWD SLOWER THAN FORECAST...ALTHOUGH SHORTWAVE NEAR
45N/140W APPEARS TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO ACT AS THE NECESSARY KICKER.
AS LOW MOVES INLAND ON TUESDAY...SHOWER ACTIVITY WILL INCREASE...
PARTICULARLY OVER THE INTERIOR OF CA. MODELS FORECAST MOST
INSTABILITY OVER SIERRA AND SIERRA FOOTHILLS WHERE SYNOPTIC LIFT WILL
BE STRONGEST IN CONJUNCTION WITH NEXT SHORTWAVE ROTATING AROUND BASE
OF CUTOFF. AVN FORECASTS A RATHER DEEP MOIST LAYER BY MIDDAY
TUESDAY...BUT NECESSARY LIFT OVER OUR DISTRICT MAY BE LIMITED DUE TO
LACK OF SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT. BEST CHANCES APPEAR TO BE IN THE EAST
BAY. HOWEVER...A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS MAY SPRING UP ALMOST ANYWHERE AS
COLD AIR ALOFT WITH UPPER LOW MOVES OVERHEAD. 00Z ETA FORECASTS A
WEAK SHORTWAVE TO ROTATE ACROSS THE N SFO BAY AREA TUE...WHICH WOULD
ENHANCE PRECIP CHANCES THERE. GIVEN ALL THAT...HAVE UPDATED ZONES TO
ADD SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TO THE N BAY AND INCREASE POPS IN THE EAST BAY
A BIT. ALTHOUGH UPPER LOW HAS WEAKENED THE MARINE INVERSION...LOW
LEVELS REMAIN MOIST AND MIXING WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO CLEAR
LOW CLOUDS OUT. 

UPPER LOW WILL MOVE OUT OF THE AREA TUE NIGHT AND SHOWER THREAT WILL
END BY WED MORNING. SHORTWAVE RIDGING ON WED WILL BRING CLEARING AND
WARMER TEMPS.

HEIGHTS BEGIN TO LOWER THURS NIGHT AS NEXT SYSTEM DROPS S OUT OF
BRITISH COLUMBIA. THIS SYSTEM WILL BRING A THREAT OF RAIN ONLY TO FAR
NRN CA. MAIN IMPACT ON OUR DISTRICTS WEATHER WILL BE AN INCREASE IN
ONSHORE FLOW AND COOLER TEMPS AT THE END OF THE WEEK.

SHOWERS TO THE EAST OF THE AREA IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY MOVING
NORTHWARD ON THE UPPER JET. ALL OF THIS IS DUE TO A SOMEWHAT

THE WEATHER PATTERN IS FAIRLY COMPLEX FOR EARLY AUGUST.  THE SURFACE
PRESSURE PATTERN IS RATHER WEAK...ONLY 1.6 MB ONSHORE SFO-SAC AT 08Z
WITH NO N-S GRADIENT FROM ACV TO SFO.  THERE IS NO MARINE INVERSION. 
HOWEVER...THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE REMAIN QUITE MOIST AND
THE USUAL EXTENSIVE LOW CLOUD COVER HAS DEVELOPED OVER OUR FORECAST
AREA DESPITE THE LACK OF THE USUAL MARINE CONDITIONS.  BY THE SAME
TOKEN...THE ABSENCE OF THOSE FACTORS SHOULD ALLOW THE CLOUDS TO CLEAR
READILY IN MOST AREAS AGAIN TODAY...WITH LOTS OF AFTN SUNSHINE.  THE
AIRMASS IS FORECAST TO WARM SLIGHTLY...SO EXPECT MAXES TO RISE A
COUPLE DEGREES INLAND.  AS USUAL...LITTLE CHANGE ON THE COAST.

FORECAST TO REFORM THE CUTOFF JUST OFF OUR COAST BY THIS EVENING. 
THE SYSTEM THEN DROPS TO A POSITION W OF PT CONCEPTION BY MON AFTN. 
FROM THERE IT WILL GENERATE A DIFFLUENT FLOW ALOFT OVER OUR FORECAST
AREA...WHICH SHOULD PRODUCE DECENT LOW/MID LEVEL MOISTURE AS A RESULT
OF UPWARD VERTICAL MOTION.  THE AIRMASS OVER OUR AREA WILL ALSO
BECOME MORE UNSTABLE.  AS A RESULT...ITS POSSIBLE WE WILL SEE A
REPEAT OF FRIDAYS SHOWER ACTIVITY OVER OUR AREA ON MON.  THE ETA ISNT
GIVING US AS MUCH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN A

SUMMER WEATHER PATTERN FOR OUR FORECAST AREA.  THERE IS STILL NOT
MUCH OF A MARINE LAYER...IF ANY...BUT WITH ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL

FORECASTS. NGM HAS BEEN SHOWING THE PRECIPITATION THAT IS NOW

THAT MODEL POPS ARE QUITE LOW FOR QPF ABOVE .01 INCHES.

ECHOES 90-100 NM WEST OF MONTEREY BAY.  SSMI CONTINUES TO SHOW 
LITTLE PRECIPITATION...BUT SEVERAL MOUNTAIN ALERT GAGES HAVE 
REGISTERED PRECIPITATION OF .04 INCHES OR LESS. SATELLITE PICTURES 
INDICATE THAT THIS BAND SHOULD CONTINUE TO ADVANCE ON THE CENTRAL 
COAST EVEN AS THE MARINE LAYER CONTINUES TO DEEPEN BEYOND 3000 
FEET.  SATELLITE PICTURES WOULD ALSO INDICATE THAT VERY LITTLE 
CONVECTION IS ACTUALLY OCCURRING IN THE BAND OF CLOUDS FILLING THE 
EASTERN QUARTER OF THE UPPER LEVEL LOW. THE WARM AIR ABOVE THE BASE 
OF THE INVERSION...NOW ABOVE 3000 FEET HAS COOLED ABOUT 5 DEG C BUT 
REMAINS ABOUT 5 DEG C WARMER THAN TO COOLEST AIR BELOW IT. SO 
AMOUNTS WILL BE VERY LIGHT AND SOME MEASURABLE RAIN MAY BE DUE TO 
HEAVY DRIZZLE. THIS BAND SHOULD STILL BE IN THE AREA TOMORROW AND A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN REMAINS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.

CURRENT FORECAST OF THE MRF FOR THE LOW TO REMAIN ON THE COAST JUST 
SOUTH OF POINT ARENA LOOK GOOD OUT THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON...FROM 
THERE IT IS STILL QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE LOW WILL LIFT OUT TOWARD

AN UNSEASONABLY STRONG UPPER LEVEL CUTOFF LOW HAS DROPPED INTO OUR

FAR BELOW NORMAL INLAND...ESPECIALLY THRU THE INLAND VALLEYS OF THE
EAST BAY.  THE MAX AT LIVERMORE IS SUPPOSED TO BE RIGHT AROUND 90 AT
THIS TIME OF YEAR...AND TODAYS HIGH THERE WAS ONLY 64.  WHERE IS THE
WARM AIR?  ITS WAY UP NORTH.  ON THIS DATE THE AVERAGE HIGH AT BARROW
ALASKA...ON THE SHORES OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN...IS ONLY 44.  TODAY...IT
WAS 74  SO IT WAS 10 DEGREES WARMER AT THE ARCTIC OCEAN TODAY THAN
AT LIVERMORE...AN EVENT THAT HAS TO BE EXTREMELY RARE. 

THE CUTOFF IS CENTERED JUST W OF PT ARENA...A LITTLE S OF THE AVN
FORECAST POSITION BUT EVEN FARTHER S THAN THE ETA FORECAST.  AN
ASSOCIATED CLOUD BAND WITH A WELL DEFINED BACK EDGE HAS REACHED THE
COAST.  PRECIP WITH THIS FEATURE IS MOSTLY ALOFT AS THE ECHOES FADED
OUT AS THE BAND APPROACHED THE MT UMUNHUM RADAR...AND IT APPEARS THAT
ALL WE WILL GET OUT OF IT IS SOME COASTAL DRIZZLE AND LOTS OF CLOUDS. 
ITS POSSIBLE THAT MORE CLOUDS AND SOME SHOWERS COULD DEVELOP
OVERNIGHT DUE TO DYNAMICS ACCOMPANYING A JET MAX THAT IS CURRENTLY
ROUNDING THE SW SIDE OF THE CUTOFF AND PREPARING TO MOVE INTO OUR
FORECAST AREA.  THE ETA AND AVN BOTH FORECAST THE LEFT FRONT QUADRANT
OF THIS JET TO MOVE THRU OUR AREA TNGT/FRI MRNG...ALONG WITH UPPER

FRI AFTN.  THUS...WILL LEAVE LIKELY DRIZZLE OR LIGHT RAIN IN THE
FORECAST FOR THE IMMEDIATE COAST THRU FRI MRNG...WITH A CHANCE OF
LIGHT SHOWERS INLAND.  THIS REPRESENTS A DROP IN POPS FROM THE AFTN
FORECAST BUT IS STILL VERY WET FOR EARLY AUGUST.  

TEMPS WILL REMAIN FAR BELOW NORMAL OVER THE INTERIOR ON FRI...AND MAY
ACTUALLY BE A LITTLE LOWER THAN TODAY AS THE AIRMASS COOLS EVEN MORE. 
EXPECT SOME WARMING SAT AS THE CUTOFF DRIFTS N.  AFTER THE DYNAMICS
WEAKEN ON FRI AFTN WE SHOULD SEE A NOTABLE DECREASE IN CLOUD COVER AS

AN UPPER LEVEL LOW...WHICH IS DEEP FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR...IS
CURRENTLY CENTERED ABOUT 380 MILES WEST OF ASTORIA OREGON AND IS
MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHWARD. A SHORT WAVE TROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW
MOVED THROUGH CENTRAL CA ON WEDNESDAY WHICH INCREASED THE MARINE
LAYER AND PRODUCED SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE SIERRA
NEVADA AND NORTHERN MOUNTAINS. THE MARINE LAYER IS NOW VERY DEEP WITH
TOPS AROUND 2500 FEET ACCORDING TO THE FT ORD PROFILER.
THUS...EXTENSIVE COASTAL STRATUS HAS MOVED FAR INLAND THIS MORNING.
THE LOW IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE MOVING SOUTHWARD UNTIL IT REACHES
CAPE MENDOCINO FRIDAY MORNING AND THEN REMAIN FAIRLY STATIONARY
THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND 1000-500MB THICKNESSES WILL BE SLOWLY
DROPPING TO NEAR 5620M. AS THE LOW MOVES SOUTH...THE ASSOCIATED
INSTABILITY AND COOLING ALOFT WILL ACT TO LIFT AND BREAK UP THE LOW
CLOUDS. BUT...A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW LIES OFF THE
NORTHERN CA COAST. SO THE LOW CLOUDS WILL BE REPLACED BY THE MID/HIGH

NORMAL THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THERE WILL ALSO BE MORE COASTAL DRIZZLE
AT NIGHT. A FEW SHOWERS OVER THE NORTH BAY ARE NOT OUT OF THE
QUESTION BUT CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH SO WILL LEAVE OUT OF THE FORECAST

THROUGH MONDAY BUT VARY ON INTENSITY AND EXACT POSITION. BEYOND THAT
THE NEW MRF HAS A VERY DIFFERENT SOLUTION THAN PREVIOUS RUN. LAST
NIGHTS MRF HAD THE CUTOFF LOW GRADUALLY MOVING NORTHWESTWARD AND

GOOD JOB ON THIS EVOLUTION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE NOGAPS...WHICH
HAS BEEN TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO KICK THE SYSTEM INLAND FOR SEVERAL
DAYS.  HOWEVER...IT APPEARS THE ETA MAY BE INITIALIZING THE SYSTEM A
LITTLE TOO FAR W...IT HAS IT NEAR 40/140.  AT ANY RATE THE MODEL
FORECASTS THE CUTOFF TO BE CENTERED AROUND 47/135 BY 00Z WED AND IF
THE SYSTEM STAYS ABOUT WHERE IT IS...THE FORECAST WILL BE VERY CLOSE. 
THE PATTERN OVER OUR FORECAST AREA IS NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE MUCH
THRU WED...WITH A RELATIVELY SHALLOW MARINE LAYER BUT A STRONG
ONSHORE FLOW.  THUS EXPECT MAX TEMPS TO BE ABOUT THE SAME OVER THE
NEXT TWO DAYS...NEAR NORMAL ON THE COAST AND SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL
INLAND.  ONE CONCERN THAT MAY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED ON THE MID SHIFT
IS LOCAL DENSE FOG.  THE FORT ORD PROFILER CURRENTLY SHOWS A MARINE
LAYER AROUND 1200 FEET DEEP...SHALLOW ENOUGH TO GENERATE AREAS OF
THICK FOG NEAR THE OCEAN.

THERE MIGHT BE ENOUGH ENERGY IN THE SYSTEM TO GENERATE A FEW SHOWERS

CUTOFF SLIGHTLY CLOSER TO SHORE THAN THE OTHER MODELS.  ALL THREE
SOLUTIONS WOULD PROBABLY GENERATE ENOUGH LOW LEVEL SUBSIDENCE AND

ALMOST COMPLETELY EACH AFTN.  MONSOON MOISTURE IS CURRENTLY JUST E OF

SOMEWHAT OVER OUR AREA...THOUGH THE BASIC ONSHORE FLOW PATTERN WILL
NOT CHANGE.  THE CURRENT FORECAST OF TEMPS STAYING THE SAME OR RISING
SLIGHTLY OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS LOOKS FINE AND WILL NOT UPDATE.  

AS THE LOW MOVES AWAY FROM US...IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING TO SEE
COASTAL STRATUS INCREASE IN COVERAGE AND DURATION.  FOR THE LAST 5
DAYS OR SO THE STRATUS HAS BEEN UNUSUALLY SPARSE FOR THIS TIME OF
YEAR...PROBABLY DUE TO LOW LEVEL SUBSIDENCE GENERATED BY THE NEARBY
CUTOFF.  WITH THE NEW LOW SETTING UP MUCH FARTHER FROM US...THE
SUBSIDENCE WILL END AND THE RESULT SHOULD BE MORE COASTAL CRUD THAN
WE HAVE HAD FOR THE PAST WEEK OR SO.  WITH A SHALLOWER MARINE
INVERSION...THIS SHOULD NOT STOP INLAND TEMPS FROM WARMING SLIGHTLY.

LATEST IR IMAGERY INDICATING UPPER LEVEL LOW OFFSHORE CA HAS
RETROGRADED EVER SO SLIGHTLY TO THE WEST FROM THIS TIME YESTERDAY -
STILL NEARLY STATIONARY HOWEVER AND CURRENTLY NEAR 37N/136W. QUICK
LOOK AT NEW ETA CONTINUES PREVIOUS MODEL TRENDS OF WAITING UNTIL
SUNDAY NIGHT TO OPEN UP LOW INTO TROF AS IT SLOWLY EJECTS TO THE
NORTH SUNDAY NIGHT/MONDAY. MODELS HAVE DONE A REASONABLE JOB WITH
THIS LOW AND CAN SEE NO REASON TO BEGIN DOUBTING THIS SOLUTION.

AS FAR AS THE LOCAL WEATHER SITUATION GOES - STRATUS A LITTLE FURTHER
INLAND THIS MORNING THAN YESTERDAY OVER THE NORTH BAY INTERIOR.
HOWEVER BIG BREAKS IN CLOUD COVER OVER MARIN COUNTY AND SAN PABLO BAY
AS WELL AS THE SOUTH BAY. JUST A BIT STRONGER ONSHORE FLOW COMPARED
TO THIS TIME YESTERDAY - 2.5 MB FROM SFO-MCC AT 8 AM. COMPARISON OF
12Z OAK SOUNDINGS IN ADDITION TO FT ORD PROFILER DATA SHOWS MARINE
LAYER VERY SIMILAR IN DEPTH TO YESTERDAY - ONLY APPROX 200 FT DEEPER
THIS MORNING. BUT THE TREND SHOWN IN VIS IMAGERY IS THAT CLOUDS ARE
GOING CLEAR MOST AREAS AROUND THE SAME TIME AS YESTERDAY OR A LITTLE
EARLIER. DUE TO A LITTLE MORE EXTENSIVE STRATUS SHOWN OFFSHORE THE
CLOUDS MAY LINGER A BIT LONGER AT PLACES LIKE PACIFICA AND THE SAN
MATEO COAST. FOR TONIGHT - LOOKS LIKE A REPEAT OF LAST NIGHT.
APPROACHING SHORTWAVE AND INCREASING SWLY FLOW ALOFT SHOULD SPREAD

CONTINUES ITS EXISTENCE IN ABOUT THE SAME PLACE FOR DAYS. AIRMASS
OVER THE STATE THIS MORNING MUCH DRYER THAN FRIDAY AND MONSOON
MOISTURE WELL CONFINED TO ARIZONA. THE SURFACE LAYER AT THE COAST IS
ANOTHER STORY. THE STRATUS IS MORE EXTENSIVE AND PROFILER DATA SHOWS
THE MARINE LAYER ABOUT 1700 FEET DEEP ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST. THE
ONSHORE FLOW IS A LITTLE BIT STRONGER THIS MORNING AS WELL. THE
MODELS PROJECT A WEAK SHORT WAVE THROUGH THE AREA TODAY WHICH SHOULD
ENHANCE THE MARINE LAYER AND RESULT IN JUST A LITTLE LATER CLEARING
INLAND. MOST AREAS WILL SEE ABUNDANT SUNSHINE THIS AFTERNOON EXCEPT
FOR LOCAL SPOTS RIGHT AT THE COAST. DAYTIME HIGHS WILL BE ABOUT
NORMAL AT THE COAST TO NEAR NORMAL INLAND OR JUST A TAD COOLER.
MODELS FINALLY START TO MOVE THE UPPER LOW TO THE NORTH BY LATE
SUNDAY...ALTHOUGH NOT SIGNIFICANTLY UNTIL MONDAY AFTERNOON WHEN IT IS
PROJECTED TO BE CENTERED NEAR 45N/140W. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US IS
CONTINUED SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WITH GOOD ONSHORE FLOW NEAR THE
SURFACE AND MORE OF THE DIURNAL STRATUS PATTERN. AS THE UPPER LOW
MOVES FURTHER OUT OF OUR NECK OF THE WOODS DURING THE EARLY PART OF
THE WEEK THE MRF SHOWS AN UPPER LEVEL HIGH INTENSIFYING OVER THE FOUR
CORNERS AREA. WHILE THIS IS GOING ON ANOTHER SHORT WAVE DEVELOPS OFF
THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND BECOMES A

FAMILIAR AND IF TRUE...WE WOULD GO THROUGH THIS WHOLE SCENARIO ONCE
AGAIN. THE NOGAPS AND CANADIAN MODELS HOWEVER KEEP A BROADER TROUGH
OVER THE AREA NEXT WEEK WITH THE UPPER HIGH FURTHER TO THE EAST.

OAK RAOB AND FORT ORD PROFILER SHOW THE MARINE LAYER COMPRESSING OVER
OUR FORECAST AREA...DOWN TO 1200-1500 FEET.  THE RAOB SHOWS THAT AS
THE LAYER THINS...THE MOISTURE WITHIN IT IS BECOMING MORE
CONCENTRATED WITH A MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE STRATUS FIELD ALONG THE COAST
THAN AT THIS TIME YESTERDAY.  A WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVING NEWD ONTO THE
COAST MAY ALSO BE ADDING A LITTLE MOISTURE TO THE LAYER.  THIS
FEATURE WAS WELL ADVERTISED ON LAST NIGHTS MODELS.  WHAT THIS ALL
MEANS IS THAT STRATUS COVERAGE WILL BE MUCH MORE WIDESPREAD AND LONG
LIVED THAN LAST NIGHT...THOUGH DONT EXPECT IT TO SPREAD AS FAR INLAND
AS LIVERMORE AND CONCORD DUE TO THE SHALLOWNESS OF THE LAYER.  THE
CLOUDS SHOULD BURN OFF TO THE BEACHES SAT BUT MAY NOT DISAPPEAR FROM
MANY SPOTS ALONG THE IMMEDIATE COAST.  CURRENT FORECAST GENERALLY
KEEPS TEMPS ABOUT THE SAME AS TODAY...OR SLIGHTLY COOLER...OVER THE

DEGREES LOWER THAN THE CURRENT FORECAST...BUT NOT ENOUGH TO UPDATE
THE ZONES.  EITHER WAY TEMPS WILL CONTINUE NEAR NORMAL ALONG THE
COAST AND A LITTLE BELOW AVERAGE INLAND.  

THE WATER VAPOR PIX SHOW OUR OFFSHORE CUTOFF RETROGRADING SLIGHTLY
WWD...NEAR 38/136 AT 02Z.  THIS WILL PROBABLY ALSO ENHANCE THE
LONGEVITY OF THE STRATUS AS THE SUBSIDENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CUTOFF
THAT HAS BEEN AFFECTING OUR AREA RECENTLY WILL DECREASE AS THE LOW
MOVES AWAY FROM US.  IN THE LONGER RANGE THE MODELS DONT MOVE THE
SYSTEM MUCH THRU SUN...THEN IT IS FORECAST TO DRIFT AWAY TO THE NW. 
THE CANADIAN IS THE SLOWEST MODEL WITH THIS MOVEMENT AND MAY BE THE
BEST.  THE NOGAPS/MRF/EURO ALL MOVE THE SYSTEM FASTER AND FARTHER TO

WITHIN THE MARINE LAYER...WHICH IS ABOUT 2000 FEET DEEP THERE AND
SLIGHTLY SHALLOWER AT FT ORD.  SUBSIDENCE ON THE PERIMETER OF THE

PRESSURE GRADIENTS REMAIN FAIRLY STRONG ONSHORE AND EXPECT COASTAL
LOW CLOUDS TO REDEVELOP OVERNIGHT...THEN BURN OFF IN ALL AREAS AGAIN
ON FRI WITH TEMPS ABOUT THE SAME AS TODAY.

THE MODELS SWING A SHORT WAVE INTO OUR FORECAST AREA FROM THE SW ON

THIS SHOULD REINFORCE THE MARINE PUSH AND MAY ADD A LITTLE LOW LEVEL

UPPER TROF IS DEEPENING OFF THE NRN CA COAST THIS EVENING AS A WELL
DEFINED VORTICITY CENTER...EASILY SEEN ON WATER VAPOR SATELLITE
LOOP...MOVES TOWARD THE BASE OF THE TROF AND THE CENTRAL CA COAST. 
AS THE TROF HAS DEEPENED OFFSHORE...SO HAS THE MARINE LAYER. FT ORD
PROFILER SHOWS THE BASE HEIGHT OF THE INVERSION APPROACHING 800
METERS. WITH SUCH A DEEP MARINE LAYER AND GOOD ONSHORE FLOW...3.3 MB
FROM SFO TO SAC...EXPECT LOW CLOUDS TO MOVE WELL INLAND OVERNIGHT.
AS VORTICITY CENTER SWINGS INLAND OVER OUR AREA ON MONDAY...IT WILL
USHER IN COOLER AIR ALOFT...A DROP OF 2-3 DEGREES C AT 850 MB...AND
GREATLY WEAKEN THE MARINE INVERSION. IMPORTANT QUESTION IS...WILL IT
WEAKEN THE INVERSION ENOUGH TO PRODUCE SUBSTANTIAL CLEARING IN OUR
AREA...OR WILL THE DEEP LAYER OF LOW CLOUDS HANG AROUND MUCH OF THE
DAY. BELIEVE INVERSION WILL BE WEAKENED ENOUGH FOR SOME
CLEARING...BUT WINDS WILL NOT LIKELY BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PRODUCE
SUFFICIENT MIXING FOR WIDESPREAD CLEARING. ALSO...WINDS ALOFT WILL
REMAIN SOUTHERLY AND SHOULD PROMOTE CLEARING IN PLACES WITH HILLS TO
THE S...LIKE MRY...SJC AND SFO. TEMPS ON MONDAY WILL BE DEPEND
GREATLY ON THE AMOUNT OF CLEARING AND STRENGTH OF SLY FLOW ALOFT. 

TROF FORECAST TO HOLD PRETTY MUCH IN PLACE INTO TUESDAY...THEN
IS REINFORCED WHEN A DEEPER CLOSED LOW DROPS S ALONG THE COAST
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THIS LOW WILL BE FURTHER OFFSHORE WHICH WOULD RESULT
IN A MORE STABLE MARINE LAYER IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD. ALL POPS ZERO.

STRATUS IS NOT PENETRATING AS FAR INLAND AS AT THIS TIME SAT MRNG. 
THE MARINE LAYER IS A LITTLE SHALLOWER...1500-2000 FEET DEEP PER FORT
ORD PROFILER...AND ONSHORE GRADIENTS ARE SLIGHTLY WEAKER THAN 24
HOURS AGO.  THESE TWO FACTORS SHOULD LEAD TO SLIGHTLY HIGHER MAX
TEMPS TODAY ALTHOUGH THE AIRMASS OVERHEAD IS NOT FORECAST TO GET ANY
WARMER.  THERE IS A WEAK VORTCENTER JUST W OF SFO THAT IS DISRUPTING
THE STRATUS PATTERN TO SOME EXTENT...AND SHOULD PROVIDE ENOUGH MIXING
TO CLEAR ALMOST ALL THE CRUD AGAIN THIS AFTN...SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY.
ON MON THE UPPER LEVEL TROF THAT HAS BEEN LURKING NEAR OUR AREA WILL
MOVE CLOSER TO THE COAST WITH LOWER 500 MB HEIGHTS...THICKNESSES...
AND 850 MB TEMPS.  THIS COOL ADVECTION SHOULD MIX OUT THE MARINE
LAYER ALMOST COMPLETELY...DISPERSING THE STRATUS BY MIDDAY ALTHOUGH
LEAVING TEMPS COOL WITH MAXES A COUPLE DEGREES LOWER IN MANY AREAS. 
SO THE WEATHER WORD FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS IS COOLER...BUT NOT
CLOUDIER OVERALL...THAN NORMAL.

OF A CUTOFF LOW TO THE W OR NW OF NRN/CNTRL CA TUE THRU THU.  THEY
FORECAST VARIOUS POSITIONS AND INTENSITIES FOR THIS SYSTEM...BUT WIND
UP AGREEING PRETTY WELL ON A SWLY FLOW ALOFT WITH SIMILAR 500 MB

SUBSTANTIAL CLEARING OF LOW CLOUDS OCCURRED ALONG THE COAST LATE THIS
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. BELIEVE THERE WERE TWO REASONS FOR THIS.
FIRST...COOL ADVECTION ALOFT WEAKENED THE MARINE INVERSION.
SECOND...MODELS SHOW AN 850 MB CIRCULATION CENTER NEAR THE GOLDEN
GATE. CIRCULATION TO THE N OF THIS CENTER BROUGHT DRIER AIR ALOFT
OVER THE COASTAL WATERS...WHICH HELPED MIX OUT AN ALREADY WEAKENED
MARINE LAYER. PROFILER DATA INDICATE INVERSION MAY BE STRENGTHENING
ONCE AGAIN...AS A WEAK SHORTWAVE RIDGE ALOFT...SEEN ON WATER VAPOR
SATELLITE LOOP...MOVES OVERHEAD. A STRONGER INVERSION COMBINED WITH
CONTINUED MODERATE ONSHORE FLOW AT THE SURFACE WILL MEAN STRATUS
SHOULD REFORM ALONG MOST OF THE COAST OVERNIGHT AND MOVE
INLAND...ALTHOUGH PROBABLY NOT QUITE AS FAR INLAND AS LAST NIGHT. 
COOL ADVECTION WILL RESUME LATER TONIGHT AS WEAK SHORTWAVE OFFSHORE
SWINGS INLAND...THEN STRENGTHEN ON MONDAY AS UPPER TROF DEEPENS
OFFSHORE. CONTINUED COLD ADVECTION WILL FURTHER WEAKEN THE MARINE
INVERSION AND ALLOW FOR SIGNIFICANT COASTAL CLEARING. HOWEVER...THIS
WILL ALSO MEAN CONTINUED BELOW NORMAL TEMPS...ESPECIALLY INLAND. 

MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ALL KEEP A TROF JUST OFFSHORE THROUGH THE
EXTENDED...ALTHOUGH THEY DIFFER AS TO RELATIVE STRENGTH AND
PLACEMENT. A CONSENSUS OF MODELS WOULD MEAN CONTINUED BELOW NORMAL

WIDESPREAD STRATUS RULES OUR FORECAST AREA AGAIN THIS MRNG.  COVERAGE
IS SIMILAR TO LAST NIGHTS WITH ONLY MINOR DIFFERENCES IN TEMPS AND
PRESSURE GRADIENTS.  HAVENT HAD PROFILER DATA THIS MRNG BUT FROM THE
LAST AVAILABLE INFO AT 01Z...THE MARINE LAYER REMAINS 2000-2500 FEET
DEEP.  HOWEVER...THE AIR ALOFT ABOVE THE LAYER HAS CONTINUED TO COOL
...SO THE INVERSION IS LESS WELL DEFINED.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW SOMEWHAT
BETTER MIXING THIS AFTN...AND EXPECT THE STRATUS TO CLEAR A LITTLE
MORE READILY THAN IT DID ON FRI.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO MOVE UP
A DEGREE OR TWO.  LITTLE CHANGE IS SEEN FOR SUNDAY.

THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS FORECAST A VARIETY OF SOLUTIONS FOR THE
EXTENDED PERIOD.  THEY ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR MON...DROPPING 500
MB HEIGHTS AND 1000-500 MB THICKNESSES AS THE W COAST TROF SHARPENS A
LITTLE.  THUS MON WILL BE COOL...BUT WITH THE AIR ALOFT EVEN COOLER

TUE THE MODELS DIVERGE WIDELY.  THE EURO/CANADIAN ARE THE WARMEST

METEOROLOGICAL WISDOM OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. ALSO...THAT THE
VARIOUS FORECAST PRODUCTS THAT I HAVE ISSUED OVER THE YEARS HAVE BEEN 
BENEFICIAL TO THE USERS OUT THERE...

ALREADY MOVED WELL INLAND THROUGH THE MRY BAY AREA INTO THE NRN SNS

00Z OAK SOUNDING AND LATEST FT ORD PROFILER AND DEEPENING WITH TIME.
SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENTS ALSO MODERATELY ONSHORE...ACTUALLY A

FOR A CONTINUATION OF A DEEPENING MARINE LAYER AND A GOOD ONSHORE
PUSH OF MARINE AIR WELL INTO COASTAL VALLEYS TONIGHT AND COOL THE
CENTRAL COASTAL FORECAST AREA ANOTHER 5-10 DEGRESS ON THU. THIS
CHANGE FROM THE HEAT WAVE OF A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO TO NEAR NORMAL OR
SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL DAYTIME TEMPERATURES IS THE RESULT OF LOWERING
500 MB HEIGHTS/THICKNESSES AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROF DROPS SWD FROM WRN
CANADA INTO WASHINGTON AND OREGON THIS EVENING. MODELS SHOW TROF WITH

PACIFIC NW WILL EJECT NEWD LATER TONIGHT AND THU AS ANOTHER LOBE SEEN
IN SATELLITE OVER NW CANADA DROPS SWD INTO NW WA...BEHIND THE FIRST
ONE...LATE THU AND FRI. THE ONLY EXPECTED EFFECT OF THIS AS FAR S AS

SHORT WAVE IS PUSHING ALL THE UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE THAT MOVED INTO CA
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS EASTWARD. THIS WILL JUST ABOUT END THE
CHANCE OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS OVER EASTERN AND SOUTHERN CA TONIGHT.
THE MAIN EFFECT THIS SHORT WAVE WILL HAVE ON CENTRAL CA IS TO DEEPEN

THERE IS A SHORT WAVE TROUGH MOVING THROUGH THE PACNW. THIS SHORT

THE FIRST SMALL SIGNS OF A COOLING TREND ARE SHOWING UP...IF YOU KNOW
WHERE TO LOOK.  ALTHOUGH SURFACE TEMPS AT MOST ASOS SITES ARE RUNNING
ABOUT THE SAME AS 24 HOURS AGO...TEMPS IN THE HILLS ARE SLIGHTLY
COOLER.  THIS IS ALSO INDICATED ON THE FORT ORD PROFILER WHERE TEMPS
ARE DOWN A LITTLE IN THE 1000-2000 FOOT ELEVATION RANGE.  THE SFO-SAC
GRADIENT WAS 2.9 MB AT 1 AM...A LITTLE STRONGER THAN LAST NIGHT. 
ALSO OF INTEREST IS THE SFO-SBA GRADIENT WHICH WAS 2 MB FROM S TO N
AT 1 AM.  THIS IS A SIGN OF AN IMMINENT SOUTHERLY SURGE THAT HAS BEEN
ADVERTISED BY THE MODELS FOR A COUPLE DAYS.  THE PROBLEM AT THIS TIME
IS THAT THERE IS NO COASTAL STRATUS ANYWHERE S OF CAPE MENDOCINO. 
HOWEVER...WITH THE INCREASING ONSHORE FLOW...EXPECT FOG TO DEVELOP
BY THIS AFTN OR EVE AND MOVE UP THE COAST TNGT.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS
WE WILL SEE SOME COOLING TODAY...BUT ONLY 4-8 DEGREES IN MOST AREAS. 
THERE ARE STILL LOTS OF HIGH CLOUDS AROUND...AND THE ETA FORECASTS
500 MB MOISTURE TO REMAIN FAIRLY ABUNDANT OVER OUR AREA TDA.  THERE
IS MUCH LESS MOISTURE FORECAST AT LEVELS BELOW 500 MB AND THE WELL
DEFINED EASTERLY FLOW ALOFT THAT WAS PRESENT YDA IS WEAKENING.  SO
THE HIGH CLOUD COVERAGE SHOULD DECREASE TNGT/WED...AND EXPECT DEEP
MOISTURE AND CONVECTION TO REMAIN SE OF OUR AREA.

TNGT/WED THE COOLING TREND WILL ACCELERATE AS THE WINDS ALOFT SHIFT
TO WLY AND THE ONSHORE FLOW STRENGTHENS.  THE MARINE LAYER WILL
DEEPEN...ENDING THE HOT NIGHTS IN THE HILLS...AND TEMPS SHOULD DROP
BACK TO AROUND NORMAL ON WED WITH A CONVENTIONAL COASTAL STRATUS
PATTERN...EXCEPT THAT THE MODELS FORECAST A MORE SLY COMPONENT THAN
USUAL TO THE LOW LEVEL FLOW.  THIS MEANS THAT MONTEREY WILL CLEAR
MORE READILY THAN SANTA CRUZ BY MIDDAY WED.  

THE COOLING DOESNT STOP THERE.  BY THU A RATHER DEEP 500 MB TROF IS
NOW FORECAST TO DROP SWD FROM THE PACIFIC NW INTO CA...AND TEMPS OVER
OUR AREA WILL CONTINUE DROPPING...TO BELOW NORMAL WITH A STRONG WSW
ONSHORE FLOW.  THIS COULD DRIVE STRATUS INLAND AS FAR AS THE DELTA
AND DROP THE TEMPS THERE INTO THE MID 80S OR EVEN LOWER...QUITE A
CHANGE IN JUST 3 DAYS FROM THE 110 DEGREE READINGS THERE ON MON.  THE

MADE IT IN THE SLUGGISH BUT PERSISTENT ELY FLOW ALOFT.  HOWEVER...ITS

BEFORE MORE MOISTURE MOVES IN TNGT...MAINLY S OF SFO.  GIVEN CURRENT

TEMPS.  IF THE CLOUDS HANG AROUND IN FORCE...AFTN MAXES WILL BE LOWER
THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST.  THE ETA INDICATES THE BEST OMEGA AND LIFTED
INDICES TO REMAIN INLAND OF OUR REGION SO WONT FORECAST ANY SHOWERS.

...AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO CLOUDS ON THE SRN CA COAST TO SURGE UP

TODAY WAS THE HOTTEST OF THE YEAR SO FAR AT MANY PLACES IN THE BAY 
AREA WITH TRIPLE DIGIT HIGHS COMMON AT SEVERAL INLAND LOCATIONS. 
MONDAY WILL BE HOT AGAIN AS THE STRONG UPPER HIGH WILL CONTINUE TO 
HOLD FIRM. TEMPS LIKELY TO WARM AN ADDITIONAL DEGREE OR TWO ON 
MONDAY AS MODEL LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES AND 850 MB TEMPS CREEP UP A 
LITTLE MORE. A COUPLE OF ITEMS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON TEMPS 
TOMORROW...AS WELL AS SKY COVER. THE FIRST IS THE MONSOON MOISTURE 
WHICH PRODUCED WIDESPREAD CONVECTION OVER SRN AND ERN CA THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVE. CURRENTLY...HIGH CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH 
TODAYS CONVECTION ARE REMAINING MOSTLY TO OUR EAST. HOWEVER...LATEST

FORECAST LIGHT PRECIP OVER THE SRN PORTION OF OUR AREA LATE MONDAY 
AND MONDAY EVE. THE AVN IS ALMOST CERTAINLY OVERDONE...BUT IF HIGH 
CLOUDS ARE THICK ENOUGH...THEY MAY HOLD MAXES DOWN SOME ON MONDAY. 
THE SECOND ITEM TO WATCH IS COASTAL FOG AND LOW CLOUDS. MARINE LAYER 
HAS BEEN COMPRESSED TO A VERY SHALLOW LAYER AND MOST COASTAL FOG 
DISSIPATED TODAY. THE LATEST ETA INDICATES THAT A WEAK SLY FLOW WILL 
SET UP AT 925 AND 850 MB ALONG MUCH OF THE COAST LATER TONIGHT AND 
CONTINUE INTO MONDAY MORNING. WINDS TURNING SLY AT THESE LEVELS 
USUALLY POINT TO A SLY FLOW ALSO FORMING AT THE SURFACE...ADVECTING

REVERSED AND BECOME S-N. SO WILL NEED TO WATCH THIS SLY FLOW 
SCENARIO CLOSELY THRU THE NIGHT FOR SIGNS OF STRATUS/FOG MOVING N. 
THIS TOO WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON TEMPS MONDAY. BUT WITH SHALLOW

MARINE ST LAYER PERSISTS COASTSIDE THIS AFTERNOON...CLEARING FROM ALL
INLAND AREAS BY LATE MORNING. TOPS OF MARINE LAYER REMAIN IN THE
1200-1500 FOOT RANGE SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY. UPPER LEVEL HIGH...AROUND
594 DM AT THE 500 MB LEVEL CONTINUES AND MODELS TREND LITTLE CHANGE
THROUGH MON. FAIRLY FLAT SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN ALSO. AT 1 PM...
OBSERVATIONS INDICATE ABOUT 4 MB NLY ACV-SFO ABOUT 2.5 MB HIGHER THAN
YESTERDAY. THIS TREND TOWARDS A MORE OFFSHORE COMPONENT...AT LEAST IN
THE N...IS NOT INDICATED ON ANY OF THE MODELS TO CONTINUE.
THEREFORE...EXPECT ONLY MINOR VARIATIONS IN MARINE INFLUENCES OVER
THE CENTRAL COAST FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. THIS MEANS CONTINUED
COOL-MILD DAYTIME CONDITIONS AT THE COAST TO MODERATELY HOT...AROUND
100 IN THE WARMEST INLAND LOCATIONS.

THE OTHER FACTOR AFFECTING THE FORECAST CONCERNS MOISTURE ASSOCIATED
WITH A MODERATELY STRONG SW MONSOON THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING OVER
AZ...SRN CA AND THE SRN SIERRA OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS. SOME
MID/HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE/CLOUDS ARE OVER THE SRN PORTION OF THE
FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON SPIRALING ABOUT A VORTMAX ALONG THE
CA/NV BORDER SE OF MONO LAKE. MOISTURE IS IN THE 12K-20K FT LEVEL
ACCORDING TO 12 OAK SOUNDING. SATELLITE AND MODELS INDICATE MORE OF
THIS MID/HIGH LEVEL MOVING OVER THE AREA LATER TODAY...AGAIN ON SUN
AND ACCORDING TO AVN MODEL...A SLIGHTLY STRONGER SURGE ON MON. NO
PRECIP EXPECTED IN ANY OF THE CENTRAL COASTAL SECTIONS. A FEW
SPRINKLES ARE POSSIBLE OVER THE DIABLO RANGE AND SRN MOUNTAINS EACH
DAY BUT AN INCREASE IN MID/HIGH CLOUD COVER...ESPECIALLY MON AND
ESPECIALLY SRN/ERN PORTIONS ARE EXPECTED OVER AREA. THIS WILL FILTER
THE SUN A LITTLE BUT NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT AFFECT ON
TEMPERATURES. 

MEDIUM RANGE MODELS DIFFER SOME ON KEEPING AN UPPER HIGH PARKED OVER
THE INTERIOR OF THE W. THE MRF KEEPS THE HIGH IN PLACE WELL INTO MID
PORTION OF THE WEEK. THIS IS FAVORABLE FOR WARM-HOT CONDITIONS AWAY
FROM THE COAST AND SOME AMOUNT OF MID/HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE TO CONTINUE
FEEDING INTO THE SIERRA...AND SRN PORTION OF CA. MRF TRENDS A VERY
WEAK UPPER TROF TO SAG INTO THE PACIFIC NW BY THU. THIS MAY OR MAY
NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO COOL DAYTIME TEMPERATURES...PROBABLY SOME IN

ONLY ADDED INGREDIENT TO THE MIX TODAY IS SOME SUBTROPICAL HIGH LEVEL
MOISTURE THAT HAS MOVED INTO THE CENTRAL COAST FROM THE SW MONSOON...
FROM AZ AND SRN CA. SOUNDING SHOWS MOISTURE IN THE 12K-20K LEVEL OF

COASTAL CONDITIONS ARE SIMILAR TO LAST NIGHT...WITH A MARINE LAYER
1200-1500 FEET DEEP AND LOW CLOUDS MOVING INTO MOST COASTAL VALLEYS
BUT NO FARTHER INLAND.  HIGHER UP...WE HAVE A GOOD BATCH OF MID/HIGH
CLOUDS MOVING SLOWLY WWD INTO CNTRL CA.  THESE CLOUDS ARE A PRODUCT
OF MONSOON MOISTURE THAT HAS COME UP FROM AZ...AND THEY ARE
ASSOCIATED WITH A VORTICITY CENTER THE ETA ANALYZES NEAR DEATH
VALLEY.  FROM SATELLITE PIX...THIS POSITION LOOKS GOOD.  WILL USE THE
ETA FOR THE WEEKEND FORECAST SINCE IT HAS A BETTER HANDLE ON THIS
FEATURE THAN OTHER MODELS.  THE ETA DRIFTS THIS VORT SLOWLY NWWD TDA
...ONLY ABOUT AS FAR AS SEQUOIA PARK...THEN MOVES IT WWD TNGT...
REACHING THE CNTRL CA COAST BY EARLY SUN MRNG.  DYNAMICS FOR OUR
FORECAST AREA ARE HARD TO FIND ON THE MODELS AS THE NEGATIVE LIFTED
INDEX VALUES STAY OVER THE DESERTS AS DO THE HIGH THETA-E NUMBERS. 
HOWEVER...THERE COULD EASILY BE SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND HEATING TO
GENERATE A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN MONTEREY AND SAN
BENITO COUNTIES TODAY AND INTO THIS EVENING...SO WILL KEEP THEM IN
THE FORECAST.  BASED ON THE ETAS MOVEMENT OF THE VORT CENTER OUT OF
THE AREA BY EARLY SUNDAY...WE ARE FORECASTING LESS CLOUDINESS AND
WARMER TEMPS...BUT STILL EXPECT SOME HIGH CLOUDS OVER CNTRL CA.

THE MODELS FORECAST HIGHER THICKNESSES AND 850 MB TEMPS OVER OUR
REGION THIS WEEKEND SO EXPECT THE MARINE LAYER TO BEGIN COMPRESSING
THIS AFTN THRU SUN...THOUGH IT WONT DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY.  IF THE
CLOUDS DONT GET TOO THICK MAXES SHOULD GO UP EACH DAY...ESPECIALLY
INLAND.  HOWEVER...PERSISTENT THICK CLOUD COVER COULD ALTER THIS
SCENARIO AND ACTUALLY DROP MAXES TODAY WHILE RAISING TONITES MINS. 
WILL HAVE TO WATCH THE BATCH OF MID CLOUDS CURRENTLY APPROACHING THE
S CNTRL COAST CAREFULLY TODAY.

IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE FORESEEN IN THE
PATTERN THAT WILL BE IN PLACE BY SUNDAY.  EXPECT AT LEAST SOME
MONSOON MOISTURE TO REACH THE NRN SIERRA THIS WEEKEND...AND IT WILL
PROBABLY PERSIST THERE DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD.  THE MRF SUGGESTS
THE MOISTURE MAY SPREAD FARTHER N TO THE OREGON BORDER ON MON...BUT
WILL THEN BE FORCED SWD AGAIN TUE/WED AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROF DROPS
INTO THE PACIFIC NW AND REESTABLISHES A WLY FLOW ALOFT IN EXTREME NRN

MARINE LAYER CONTINUES 1200-1500 FEET DEEP WITH A FAIRLY WEAK ONSHORE
PRESSURE GRADIENT...1.7 MB SFO-SAC AT 20Z.  N-S GRADIENTS ARE ALSO
WEAK...ALMOST FLAT SFO-SBA AND ONLY 2.3 MB ACV-SFO.  THIS MEANS THE
STRATUS SHOULD CONTINUE TO SIT ALONG THE COAST...AND EXPECT IT WILL
MOVE INLAND ABOUT AS FAR TONIGHT AS LAST NIGHT.  AFTER THAT THE RIDGE
IS FORECAST TO STRENGTHEN A LITTLE WITH HIGHER 1000-500 MB
THICKNESSES AND 850 MB TEMPS...SO BELIEVE THE MARINE LAYER WILL
COMPRESS SOMEWHAT BEGINNING SAT PM...LEADING TO WARMER INLAND TEMPS
AND STRATUS STAYING CLOSER TO THE COAST.  THE WARMING IS FORECAST TO
CONTINUE INTO SUN...THEN LEVEL OFF.  BY THAT TIME MAXES IN THE DELTA
SHOULD BE UP TO 100 AGAIN.

THE WILD CARD ELEMENT IN THE FORECAST IS THE MONSOON MOISTURE
SPREADING NWWD UP THE SIERRA NEVADA.  THE MODELS FORECAST A LIGHT
SELY FLOW ALOFT OVER OUR FORECAST AREA THRU THE WEEKEND.  THIS SHOULD
ALLOW SOME MOISTURE TO MOVE AT LEAST INTO THE COASTAL MTNS S OF SAN
JOSE OVER THE WEEKEND...AND POSSIBLY FARTHER NORTH.  PUT A CHANCE OF
A FEW SPRINKLES OVER THE INLAND MOUNTAINS OF MONTEREY/SAN BENITO
COUNTIES TO COVER THIS...AND MAY HAVE TO EXPAND THE CLOUDS/SHOWER
RISK FARTHER NW LATER.  THE MOISTURE MAY ALSO BE A FACTOR DOWN AT SEA
LEVEL.  IF A THICK BATCH OF MID/HI CLOUDS MOVES INTO OUR FORECAST
AREA...IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY RAISE MIN TEMPS AND/OR HOLD DOWN MAXES 
...DEPENDING ON TIMING.  SUCH AN OCCURRENCE ALSO USUALLY DISPERSES
THE COASTAL STRATUS UNDER IT AND WEAKENS THE SEABREEZE.  I HAVE SEEN
COASTAL TEMPS GO WAY UP FOR A DAY...ONLY ONE DAY...UNDER THIS TYPE
OF PATTERN.  ITS VERY HARD TO FORECAST THIS MORE THAN A FEW HOURS IN
ADVANCE AND WONT DO SO AT THIS TIME...BUT WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE
POSSIBLE SCENARIO.

THE ANTICIPATED WEATHER PATTERN FOR SUNDAY...LIGHT SELY FLOW...
MONSOON MOISTURE...WARM AIRMASS...AND SHALLOW BUT PERSISTENT MARINE

900 AM PDT FRI JUL 09 1999

OUR FORECAST AREA IS BETWEEN TWO WEATHER SYSTEMS.  ONE IS A SHORT
WAVE OFF THE SRN OR COAST...HEADING NEWD.  THIS MAY BE ENHANCING THE
CURRENT ONSHORE FLOW SLIGHTLY...WITH NO OTHER EFFECTS ON OUR AREA. 
THE SECOND FEATURE IS AN EASTERLY WAVE TO OUR SE.  ITS HARD TO FIND
THE ASSOCIATED VORT CENTER ON THE WATER VAPOR PIX...BUT BELIEVE IT IS
SOMEWHERE AROUND YUMA AZ.  CLOUDS FROM THIS FEATURE ARE CURRENTLY
MOVING WWD THRU SRN CA BUT IF THE MODELS ARE CORRECT...EXPECT A MORE
SELY FLOW TO DEVELOP ALOFT OVER OUR FORECAST AREA AND SOME HIGH
CLOUDS SHOULD FILTER INTO OUR REGION BEGINNING THIS AFTN.  CURRENTLY
WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT WEATHER RELATED TO THE ELY WAVE IN OUR
ZONES BUT WILL HAVE TO WATCH EVENTS CAREFULLY TODAY...WE MAY NEED TO 
AT LEAST INCREASE CLOUDS OVER INLAND AREAS S OF SAN JOSE IN THE AFTN
ZONES AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE DIABLO RANGE THIS WEEKEND
ARE NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION GIVEN THE FORECAST OF CONTINUING SELY
FLOW ALOFT.  

AS FOR THE STRATUS...THE GRADIENT FROM ACV TO SFO IS ALMOST FLAT...
WITH ONLY ABOUT 1 MB SFO-SBA.  THIS PATTERN WHERE THE ISOBARS ARE
BASICALLY PARALLEL TO THE COAST IS AN IDEAL ONSHORE PATTERN...WHICH
MEANS EXTENSIVE CRUD WILL CONTINUE ALONG THE COAST.  THE RELATIVELY
SHALLOW MARINE LAYER...AROUND 1200 FEET...WILL LIMIT INLAND
PENETRATION OF THE CLOUDS TO SOME DEGREE TNGT...WITH NO CRUD AS FAR
INLAND AS LIVERMORE.  THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE IN THIS PATTERN FORECAST
THRU THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH MEANS THAT THE MONSOON MOISTURE
SHOULD SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE SIERRA BY SUN...GIVING A CHANCE OF
THUNDERSTORMS TO THE ENTIRE RANGE.  TEMPS WILL REMAIN HOT INLAND...A
LITTLE ABOVE NORMAL...BUT SEASONABLY COOL NEAR THE OCEAN.

HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES OVER THE WEST WHICH IS ALLOWING MONSOONAL
MOISTURE TO MOVE INTO THE SOUTHWESTERN US AND SOUTHERN CA. THIS
PRODUCED SOME THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE DESERTS AND FLASH FLOODING IN
LAS VEGAS ON THURSDAY. AT THIS TIME DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE MOISTURE
WILL MOVE WESTWARD ENOUGH TO AFFECT THE CENTRAL CA COAST EXCEPT MAYBE
SOME HIGH CLOUDS ON SATURDAY. SO MAIN STORY FOR CA IS THE SAME OLD
THING...COASTAL LOW CLOUDS AND FOG AND HOT INLAND. MARINE LAYER ABOUT
1200-1500 FEET DEEP THIS MORNING. THIS IS ALLOWING THE LOW CLOUDS TO
SPREAD INLAND FROM THE COAST INTO MOST AREAS. SOME AREAS HAVE FOG BUT
NO REPORTS OF DENSE FOG YET. SOME MAY STILL FORM IN THE NEXT FEW
HOURS BEFORE SUNRISE SO WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR. THE HIGH PRESSURE
SYSTEM WILL REMAIN STRONG OVER THE WEST. 500MB HEIGHTS/1000-500MB
THICKNESSES STAY ABOUT THE SAME AND SURFACE FLOW REMAINS WEAKLY
ONSHORE. SO DO NOT EXPECT MUCH CHANGE IN DAYTIME TEMPERATURES FOR
CONTINUED HOT INLAND AND MUCH COOLER AT THE COAST. THERE WILL BE
LITTLE CHANGE IN THIS PATTERN THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND INTO NEXT WEEK.

STRONG RIDGE OF HIGH PRES ALOFT OVER THE WESTERN U.S. WILL CONTINUE
THE BE THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. IN THE
SHORT TERM...INCREASING ONSHORE FLOW THIS EVENING WILL ALLOW STRATUS
TO FILL IN ALONG THE COAST IN AREAS WHERE IT CLEARED LATE THIS
AFTERNOON...SUCH AS THE N SFO BAY COUNTIES. FT ORD PROFILER SHOWS A
WEAK INVERSION AROUND 1500 FEET. WOULD NOT EXPECT MARINE LAYER TO
DEEPEN ANY OVERNIGHT...AND MAY IN FACT BECOME MORE SHALLOW. THUS...
INLAND EXTENT OF MARINE LAYER CLOUDS/FOG WILL BE SOMEWHAT LIMITED.
SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN ON FRI LOOKS VERY SIMILAR TO TODAY WITH A
WEAK ONSHORE FLOW CONTINUING. HOWEVER...LATEST ETA INITIALIZED WITH
HIGHER 500 MB HEIGHTS JUST OFF THE CNTRL CA COAST THAN THE 12Z ETA
HAD FORECAST. WITH HIGHER INITIAL 500 MB HEIGHTS THAN ANTICIPATED AND
WITH SLOWLY INCREASING THICKNESSES AND 850 MB TEMPS FORECAST BY THE
LATEST ETA...BELIEVE TEMPS MAY ACTUALLY INCREASE A BIT ON
FRIDAY...MAINLY INLAND. COASTAL TEMPS WILL REMAIN FLAT DUE TO
CONTINUED WEAK ONSHORE GRADIENT. WILL UPDATE ZONES TO ADD A FEW
DEGREES TO FRIDAYS HIGHS. BY SATURDAY...SURFACE PRESSURE WILL
INCREASE TO THE N AND A STRONGER N-S GRADIENT SHOULD BRING CLEARING
TO MOST OF THE COAST N OF MONTEREY BAY BY AFTERNOON. AIRMASS NOT
FORECAST TO CHANGE MUCH ON SATURDAY...BUT PLACES THAT WARM IN AN
INCREASED NLY FLOW...SUCH AS SANTA ROSA/SANTA CRUZ...WILL LIKELY SEE
WARMER HIGHS THAT DAY.

UPPER RIDGE FORECAST TO STRENGTHEN FURTHER THRU THE EXTENDED PERIOD.
THIS WILL KEEP TEMPS INCHING UP INLAND AND A SHALLOW MARINE LAYER
CONFINED TO THE IMMEDIATE COAST. MRF FORECASTS SELY FLOW ALOFT OVER

MARINE ST LAYER NOW COVERS THE CENTRAL CA COASTAL WATERS EXCEPT FOR A
SMALL STRIP OFF SRN MRY COUNTY. THIS HAS OCCURRED AS SURFACE PRESSURE
GRADIENTS HAVE GONE SLACK...COMPARED TO THE STRONG NLY GRADIENT OF
YESTERDAY. THE SFO-SBA GRADIENT HAS ACTUALLY SWITCHED TO ABOUT 1 MB
SLY. THIS SLY GRADIENT WILL ALLOW ENTIRE COAST TO BE CLOUD COVERED BY
THIS EVENING. THE LAYER IS STILL SHALLOW...1200-1500 FOOT TOPS FROM
FT ORD PROFILER BUT IS EXPECTED TO DEEPEN SLIGHTLY OVERNIGHT AS THE
MARINE INVERSION LIFTS. MODELS TREND SURFACE PRESSURE TO REMAIN
FAIRLY WEAK...BUT DO SHOW A LITTLE MORE ONSHORE FLOW FRI COMPARED TO
THE 1 MB SFO-SAC SEEN AT THIS TIME. THEREFORE...EXPECT A LITTLE
COOLING OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA ON FRI. NOT MUCH FURTHER
CHANGE FOR SUN...HIGH 500 MB HEIGHTS REMAIN OVER NRN CA WITH SURFACE
PRESSURE GRADIENTS REMAINING NEUTRAL TO WEAK ONSHORE. THUS...
CONTINUED LOW CLOUDS AND COOL AT THE COAST AND NEAR NORMAL - SUNNY...
WARM - DAYTIME CONDITIONS WELL INLAND. ONE OTHER FACTOR TO CONSIDER
IS HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE FROM THE SW MONSOON...NOW WELL ESTABLISHED AZ
AND SE CA. NEW MODELS HINT AT SOME HIGH...CI LEVEL MOISTURE MOVING
INTO THE CENTRAL COAST FROM THE SW. FOR NOW WILL JUST INDICATE MOSTLY
SUNNY RATHER THAN SUNNY ON SAT TO HINT AT SOME CI MOVING IN...MOSTLY
SRN PORTION OF DISTRICT.

THIS BASIC PATTERN IS TRENDED IN MEDIUM RANGE MODELS TO CONTINUE
THROUGH THE MID PORTION OF NEXT WEEK. UPPER LEVEL HIGH IS FORECAST TO
REMAIN OVER THE SW OR SRN GREAT BASIN DURING THIS TIME. THIS WILL
ALLOW MONSOONAL MOISTURE TO CONTINUE FEEDING INTO THE SIERRA WITH
CONTINUING AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS. OTHER THAN SOME VARIABLE HIGH
CLOUDS...THE CENTRAL COASTAL AREAS SHOULD REMAIN WARM AND CLEAR
INLAND WITH NEUTRAL TO WEAK ONSHORE PRESSURE GRADIENTS AND A SHALLOW
LAYER OF ST PERSISTING AT THE COAST.

YESTERDAY...NOW ABOUT 3.5 MB. THE NLY GRADIENT ALONG THE S PORTION OF

WITH THE GRADIENT SLACKENING OFF...THE MARINE LOW ST LAYER HAS
MAGICALLY REAPPEARED ALONG THE COAST. THIS RAPID REFORMATION OF THE

UPDATED AT 7.30 AM TO REFLECT THIS. 12Z OAK SOUNDING WAS MISSING DATA
AT LOWER LEVELS THIS MORNING SO NO MARINE INVERSION THICKNESS COULD
BE DETERMINED WHILE FT ORD PROFILER SHOWS LAYER VERY SHALLOW...BUT
INCREASING. THIS WILL KEEP THE COAST COOL BUT WITH LAYER VERY SHALLOW
AND VERY WEAK ONSHORE GRADIENTS...EXPECT INLAND TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB
A COUPLE OF DEGREES COMPARED TO YESTERDAY. NEW ETA/NGM DO NOT SHOW AS
STRONG A THERMAL TROF DEVELOPING NEAR THE COAST AS YESTERDAY/S
VERSIONS DID...APPEARS THAT AFTER A SLIGHT WARMING TREND INLAND

A FEW DEGREES COOLING INLAND. THIS COOLING TREND IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE INTO SAT...THEN EXTENDED MODELS TREND WARMING AGAIN AS AN

VERY STRONG NORTHERLY FLOW DEVELOPED OVER NORTHERN CA ON WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON. THE PRESSURE GRADIENT AT ITS PEAK WAS 8.7MB FROM ACV-SFO.
THIS STRONG NORTH-SOUTH GRADIENT SWEPT ALL THE STRATUS FROM THE
COAST DURING THE DAY. THUS...ALL STATIONS ARE REPORTING CLEAR SKIES
AT THIS TIME. THE GRADIENT HAS WEAKENED OVERNIGHT WHICH MAY ALLOW A
FEW PATCHES OF FOG TO DEVELOP BY SUNRISE. BUT THE HIGH PRESSURE THAT
LIES OVER THE WEST WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.
SO THE WARM...DRY AIR ALOFT WILL KEEP THE MARINE LAYER SHALLOW SO
ANYTHING THAT FORMS SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF FOG AND BURN OFF FAIRLY
QUICKLY. WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WEST AND MONSOONAL MOISTURE
MOVING INTO THE SOUTHWEST...A FEW THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPED OVER

MORNING BEFORE A WEAK ONSHORE FLOW RETURNS IN THE AFTERNOON. WEAKLY
OFFSHORE GRADIENT FOR MUCH OF THUR...COMBINED WITH A WARMING AIRMASS

RESPONSE TO A SURFACE HIGH BUILDING INTO THE PACIFIC NW TODAY.
THIS...IN TURN...IS CREATING A STRONG NLY SURFACE GRADIENT OVER NRN

3.5 MB SFO-SBA. COASTAL BUOYS REFLECT THIS STRONG GRADIENT WITH NW
WINDS GUSTING OVER 30 KTS THIS AFTERNOON...HELPING TO MIX OUT MARINE
LAYER. MODELS ALL TREND NLY GRADIENT TO SLACKEN BY THU...WITH A
THERMAL TROF TO DEVELOP NEAR THE COAST. SURFACE FLOW AT THAT TIME
BECOMES FLAT TO WEAK OFFSHORE WHILE 500 MB HEIGHTS CONTINUE TO
INCREASE. THUS...MINIMAL LOW CLOUDS ALONG THE COAST TONIGHT WITH
LIKELY NO INLAND EXTEND...EXCEPT POSSIBLY MRY BAY INTO NRN END SNS
VALLEY. AND...DAYTIME TEMPERATURES UP 5 TO 10 DEGREES INLAND TODAY
WILL RISE ANOTHER 5 DEGREES OR SO TOMORROW. BY FRI...AVN AND EARLIER
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS TREND A WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROF TO APPROACH THE
PACIFIC NW. NO WEATHER ASSOCIATED WITH TROF IN OUR AREA BUT A SLIGHT
INCREASE IN MARINE INFLUENCES...NIGHT AND MORNING LOW CLOUDS AT THE

TO WARM-HOT WEATHER FOR THE COASTAL FORECAST AREA INTO EARLY NEXT
WEEK. 500 MB HEIGHTS ARE FORECAST IN THE LOW-MID 590 DM RANGE WITH
THERMAL SURFACE TROFFING NEAR THE COAST. THIS SHOULD BRING LOTS OF
90S TO THE WARMER LOCATIONS SUN THROUGH THE MID PORTION OF THE WEEK.
IN ADDITION...SW MONSOONAL MOISTURE-AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS-ALREADY

THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM CONTINUES OVER THE WEST BUT A WEAK SHORT

MARINE LAYER CONTINUES ABOUT 1500 FEET DEEP.  THE ACV-SFO AND SFO-SAC
GRADIENTS WERE IDENTICAL AT 03Z...4.7 MB.  THE ONSHORE PUSH AT THE
SURFACE IS BEING SUPPORTED BY A BRISK WSW FLOW ALOFT.  THIS MEANS
MARINE AIR WILL CONTINUE POURING INLAND TNGT AND STRATUS WILL BE
FAIRLY WIDESPREAD.  THE STRONG ONSHORE PUSH IS BEING DRIVEN BY AN
INCOMING SHORT WAVE WITH THE ASSOCIATED VORTICITY CENTER CURRENTLY
NEAR 40/130.  MOST ENERGY FROM THIS SYSTEM WILL MISS CA TO THE N BUT
ITS STILL ENHANCING THE ONSHORE FLOW TNGT.  BY WED AFTN IT WILL BE A
DIFFERENT STORY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE PACNW BEHIND
THE SHORT WAVE AND THE N-S GRADIENT IN CA INCREASES RAPIDLY...NEW ETA
FORECASTS ACV-SFO AT 8 MB BY 00Z THU.  ALL COLD AIR WITH THE SHORT
WAVE WILL REMAIN N OF OUR FORECAST AREA AND 1000-500 MB THICKNESSES

THE SCENARIO EXPECTED TO OCCUR INVOLVES LOTS OF LOW CLOUDS TNGT... 
POSSIBLY MOVING AS FAR INLAND AS LIVERMORE.  HOWEVER...WITH THE WINDS
VEERING TO MORE NORTHERLY ON WED THE STRATUS WILL BE SWEPT COMPLETELY
OUT OF OUR REGION BY EARLY AFTN AND TEMPS WILL RISE RAPIDLY.  THE

MAY RISE EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT.  WITH A 500 MB RIDGE BUILDING OVER

A MARINE INVERSION IS DEVELOPING RAPIDLY AS INDICATED ON THE FORT

LOW CLOUDS HAVE FORMED YET...AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS LACKING.  THIS
WAS EVIDENT ON THE OAK RAOB...AND LOOKING ACROSS MRY BAY FROM OUR
OFFICE ROOF JUST BEFORE DARK I COULD SEE THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS 
ROUGHLY 35 MILES AWAY.  THIS GOOD VISIBILITY IS ANOTHER INDICATOR OF
SPARSE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE.  ON TOP OF THIS...THE 03Z ACV-SFO GRADIENT
WAS 5.5 MB...WITH A MILD 2.2 FROM SFO INLAND TO SAC.  SO ALTHOUGH
SOME STRATUS WILL PROBABLY DEVELOP ALONG THE COAST OVERNIGHT...DONT
EXPECT IT TO REACH SFO OR MOVE VERY FAR INLAND EXCEPT POSSIBLY IN
THE SALINAS VALLEY.

THE NEW ETA RECONFIRMS THE EARLIER MODELS IN FORECASTING A GOOD
INCREASE IN 500 MB HEIGHTS...1000-500 MB THICKNESS...AND 850 MB TEMPS
OVER OUR FORECAST AREA ON MON AS THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN.  THE
SURFACE PATTERN IS FORECAST TO REMAIN SIMILAR TO TODAYS.  THE PLAN
REMAINS TO WARM INLAND MAXES ABOUT 5 DEGREES FROM TODAYS VALUES...AND
SINCE TODAYS MAXES ROSE HIGHER THAN THE EARLY AFTERNOON PROJECTIONS 
...HAD TO UPDATE MOST ZONES TO WARM UP THE MAXES FOR MON.  WE SHOULD
SEE A LITTLE MORE WARMING ON TUE WITH FURTHER SLIGHT INCREASES IN
HEIGHTS/THICKNESSES...EXCEPT ON THE COAST.  EXPECT A MUCH MORE
EXTENSIVE STRATUS DECK TO FORM BY MON NGT AS THE INVERSION WILL BE
SHALLOW BUT WELL DEFINED BY THEN...SO COASTAL TEMPS PROBABLY WONT
WARM MUCH ON TUE.

ALL MEDIUM RANGE MODELS BRING A SHORT WAVE THRU THE PACIFIC NW ON
WED.  MRF IS WEAKEST WITH THIS FEATURE.  THE SHORT WAVE POSES NO RAIN
THREAT TO CA BUT WILL PUT A TEMPORARY HOLD ON HE WARMING TREND...
WHICH SHOULD RESUME THU/FRI WHEN HEIGHTS INCREASE AGAIN WITH A STRONG

MUCH MORE THAT PATCHY COASTAL LOW CLOUDS FROM DEVELOPING. ANY LOW
CLOUDS THAT DO FORM SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL AFTER THE FIREWORKS

HEIGHTS/THICKNESSES RISE QUICKLY THROUGH 24 HOURS AND INLAND AREAS

MODERATE SEABREEZE SHOULD KEEP MAXES FROM RISING MUCH. THE UPPER

FLOW SHOULD STRENGTHEN NEAR THE COAST MON NGT AND TUE AND ALLOW FOR

UPPER TROF OVER PAC NW LIFTS TO THE NE ON SUNDAY AND

WARMING ALOFT TOMORROW WITH A GOOD LOW LEVEL INVERSION FORMING BY
LATE TOMORROW NIGHT WHICH WILL SET UP A GOOD ENVIRONMENT OF LOW CLOUD

HAS STABILIZED THIS EVENING WITH A BASE AROUND 1000 FEET AND THE TOP
NEAR 2500.  STRATUS CONTINUED MOVING RAPIDLY DOWN THE CNTRL CA
COAST...OUT OF MONTEREY COUNTY BY 03Z.  

THE STRONG ACV-SFO GRADIENT DICTATES THAT THE STRATUS WILL NOT MOVE
INTO SFO TNGT...THE RULE OF THUMB IS THAT IT DOESNT REACH THE AIRPORT
OVERNIGHT IF THE ACV-SFO N-S GRADIENT IS GREATER THAN 5 MB DURING THE
EVENING.  THE CRUD SHOULD REFORM ALONG THE COAST S OF SFO OVERNIGHT
AND MOVE UP THE SALINAS VALLEY DUE TO THE STRONG ONSHORE PUSH AND
PLENTIFUL LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IN THOSE AREAS...BUT WOULDNT BE
SURPRISED TO SEE THE N BAY COAST REMAIN CLEAR ALL NIGHT WHILE THE NW

COVERAGE AND REMOVE THE DRIZZLE...ESPECIALLY N OF MRY BAY.  DESPITE
THE PROJECTED SPARSE STRATUS COVERAGE...MAX TEMPS WILL CONITNUE GOING
DOWN FRI DUE TO THE STRONG MARINE PUSH AND COLD ADVECTION ALOFT.

BY SAT THE COLD ADVECTION WILL REALLY BE GOING STRONG AS AN
UNSEASONABLY VIGOROUS UPPER LEVEL TROF DIGS INTO THE PACIFIC NW. 
WITH THE MODELS FORECASTING A WEAKENING N-S GRADIENT FRI NIGHT...
EXPECT MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE STRATUS COVERAGE WITH THE CRUD POSSIBLY
MOVING AS FAR INLAND AS LIVERMORE BY SAT MRNG.  HOWEVER...WITH THE
MODELS FORECASTING ABOUT 15 DEGREES C COOLING AT 850 MB FROM THU AFTN
TO SAT AFTN...THERE WILL PROBABLY BE SUFFICIENT COLD ADVECTION TO
MIX OUT VIRTUALLY ALL THE LOW CLOUDS OVER OUR FORECAST AREA BY SAT PM
...LEAVING US WITH A COOL...WINDY BUT SUNNY AFTN.

AND WILL RESULT IN AN EVEN DEEPER MARINE LAYER TONIGHT AND FRI. CLOUD
TOPS WILL LIKELY BE NEAR 2000FT FRI AM...WITH LOCAL DRIZZLE (BUT
LITTLE FOG) ALONG MUCH OF THE COAST. THE SONOMA/MARINE COUNTY COAST
SHOULD BE THE LAST TO SEE THE INCREASING LOW CLOUDS IN THE AM. TEMPS
WILL BE COOLER INLAND ON FRI AS THE MARINE LAYER INFLUENCES A LARGER

SATELLITE FOG PRODUCT SHOWS A LARGE INCREASE IN MARINE LOW CLOUDS
ALONG THE COAST EXTENDING WELL OFFSHORE. THESE LOW CLOUDS ARE NOT FAR
INLAND YET...SEEN IN THE NRN SNS VALLEY AND COASTAL SECTIONS OF SF
AND SAN MATEO COUNTIES. LAYER IS ESTIMATED 1200-1500 FEET DEEP BASED
ON FT ORD PROFILER...JUST SLIGHTLY DEEPER THAN LAST NIGHT. THIS WILL
COOL COASTAL SECTIONS CONSIDERABLY BUT ONLY A FEW DEGREES AREAS WELL
INLAND. PROBABLY NO 100/S TODAY IN THE CENTRAL COASTAL FORECAST
AREA...BUT STILL MID TO UPPER 90S IN SEVERAL OF THE WARMER E SF BAY
AREAS. THIS IS OCCURRING AS FORECAST MODELS TREND 500 MB HEIGHTS TO
GRADUALLY LOWER...ALLOWING MARINE INVERSION TO DEEPEN...AND WITH THE
SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT TO GRADUALLY INCREASE ONSHORE. THIS TREND
IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE PERIOD AND EXPECT MORE DRAMATIC
COOLING INLAND FRI THAN TODAY. 

MOVING INTO THE 4TH OF JUL WEEKEND PERIOD...COOLING IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE WELL INTO THE WEEKEND. 500 MB HEIGHTS DROP FROM 595 DM AT
00Z WED AFTERNOON TO A FORECAST 576 DM SAT AFTERNOON. THIS
SIGNIFICANT LOWERING OF HEIGHTS IS THE RESULT OF A FAIRLY STRONG...
FOR JUL... UPPER LEVEL TROF...CURRENTLY SEEN FROM SATELLITE WATER
VAPOR IMAGERY NEAR 130W IN THE ERN GULF OF ALASKA DIGGING SWD ALONG
THE PACIFIC NW COAST INTO NW CA. MRF AND AVN SUGGEST THAT SAT WILL BE
A COOL-BREEZY DAY OVER ALMOST ALL OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH A
CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVER THE NRN MOUNTAINS OF CA. THIS TREND WILL
CONTINUE ON SUN ACCORDING TO MRF AND OTHER MEDIUM RANGE MODELS. BY
MON MRF INDICATES TROF BAGGING OFFSHORE WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN 500

900 PM PDT WED JUN 30 1999

THE BIG FORECAST PROBLEM OF THE NEXT TWO DAYS WILL BE THE SPEED AND
INTENSITY OF THE COOLING TREND IN OUR FORECAST AREA.  THE MODELS
INDICATE THAT BY FRI AFTN TEMPS WILL BE DOWN TO AROUND NORMAL
THROUGHOUT OUR REGION...BUT HOW FAST THEY GET THERE IS BY NO MEANS
CERTAIN.  THIS EVENINGS 03Z (8PM PDT) TEMPS DO NOT SIGNAL AN IMMINENT
MARINE INTRUSION.  FOR STARTERS...THE CURRENT 7.8 MB N-S PRESSURE
GRADIENT FROM ACV TO SFO PRECLUDES STRATUS MOVING INTO SFO BAY
TONIGHT.  THE READINGS OVER 16 CITIES IN AND NEAR OUR FORECAST AREA
ARE MOSTLY RUNNING FROM 1 DEGREE F BELOW TO 3 ABOVE THE NUMBERS 
24 HOURS EARLIER...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SANTA ROSA WHICH IS 9
DEGREES WARMER TONIGHT.  THE OAKLAND EVENING SOUNDING IS SIMILAR TO
YESTERDAYS...AS IS THE FORT ORD PROFILER ALTHOUGH THAT IS SHOWING
HINTS OF THE MARINE LAYER BEGINNING TO DEEPEN.  THE OFFSHORE STRATUS
FIELD IS MORE EXTENSIVE CLOSER TO THE COAST THAN LAST NIGHT BUT THE
CLOUDS ARE MOVING MORE PARALLEL TO THE COAST THAN TOWARD SHORE. 
THESE PARAMETERS ALL INDICATE THAT A STRONG MARINE PUSH IS NOT LIKELY
TNGT.  THE MODELS LOWER 500 MB HEIGHTS AND 500-1000 MB THICKNESS
VALUES 40-50 DM ON THU...AND FORECAST A SOMEWHAT STRONGER ONSHORE
GRADIENT BY THAT AFTN ALTHOUGH THE ETA STILL FORECASTS A 5 MB N-S
GRADIENT ACV-SFO AT 00Z FRI...WHICH WOULD MAKE THE PROSPECTS OF
STRATUS INTRUSION INTO SFO BAY IFFY ON THU NIGHT.

THE BEST CONCLUSION AT THIS TIME APPEARS TO BE THAT IT WILL BE
ANOTHER MILD NIGHT TONIGHT WITH FOG/STRATUS LIMITED TO THE IMMEDIATE
COAST...AND TOASTY WARM OVERNIGHT TEMPS AGAIN IN THE HILLS DUE TO THE
SHALLOW MARINE LAYER.  HOWEVER...ON THU THE SEABREEZE WILL BE
STRONGER AND BEGIN SEVERAL HOURS EARLIER ALONG THE COAST...KNOCKING
MAX TEMPS DOWN 10 DEGREES OR MORE AT MANY SPOTS NEAR THE OCEAN. 
THERE WILL BE LESS COOLING THE FARTHER INLAND YOU GO...AND SPOTS IN
THE DELTA WILL PROBABLY REACH THE CENTURY MARK AGAIN.  THEN...THE
STRONG MARINE PUSH WILL OCCUR THU NIGHT...BOLSTERED BY LOWERING
HEIGHTS/THICKNESS AND A STRENGTHENING WLY FLOW ALOFT AND AT THE
SURFACE.  BY FRI MAXES SHOULD BE DOWN TO NORMAL EVERYWHERE...MEANING
10-15 DEGREES COOLING FROM SFO BAY INLAND.  THATS THE SCENARIO WE
WILL USE FOR THE EVENING UPDATE...MOSTLY RAISING MAX TEMPS ON THU AND
LOWERING THEM ON FRI FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.  IN THE COASTAL
VALLEYS THE BIG COOLING USUALLY OCCURS ALL IN ONE DAY...NOT SPREAD
OVER TWO...AND WILL NOW TAB FRI AS THE MAIN COOLDOWN DAY.

IN THE EXTENDED OUTLOOK THE MODELS ARE IN FAIR AGREEMENT ALTHOUGH THE
MRF GENERALLY HAS 500 MB HEIGHTS 20-40 M HIGHER THRU THE WEEKEND THAN
THE OTHERS.  TEMPS SHOULD COOL A LITTLE MORE ON SAT...TO SLIGHTLY
BELOW NORMAL...THEN STAY THERE ON SUN WITH SLIGHT WARMING ON MON. 
THERE WILL PROBABLY BE EXTENSIVE COASTAL CRUD THRU THE WEEKEND BUT IF
THE 500 MB TROF TURNS OUT TO BE A LITTLE STRONGER THAN FORECAST IT
COULD MIX OUT THE MARINE LAYER AND GIVE US MOSTLY CLEAR...COOL...

AS IS USUALLY THE CASE DURING WARM SPELLS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY
AREA/CENTRAL COAST...MOST DIFFICULT FORECAST PROBLEM IS DETERMINING
THE TIMING AND STRENGTH OF INEVITABLE COOLING. UPPER RIDGE IS STILL
FIRMLY IN CONTROL OF OUR WEATHER AND SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN HAS
CHANGED VERY LITTLE DURING THE PAST FEW DAYS. HOWEVER...SOME MINOR
CHANGES WILL OCCUR TODAY...WITH MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ON THURSDAY
AND INTO THE WEEKEND. CURRENTLY...MARINE INVERSION IS HOLDING STEADY
AROUND 1000 FEET. WHILE THE INVERSION HEIGHT IS A FEW HUNDRED FEET
HIGHER THAN 24 HOURS AGO...THE AIR ABOVE THE INVERSION IS WARMER.
THIS CAN CLEARLY BE SEEN BY LOOKING AT AUTOMATED TEMP GAGES IN THE
HILLS. SPRING VALLEY...AT 1075 FEET IN THE HILLS OF SAN MATEO
COUNTY...IS 14 DEGREES COOLER THAN 24 HOURS AGO. MEANWHILE...AT LAS
TRAMPAS...AT 1760 FEET IN THE EAST BAY HILLS...THE TEMP IS CURRENTLY
RUNNING 7 DEGREES WARMER. THE DEEPER MARINE LAYER COMBINED WITH A
SLIGHTLY STRONGER ANTICIPATED SEABREEZE TODAY MEANS TEMPS SHOULD COOL
NEAR THE COAST...BUT REMAIN HOT INLAND. 

LOW CLOUDS AND FOG ARE CURRENTLY CONFINED TO AREAS FROM THE MONTEREY
BAY SWD. THE LARGE AREA OF STRATUS OFFSHORE SHOULD STAY OFFSHORE
THROUGH AT LEAST TODAY. CURRENTLY...STRATUS HAS MOVED TO OR DEVELOPED
ALONG THE COAST ONLY IN AREAS WHERE THE MODEL 850 MB WINDS SHOW AN
ONSHORE COMPONENT. FOLLOWING THE ETA AND AVN 850 MB WIND
FORECASTS...WOULD EXPECT STRATUS FIELD TO REMAIN PRETTY MUCH WHERE IT
IS THROUGH TODAY WITH SOME INCREASE TONIGHT. HOWEVER...A
STRENGTHENING N-S GRADIENT ALONG THE N COAST THRU THURS SHOULD LIMIT
ANY INLAND MOVEMENT OF MARINE CLOUDS...ESPECIALLY N BAY. BY THURS
AFTERNOON...850 WINDS TURN ONSHORE EVERYWHERE AND 500 MB HEIGHTS
BEGIN TO DROP. THIS WILL ALLOW COOL MARINE AIR TO PUSH INTO THE
COASTAL VALLEYS AND BRING COOLING REGION-WIDE.

MEDIUM RANGE MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN DEVELOPING A
MODERATELY-STRONG 500 MB TROF OVER NRN CA DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD.
TEMPS WILL DROP TO NORMAL...OR SLIGHTLY BELOW...OVER THE ENTIRE AREA

TEMPS TO FOLLOW SUIT. CHANGES IN LOW LEVEL WIND FLOW PATTERN AND
ASSOCIATED FOG MOVEMENT WILL BE PRIMARY DETERMINING FACTOR FOR
CHANGES IN TEMPS CLOSE TO THE OCEAN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. SURFACE
PRESSURE PATTERN LOOKS VERY SIMILAR TODAY COMPARED TO YESTERDAY SO
SEE LITTLE CHANGE NEAR THE COAST. HOWEVER...ON WEDNESDAY...THE N-S
GRADIENT IS DUE TO INCREASE WHICH WILL LIKELY LEAD TO COOLING IN
PLACES WITH NORTHERN EXPOSURE TO THE COAST...SUCH AS MONTEREY.
ALSO...AVN INCREASES ONSHORE GRADIENT ON WED AND THIS WOULD MEAN
UNIVERSAL COOLING ALONG THE IMMEDIATE COAST. BUT WITH INVERSION
CONTINUING VERY LOW...COOLING EFFECTS WONT REACH VERY FAR INLAND.

MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ALL DROP A TROF SOUTH INTO NRN CA FRI AND SAT.
MRF AND EURO ARE STRONGER WITH THIS TROF THAN UKMET OR NOGAPS. TEND
TO BELIEVE THE WEAKER SOLUTIONS AS IT APPEARS UNLIKELY THAT THE RIDGE
WILL YIELD AS EASILY AS THE MRF/EURO INDICATE. IN ANY EVENT...A
COOLING TREND WILL TAKE PLACE THRU THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

STRONG HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WEST LED TO SUNNY AND WARM CONDITIONS
THROUGHOUT CA TODAY. MOST AREAS HAD 5-10 DEGREES OF WARMING BUT NO
RECORDS WERE BROKEN IN THE SFO BAY AREA OR THE CENTRAL COAST REGION.
A SOUTHERLY SURGE DEVELOPED THIS MORNING WHICH BROUGHT COOL MARINE
AIR NORTHWARD UP THE COAST. THIS MARINE LAYER IS ONLY ABOUT A FEW
HUNDRED FEET THICK AND HAS MOVED AS FAR NORTH AS HALF MOON BAY THIS
EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BUILD SO DO NOT EXPECT THIS
SHALLOW MARINE LAYER TO DEEPEN MUCH WHICH WILL LIMIT THE INLAND
EXTENT TONIGHT. THIS MARINE LAYER WILL COOL THE COAST A FEW DEGREES
ON TUESDAY BUT WILL NOT HAVE MUCH INFLUENCE INLAND. SO WITH
INCREASING 1000-500 MB THICKNESSES EXPECT ANOTHER COUPLE DEGREES OF
WARMING INLAND TUESDAY. THIS STRONG HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER

BASED ON PROFILER AND MODEL DATA...BELIEVE TEMPS INLAND WILL WARM A
COUPLE OF DEGREES TODAY AND AGAIN ON TUE. TEMPS NEAR THE COAST WILL

CONCERN IS SUBTLE CHANGES IN LOW LEVEL WIND FIELD AND ITS IMPACT ON

REMAINS QUITE STRONG AND CONTINUES TO HINDER FOG FORMATION NORTH OF
MONTEREY BAY. FURTHER SOUTH...A NEARLY FLAT GRADIENT HAS ALLOWED A
SOLID LAYER OF FOG TO FORM ALONG THE COAST S OF PT PINOS. GRADIENT

LIKELIHOOD OF FURTHER NWD PROGRESSION OF COASTAL FOG TONIGHT IS
LIKELY...ALTHOUGH FOG PROBABLY WONT GET ANY FURTHER N THAN PT REYES.
SHALLOW INVERSION WILL PREVENT FOG FROM MOVING MUCH MORE THAN A FEW

1800 FEET DEEP. ONSHORE FLOW NOW TRANSITIONING FROM SOUTHWESTERLY TO
NORTHWESTERLY AS INDICATED BY BOTH BUOY AND LAND BASED WIND DATA.
MODELS IN AGREEMENT FOR THE SHORT TERM WITH A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
RIDGE NOSING INTO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND
WIND FLOW BECOMING MORE NORTHERLY...MAINLY FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY
AREA NORTHWARD. FOR THE BAY AREA SOUTHWARD...MODELS KEEP GOOD
NORTHWESTERLY ONSHORE FLOW THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THEREFORE EXPECT TO
CONTINUE THE NIGHTTIME/MORNING STRATUS SITUATION MOST AREAS. ACTUALLY
SHOULD SEE SLIGHT HEIGHT FALLS THE NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS BUT NOT ENOUGH
FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO TEMPERATURES...ALTHOUGH WITH THE FLOW
BECOMING MORE NORTHERLY WOULD EXPECT THE STRATUS TO CLEAR A LITTLE
SOONER FRIDAY AND SATURDAY..PARTICULARLY NORTH BAY AREAS AND LIKELY
SEE A SLIGHT WARMING TREND INLAND LOCATIONS. LITTLE CHANGE IN
TEMPERATURES AT THE COAST.  ALSO...A TIGHTER GRADIENT SETS UP FRIDAY
AND SATURDAY VERSUS TODAY SO EXPECT WINDS TO PICK UP AS WELL...
STRONGEST AT OR NEAR THE COAST.  WOULD STILL EXPECT THE FLOW TO BE
BRISK OUT TO THE DELTA BOTH DAYS.
IN THE EXTENDED THE CANADIAN AND NOGAPS MODELS PAINT A SIMILAR
PICTURE WITH A TROUGH MOVING INTO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND DROPPING
AS FAR SOUTH AS THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. IF TRUE...THIS WOULD KEEP
US IN A ROBUST ONSHORE SITUATION WITH RELATIVELY COOL TEMPERATURES
THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE WEEK. THE MRF ON THE OTHER HAND
SUGGESTS A DECENT HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER THE AREA WHICH WOULD SET
UP A WARMING TREND MOST LOCATIONS.  HOWEVER EXPERIENCE DICTATES NOT
PLAYING TO STRONGLY INTO THE WARMING TREND. A MORE LIKELY SCENARIO IS
A RELATIVELY FLAT RIDGE OR WEAK TROUGH OVER THE AREA WHICH WILL BRING
CONTINUED NIGHTTIME/MORNING STRATUS CONDITIONS WITH NEAR NORMAL
TEMPERATURES...SO WILL LEAN THAT DIRECTION AT THIS TIME.

A MAJOR MARINE INTRUSION IS UNDERWAY AS A STRONG...PREVAILING SWLY
ONSHORE FLOW HAS DEVELOPED AND IS SENDING STRATUS RAPIDLY INLAND THIS
MRNG.  THE FORT ORD PROFILER SHOWS A STEADILY DEEPENING MARINE LAYER
WITH A BASE RISING ABOVE 500 M AND THE TOP ABOVE 1000 M.  THIS ADDS
UP TO STRONG COOLING OVER INLAND PARTS OF OUR FORECAST AREA...EXPECT
MAXES TO DROP 10 DEGREES OR MORE IN SPOTS LIKE CONCORD AND LIVERMORE
AND IT WOULDNT BE SURPRISING TO SEE SOME INLAND LOCATIONS LOSE 15
DEGREES OFF THE MAX TEMPS TODAY.  COASTAL AREAS WILL HAVE A HARD TIME
CLEARING...DONT EXPECT TO SEE MUCH SUN TODAY IN AREAS LIKE THE SUNSET
AND RICHMOND DISTRICTS OF THE CITY OR IN PACIFIC GROVE AND CARMEL.

AS IMPLIED AT THE TOP OF THE DISCUSSION THERE IS STILL MORE OF A SLY
COMPONENT TO THIS MARINE PUSH THAN NORMAL AS INDICATED BY THE SELY
WINDS ON THE SAN MATEO COUNTY COAST.  THE PREVAILING WINDS SHOULD
SHIFT MORE TO WLY TODAY AS THE MODELS FORECAST THE SURFACE PRESSURE
ISOBARS TO BECOME PARALLEL TO THE COAST.  BY FRI...HIGH PRESSURE IS
FORECAST TO BUILD MORE STRONGLY INTO THE PACIFIC NW AND THE PRESSURE 
GRADIENTS OVER OUR FORECAST AREA WILL PICK UP MORE OF A NLY
COMPONENT.  THIS SHOULD BURN THE STRATUS OFF MORE RAPIDLY IN THE N
BAY FRI THAN TDA AND HELP TEMPS TO WARM UP A LITTLE...BUT ELSEWHERE
MAXES WILL STAY ABOUT THE SAME AS TODAY AS THE ONSHORE FLOW AND THE
AIRMASS ALOFT CHANGE LITTLE.  

WE SHOULD SEE SOME WARMUP ON SAT AS THE AIRMASS WARMS OVER OUR
FORECAST AREA AND THE MARINE LAYER STARTS TO BECOME SHALLOWER AGAIN. 
AFTER THAT THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS DIVERGE AS USUAL.  THE MRF
CONTINUES TO BE THE WARMEST...AND IN FACT BUILDS A FLAT RIDGE WITH
HIGH 500 MB HEIGHTS (589 DM AT SFO) OVER OUR REGION BY MON. 
HOWEVER...THE EURO/UK/CANADIAN MODELS ALL RETAIN A WEAK TROF OVER CA
THRU MON WITH 500 MB HEIGHTS 4-6 DM LOWER THAN THE MRF.  BY TUE THE
UK DEEPENS THE TROF MUCH MORE THAN THE OTHER MODELS.  IT MAY BE TOO
DEEP BUT THE MRF IS PROBABLY TOO WARM...GIVEN THE LONG TERM MEAN

OFFSHORE FROM WINNEMUCCA TO SFO.  HOWEVER...THERE WAS STILL 2.2 MB OF
ONSHORE GRADIENT SFO-SAC.  THE FORT ORD PROFILER SHOWED THE MARINE

ADDS UP TO A WARMER DAY INLAND...BUT MARGINAL AT THE COAST AS A TRUE
OFFSHORE FLOW AT THE OCEAN IS NOT LIKELY TO DEVELOP...ESPECIALLY S OF
THE GOLDEN GATE.  THE AIRMASS ALOFT IS ALSO FORECAST TO WARM UP 4-5
DEGREES C AT 850 MB TDA SO THAT SHOULD AID IN THE WARMING INLAND.

SEVERAL PARAMETERS THAT WE WATCH TO SEE THE ONSET OF A STRONG
OFFSHORE PATTERN ARENT PANNING OUT SO FAR THIS MRNG.  AT 09Z WINDS
WERE STILL LIGHT SW AT TRAVIS INSTEAD OF N.  THE SOSF INDICATOR ON

THE SURFACE OB AT SFO.  CALM CONDITIONS PREVAILED AT NAPA WITH LIGHT
S WINDS AT SANTA ROSA...WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE N WINDS AT THOSE SPOTS
BEFORE FORECASTING A REALLY BIG WARMUP.  THE BEST INDICATIONS ARE
THAT THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT WARMING TDA...BUT NOT AS MUCH AS
PREVIOUSLY ADVERTISED.  WILL WARM TEMPS UP 8-12 DEGREES TDA FROM
MONDAYS READINGS...EXCEPT ON THE MONTEREY COUNTY COAST WHERE LESS
WARMING IS ANTICIPATED DUE TO THE LACK OF ANY N-S PRESSURE GRADIENT
IN THE AREA.  THIS MEANS GENERALLY COOLER TUE MAXES THAN PREVIOUSLY
FORECAST.

IN FACT...THERE IS NOW A 2.1 MB S-N GRADIENT FROM SANTA BARBARA TO
SFO.  THIS IS AN INDICATOR OF A SOUTHERLY SURGE WHICH SHOULD MOVE UP
THE COAST TNGT/WED...RETURNING STRATUS AND MARINE AIR N THRU SONOMA

SHOULD SEE MORE WARMING THAT DAY.  BY TUE THE RIDGE REACHES ITS
MAXIMUM STRENGTH ON THE MRF...AND WITH THE OTHER MODELS IN FAIR

HARDER FOR THE EARLY VESTIGES OF MONSOON MOISTURE NOW IN AZ TO REACH

DESTABALIZE THE LOWER LEVELS ENOUGH TO DO JUST THAT. HOWEVER...MODELS
INDICATE RATHER WEAK COLD ADVECTION...AT LEAST IN THE 1000-850

THE AREA WILL BE THE MOST DIFFICULT DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF CLOUDINESS

A DIRTY RIDGE CONTINUES OVER CA BUT THERE IS A FAIRLY DEEP LOW OVER
THE GULF OF ALASKA. A STRONG VORT MAX ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW IS
EVIDENT ON THE WATER VAPOR SATELLITE LOOP. THE HIGH WILL BE STRONG
ENOUGH TO KEEP THE LOW FROM MOVING EASTWARD SO SHOULD NOT AFFECT
CENTRAL CA EXCEPT SOME HIGH CLOUDS WILL MOVE THROUGH THE STATE TODAY.
OTHERWISE...STRATUS HAS CLEARED SOUTHWARD DOWN THE COAST. BUT A LARGE
AREA OF STRATUS DEVELOPED OFFSHORE AND MOVED RAPIDLY EASTWARD TOWARD
THE COAST TO FILL IN BEHIND IT. SO THE MARINE LAYER HAS BECOME WELL
ESTABLISHED AND SHOULD PERSIST ALL DAY ALONG THE COAST. THE RIDGE
WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY SO WITH RISING 500 MB

SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT WAS 3.8 MB...WE LIKE TO HAVE AT LEAST 5 MB

FORECAST INCREASE IN 500 MB HEIGHTS THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  END RESULT
WILL BE A GRADUAL WARMING TREND INLAND...BUT LOTS OF COASTAL CRUD
CONTINUING ESPECIALLY S OF THE GOLDEN GATE.  

IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD THE MODELS MAINTAIN A RIDGE OVER THE
INTERMOUNTAIN REGIN WITH CA ON ITS WESTERN EDGE.  THE UK AND MRF
FORECAST HIGHER 500 MB HEIGHTS THAN THE EURO/NOGAPS...BUT ALL MODELS
KEEP HEIGHTS AT SUFFICIENT LEVELS TO DIVERT ANY PRECIP TO THE N OF CA
EXCEPT POSSIBLY FOR SOME COASTAL DRIZZLE IN THE FAR N SAT PM/SUN AM. 
BY TUE THE MRF SETS UP A SSELY FLOW INTO CA AS THE RIDGE STRENGTHENS

LIKE THE MRF FORECAST WOULD RESULT IN ANY TROPICAL MOISTURE BEING

THE UPPER LEVEL LOW IS NOW CENTERED EAST OF LAS VEGAS AND MOVING
EASTWARD AND A RIDGE IS BUILDING OVER CA. SHOWERS HAVE ENDED OVER THE
BAY AREA AS WRAP AROUND MOISTURE HAS MOVED EAST OF THE AREA.
ATMOSPHERE HAS RAPIDLY STABILIZED WITH WARMING ALOFT THUS ALLOWING
AREAS OF LOW CLOUDS AND FOG TO DEVELOP. MAIN AREAS OF LOW CLOUDS ARE
ALONG THE CENTRAL CA COAST SOUTH OF PT REYES...SOUTHERN SFO BAY AND
MONTEREY BAY. WINDS HAVE PICKED UP OFFSHORE AND WILL INCREASE INLAND

CUTOFF LOW IS DRIFTING SEWD THRU NWRN CA THIS EVE...GENERATING GOOD
CONVECTION OVER MUCH OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY.  AS OF 8 PM THE CLOUD
TOPS WERE WARMING...BUT THE CUTOFF IS COLD ENOUGH AND HAS SUFFICIENT
DYNAMICS TO KEEP SHOWERS...IF NOT THUNDERSTORMS...GOING ALL NIGHT. 
FOR OUR FCST AREA...THE LARGE MASS OF CLOUDS AND SHOWERS IN THE
WESTERN SAC VALLEY AND ADJACENT MTNS APPEARS TO BE STARTING TO SHIFT
TO THE SW.  THIS MOTION CORRESPONDS WITH THE FORECASTED OVERNIGHT
REALIGNMENT OF THE CUTOFF LOW AXIS FROM N-S TO E-W.  THINK OF THE
CUTOFF AS SHAPED LIKE AN EGG...AND FIRST STANDING UP VERTICALLY AND
THEN FLOPPING OVER INTO ITS NATURAL HORIZONTAL POSITION.  THE AXIS
IS THE FOCUS OF STRONG CYCLONIC SHEAR...AND THE RESULTING UPWARD
VERTICAL MOTION THAT TRIGGERS CONVECTION.  ITS ACTUALLY JUST AN UPPER
LEVEL TROF...BUT ITS MOVING FROM NE TO SW INSTEAD OF THE USUAL W-E
MOTION.  

THE NEW ETA IS CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS...FCSTG THE CUTOFF
TO BE CENTERED NEAR ANTIOCH...IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY...AT 12Z THU
WITH ITS AXIS RUNNING E-W BY THAT TIME.  BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND NOON
THU THE AREA OF CLOUDS/SHOWERS CURRENTLY JUST NE OF THE BAY AREA

MRNG AND THRU MONTEREY BAY BY ABOUT NOON.  SHOWER THREAT WILL
CONTINUE TIL THIS AREA OF CLOUDS MOVES THRU...WHICH WILL COINCIDE
WITH THE SWD MOTION OF THE SHEAR AXIS.  

AFTER THE AXIS MOVES THROUGH THE CHANCE OF RAIN WILL DECREASE AND
SOME CLEARING IS EXPECTED...BUT THE DEVELOPING NELY FLOW ALOFT ON
TRHE N SIDE OF THE CUTOFF WILL CARRY ANY WRAPAROUND MOISTURE SWWD OFF
THE SIERRA AND INTO OUR FCST AREA.  SO...CANT COMPLETELY RULE OUT
A RISK OF SHOWERS DURING THE AFTERNOON...BUT THE MAIN THREAT WILL BE
IN THE MORNING WITH THE PASSING SHEAR AXIS.  BY FRI OUR FCST AREA
WILL BE IN THE CLEAR AS FAR AS THE RAIN THREAT IS CONCERNED... BUT
THE LOW LEVEL ONSHORE FLOW WILL CONTINUE AND WITH THE AIRMASS WARMING
ALOFT...SOME STRATUS IS LIKELY.

IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...ALL MODELS MAINTAIN THE MEAN UPPER TROF
PATTERN OVER THE W COAST...AS IT HAS BEEN ALL SPRING.  THE MRF AND UK
ARE THE STRONGEST MODELS WITH THE PATTERN...BUT THE EURO/NOGAPS/
CANADIAN ALL COME ON BOARD BY LATE SUN/MON.  AT ANY RATE THE TROF

VAPOR LOOP SHOWS A MODERATELY STRONG 500 MB LOW ALONG THE NRN 
OREGON COASTLINE DROPING DUE SWD EARLY THIS MORNING. MODELS
CONSISTENT IN MOVING THIS INTO THE SF E BAY AREA LOW DEEPENING IT TO
AROUND 550 DM BY EARLY THU. THIS LOW HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
LATEST ROUND OF COOL CONDITIONS AND FOR THE SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWER
ACTIVITY THAT BEGAN YESTERDAY. WITH THE LOW PASSING OVER THE AREA ON
THU...THE PATTERN IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE THROUGH MOST OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD. THE EXACT MOVEMENT OF THE LOW IS CRITICAL TO HOW MUCH SHOWER
ACTIVITY WE WILL SEE. IF LOW TRACKS AS MOST OF CURRENT MODELS
SHOW...OVER THE AREA...EXPECT ONLY SCATTERED VERY LIGHT SHOWER
ACTIVITY WITH A RISK OF AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS ERN PORTIONS OF
AREA. MOST OF THE ACTIVITY WITH THIS TRAJECTORY WOULD REMAIN E OF THE
CENTRAL COAST FORECAST AREA...MAINLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND OVER
THE SIERRA. IF LOW TRACKS FURTHER W...WE COULD SEE MORE PRECIP THAN
CURRENT FORECAST SHOW...IF IT TRACKS MORE INLAND AS EARLIER MODELS
INDICATED...LESS PRECIP BUT STILL COOL AND BREEZY FOR THE AREA.

CLOUD PATTERN IS REALLY MESSY. A WEAK COLD FRONTAL BAND ASSOCIATED
WITH UPPER LOW/TROF RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE LIGHT SHOWER ACTIVITY
IS OVER THE BAY AREA THIS MORNING. IN ADDITION...SATELLITE AND
AIRPORT OBSERVATIONS SHOW LOTS OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...ALSO
RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE DRIZZLE OR SPRINKLES REPORTED. LOW CLOUDS
ARE BROKEN UP OR LIFTED DUE TO THE COLD ADVECTION PROCESSES OCCURRING
AND RESULTANT INSTABILITY. THUS...NO FOG AROUND BUT SEVERAL LAYERS OF
LOW ST/SC CLOUDS. THIS CLOUD COVER AND INCOMING COLD AIRMASS FROM THE
N WILL KEEP DAYTIME TEMPERATURES UNSEASONABLY COOL. SOME SITES WERE
AS MUCH AS 20 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL ON TUE AND EXPECT SIMILAR NEAR
RECORD LOW MAXIMUM READINGS TODAY. FOR EXAMPLE...SAN FRANCISCO
DOWNTOWN WAS 57 ON TUE...JUST 1 DEGREE ABOVE THE RECORD 56. THE
FORECAST FOR TODAY IS 57 WHICH IS ALSO 1 DEGREE ABOVE THE RECORD FOR
THE DATE. DO NOT USUALLY TALK ABOUT SNOW LEVELS AFTER MEMORIAL DAY...
BUT EXPECT SNOW IN THE SIERRA DOWN TO AROUND 5000 FEET AS UPPER LOW
MOVES ACROSS LATER TONIGHT AND EARLY THU.  

WE JUST CAN NOT SHAKE THIS UPPER TROFFY PATTERN THIS SPRING.
BASICALLY...WE HAVE HAD A LONG WAVE 500 MB TROF ENTRENCHED OVER THE
W COAST...ALMOST ALL THIS LA NINA SPRING. NEW MEDIUM RANGE MODELS
EXCEPT WEAKER NOGAPS...SHOW THIS PATTERN CONTINUING THROUGH THIS
WEEKEND. BRIEF SHORTWAVE RIDGE IS TRENDED TO FOLLOW CURRENT LOW AS IT
MOVES INTO SRN GREAT BASIN...FOR FRI/SAT. SURFACE FLOW WILL CONTINUE
ONSHORE...HOWEVER FOR CLOUDY AND COOL AT COAST BUT WARMER...NEAR
NORMAL TEMPERATURES INLAND. MRF TRENDS ANOTHER MODERATE UPPER LEVEL
GULF OF ALASKA SHORTWAVE TROF TO BEGIN MOVING INTO AREA LATER SAT AND
PERSISTING INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. THIS INDICATES MORE COOL-POSSIBLY
BREEZY CONDITIONS BEGINNING SUN. MRF DOES BECOME MORE OPTIMISTIC
LATER...HOWEVER. MODEL SHOWS A DISTINCT WEAKENING OF THE UPPER LEVEL
FLOW WITH A FLAT RIDGE...BUT MODERATELY HIGH 500 MB HEIGHTS AND A

BUT SOME DECENT DAYTIME HEATING WILL ALSO BE IN ORDER. THIS COULD BE
THE CRUCIAL VARIABLE IF ENOUGH OF A CLOUD CAN0PY PERSISTS. ALSO...THE
AIRMASS ADVECTING INTO THE AREA IS VERY COLD WHICH WILL CERTAINLY BE
A FACTOR WITH INSTABILITY. SO...MENTION OF AT LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE
OF THUNDERSTORMS FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON WILL BE NECESSARY AND THEN
LIKELY OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN. AND AS IF THAT WERE NOT ENOUGH...THE
COOLER DAYTIME HIGHS WILL CONTINUE TOMORROW AS WELL. BEYOND THAT
THINGS SHOULD START TO IMROVE FOR THE NEAR TERM. BY FRIDAY A WARMER
AIRMASS DEVELOPS ALTHOUGH MAINLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN CWA.
STILL...TEMPERATURES SHOULD EDGE UP A BIT MOST AREAS FRIDAY COMPARED
TO TODAY AND THURSDAY WITH THE AIRMASS DRYING INLAND FAIRLY GOOD.
ONSHORE FLOW WILL STILL BE THE RULE AND EXPECT COASTAL LOW CLOUDS
FROM THE BAY AREA SOUTHWARD BACK IN THE PICTURE.
IN THE EXTENDED THE IMPROVED CONDITIONS ON FRIDAY WILL LIKELY SPILL
INTO SATURDAY BEFORE MORE CHANGES TAKE PLACE. LONG-RANGE MODELS
DEVELOP A TROUGH OVER THE WEST COAST BY SATURDAY NIGHT THAT PERSISTS
INTO TUESDAY. THIS WILL MEAN MORE OF THE COOLER CONDITIONS LIKE WE
HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING BUT LIKELY NO PRECIPITATION.

QUITE A MESSY WEATHER PATTERN OVER OUR AREA WITH TWO CUTOFF LOWS. 
THE CUTOFF OVER SRN CA IS BEING KICKED OUT BY THE COLD CUTOFF
DROPPING SWD INTO THE PACNW.  THE SOUTHERN SYSTEM IS SENDING CLOUDS
AND SOME VIRGA INTO SRN MONTEREY COUNTY...AND MAY PRODUCE A FEW
SPRINKLES OVER THE MOUNTAINS OF THE COUNTY TNGT BEFORE IT MOVES NEWD
OUT OF THE PICTURE.  THE PACNW CUTOFF HAS A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED
WITH IT THAT IS DROPPING SLOWLY SEWD THRN NRN CA.  IT IS ENHANCING
THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND A STRONG SWLY FLOW AT THE SURFACE AND THE
PREFRONTAL LIFT...ENHANCED BY A SWLY JET...HAS GENERATED SHOWERS IN
SAN FRANCISCO AND THEY COULD DEVELOP ANYWHERE IN OUR FCST AREA TNGT/
WED MRNG...AND WILL UP ALL POPS TO AT LEAST THE CHANCE CATEGORY.  BY
WED AFTN...THE LEFT FRONT QUADRANT OF THE STRONG NWLY JET ON THE W
SIDE OF THE PACNW CUTOFF IS FCST TO DROP VERY CLOSE TO SFO WITH
STRONG DIFFLUENCE AND COLD ADVECTION.  ALTHOUGH THE MARINE INVERSION
WILL BE LONG GONE BY THEN...THERE WILL BE ENOUGH MOISTURE AND
DYNAMICS WITH THE SYSTEM TO CONTINUE A SHOWER THREAT OVER OUR FCST
AREA...AND THERE MAY EVEN BE A FEW AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS ESPECIALLY
OVER THE INTERIOR OF THE N BAY.  THE MOST UNSTABLE AIR WILL BE FROM
THE CENTRAL VALLEY EWD BUT THE DYNAMICS WITH THIS CUTOFF APPEAR
STRONG ENOUGH TO POP A BOOMER OR TWO IN OUR FCST AREA.  ALONG WITH
THE CLOUDS AND THE SHOWERS...TEMPS WILL REMAIN UNSEASONABLY COOL...
ESPECIALLY INLAND...WITH W-SWLY LOW LEVEL ONSHORE FLOW CONTINUING
ALONG WITH THE UNUSUALLY COLD AIR ALOFT.  

THE NEW ETA NOW FCSTS THE CUTOFF CENTER TO BE NEAR ANTIOCH BY 12Z
THU.  THIS IS A MORE WLY POSITION THAN THE PREVIOUS RUN WHICH HAD IT
NEAR BLUE CANYON AT THE SAME TIME.  IF THE CUTOFF DOES TRACK MORE TO
THE W AND DEVELOPS A LONGER OVERWATER FETCH...WE COULD HAVE EVEN MORE
SHOWER ACTIVITY THAN THE UPDATED...WETTER ZONES INDICATE.  IF THE ETA
IS CORRECT...DROPPING THE CUTOFF TO PASO ROBLES BY 00Z FRI...WE
SHOULD SEE DRYING FROM N TO S OVER OUR FCST AREA DURING THE DAY THU.

IN THE LONGER RANGE THE MODELS ALL BUILD AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER
NRN/CNTRL CA FRI/SAT...BUT CONTINUE THE ONSHORE FLOW.  THUS WE WILL
RETURN TO NORMAL JUNE WEATHER.  BY SUN THE MRF/EURO DROP YET ANOTHER
UPPER TROF ONTO THE W COAST...FOR MORE COOL CLOUDY WEATHER.  THE
UK/NOGAPS RETAIN A RIDGE OVER CA ON THAT DAY BUT GIVEN THE PREVAILING
WEATHER PATTERN THROUGHOUT THIS SPRING...ARE WE GOING TO GO WITH THE
RIDGE MODELS?  NOT A CHANCE.

AFTERNOON WATER VAPOR LOOP SHOWS UPPER LOW CENTER NOW FINALLY
SHIFTING SOUTHWARD AND LOCATED OVER SOUTHERN LAKE COUNTY. MODELS MOVE
THIS LOW OVER THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA LATER TONIGHT AND AS IT IS
DOING SO THE STRATUS IS CLEARING OUT FROM THE NORTH. BEHIND THE LOW
MORE NORTHWESTERLY ANTICYCLONIC FLOW IS TRYING TO SETUP OVER NORTHERN
CALIFORNIA. AN AREA OF CONVECTION IS SHOWING UP ON THE SATELLITE LOOP
OVER LATE COUNTY AND WITH IT MOVING SOUTHWESTWARD THIS AFTERNOON WILL
HAVE TO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF A LATE AFTERNOON SHOWER ACROSS
NORTHER SONOMA AND NAPA COUNTIES. BUT THIS SHOULD DIE OUT IN ORDERLY
FASHION AS THE LOW CONTINUES ITS SOUTHWARD TRACK AND THE DAY WEARS
ON. AVIATION/ETA MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON MOVING THE UPPER LOW
FURTHER SOUTHWARD OVERNIGHT AND THEN OUT OVER THE OCEAN SOUTH OF OUR
FORECAST AREA BY LATE SUNDAY. AS THIS TRANSITION TAKE PLACE EXPECT TO
SEE MORE CLEARING OF THE COASTAL STRATUS THIS EVENING. ONE FLY IN THE
OINTMENT IS THE SURFACE PATTERN IN WHICH THE MODELS PROJECT AN EAST
TO WEST LOCATED TROUGH ACROSS THE BAY AREA LATER TONIGHT. THIS IN
COMBINATION WITH THE UPPER LOW MOVEMENT WOULD SUGGEST A SOUTHERLY
FLOW SITUATION. THEREFORE WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME DECENT CLEARING
LATER THIS EVENING THE POSSIBILITY IS VERY REAL FOR RETURN FLOW OF
THE STRATUS ALONG THE COAST OVERNIGHT WITH LOCAL PENETRATION INTO THE
BAY AREA. AS THE LOW MOVES FURTHER SOUTHWARD ON SUNDAY AN OFFSHORE
PATTERN SETS UP NORTH OF THE BAY AREA AND THE AIRMASS WARMS UP A BIT.
SO EXPECT A LITTLE WARMING SUNDAY AND MONDAY INLAND AREAS WITH MAYBE
JUST A TAD WARMER AT THE COAST. STILL THE ONSHORE PATTERN WILL
CONTINUE SOUTH OF THE BAY AREA ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY. BY TUESDAY THE
PATTERN STRENGTHENS AND THE OFFSHORE FLOW TO THE NORTH WEAKENS AND
SHIFTS TO NORTH TO NORTHWESTERLY. THIS ONSHORE SITUATION CONTINUES

TYPICAL ONSHORE PATTERN IN PLACE WITH A FAIRLY STRONG MARINE PUSH AND
THE MARINE LAYER AROUND 3000 FEET DEEP AT FORT ORD.  THE LINGERING
UPPER LEVEL CUTOFF IS CENTERED IN EXTREME NWRN AZ.  MODELS HAVE BEEN
DOING A GOOD JOB ON THIS SYSTEM...MOVING IT EWD VERY SLOWLY.  ITS
FCST TO PICK UP SPEED STARTING TDA AS A SHORT WAVE MOVES INTO THE
PACIFIC NW AND ACTS AS A HALFHEARTED KICKER...MOVING THE CUTOFF TO
NEAR 4 CORNERS BY TNGT.  LOCALLY THERE WILL BE ONLY SUBTLE CHANGES TO
THE WEATHER PATTERN IN OUR FCST AREA.  THE PACNW SHORT WAVE IS
EXPECTED TO GENERATE ENOUGH OF A SURGE OF SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE INTO

MB BY 00Z THIS AFTN WHILE AVN FCSTS A 5 MB GRADIENT.  AT 08Z THE
GRADIENT WAS ALREADY 2.5 MB SO THE STRONGER AVN WILL PROBABLY VERIFY
BETTER.  THIS DEVELOPMENT SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE NLY COMPONENT OF THE
WINDS IN THE N BAY ENOUGH TO CLEAR THE LOW CLOUDS FROM MOST OF THE

DUE TO A WEAKER AND LATER SEABREEZE.  FROM SFO S...THE MODELS FCST
LITTLE CHANGE IN THE NLY COMPONENT OF THE LOW LEVEL FLOW AND EXPECT
MAX TEMPS ABOUT THE SAME AS YDA.  ON WED...THE PRESSURE PATTERN IS
FCST TO BECOME MORE WLY IN THE N BAY AGAIN AND STRONGER ONSHORE IN
GENERAL.  AT THE SAME TIME THE ETA FCSTS A DECREASE IN 950 MB

GET MORE INTERESTING AS ALL MEDIUM RANGE MODELS DROP A STRONG...DEEP
TROF DOWN THE W COAST STARTING ON SAT.  THAT DAY SHOULD SEE AN
INCREASE IN WIND...WITH COOLER TEMPS INLAND AND LESS COASTAL STRATUS

THE SOUTHERLY SURFACE FLOW AT THE COAST WAS STRONGER THAN EXPECTED
TODAY. STRATUS HAS RACED NORTHWARD AND NOW COVERS ALL OF THE COAST
IN OUR DISTRICT. THIS PREVENTED THE WARMING FROM TAKING PLACE IN
AREAS ADJACENT TO THE COAST. THE EAST-WEST ELONGATED SURFACE TROUGH
OVER CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND THE UPPER LEVEL CUTOFF LOW OVER SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA PRODUCED A DRY NORTHERLY FLOW WHICH RESULTED IN
SIGNIFICANT WARMING AWAY FROM THE COAST. THE NORTHERLY FLOW WILL
WEAKEN SUNDAY AS THE SURFACE TROUGH MOVES NORTH AND TEMPERATURES WILL
COOL A FEW DEGREES INLAND. ON MONDAY THE UPPER LOW WILL BE KICKED
NORTHEAST AS A TROUGH FROM THE GULF OF ALASKA APPROACHES THE PACIFIC
NORTHWEST AND THE ONSHORE FLOW WILL STRENGTHEN BRINGING FURTHER
COOLING OF TEMPERATURES INLAND. COASTAL AREAS WILL STAY COOL THROUGH
MONDAY. 

IN THE EXTENDED...AN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE THROUGH THE PACIFIC
NORTHWEST DURING MIDWEEK DEEPENING THE MARINE LAYER AND KEEPING
TEMPERATURES NEAR NORMAL. ON THURSDAY WE MIGHT GET AN OFFSHORE FLOW
GOING OVER THE DISTRICT AS SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS FROM THE EASTERN
PACIFIC HIGH INTO THE NORTHWEST AFTER THE TROUGH PASSAGE. POPS ZERO.

INFRARED SAT PIX SHOW THE WEDGE OF WARM AIR MOVING SWD THRU SOLANO

LITTLE PERPLEXING THAT WE ONLY HAVE PATCHY STRATUS IN OUR FCST AREA. 
THE POTENTIAL IS THERE...ITS MOVED INLAND AS FAR AS LIVERMORE...BUT
MEANWHILE THE 1 AM SKIES WERE CLEAR AT MONTEREY AND AT OCEAN BEACH IN
THE CITY.  THE ETA AND AVN LOW LEVEL RH PROGS FCST A MOISTURE
SHORTAGE ALONG THE COAST...AND THEYRE APPARENTLY ON TO SOMETHING. 
LOW CLOUDS OR NOT...TEMPS SHOULD BE A LITTLE COOLER TDA DUE TO A
COOLER AIRMASS ALOFT AND AT LEAST AS MUCH ONSHORE FLOW AS YDA.  THE

EXPECT MUCH FOG...MOSTLY JUST LOW CLOUD TONIGHT. SIMILAR TO LAST

WEAKENED THE ONSHORE FLOW CONSIDERABLY OVER THE SRN PART OF OUR AREA

300 AM PDT SUN MAY 16 1999

THE TROUGH IS MOVING EASTWARD AND A RIDGE IS BUILDING OVER THE WEST.
THE ATMOSPHERE IS BECOMING MORE STABLE AS THE HIGH BUILDS IN WHICH IS
EVIDENT ON THE CURRENT FOG SATELLITE IMAGE. AN AREA OF LOW CLOUDS HAS
DEVELOPED ALONG THE SAN MATEO COAST AND IS SPREADING RAPIDLY
SOUTHWARD. SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENTS HAVE WEAKENED SO TODAY WILL
BE A RETURN TO OUR MORE NORMAL AFTERNOON SEABREEZE WHICH WILL ALLOW
FOR A FEW DEGREES OF WARMING. WITH THE RIDGE BUILDING...THE
ATMOSPHERE STABILIZING...WARMING ALOFT AND THE STRONG NORTHERLY
GRADIENT DYING EXPECT COASTAL STRATUS TO MAKE A COMEBACK TONIGHT. THE
RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD THROUGH MONDAY MORNING AND THEN IT SORT
OF FLATTENS OUT AND REMAINS SO THROUGH MOST OF THE WEEK. SO THROUGH
THE WEEK EXPECT NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND EXTENSIVE COASTAL
STRATUS EXTENDING INLAND NIGHTS AND MORNINGS. THIS PATTERN WILL HOLD
THROUGH EARLY THURSDAY AT LEAST. BUT BY THE END OF THE EXTENDED
PERIOD MODELS DIVERGE...THEY WANT TO DEVELOP A TROUGH OVER THE WEST
BUT VARY ON INTENSITY OF THE SYSTEM. MRF AND NOGAPS DEVELOP A CUTOFF
LOW OVER CA ON FRIDAY. MRF STRONGEST WITH THIS FEATURE AND BY
SATURDAY MORNING HAS A 5490 M CUTOFF UPPER LEVEL LOW RIGHT OVER THE
BAY AREA. THIS SOLUTION SEEMS TOO EXTREME FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR SO
PREFER WEAKER UK/EURO WHICH JUST BRING A TROUGH THROUGH CA WITH
HEIGHTS NOT GOING LOWER THAN ABOUT 5620 M.  ALL POPS ZERO.  BELL

WINDS AT THE BUOYS IN OUR COASTAL WATERS CONTINUE TO BLOW AT 25 KT
WITH GUSTS TO 35 KT AND WILL SUBSIDE ONLY SLIGHTLY OVERNIGHT AS
SURFACE GRADIENT BEGINS TO SLACKEN. WIND WILL KEEP THE LOWER LEVELS
OF THE TROPOSPHERE SUFFICIENTLY MIXED TO PREVENT WIDESPREAD STRATUS
FORMATION. ALSO...OAK SOUNDING AND FT ORD PROFILER SHOW NO SIGNS OF A
MARINE INVERSION FORMING. A FEW AREAS OF LOW CLOUDS HAVE FORMED IN
OROGRAPHICALLY FAVORABLE AREAS...BUT WITH CURRENT WIND AND AIRMASS
CHARACTERISTICS...DONT EXPECT ANY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LOW CLOUDS
OVERNIGHT.

WEAK SHORTWAVE THAT PASSED OVER THE CENTRAL COAST ON SATURDAY HAS
MOVED INTO SRN CA. THIS WILL ALLOW A SHORTWAVE RIDGE TO BUILD OVER
CA ON SUNDAY AND RESULT IN WARMER TEMPS...ABOUT 2 TO 5 DEGREES
WARMER...IN MOST AREAS. WILL UPDATE ZONES TO BETTER REFLECT WARMING.
LIGHTER WINDS NEAR THE COAST AND WARMING ALOFT COMBINED WITH A
CONTINUED ONSHORE FLOW WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY MEAN MORE WIDESPREAD
COASTAL LOW CLOUDS SUNDAY NIGHT/MONDAY MORNING. A WEAK SYSTEM WILL
RIDE UP OVER AND FLATTEN THE RIDGE ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. IT MAY
BRING SOME LIGHT RAIN TO FAR NRN CA...BUT ONLY SOME CLOUDS TO THE
NORTH SFO BAY MONDAY. 

THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS CONTINUE TO FORECAST A WEAK TROF OVER CA THRU
WEDNESDAY WHICH WILL KEEP US IN A MODERATE ONSHORE FLOW PATTERN AND
COOLER THAN NORMAL. BY DAY FIVE...THURSDAY...MODELS DEEPEN AN UPPER

WNW-NW AND FAIRLY STRONG FOR THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS. UPPER WINDS
COMBINED WITH A STRONG SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT FROM A HIGH OVER THE

BREEZY-WINDY SURFACE CONDITIONS FOR PAST SEVERAL DAYS...AND OFF AND
ON FOR MOST OF THIS COOL-BREEZY SPRING. ALSO...WITH GENERAL TROFFY

THAN USUAL. AND...AS INDICATED PREVIOUSLY...COASTAL BUOYS SHOW OCEAN
TEMPERATURES IN THE 47-50 DEGREE RANGE...ACCORDING TO NOAA ANOMALY
CHARTS...SEVERAL DEGREES COOLER THAN NORMAL. COLDER WATER IS DUE TO
INCREASED UPWELLING FROM THE STRONG NW FLOW PATTERN ALL SPRING...AND
IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE AS A FACTOR FOR AWHILE IN KEEPING LAND
TEMPERATURES IN THE COASTAL ZONES ON THE COOL SIDE. 

WEAK UPPER RIDGE MOVES ACROSS NRN CA ON SUN...THEN ON MON ANOTHER
WEAK SHORTWAVE TROF IS FORECAST IN MODELS TO MOVE ACROSS FAR NRN CA.
SHOWERS AT THE FAR N END OF STATE ARE POSSIBLE WITH TROF BUT PROBABLY

THE LACK OF A STRONG SUBSIDENCE INVERSION IS THE RESULT OF THE
CENTRAL COAST FORECAST AREA REMAINING ON THE BACK SIDE OF A LARGE

PRESENCE OF A STRONG W-WNW FLOW ALOFT ARE NOT FAVORABLE FOR THE
FORMATION OF A STRONG LOW LEVEL MARINE INVERSION. COOLER THAN NORMAL
COASTAL WATERS MAY ALSO BE AFFECTING THIS PROCESS. THIS EFFECT WILL
HOLD TRUE FOR TODAY AND LIKELY INTO SUN AS WELL. NEW ETA/NGM MODELS

ENOUGH EAST TO ALLOW A RIDGE TO DEVELOP OVER THE WEST COAST. UNTIL

CONDITIONS WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING. HEIGHTS/THICKNESS ALSO START TO
INCREASE ON SUNDAY AS THE RIDGE BUILDS IN. NEW MODELS SHOW MUCH LESS

900 AM PDT WED MAY 12 1999

A WEAKENING COLD FRONT WAS MOVING INTO THE CENTRAL COAST THIS AM.
AHEAD OF IT...ST/FOG/DZ HAD SPREAD WELL INTO THE COASTAL VALLEYS. 
MRY FORECAST OFFICE RECORDED .01 OF DRIZZLE. BEHIND THE FRONT WAS 
A BROKEN AREA OF CU/SC OVER THE OCEAN WHICH INDICATES A CONSIDERABLE
RISE IN THE MARINE LAYER FROM THE CURRENT 900FT REPORTED AT MRY. THIS
AREA OF CU/SC WILL MOVE SWD INTO OUR AREA LATER THIS PM/EVNG...BUT
WITH LITTLE COLD ADVECTION TO SUSTAIN IT. CURRENT FORECAST CONTINUES
TO FORECAST CLEAR SKIES AND WINDY CONDITIONS THU AND FRI...SUPPORTED
BY FOUS. WITH UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMING MORE NWLY PER ETA THE LOWER
ATMOSPHERE SHOULD REMAIN WELL MIXED INTO SAT. MRF CONTINUES THE TREND
TOWARD DECREASING WINDS ALOFT...BECOMING MORE WLY BY SUN. THIS WILL
ALLOW THE ST/FOG TO MOVE BACK ONTO THE CENTRAL COAST SUN AND MON
AHEAD OF ANOTHER WEAK SHORT WAVE/COLD FRONT. THE REMNANTS OF THE
FRONT SHOULD MOVE THRU MON NIGHT...WITH ANOTHER WINDY DAY NEXT TUE.
THE LONGER RANGE SUGGESTS A CUTOFF LOW DEVELOPING OFF THE COAST THE

300 AM PDT WED MAY 12 1999

A WEAK RIDGE LIES OVER CA WITH ZONAL FLOW OVER THE PACNW BUT WITH
VERY LIMITED MID LEVEL MOISTURE. STRATUS HAS DEVELOPED AND FILLED IN
THE ENTIRE COAST THIS MORNING. FORT ORD PROFILER IS SHOWING THE TOP
OF THE MARINE LAYER AROUND 1500 FEET SO IT IS FAIRLY SHALLOW. THUS
THE STRATUS HAS NOT EXTENDED VERY FAR INLAND AND SHOULD RETREAT TO
THE COAST BY MIDDAY. A WEAK DRY COLD FRONT IS MOVING THROUGH NORTHERN
CA AT THIS TIME. IT CAN BE SEEN ON THE SATELLITE FOG PRODUCT ERODING
THE STRATUS OFFSHORE NORTH OF PT ARENA. THIS FRONT SHOULD SLOWLY MIX
OUT THE LOW CLOUDS ALONG THE COAST TODAY AND TONIGHT. BY THURSDAY
MORNING SKIES SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR DUE TO SUBSIDENCE AND DRYING
ALOFT. ON THURSDAY 1000-500MB THICKNESSES ARE FORECAST BY THE ETA TO
DROP ABOUT 60 M AND STRONG ONSHORE FLOW WILL KEEP THE MARINE
INFLUENCE. SO EVEN THOUGH THERE WILL BE MORE SUNSHINE ON THURSDAY
TEMPERATURES ARE LIKELY TO STAY ABOUT THE SAME AS TODAYS READINGS. IN
THE EXTENDED THE MRF DEVELOPS A WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER CA SO
GENERAL PATTERN THROUGH THE PERIOD FOR CENTRAL CA SHOULD BE LESS
COASTAL CLOUDS AND NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES.  ALL POPS ZERO.  BELL

VORT MAX PASSES BY WED NIGHT...SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDENCE DEVELOPS AND
DRIES AIR MASS.  THUS EXPECT WED TO HAVE SIMILAR COASTAL STRATUS
COVERAGE TO TODAY...WITH SOMEWHAT GREATER EARLY AM INLAND PENETRATION
DUE TO EARLIER START TONIGHT THAN MON NIGHT AND APPROACH OF COLD
FRONT.  MAX TEMPS WED SHOULD THEREFORE BE COOLER...ESPECIALLY INLAND.

COASTAL STRATUS SHOULD BE LESS EXTENSIVE WED NIGHT AND THEN CLEAR
ALMOST COMPLETELY THURS AM AS SUBSIDENCE INCREASES AND LOW LEVEL
WINDS INCREASE OUT OF THE NORTHWEST.  RELATIVELY COOL AIR
MASS...STRONG WINDS...AND CONTINUED ONSHORE COMPONENT TO FLOW KEEP
TEMPS THURS FROM REBOUNDING MUCH DESPITE EXPECTED GREATER SUNSHINE. 
SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DAY 1 TO DAY 2 COOLING OF 850 TEMPS IN ETA THAN
NGM...HOWEVER...COULD BE REFLECTED IN THURS HIGHS EXCEEDING NGM MOS
VALUES. 

IN EXTENDED...LONGER RANGE MODELS CONTINUE TO DIVERGE SIGNIFICANTLY
FROM DAY 3 ONWARDS...WITH UNCERTAINTY OF SOLUTION REFLECTED IN NCEP
MRF ENSEMBLE PLOTS.  CONSENSUS INDICATION IS OF DEVELOPMENT OF LONG
WAVE TROUGH CENTERED OVER GREAT BASIN...BUT INTENSITY...
PERSISTENCE...AND DETAILS OF LOCATION VARY WIDELY.  UKMET AND
CANADIAN MODELS GIVE STRONGEST SOLUTION...WITH ECMWF AND MRF MUCH
WEAKER.  IN OUR AREA...NO PRECIP EXPECTED WITH ANY OF THESE SOLUTIONS
THOUGH SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL IMPACT ON TEMPS...STRATUS AND WINDS. 
GENERAL INDICATION OF TROUGHING AND LOWER THAN CLIMATOLOGICAL 500 MB

APPROACHING FRONT HAS LOST MUCH OF ITS UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT...SO ONLY
EFFECT OF THE FRONT ON THE CENTRAL COAST WED WILL BE SOME INCREASE IN

A POSSIBILITY. THE SURFACE HIGH WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD AS IT MOVES

SWD. MARINE LAYER IS FAIRLY SHALLOW (CLOUD TOPS LESS THAN 1200FT) 
SO EXPECT BURNOFF TO OCCUR DURING THE MORNING. INCREASING PREFRONTAL
SUBSIDENCE SHOULD CLEAR THE ST/FOG FROM THE COAST THIS PM AND KEEP IT
OFFSHORE UNTIL LATER TONITE. MOST FRONTAL COLD ADVECTION WILL REMAIN

BE MOST NOTICEABLE IN THE COASTAL VALLEYS AS MAX TEMPS FALL FROM THE
70S AND LOW 80S MON TO THE 60S AND 70S WED. STRONGEST WINDS SHOULD BE
WED AND THU AS THE SURFACE HIGH REACHES MAX INTENSITY OVER THE ERN
PACIFIC PER NOGAPS/MRF. COASTAL ST SHOULD BE DECREASING AFTER WED AS
THE WINDS LIFT IT AND MIX IT OUT. ST/FOG SHOULD RETURN NEXT SUN/MON

SAN FRANCISCO AREA/CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST FORECAST
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SAN FRANCISCO CA
900 PM PDT MON MAY 10 1999

NCEP MODELS RUNNING BEHIND...SO ONLY 00Z OUTPUT AVAILABLE THUS FAR IS
ETA THROUGH 36 HRS...WHICH APPEARS VERY SIMILAR TO EARLIER 12Z RUN. 
WEAK WARM FRONT APPEARS TO HAVE JUST MOVED INLAND OVER THE FAR
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST...AND HAS BROUGHT JUST A LITTLE LIGHT
PRECIP TO THE FAR NORTHWESTERN PART OF THE STATE.  LIGHT PRECIP
ASSOCIATED WITH TRAILING AND EQUALLY WEAK COLD FRONT WILL ALSO STAY
WELL NORTH OF OUR DISTRICT.

HIGH CLOUDINESS...HOWEVER...IS STREAMING OVER THE TOP OF AN UPPER
LEVEL RIDGE JUST WEST OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST WHILE IR FOG IMAGERY
SHOWS THAT LARGE MASS OF STRATUS ADVECTING TOWARDS US FROM THE
NORTHWEST THROUGHOUT THE DAY HAS FINALLY REACHED THE COAST FROM ABOUT
MONTEREY NORTH.  LATEST ETA UPPER RH FIELDS SUGGEST SOME...ALBEIT
MORE LIMITED...HIGH CLOUDS TUESDAY NORTHERN ZONES AND DRIER ALOFT TO
THE SOUTH.  BIGGER QUESTION CONCERNS STRATUS LAYER.  00Z ETA...LIKE
EARLIER 12Z MODEL RUNS...ONLY PARTLY CAPTURES THIS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
IN INITIALIZATION.  ALSO NOTE FT ORD PROFILER SHOWS REDEVELOPMENT OF
LOW LEVEL INVERSION.  THUS COASTAL STRATUS MAY BE SOMEWHAT MORE
EXTENSIVE TUES AM THAN EARLIER ANTICIPATED.  WILL LEAVE ZONES ALONE
FOR NOW BUT MIDNIGHT SHIFT MAY WANT TO MODIFY IN NEXT ISSUANCE
ACCORDINGLY.

1000/500 THICKNESS GOES UP A BIT TUES THEN LEVELS OUT WED WITH LOW
LEVEL WIND MAINTAINING ONSHORE COMPONENT.  WITH GREATER SUNSHINE
INLAND AND DECREASE IN HIGH CLOUDINESS TEMPS SHOULD WARM A BIT INLAND
BOTH DAYS WHILE ONSHORE FLOW AND STRATUS KEEPS IT COOL NEAR THE
COAST.

IN EXTENDED...MODELS GENERALLY AGREE ON LONG WAVE TROUGH DEVELOPING
VICINITY WESTERN U.S LATER IN THE WEEK BUT DISAGREE MARKEDLY IN
INTENSITY AND DETAILS OF LOCATION.  AS WITH LAST WEEKS CASE...A
CONSENSUS APPROACH SEEMS MOST REASONABLE AT PRESENT.  THIS SUGGESTS
SOME CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN THE FAR NORTH AND OVER THE SIERRA
NEVADA...WITH COOLER AIR MASS AND ONSHORE FLOW KEEPING TEMPS MODEST
THROUGHOUT OUR AREA.

ALL POPS ZERO.     BLIER

.SFO...SCA...PIGEON PT TO PT PIEDRAS BLANCAS AND SFO BAY.

THICKNESSES CONTINUE TO INCREASE SO WOULD EXPECT ADDITIONAL WARMING
IN AREAS WITH LITTLE CLOUD COVER. TEMPS IN THE N BAY MAY BE HELD DOWN
BY CLOUD COVER THRU AT LEAST MIDDAY. AFTER PASSAGE OF UPPER TROF ON
TUE...SFC HIGH PRES RIDGE WILL BUILD INTO THE PAC NW TUE NIGHT AND
INCREASE THE N-S GRADIENT ENOUGH TO SCOUR OUT ANY REMAINING LOW LEVEL
CLOUDS BY MIDDAY WED. WITH INCREASE SURFACE GRADIENT...WED WILL BE
BREEZY. HOWEVER...NO COLD ADVECTION WILL REACH OUR LATITUDE AND 500
MB HEIGHTS REMAIN ABOVE 576 DM THRU WED AFTERNOON...SO TEMPS SHOULD
REMAIN FLAT FROM TUE INTO WED EXCEPT FOR COASTAL AREAS WHICH WILL
COOL A BIT DUE TO STRONGER WINDS OFF OCEAN WATERS.

MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ALL HAVE SOME SORT OF TROF OVER THE WESTERN US
THRU THE EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT VARY AN EXACT LOCATION AND INTENSITY.
MRF SEEMS TO BE CLOSEST TO CONSENSUS...ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE DIGGING
THE TROF TOO FAR S OVER OUR DISTRICT LATE IN THE PERIOD. IN ANY

BEING PUSHED EASTWARD AS UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES PACIFIC NORTHWEST
COAST. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW FAIRLY STRONG LOW LEVEL SUBSIDENCE
OFF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST. THIS IS ALSO IMPLIED IN THE INFARED AND
VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES AS THE LOW CLOUDS FROM THE UPSTREAM SYSTEM
DISSIPATE AS THEY MOVE INTO CALIFORNIA OFFSHORE WATERS. SO ONLY
WIDESPREAD CLOUDINESS THAT CAN BE EXPECTED OVER SFO CWA TONIGHT AND

OF LOW CLOUDS ESPECIALLY NEAR THE COAST AND AROUND MONTEREY BAY
TONIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING WITH MOISTURE SUPPLIED FROM CONTINUED

TUESDAY SHOULD BE A COUPLE OF DEGREES WARMER IN MOST LOCALES AS 500

WEAK COLD FRONT THAT BROUGHT LIGHT RAIN TO FAR NORTHERN CALIF COAST
THIS AFTERNOON IS NOW DYING ON APPROACH TO OUR CWA.  NO CHANCE OF
IT BRINGING US ANY RAIN...RATHER QUESTION IS HOW MUCH COASTAL STRATUS

SHOW STRATUS DECK WORKING DOWN THE COAST WITH THE FRONT...THOUGH
INLAND PENETRATION FAIRLY LIMITED.  THUS ZONE FORECASTS FOR TONIGHT
SEEM REASONABLY ON TARGET.

NO 00Z MODEL GUIDANCE TO LOOK AT DUE TO NCEP COMPUTER PROBS.  EARLIER
MODEL RUNS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT OVER NEXT 2 DAYS SHOWING POST FRONTAL
DRYING OF BOUNDARY LAYER AIR MASS AND MODERATELY STRONG SURFACE WINDS
OUT OF THE NORTHWEST.  MODEL CONSENSUS SUGGESTS ABOUT 3 DEG C OF
COOLING AT 850 MB BETWEEN 00Z TODAY AND 00Z FRIDAY...THOUGH THIS WILL
BE COMPENSATED FOR BY ENHANCED VERTICAL MIXING AND LOCAL AREAS OF
MILD DOWNSLOPE HEATING...WITH NET RESULT OF GENERALLY SMALL CHANGES
IN MAX TEMPS FROM TODAY.  AIR MASS SHOULD WARM A BIT BY SATURDAY AND
PRESENT DAY 2 FORECAST HIGH TEMPS MAY ULTIMATELY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED
UPWARDS A BIT.

EXTENDED STILL SOMEWHAT CONFUSED AS LONG RANGE MODELS RELUCTANT TO
COME INTO AGREEMENT...THOUGH DO NOTE THAT ECMWF AND NOGAPS HAVE
BACKED OFF FROM YESTERDAYS ODD SOLUTION OF COLD UPPER LOW
RETROGRADING FROM GREAT BASIN TO CENTRAL CALIFORNIA FIRST PART OF
NEXT WEEK.  ALL MODEL PROJECTIONS NOW DRY FOR OUR AREA THROUGH 
DAY 5 AND ALL SHOW GENERAL NORTHWEST FLOW AS UPPER RIDGE AND SURFACE
HIGH BUILD TOWARDS WEST COAST.  DIFFERENCE FOR US IS IN STRENGTH OF
FLOW AND WARMTH OF AIR MASS...WITH THE MRF AND UKMET HOLDING WITH
HIGHER HEIGHTS AND WEAKER UPPER FLOW AND NOGAPS AND ECMWF LOWER
HEIGHTS AND STRONGER UPPER FLOW.  AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY...BELIEVE
GENERAL APPROACH OF GOING WITH INTERMEDIATE SOLUTION TENDS TO WORK
BEST IN SUCH CASES AND THUS EXPECT DECREASING WINDS AND GENERALLY
WARMING TEMPS INTO THE FIRST PART OF THE WEEK.  NORTHERLY FLOW AND

GRADIENTS TODAY. WITH WEAK PRESSURE GRADIENTS...AND WITH A VERY
SHALLOW MARINE INVERSION...THE NORMAL COOLING SEABREEZE IS MUCH LATER

ESPECIALLY INLAND FROM COAST. HOWEVER...A MODERATELY DEEP UPPER LEVEL

CLOUDINESS IS DIMINISHING OVER OUR AREA AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS INTO
THE WEST COAST AND ZONE OF STRONG MID TROPOSPHERIC FLOW AND
ASSOCIATED MOISTURE SHIFTS TO OUR NORTHEAST.  HIGH TEMPERATURES THIS
AFTERNOON WERE CHILLY FOR EARLY MAY REFLECTING THE COOL MOIST

ONLY 2 DEG C.  00Z RUN OF ETA MODEL...GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH 00Z

IN 850 MB TEMPS AND SOME CONTINUED DRYING OF AIR MASS.  THUS EXPECT
SUNNIER SKIES TUES AFTERNOON WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES INCREASING BACK

A SHORT WAVE TROUGH IS MOVING THROUGH THE PACNW AT THIS TIME. THIS
TROUGH BROUGHT A WEAK COLD FRONT TO CENTRAL CA ON SUNDAY. EVEN THOUGH
THE FRONT WAS WEAK IT WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO BRING SOME LIGHT RAIN TO
CENTRAL CA AND CLEAR OUT THE COASTAL STRATUS. THE MOST RAINFALL WAS
IN SANTA ROSA WHERE THEY RECEIVED .10 INCHES. COMBINATION OF THE COLD
UNSTABLE AIR BEHIND THE FRONT AND FAIRLY STRONG UPPER LEVEL JET
ORIENTED NW-SE OVER NORTHERN CA AS SEEN ON SATELLITE IS ALLOWING SOME
SHOWERS TO DEVELOP THIS EVENING. WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL
CONTINUE THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT ANY RAINFALL TOTALS WILL BE LIGHT. THE
UPPER LEVEL JET SHOULD MOVE EAST OF OUR AREA ON MONDAY WHICH WILL PUT
AN END TO THE SHOWERS BUT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL STICK AROUND A BIT
LONGER. BY TUESDAY A RIDGE STARTS TO BUILD OVER CA SO SHOULD SEE
WARMER TEMPERATURES ALL AREAS BY MIDWEEK. ON FRIDAY MEDIUM RANGE

DEEP MARINE LOW CLOUD LAYER HAS BROKEN UP SOMEWHAT OVER COASTAL
CENTRAL CA THIS EVENING. VERY STRONG ONSHORE SURFACE PRESSURE
CONTINUES WITH OAK SOUNDING CONTINUING TO SHOW A DEEP...2500 FT
MARINE LAYER AT 00Z. EXPECT THIS DEEP MARINE LAYER TO REDEVELOP AND

AHEAD OF A MODERATELY STRONG UPPER TROF DROPPING SEWD FROM THE GULF
OF ALASKA HEADING INTO THE PAC NW AND NRN CA LATE TONIGHT CONTINUING
THROUGH MOST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. INFLUENCE OF UPPER TROF OR
GENERAL TROFFINESS WILL HELP KEEP MARINE INFLUENCE OVER THE AREA
THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. 

THE OTHER FACTOR IS HOW MUCH PUNCH THE TROF HEADING INTO THE PAC NW
WILL HAVE ON CENTRAL CA PRECIP-WISE. IT LOOKS THIS EVENING WITH NEW
00Z MODEL TRENDS EVEN SLIGHTLY WETTER THAN EARLIER ONES...THAT THERE
WILL BE THREAT OF LIGHT PRECIP AT LEAST INTO THE N SF BAY COUNTIES
AND SOME POSSIBLE SPRINKLES OVER THE GREATER SF BAY AREA. THIS WILL
OCCUR SUN AFTERNOON AND NIGHT AS THE TROF PASSES ACROSS NRN CA.
MODELS TREND VERY LITTLE PVA OR OMEGA WITH THIS SYSTEM...VERY LITTLE
COLD AIR SUPPORT. BUT...LOOKS LIKE LOTS OF MID/HI CLOUDS AND A SMALL
CHANCE OF LIGHT SHOWERS DURING THAT PERIOD. THEREFORE...WILL UPDATED
ZONES THIS EVENING TO REFLECT THIS CHANGE IN THINKING.

MEDIUM RANGE GUIDANCE IS IN FAIR AGREEMENT THROUGH MID PORTION OF
UPCOMING WEEK...AT LEAST. THESE MODELS ALL INDICATE UPPER LEVEL FLOW
PATTERN SHIFTING WELL N OF CENTRAL CA...MAINLY WELL N INTO PAC NW.
WITH BASICALLY AN UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA...EXPECT A WARM UP PERIOD
BEGINNING TUE AND CONTINUING FOR A FEW DAYS. THERE MAY BE SOME
COOLING AT THE COAST DURING THIS PERIOD BUT MARINE INFLUENCES INLAND
ARE LIKELY TO BE MINIMAL.

CLEARING INLAND AND VERY LITTLE CLEARING AT THE COAST ON SUNDAY.

STRATUS HAS FILLED IN ALONG THE ENTIRE COAST EARLY THIS MORNING...BUT
THUS FAR ITS MOVEMENT INLAND HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THAT
DIFFICULTY IS DUE MOSTLY TO A COMPLEX SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN. A
WEAK E TO W SURFACE TROF LIES ACROSS THE NRN BAY AREA. SOUTHERLY WIND
TO THE S OF THIS TROF HAS ALLOWED STRATUS TO SURGE FROM THE MONTEREY
BAY ALMOST TO THE PACHECO PASS. HOWEVER...IN THE SFO BAY AREA...THIS
WEAK SLY GRADIENT HAS KEPT INLAND PENETRATION OF STRATUS TO A MINIMUM
THUS FAR. BUT OVERALL...GRADIENT IS ONSHORE AND WOULD EXPECT STRATUS
TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE INLAND THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING HOURS.
WATER VAPOR SATELLITE LOOP SHOWS UPPER LEVEL TROF MOVING INTO THE PAC
NW. THIS TROF IS FORECAST TO ACT AS THE KICKER FOR THE CUTOFF LOW
OVER THE DESERT SW. AS THE PAC NW TROF MOVES INLAND AND THE CUTOFF
MOVES EAST...UPPER LEVEL FLO OVER OUR AREA WILL TURN MORE WLY. THIS
WILL IN TURN INCREASE ONSHORE TENDENCIES AT THE SURFACE. WITH A
STRONGER ONSHORE FLOW...MORE COASTAL CLOUDS...A COOLER AIRMASS AT

AREAS TODAY. HOWEVER...IF WEAK SOUTHERLY FLOW IS SLOWER TO END THAN
EXPECTED...MAXES IN PLACES LIKE MRY...LVK...AND SJC WILL BE WARMER
THAN FORECAST. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TROF IS FORECAST TO MOVE THRU THE

EVEN MORE.

NEARLY ZONAL UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL BE IN PLACE BY MONDAY AND CONTINUE

WE STILL HAVE A BAND OF JET INDUCED CIRRUS ACROSS CNTRL CA...THE
REMNANTS OF A WEAK FRONTAL ZONE.  THE CIRRUS IS DECREASING AS THE JET
MOVES EWD OUT OF OUR DISTRICT AND IT SHOULD DISSIPATE BY MIDDAY.  LOW
CLOUDS ARE SPARSE AS THE COOLER AIR ALOFT HAS PRETTY WELL MIXED OUT
THE MARINE LAYER...BUT THERE IS STILL A WEAK INVERSION ALONG WITH A
STRONG ONSHORE FLOW SO THERE WILL BE SOME PATCHES OF STRATUS THIS
MRNG.  OUR FCST AREA WILL BE COOL AND BLUSTERY TDA...ESPECIALLY ALONG
THE COAST...BUT YOU AINT SEEN NOTHING YET.  THE MODELS ARE NOW IN
GOOD AGREEMENT IN DROPPING THE VORTCENTER CURRENTLY MOVING PAST
50/140 TO NEAR EUREKA BY THIS EVENING.  THIS FEATURE THEN RACES SEWD
THRU CA TNGT/WED...WINDING UP JUST W OF LAS VEGAS BY 00Z THU.  BEHIND
IT THE SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL BECOME VERY STRONG NW-SE WITH A
STRONG COLD CYCLONIC FLOW AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE LENDING
SUPPORT TO THE SURFACE PATTERN.  EXPECT AT LEAST 25-45 MPH WINDS
THROUGHOUT OUR FCST AREA AND WE MAY NEED TO ISSUE WIND ADVISORIES...
AT LEAST FOR THE COASTAL ZONES.  TEMPS WILL BE VERY COOL THE NEXT
TWO DAYS WITH 1000-500 MB THICKNESSES IN THE LOW 540 DM RANGE AND
850 MB TEMPS ONLY AROUND 2 DEGREES C.  THE ETA INDICATES SOME
INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TNGT/WED MRNG AS THE SHORT WAVE PASSES 
...THEN DRYING AGAIN WED AFTN AS IT MOVES OUT TO THE SE. THE MOISTURE
WILL REMAIN TOO SPARSE FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT RAIN ALTHOUGH A FEW
SPRINKLES IN THE N BAY ARE NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION.  

THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THRU FRI...KEEPING THE
N-NW CYCLONIC FLOW OVER CA BUT WEAKENING IT EACH DAY.  WED SHOULD BE
THE COOLEST...WINDIEST DAY...FOLLOWED BY IMPROVING CONDITIONS THRU
SAT.  SHOWER THREAT IN THE MTNS SHOULD END BY THEN.  ALTHOUGH THERE
WILL BE A WARMING TREND...A PROLONGED OFFSHORE PATTERN IS NOT FCST TO
DEVELOP AS THE CUTOFF LOW IS FCST TO MIGRATE SLOWLY N THRU ERN NV
STARTING THU...MUCH LIKE THE PREVIOUS ONE DID LAST WEEK.  THIS WILL
KEEP THE WINDS AT ALL LEVELS FROM DEVELOPING A STRONG ELY COMPONENT.

ONLY MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS FROM WEAK FRONTAL ZONE REMAIN ACROSS
THE SRN PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREAS THIS EVENING. THESE WILL SLOWLY
PUSH SOUTH AND MOST OF OUR AREA WILL BE CLEAR BY MIDNIGHT. WITH
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND DIMINISHING WINDS...OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL COOL
FURTHER THAN PREVIOUS FORECAST INDICATED AND HAVE UPDATED ZONES TO
REFLECT THIS. 

DEVELOPING SHORTWAVE OFF THE BC COAST IS FORECAST TO STENGTHEN AND
DIVE SSE INTO NWRN CA BY TUE EVENING AND INTO SRN CA BY WED
AFTERNOON WHILE UPPER LOW CUTS OFF OVER WRN NEVADA. AVN FORECASTS A
100-PLUS JET OVER COASTAL CA BY MIDDAY WED WITH A TIGHT SURFACE PRES
GRADIENT. THIS PATTERN LOOKS SIMILAR TO WHAT WE SAW DURING THE STRONG
WIND EVENT OF APRIL 3RD...ALTHOUGH A BIT WEAKER. IN ANY EVENT...IT
WILL BE WINDY ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY...LIKELY
WINDY ENOUGH FOR WIND ADVISORIES. THIS SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE DRY AND
EXPECT NO MORE THAN A FEW SPRINKLES FROM IT TEUS NIGHT INTO WED
MORNING WITH MOST PRECIP CONFINED TO THE SIERNEV AND NRN MTNS.
ALTHOUGH NOT AS WINDY AS WEDNESDAY...TUE WILL BE RATHER BLUSTERY ALSO
WITH COOL NWLY WINDS HOLDING HI TEMPS A FEW DEGREES BELOW MONDAYS
MAXES. BUT AIRMASS WILL BE QUITE DRY AND EXPECT MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES.

MEDIUM RANGE MODELS MOVE CUTOFF LOW OVER THE DESERT SW WED NIGHT AND
THEN KEEP IT IN THAT GENERAL VICINITY THRU THE EXTENDED PERIOD. THIS
WILL ALLOW THICKNESSES AND HEIGHTS TO RISE AND TEMPS WILL REBOUND TO
SEASONAL LEVELS BY FRI. UPPER LOW IS FORECAST TO WOBBLE AROUND THRU

EVENING. HOWEVER...WITH A 2 MB INLAND GRADIENT FROM SFO TO SAC AND
A 3000 FOOT DEEP MARINE LAYER...EXPECT LOW CLOUDS TO MOVE WELL INLAND
OVERNIGHT AND SATELLITE DATA SUGGESTS THIS PROCESS IS UNDERWAY. WITH
SOME LOCATIONS REMAINING CLEAR WELL AFTER SUNSET...TEMPS DROPPED
FURTHER THAN FORECAST AND HAVE UPDATED ZONES FOR LOWER MINS IN SOME
ZONES. 

WEAK BAROCLINIC BAND STRETCHES FROM NRN CA WSW TO BASE OF UPPER TROF
NEAR 37N/140W. BAND IS COMPOSED MOSTLY OF MID AND HI LEVEL CLOUDS AND
SSMI RAIN RATES INDICATE VERY LITTLE PRECIP IN THIS BAND.
HOWEVER...SOME DEVELOPMENT IS CURRENTLY OCCURRING WITH SHORTWAVE NEAR
37/138. THIS FAST MOVING FEATURE IS FORECAST BY ETA TO MOVE ACROSS
NRN CA MONDAY MORNING. IT MAY PRODUCE A FEW SPRINKLES OR LIGHT
SHOWERS N OF SAN JOSE OR SOME DRIZZLE NEAR THE COAST. AFTER INITIAL
SHORTWAVE TROF PASSES MON AFTERNOON...LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES DROP
SUFFICIENTLY TO WIPE OUT INVERSION AND WE SHOULD SEE A BREAK-UP OF

AFTER INITIAL SHORTWAVE MOVES INLAND MON MORNING AND DOESNT PRODUCE
ANY MORE QPF WITH UPPER TROF OR SUBSEQUENT SHORTWAVES. CONFIDENCE IS
NOT VERY HIGH THAT THE ETA HAS A GOOD HANDLE ON QPF.

HIGH PRESSURE WEAKENING OVER CA AS A TROUGH MOVES TOWARD THE PACIFIC
NORTHWEST COAST. STRONG ONSHORE FLOW AND A VERY DEEP MARINE LAYER
BROUGHT THE COASTAL STRATUS VERY FAR INLAND THIS MORNING. CLOUDS
ACTUALLY EXTENDED THROUGH THE DELTA AND REACHED THE SIERRA NEVADA
FOOTHILLS. THUS IT WAS HAVING A TOUGH TIME CLEARING IN MOST AREAS.
THE NEXT FEATURE OF INTEREST IS THE COLD FRONT CURRENTLY OFF THE
NORTHERN CA COAST. THIS FRONT IS MOVING VERY SLOWLY AND IS NOT
EXPECTED TO PASS THROUGH CENTRAL CA UNTIL MONDAY. THIS FRONT HAS
LITTLE DYNAMICS BUT WITH A MOIST LOWER ATMOSPHERIC LAYER THERE MAY
BE A FEW SHOWERS SO WILL MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR THE
NORTH BAY ON MONDAY...OTHERWISE THE FRONT WILL JUST KEEP SKIES
CLOUDY. SUBSIDENCE AHEAD OF THE FRONT APPEARS TO BE CLEARING OUT THE
STRATUS SO AS THE FRONT MOVES CLOSER TONIGHT THE LOW CLOUDS SHOULD BE
REPLACED BY MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS. THE COMBINATION OF INCREASING
SURFACE GRADIENTS AND GOOD COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT ON MONDAY
AFTERNOON SHOULD KEEP STRATUS FROM REDEVELOPING ONCE THE FRONT
PASSES. EVEN THOUGH THERE WILL BE MORE SUNSHINE THE COLD AIR BEHIND
THE FRONT WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES COOL AND SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL. BY
MIDWEEK ALL MODELS DEVELOP A LOW OVER THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST BUT VARY
ON TIMING AND EXACT LOCATION. MRF APPEARS TOO FAST IN MOVING THIS LOW
OUT OF THE AREA SO PREFER SLOWER TIMING OF NOGAPS. BY WEDNESDAY WITH
THE LOW OVER THE GREAT BASIN THE SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENTS WILL
INCREASE AND A STRONG NORTH-SOUTH UPPER LEVEL JET WILL MOVE OVER CA.
SO THIS WEEK A REPEAT OF LAST WEEK WITH CLEAR...COOL AND WINDY
WEATHER. IF THE NOGAPS TIMING HOLDS TRUE THERE WILL BE IMPROVING

ONSHORE FLOW INCREASED OVERNIGHT ALLOWING THE COASTAL STRATUS TO
EXTEND VERY FAR INLAND. STRATUS HAS EXTENDED SO FAR INLAND THAT
CLOUDS EXTEND THROUGH THE DELTA ALL THE WAY TO THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS.
BOTH BASES AND TOPS ARE QUITE HIGH SO ACTUAL DEPTH OF THE CLOUDS IS
NOT VERY THICK AND FOG IS NOT A PROBLEM. AS THE FRONT MOVES CLOSER TO

STRONG COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT ON MONDAY WHICH SHOULD BE
ENOUGH TO DISSIPATE THE MARINE LAYER ALL TOGETHER. IN THE EXTENDED

A VERY DEEP MARINE INVERSION HAS DEVELOPED WITH THE FORT ORD PROFILER
SHOWING ITS BASE AROUND 2000 FEET UP WITH THE TOP SOMEWHERE ABOVE
4000...OFF THE CHART.  THE SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN IS SHIFTING FROM
YESTERDAYS SW-NE GRADIENT TO A MORE W-E CONVENTIONAL ONSHORE FLOW. 
AS A RESULT STRATUS HAS CLOAKED THE ENTIRE COAST AND MOVED WELL
INLAND.  THIS WILL RESULT IN COOLER TEMPS FOR MOST OF OUR REGION TDA 
ALTHOUGH SOME SPOTS WITH SOUTHERLY EXPOSURE TO THE OCEAN SUCH AS
SANTA ROSA...NAPA...AND SANTA CRUZ WILL NOT SEE MUCH TEMP CHANGE FROM
THEIR CHILLY READINGS ON SATURDAY.  EXPECT LOW CLOUDS TO CLEAR OVER
MOST INTERIOR AREAS TDA BUT NOT ALONG THE COAST AS THE ONSHORE FLOW
WILL REMAIN MODERATELY STRONG.  THE CRUD SHOULD MOVE WELL INLAND TNGT
AS THE ONSHORE FLOW CONTINUES AHEAD OF THE ONCOMING UPPER LEVEL TROF
AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT.  THIS FRONT IS DRY AT OUR LATITUDE AND

MON MRNG.  HOWEVER...THE MODELS ARE FCSTG STRONG COLD ADVECTION
BEHIND THE FRONT ON MON...WITH 850 MB TEMPS DROPPING ABOUT 10 DEGREES

INLAND INTO AREAS WITH SOUTHERN EXPOSURE TO THE OCEAN. SUBSIDENCE
OFFSHORE RESULTED IN DEVELOPMENT OF A LARGE STRATUS FIELD WELL OUT
OVER THE OCEAN. A MESO LOW...WHICH FORMED OFF THE CENTRAL CA COAST
THIS AFTERNOON...WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SLY SURGE AND ALSO PRODUCED
SOME RATHER STRONG...GUSTY SOUTHERLY WINDS. LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND

TO 32 MPH AT THE NAPA AIRPORT. THE LATEST ETA INDICATES A SOUTHERLY
FLOW WILL CONTINUE ALONG AND NEAR THE COAST THRU MIDDAY
SUNDAY...ALTHOUGH THE MAGNITUDE SHOULD EASE SOMEWHAT. THIS CONTINUED
SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL RESULT IN SOMEWHAT UNCONVENTIONAL MARINE LAYER
CLOUD COVER PATTERNS. LOW CLOUDS ALREADY COVER MOST OF THE N BAY

AREAS WILL CLOUD OVER. INVERSION SHOULD BECOME WELL ESTABLISHED
OVERNIGHT AS UPPER LOW OVER SWRN UTAH MOVES EAST...ALLOWING A WEAK
SHORTWAVE RIDGE TO BUILD OVER OUR AREA. BASED ON EXTENT OF INLAND
PENETRATION OF STRATUS SO FAR...IT LOOKS AS THOUGH MARINE LAYER IS
QUITE DEEP. WITH A DEEP MARINE LAYER...STRENGTHENING INVERSION AND
ONSHORE FLOW...EXPECT RATHER SLOW CLEARING OF LOW CLOUDS ON SUNDAY.
BY LATE SUNDAY...WEAK IMPULSE FROM TROF CURRENTLY ALONG 150W MOVES
INTO NW CA...FLATTENS RIDGE AND LIKELY DEEPENS MARINE LAYER FURTHER.

OFFSHORE FLOW IS CONTINUING OVER OUR FCST AREA THIS AFTN WITH TEMPS
RUNNING AHEAD OF YDA AND BRISK N WINDS CONTINUING THROUGHOUT THE BAY

WITH THE NWD MOVEMENT OF THE SOCAL CUTOFF AND THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE
LOW SUFFICIENTLY SLOW TO KEEP A NE-SW SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT GOING
INTO SAT MRNG OVER OUR FCST AREA.  THE STRENGTH OF THE CURRENT WINDS
WOULD TESTIFY IN FAVOR OF THIS SOLUTION.  AS A RESULT...WILL TAKE LOW
CLOUDS OUT OF FCSTS TNGT.  

HOWEVER...THE PATTERN WILL CHANGE IN TIME.  MAYBE THE FIRST
INDICATION OF THIS IS THE RECENT WIND SHIFT FROM NW TO SW AT SAN LUIS

NWD ON SAT AS THE CUTOFF AND SURFACE LOWS MOVE N THRU THE GREAT

TO SLY WINDS OFF THE WATER SUCH AS SANTA CRUZ AND SANTA ROSA.  

THE ONSHORE FLOW IS FCST TO INCREASE SAT NGT/SUN AND BECOME MORE WLY
IN ASSOCIATION WITH BACKING OF THE WINDS ALOFT INTO THAT DIRECTION.

A CLEAR NIGHT...WITH A PRONOUNCED OFFSHORE FLOW PATTERN AND NO
COASTAL ST/FOG IN SIGHT...YET. WINDS HAVE DECREASED OVERNIGHT ALONG
THE COAST...BUT INCREASED INLAND AROUND SFO BAY AND ESPECIALLY IN 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AS THEY CHANNEL THROUGH THE SAC RIVER DELTA
GAP. THESE STRONGER WINDS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE AM HOURS BEFORE
DECREASING IN THE PM AS A SURFACE LOW WORKS ITS WAY NWD INTO CENTRAL
CA. A CLASSIC SLY SURGE IS A GOOD POSSIBILITY FRI NITE/SAT AM AS THE
LOW MOVES INTO NRN CA. THIS WOULD MEAN A RIBBON OF ST/FOG MOVING 
NWD ALONG THE S CENTRAL COAST TOWARDS MRY BAY EARLY SAT AM...AND
CONTINUING NWD THROUGH THE DAY. THIS INCREASING MARINE LAYER WOULD
ALSO HAVE THE EFFECT OF COOLING TEMPS NEAR THE COAST ON SAT COMPARED
TO TODAY...BUT INLAND TEMPS WOULD LIKELY BE ABOUT THE SAME. THE COAST
SHOULD SEE MORE LOW CLOUDS SAT NIGHT AND SUN AM AHEAD OF ANOTHER COLD
FRONT APPROACHING THE NW CA COAST. ALL MODELS AGREE THAT THIS FRONT
WILL BE MUCH WETTER THAN THE PAST SEVERAL FRONTS AS IT COMES WITH AN
UNUSUALLY COLD NEGATIVELY TILTED TROF. EXPECT THIS SYSTEM TO BRING
PRECIP TO CENTRAL CA SUN NIGHT/MON...WITH SNOW LEVELS DROPPING TO
AROUND 3000FT BEFORE PRECIP ENDS MON EVENING. TUE AND WED AM TEMPS
COULD BE NEAR FREEEEZING IN THE UNPROTECTED VALLEYS PER MRF. NOGAPS

CLEAR SKIES EVIDENT FROM OBSERVATIONS AND SATELLITE THIS EVENING..
NO BIG SURPRISES LIKE LAST NIGHT/S LOW CLOUD COVER. AND...WITH WINDS
ON THE DECREASE...A PLEASANT-COOL SPRING NIGHT AHEAD. FRI AND SAT
ALSO LOOK GOOD WITH WINDS GRADUALLY DECREASING AND DAYTIME
TEMPERATURES NEAR SEASONAL NORMALS - MOSTLY IN THE 70S. CENTRAL
COASTAL WEATHER STILL GOVERNED BY HUGE UPPER LOW SETTLING SWD OVER
SRN NV. BACKWASH-NLY FLOW AROUND THE WRN PERIPHERY OF THIS SYSTEM
WITH MODELS INDICATING CONSIDERABLE CHANNELED VORTICITY IS MAINLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WINDY CONDITIONS OF TODAY...ALONG WITH A
CORRESPONDING STRONG SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN A HIGH ABOUT

EXPECTED. NEW MODELS KEEP LOW OVER NV THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...

MID/HIGH CLOUDS AT TIMES IN THIS WRAP AROUND FLOW PATTERN.

GREAT BASIN LOW WILL FINALLY GET KICKED EWD ON SUN...JUST IN TIME FOR
ANOTHER...POSSIBLY VIGOROUS SHORTWAVE TROF SEEN IN SEVERAL MEDIUM
RANGE MODELS MOVING INTO E PACIFIC EARLY NEXT WEEK. THESE MODELS
DIFFER SOMEWHAT IN TIMING AND INTENSITY...BUT ARE REASONABLY CLOSE IN
BRINGING INTO CENTRAL CA A FAST MOVING NEGATIVELY TILTED SHORTWAVE

MOVES OVER THE AREA...WOULD BE THE FIRST PRECIP FOR CENTRAL COAST

TRENDS SUGGESTED MOSTLY CLEAR AND BREEZY CONDITIONS. HOWEVER...WINDS
EARLIER PICKED UP A LITTLE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED...GUSTS TO OVER 40
MPH AT SFO/SQL AIRPORTS AND IN THE SF CITY ACCORDING TO REPORTS.
AT LEAST THESE STRONGER WINDS ONLY LASTED A FEW HOURS DURING THE LATE
AFTERNOON BEFORE SUBSIDING TO THE EXPECTED...BREEZY RANGE. 

THE OTHER UNEXPECTED CHANGE SEEN DURING THE EVENING IS THE LARGE
INCREASE IN LOW CLOUDS...BOTH ALONG THE COAST AND IN NUMEROUS AREAS
INLAND. THIS LOWER...SC TYPE CLOUD COVER...NOT THE USUAL MARINE ST
TYPE CLOUDS...WAS EXPECTED TO REMAIN OVER THE OCEAN WITH JUST A FEW
PATCHES REMAINING ALONG THE COAST. HOWEVER...AREA NOW COVERS THE
OCEAN AREAS AND CONTINUES TO INCREASE INLAND. SATELLITE LOOP SHOWS A
LOW LEVEL VORTMAX DROPING SWD ALONG THE NRN CA COAST AT THIS TIME...
NEAR 40/127...FORECAST IN NEW ETA TO CONTINUE SWD ALONG THE COAST
OVERNIGHT. THIS IS SEEN AS A CHANNELED VORTICITY PATTERN IN NEW MODEL
RUNS...DROPING SWD ALONG COAST. THEREFORE...GRADUALLY LATER
TONIGHT...THIS LOW CLOUD COVER SHOULD DECREASE...WITH PARTLY CLOUDY
CONDITIONS RETURNING TO THE AREA.

UPPER LOW OVER ID WITH A WELL DEFINED VORTMAX NEAR ASTORIA HEADING

THAT OF A SMALL SLIVER IN THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE MONTEREY BAY.
WHILE IT IS TEMPTING TO RULE OUT STRATUS ALTOGETHER TONIGHT...THERE
SEEM TO BE SEVERAL CONTRAINDICATIONS. FIRST THE HEAT TROUGH IS WELL
INLAND AND BOTH THE OAKLAND SOUNDING AND THE FORT ORD PROFILER SHOW
ONSHORE WINDS. SECOND DEWPOINTS IN AREAS THAT WERE ORIGINALLY
FORECAST TO SEE AREAS OF STRATUS ARE BETWEEN 9 AND 13 DEGREES...WHICH

STRATUS WILL FORM LATE AND BURN OFF RATHER EARLY IN AREAS NORTH OF
THE MONTEREY BAY. CURRENTLY THE DEWPOINT AT PASO ROBLES IS 0 DEG C
AND THEY HAVE A SOUTH WIND. IT IS LIKELY THAT DRAINAGE WINDS WILL SET
UP IN THE SALINAS VALLEY TONIGHT AND KEEP STRATUS OUT OF ALL BUT

IN THE LONGER TERM...THE LATEST MODELS KEEP THE MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES

ENJOYED A FINE TOASTY DAY...THE NICEST ONE IN A LONG TIME.  IN FACT
...TODAYS HIGH OF 85 IN MONTEREY MADE IT THE WARMEST DAY HERE SINCE
NOV 2 1997...ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF AGO  FOR THE RECORD IT WAS 91
BACK ON THAT DATE...IN THE MIDDLE OF EL NINO WHEN THE OCEAN WAS WARM.

NOW THE FCST PROBLEM IS THE UPCOMING COOLING TREND AND RETURN OF THE
COASTAL CRUD.  THERE IS NONE AROUND AT THIS TIME...AND AS OF 8 PM
TEMPS WERE GENERALLY NEAR OR ABOVE THE LEVELS OF 24 HOURS AGO...WITH
WESTERLY WINDS A BIT LIGHTER AT SPOTS LIKE SFO AND ANGEL ISLAND. 
THE SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN IS FCST TO REMAIN WEAKLY OFFSHORE
OVERNIGHT.  THESE ARE GOOD INDICATIONS THAT OUR REGION WILL REMAIN
FREE OF FOG/STRATUS ALL NIGHT...AND THAT TEMPS WILL PROBABLY RISE
QUICKLY AGAIN FRI MRNG BEFORE A MORE DEFINITIVE ONSHORE FLOW BEGINS
EARLY FRI AFTN...TOPPING COASTAL TEMPS A LITTLE BELOW TODAYS MAXES
AND BRINGING THE FOG BACK IN LATE FRI AFTN THRU THE EVENING.  WILL
UPDATE FCSTS TO GO WITH THIS SCENARIO...A FAIRLY COMMON ONE IN THIS
WEATHER PATTERN.

A POSSIBLE GLITCH IN THIS IS THE BAND OF HIGH CLOUDS CURRENTLY MOVING
ONSHORE. THERE DOESNT APPEAR TO BE ANY INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BAND...BUT IT IS WELL DEFINED WITH A FAIRLY
DISTINCT BACK EDGE...THE NEW ETA DOES HAVE A VORT MAX ASSOCIATED WITH
THE FEATURE...AND IT WOULD NOT BE A BIG SHOCK TO SEE A STRATUS FIELD
MATERIALIZE BEHIND THIS HIGH CLOUD BAND AND RACE ASHORE ON FRI.  IF
THIS HAPPENS EARLY IN THE MRNG...WE COULD SEE COASTAL TEMPS 20
DEGREES COOLER THAN TDA WITH LOTS OF STRATUS ALL DAY.  HOWEVER...THE
ETA DOESNT MOVE THE SHORT WAVE ONSHORE UNTIL AROUND MIDDAY FRI...SO
ITS LIKELY THE STRONG MARINE INFLUX WILL BE DELAYED TIL FRI AFTN.  WE
COULD SPECULATE ON THE POSSIBILITIES FOR A LONG TIME BUT LETS JUST
SAY THAT A MARKED COOLING TREND WILL BE UNDERWAY BY LATE FRI...WITH
TEMPS RETURNING TO NORMAL FOR THE WEEKEND WITH FAIRLY EXTENSIVE
NIGHT/MRNG STRATUS.

AFTER THE WEEKEND...THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS SPLIT UP AS USUAL.  THE
MRF AND UK BRING ANOTHER STRONG...COLD TROF INTO CA FROM THE NW.  UK
IS FASTER...MOVING THE TROF AXIS TO OUR COAST BY 12Z TUE WHILE THE
MRF DELAYS IT UNTIL 00Z WED.  THE EURO AND ESPECIALLY THE NOGAPS AND
CANADIAN MODELS ARE MUCH WEAKER...FASTER...AND FARTHER N WITH THIS
TROF AND FCST IT TO HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON CA.  GIVEN THE TRACK RECORD
OF THIS SPRING...WITH ONE COLD TROF AFTER ANOTHER SWEEPING INTO CA
FROM THE NW...HAD TO GO WITH THE MINORITY OPINION AND FCST STRONG
COOLING ACROSS NRN/CNTRL CA ON TUE WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN THE N.

A WARM - SUNNY AFTERNOON OVER THE CENTRAL COAST...AND ALMOST ALL OF

RECORD HIGHS FOR THIS DATE TIED/BROKEN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. 
TODAY IS LIKELY TO BE THE ZENITH OF THIS WARM SPELL...HOWEVER. MODEL
DATA TODAY AND OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS HAS INDICATED THE
BEGINNINGS OF A COOLING TREND WITH AN INCREASED ONSHORE FLOW PATTERN.
EARLIER INDICATIONS WERE OF A STRONGER MARINE INFLUX BEGINNING
TONIGHT. HOWEVER...APPEARS AT THIS TIME THAT THE PROCESS WILL BE
SLOWER. WE STILL HAVE A MODERATE TO STRONG OFFSHORE FLOW PATTERN...
SURFACE GRADIENTS ABOUT 1 MB OFFSHORE SAC-SFO AND ABOUT 1 MB NLY
SFO-SBA AND E SF BAY HILL WINDS ARE STILL BLOWING STRONGLY FROM THE
E. IN TIME...THE APPROACH OF A WEAK TROF JUST W 130W AND A STRONGER -
COLDER TROF NEAR 148W WILL START A COOLING TREND. 

EXPECT PATCHY LOW CLOUDS/FOG TO DEVELOP AT THE COAST LATE TONIGHT...
INSTEAD OF THE CLEAR CONDITIONS OF LAST NIGHT. THEREFORE...COASTAL
SECTIONS SHOULD COOL 5-10 DEGREES ON FRI BUT LACK OF A GOOD INLAND
PUSH WILL ALLOW ONLY ABOUT 3-5 DEGREES OF COOLING AWAY FROM THE
OCEAN. BY SAT WITH THE UPPER TROF PARKED ALONG THE NRN CA COAST...A
STRONGER ONSHORE SURFACE GRADIENT WILL SET UP FOR MUCH COOLER INLAND
AREAS AS WELL AS COAST. TROF IS FORECAST TO REMAIN AROUND THE PACIFIC

AS SURFACE HIGH PRES CONTINUES TO BUILD OVER THE GREAT BASIN. SFO-WMC

WARMING. 850 MB TEMPS ARE FORECAST TO INCREASE BY A COUPLE OF DEGREES

FORECAST ISSUE IS TEMPS NEAR THE COAST TODAY. NEUTRAL TO WEAK
OFFSHORE FLOW THRU MIDDAY ALONG WITH SHALLOW INVERSION SHOULD MEAN A
RAPID WARMUP. BUT EVEN A WEAK SEABREEZE THIS AFTERNOON WILL BRING
WARMUP TO A QUICK HALT NEAR THE COAST. ETA SEEMS TO HAVE THE BEST

FORT ORD PROFILER NOW SHOWS THAT THE MARINE LAYER HAS BEEN SQUASHED
SUBSTANTIALLY AND IS ONLY ABOUT 1000 FEET DEEP...DOWN FROM CLOSE TO
2500 FEET AT THIS TIME YDA.  RAWS OBS IN THE E BAY HILLS SHOW TEMPS
AROUND 60 IN THE 1000-2000 FOOT ELEV RANGE...BUT ONLY LIGHT WINDS. 
WE HAVE A FLAT PRESSURE PATTERN AT THE MOMENT.  THERE IS A WEAK
OFFSHORE GRADIENT FROM THE GREAT BASIN TO THE COAST BUT ITS STILL
SLIGHTLY ONSHORE FROM THE COAST TO THE CNTRL VALLEY.  EXPECT SOME
WARMING IN ALL AREAS TDA...AND THE CRUD SHOULD CLEAR FROM THE CNTRL
COAST AND SALINAS VALLEY BY MIDDAY.  HOWEVER...EXPECT THE SEABREEZE
TO RETURN THIS AFTN SO COASTAL AREAS WILL STILL BE MOSTLY IN THE 60S. 
THE BEST PERIOD FOR OFFSHORE FLOW APPEARS TO BE LATE TNGT/THU MRNG
WHEN ALL MODELS MOVE THE SURFACE THERMAL TROF OFF THE COAST AS HIGH
PRESSURE DRIVES SEWD THRU THE INTERMOUNTAIN REGION.  THE ETA/AVN
IMPLY A FLAT PRESSURE PATTERN THU AFTN WITH A WEAK SEABREEZE...BUT
STILL EXPECT THE COASTAL AREAS TO REACH THE 70S BEFORE THE WIND KICKS
UP.  THE NGM FCSTS A STRONGER OFFSHORE PATTERN THAN THE OTHER MODELS
BUT IT TENDS TO HAVE A BIAS TOWARD FCSTG THE PRESSURE TOO HIGH IN THE
GREAT BASIN...AND INDEED THE OBS FROM WINNEMUCCA SHOW PRESSURES MORE
ALONG THE LINES OF THE ETA THAN THE NGM.  SO...USED THE ETA/AVN FOR
THE FCST AND WENT WITH COOLER COASTAL MAXES ON THU THAN THE NGM MOS. 
WE SHOULD SEE SOME MODERATE NE WINDS DEVELOP IN THE E BAY HILLS
TNGT/THU BUT WITH ONLY WEAK UPPER SUPPORT THEY SHOULDNT GET MUCH
STRONGER THAN 25 MPH OR SO.

IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...FRI WILL BE ANOTHER DAY OF SEABREEZE
ROULETTE ALONG THE COAST.  THE AVN FCSTS A LOW LEVEL SELY FLOW FRI
MRNG WHICH MAY AID IN A SOUTHERLY SURGE OF STRATUS UP THE CNTRL COAST
WHICH WOULD BRING STRONG COOLING TO PLACES LIKE SANTA CRUZ.  INLAND
THE AIRMASS WILL CHANGE LITTLE AND IT SHOULD BE ANOTHER WARM DAY. 
THE SHORT WAVE DUE ONSHORE SAT IS NOW FCST TO BE VERY WEAK BY 4 OF
OUR 5 MEDIUM RANGE MODELS...ONLY THE UK PREDICTS IT TO HAVE ENOUGH
PUNCH TO GENERATE SHWRS IN NWRN CA.  THE OTHER MODELS SIMPLY INCREASE
THE ONSHORE FLOW AND DUE TO THE STRENGTH OF OUR RIDGE...WILL GO WITH
THIS CONSENSUS...BRINGING BACK MORE EXTENSIVE COASTAL STRATUS FOR
THE WEEKEND WITH TEMPS DROPPING TO AROUND NORMAL.

ONE DEVELOPMENT TO WATCH IS THAT THE LAST 3 RUNS OF THE MRF HAVE
DEVELOPED A COLD CYCLONIC NWLY FLOW OVER CA BY NEXT WED...APRIL 21. 
THE POSITION OF THE FCST CUTOFF HAS SHIFTED FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN
VALLEY TO SRN IDAHO FROM RUN 1 TO RUN 3...BUT ALL THE RUNS HAVE

LATEST IR FOG PRODUCT IMAGES SHOW MARINE STRATUS PERSISTING ALONG
COAST SOUTH OF SAN FRANCISCO.  ALTHOUGH PRESENTLY EXTENDING WELL INTO
THE NORTHERN SALINAS VALLEY...ELSEWHERE IN OUR CWA INLAND PENETRATION
IS LESS THAN AT THIS TIME LAST NIGHT.  OTHER BIG CHANGE IS DECREASED
DEPTH OF MARINE LAYER.  FT ORD PROFILER SHOWS TOP OF MARINE LAYER AT
02Z NEAR 350 METERS COMPARED TO 600 METERS 24 HRS AGO.  THIS IS
REFLECTED IN THE LOWER CEILINGS AND VISIBILITIES AT MRY AND SNS. 
MIDNIGHT SHIFT MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER ISSUANCE OF DENSE FOG ADVISORY
DURING EARLY AM HOURS MRY BAY AREA AND VICINITY HIGHWAY 1 SOUTH OF
SAN FRANCISCO...AND PERHAPS IN THE SFO BAY AREA ITSELF WHERE PATCHES
OF FOG/STRATUS DEVELOP.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT QUESTION IN SHORT TERM IS HOW MUCH WARMING WILL
OCCUR.  HIGH TEMPERATURES TUESDAY IN OUR CWA WERE GENERALLY A FEW
DEGREES WARMER THAN MONDAY.  CONSISTENT WITH THE PAST SEVERAL MODEL
RUNS...00Z NGM FORECASTS FASTER AND STRONGER DEVELOPMENT OF LOW LEVEL
OFFSHORE FLOW THAN 00Z ETA.  IN FACT...EVEN BY 06Z NGM PREDICTS
STRONG NE WINDS OVER MUCH OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHILE ETA SHOWS MUCH
LIGHTER N TO NW FLOW.  AS THE LATTER APPEARS MUCH MORE CONSISTENT
WITH LATEST SURFACE OBSERVATIONS...AND AS NGM HAS BEEN OVERDEVELOPING
NEAR TERM OFFSHORE FLOW IN PREVIOUS RUNS...WILL GO WITH ETA.  ETA
KEEPS SURFACE TROUGH ONSHORE THROUGH WEDNESDAY...THOUGH BRINGS IT
CLOSER TO THE COAST...AND THEN BRIEFLY OFFSHORE EARLY THURSDAY BEFORE
SHIFTING IT BACK ONSHORE AGAIN BY AFTERNOON AS APPROACHING UPPER
TROUGH GETS CLOSER.  THIS SUGGESTS COASTAL TEMPS WILL PEAK LATE
THURSDAY MORNING WHILE INTERIOR TEMPS CONTINUE TO WARM.

BY FRIDAY EXPECT MARINE STRATUS TO INCREASE IN DEPTH AND COVERAGE.

LOW CLOUDS CLEARING FROM N TO S ALONG THE COAST...SIMILAR TO MONDAY
AFTERNOON. UNLIKE LAST NIGHT...WHEN LOW CLOUDS AND FOG REFORMED
ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA...MOST PLACES SHOULD REMAIN CLEAR TONIGHT FOR
TWO REASONS. FIRST...SURFACE HIGH WILL BUILD OVER THE GREAT BASIN
OVERNIGHT SETTING UP A WEAK SURFACE TROF ALONG THE COAST AND A
NEUTRAL OR WEAKLY OFFSHORE FLOW. SECOND...MARINE INVERSION IS
BECOMING MORE SHALLOW AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ALOFT. FT ORD PROFILER
SHOWS A 200 M DECREASE IN HEIGHT OF INVERSION OVER PAST 10 HOURS. SO
ANY REMAINING FOG AT THE COAST SHOULD BE TOO SHALLOW TO MOVE MORE
THAN LOCALLY INLAND. WITH A SHALLOW INVERSION...WARMER AIRMASS AND
LESS LOW CLOUD TO BURN OFF TOMORROW...TEMPS SHOULD WARM NEARLY
EVERYWHERE AND WE COULD SEE 70 AT THE COAST AND A FEW 80 DEGREE
READINGS WELL INLAND. MODELS MOVE THE SURFACE TROF OFFSHORE WED NIGHT
INTO THURS MORNING AND EVEN THOUGH UPPER RIDGE BEGINS TO WEAKEN BY
THURS...STRONGER OFFSHORE FLOW SHOULD MEAN EVEN MORE WARMING. ONLY
PROBLEM WITH THIS SCENARIO IS IF GULF OF ALASKA SYSTEM NUDGES OUR
UPPER RIDGE FAR ENOUGH EAST BY THURSDAY TO LEAD TO A QUICK INLAND
SHIFT OF THE THERMAL TROF AT THE SURFACE AND A RETURN OF THE ONSHORE
FLOW. MODELS INDICATE PATTERN WILL BE SLOW TO CHANGE AND THUS WILL
CONTINUE WARMING TREND THRU THURSDAY AND NOT BRING ANY FOG BACK TO
THE COAST UNTIL PERHAPS THURS NIGHT.

MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ALL BRING A WEAK SYSTEM INTO THE PAC NW FRI INTO
SAT. RIDGE LOOKS TO BE STRONG ENOUGH SO THAT THE ONLY RISK OF RAIN
WILL BE IN THE FAR N. MAIN IMPACT ON OUR AREA WILL BE AN INCREASE IN
ONSHORE FLOW AND A COOLING TREND...ESPECIALLY NEAR THE COAST.

THIS HAS RESULTED IN WIDESPREAD STRATUS S OF SFO...WHILE SKIES ARE 
MOSTLY CLEAR N OF THE CITY IN OUR FCST AREA.  FORT ORD PROFILER SHOWS
A STRONG MARINE INVERSION HAS QUICKLY DEVELOPED OVERNIGHT...AROUND
2500 FEET DEEP.  THIS WILL LIMIT WARMING ON THE COAST S OF SFO TO A
FEW DEGREES AT MOST TDA...BUT WITH THE AIRMASS WARMING ALOFT INLAND
AREAS IN THE N AND E BAY SHOULD SEE MORE WARMING THAN THAT.  

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS BUILDING STRONGLY INTO THE PACIFIC NW IN THE
WAKE OF YESTERDAYS SHORT WAVE.  BY TNGT THIS HIGH WILL MOVE INTO THE

BY THE SAME TIME.  EITHER WAY...THE LONG ADVERTISED WARMING/DRYING
TREND WILL BECOME REALITY OVER OUR FCST AREA DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL
DAYS.  850 MB TEMPS ARE FCST TO RISE ABOUT 10 DEGREES C OVER THE NEXT
TWO DAYS IN THE BAY AREA...WHICH SHOULD TRANSLATE TO MAXES ABOUT 20
DEGREES F HIGHER OVER INLAND AREAS BY TUE AFTN.  WE PROBABLY WONT SEE
AS MUCH WARMING ALONG THE COAST AS A WEAK/MODERATE ONSHORE FLOW IS
FCST TO CONTINUE...BUT EVEN COASTAL AREAS SHOULD APPROACH 70 ON TUE. 
WITH THE ONSHORE FLOW AND WARMING ALOFT A MARINE INVERSION WILL
DEVELOP AND CANT RULE OUT SOME NIGHT/MRNG COASTAL FOG.  

MEDIUM RANGE MODELS INDICATE THE WARMEST DAY IN OUR FCST AREA SHOULD
BE WED...WHEN 850 MB TEMPS PEAK AND THE ONSHORE FLOW IS WEAKEST.  THE
RIDGE WILL BASICALLY HOLD OVER CA AT LEAST THRU FRI...BUT ON THAT DAY
A WEAK SHORT WAVE WILL PASS OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE AND INCREASE
THE ONSHORE FLOW AGAIN...RESULTING IN COOLING ESPECIALLY IN COASTAL
AREAS.  STILL...THE NEXT 5 DAYS WILL BRING THE BEST WEATHER SO FAR
THIS SPRING.  POPS ZERO.  MARKKANEN

BAY BY AFTERNOON. LIKELY TO SEE DAYTIME TEMPERATURES RISE INTO THE
LOW 70S AT THAT TIME. AREA TO THE S IS MORE QUESTIONABLE THOUGH. AS
WITH UPPER LOW THAT MOVED ACROSS SRN CA ABOUT A WEEK AGO...
CONSIDERABLE WRAP AROUND MOISTURE REMAINED OVER THE SRN PORTION OF

WARM ADVECTION AND 00Z OAKLAND SOUNDING CONCURS...SHOWING VEERING
WINDS BETWEEN 5 AND 15 THOUSAND FEET. RADAR INDICATES BACK EDGE OF
WARM FRONTAL BAND IS MOVING SLOWLY OUT OF THE AREA. EXPECT ONLY
SCATTERED LIGHT...MOSTLY OROGRAPHIC...SHOWERS UNTIL COLD FRONT
ARRIVES LATER THIS EVENING. BASED ON SATELLITE AND MODEL DATA...COLD
FRONT WILL PUSH SE ACROSS THE BAY AREA OVERNIGHT AND RAIN RATES WILL
PICK UP JUST AHEAD AND WITH THE FRONT. SATELLITE SHOWS SOME
ENHANCEMENT JUST OFFSHORE FROM PT ARENA TO PT REYES AND BELIEVE THIS
IS WHERE COLD FRONT LIES...ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS RATHER DISORGANIZED.
THUNDERSTORMS A POSSIBILITY TOMORROW AS COLD AIR ALOFT SLIDES SE
ALONG COAST. CURRENT TRAJECTORY OF UPPER LOW WILL KEEP COLDEST AIR
ALOFT OFFSHORE...PROBABLY FURTHER W THAN MODELS HAVE FORECAST...WHICH
HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH SEVERAL RECENT COLD SYSTEMS THAT HAVE COME
THROUGH. ALSO...00Z ETA IS FORECASTING 30 M HIGHER THICKNESS VALUES
SUNDAY AFTERNOON THAN 12Z RUN. THIS WOULD MEAN HIGHER SNOW LEVELS AND
LOWER THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL. HOWEVER...UPPER LOW SHOULD BE CLOSE
ENOUGH TO THE COAST AND ENOUGH SURFACE HEATING SHOULD OCCUR FOR AT
LEAST A RISK OF CONVECTION. WITH SIMILAR SYSTEMS LATELY...PRECIP HAS
BEEN SLOW TO END...EVEN AFTER UPPER LOW IS WELL SOUTH OF AREA. SO
EXPECT WRAP AROUND RESIDUAL SHOWERS TO CONTINUE INTO EARLY MONDAY
MORNING FOR THE SRN PORTION OF FORECAST AREA. SHORTWAVE MOVING

BETWEEN MODELS. AVN MODEL SHOWS PRECIP OVER THE ENTIRE CENTRAL COAST
BY SAT AFTERNOON WHILE THE ETA/NOGAPS ARE SLOWER KEEPING MAIN PRECIP
BAND IN THE N SF BAY UNTIL EVENING HOURS. WILL HEDGE TOWARDS A LITTLE
TOWARD ETA...SLOWING THE SYSTEM A FEW HOURS FROM EARLIER...BUT
KEEPING IN MIND THAT PAST COUPLE OF THESE SYSTEMS HAVE MOVED VERY
RAPIDLY THROUGH THE AREA. SYSTEM IS A MODERATELY STRONG WINTER-LIKE
SYSTEM WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR MODERATE PRECIP OVER THE AREA SAT
AFTERNOON/EVENING BUT DOES NOT APPEAR NEARLY AS COLD/STRONG AS PAST
ONE...PROBABLY CLOSER TO PREVIOUS SYSTEM THAT MOVED OVER THE AREA ON
MON. SNOW LEVELS IN THE SF BAY AREA ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE 2500 TO
3000 FOOT RANGE...ABOUT 1500 FEET HIGHER THAN YESTERDAY.

AVN AND MEDIUM RANGE MODELS SAG TROF SWD ALONG SRN CA COAST THEN CUT
IT OFF AS A 537 DM OR SO H5 LOW. THIS DEEP UPPER LOW WILL LIKELY HANG
OVER SRN CA FOR A FEW DAYS...WITHOUT ANY SYSTEMS IN THE MAIN
WESTERLIES TO KICK IT OUT. THUS... WILL NEED TO KEEP MENTION OF
SHOWERS IN THE SRN PORTION OF DISTRICT...TUE MORNING. AT THAT
TIME...LOW AND ASSOCIATED WRAP AROUND MOISTURE SHOULD BE SHIFTED FAR
ENOUGH EWD TO CLEAR CLOUDS/SHOWERS FROM SRN SIERRA. NEW MRF AND EURO
MODELS SHOW A MAJOR UPPER RIDGE DEVELOPING E PACIFIC TUE-THU. NOGAPS
IS NOT QUITE AS STRONG BUT STILL SHOWS SOME RIDGING. IF THESE MODELS
ARE CORRECT AND BEING AN OPTIMIST...WILL PREDICT THE FIRST 80S OF THE
SEASON FOR WED IN THE WARMER SF BAY LOCATIONS. AND...IF PATTERN HOLDS
FOR A FEW DAYS...MAY SEE A 90 WELL INLAND FROM THE COAST ON THU.

COLD SHOWERS ARE CONTINUING TO MOVE ONSHORE THIS EVE...WITH MANY
REPORTS OF HAIL.  LOW LEVEL WINDS ARE GRADUALLY VEERING...AND BY 12Z
THEY SHOULD BE PARALLEL TO THE COAST.  THIS WILL KEEP MOST SURVIVING
SHOWERS OFFSHORE.  CURRENT FCSTS LOOK GOOD WITH A GRADUAL DRYING
TREND TNGT/FRI MRNG.  TEMPS WILL BE QUITE COLD TNGT BUT A COMBINATION
OF SOME CLOUDS AND WIND SHOULD PRECLUDE FROST IN MOST AREAS... 
SHELTERED VALLEYS IN THE N AND E BAY COULD SEE SOME BUT THATS ABOUT
ALL.  WE SHOULD SEE A CRISP...MOSTLY SUNNY DAY IN OUR REGION ON FRI
WITH MODERATE NWLY WINDS.  850 MB TEMPS DONT REALLY WARM UP MUCH... 
ONLY A COUPLE DEGREES C...SO MAX TEMPS WILL STILL BE WELL BELOW
NORMAL.  

THE NEXT TROF IS TAKING SHAPE IN THE GULF OF ALASKA.  ITS
BAROCLINICITY WILL BE LIMITED AS IT WILL MOVE INTO AN ALREADY CHILLY
AIRMASS OVER CA ON SAT...BUT THAT DIDNT REALLY STOP OUR CURRENT
SYSTEM FROM PRODUCING A GOOD SHOT OF RAIN AND THE WEEKEND STORM WILL
PROBABLY DO LIKEWISE.  THE BULK OF THE RAIN FOR OUR AREA LOOKS LIKE
IT WILL OCCUR SAT PM/SUN AM BEFORE THE STORM MOVES OUT OF OUR AREA
TO THE S OR SE.  ALL MODELS DIFFER ON DETAILS OF THIS SYSTEM.  THE
AVN/MRF WOULD GIVE OUR AREA THE WORST WEATHER...DROPPING A DEEP
CUTOFF TO JUST W OF SFO BY 12Z SUN.  THE UK IS A LITTLE WEAKER AND
TRACKS THE CUTOFF SLIGHTLY FARTHER WWD.  THE NOGAPS AND CANADIAN MOVE
THE SYSTEM THRU FASTER AND WEAKER...AS AN INSIDE SLIDER.  THE EURO
DROPS THE CUTOFF DUE S THRU OUR FCST AREA ON SUN...THEN MOVES IT EWD
INTO SOCAL ON TUE AT THE SAME TIME THE MRF HAS IT OVER SERN CO 
GIVEN THE CURRENT CONTINUING PATTERN OF A MEAN TROF OVER THE W
COAST AND THE CURRENT POSITION AND MOVEMENT OF THE INCOMING SYSTEM... 
USED THE MRF/UK SOLUTION FOR THE EXTENDED FCST.  

ALL MODELS EXCEPT THE EURO IMPLY WE WILL FINALLY SEE A WARM...DRY
RIDGE DEVELOP OVER OUR FCST AREA MON/TUE.  THAT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE
TRUE...MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE USED THE EURO FOR THE EXTENDED.

BRINGING SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WITH SMALL HAIL...MOSTLY PEA
SIZED...TO THE BAY AREA THIS AFTERNOON. SNOW LEVELS WERE AROUND 3500
FEET THIS MORNING WITH THE FRONT SO JUST A DUSTING OF SNOW ON THE BAY
AREAS HIGHEST PEAKS. 1000-500 MB THICKNESSES ARE FORECAST TO LOWER TO
AROUND 525 DM THIS AFTERNOON SO SNOW IS POSSIBLE DOWN TO ABOUT 1000
FEET IN THE SHOWERS BUT THERE WILL BE LITTLE ACCUMULATION. ONCE THIS
TROUGH PASSES THROUGH...THE MODELS FORECAST GOOD NVA SO IF THE TIMING
IS CORRECT THE SHOWERS SHOULD BE JUST ABOUT OVER WITH FRIDAY MORNING.
ONLY A BRIEF RESPITE ON FRIDAY BECAUSE THE NEXT SYSTEM IS EXPECTED ON
SATURDAY. THE AVN MOVES A TROUGH TO THE COAST AND THEN CUTS IT OFF
OFF THE NORTHERN CA COAST LATE SATURDAY IT THEN MOVES SOUTHWARD DOWN
THE COAST BEFORE SWINGING EASTWARD SIMILAR TO THE SYSTEM WE HAD
EARLIER THIS WEEK. THIS CUT OFF LOW WILL PROBABLY MOVE VERY SLOWLY SO

A LOWER LEVEL BAND...AHEAD OF THE MAIN COLD FRONT IS ALREADY MOVING
THROUGH THE SF BAY AREA. A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS ARE OCCURRING WITH THIS
BAND. LOTS OF MARINE LOW CLOUDS ALSO....AHEAD OF FRONT...COVERING
THE ENTIRE COAST S OF PT ARENA AND EXTENDING WELL INLAND. MAIN COLD
FRONT IS SEEN MOVING INTO SONOMA COUNTY EARLY THIS MORNING...ABOUT ON
PREVIOUS FORECAST TREND. LIGHT TO MODERATE PRECIP IS EXPECTED WITH
THIS MAIN PORTION OF FRONT AS IT RACES SWD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
BETWEEN NOW AND AROUND NOON AT THE SRN END OF MONTEREY COUNTY. LOTS
OF COLD AIR SHOWER ACTIVITY BEHIND THE FRONT...VERY IMPRESSIVE AS WE
MOVE INTO THE MIDDLE THIRD OF APRIL...MODEL SHOWS MINUS 6 DEG C H8
ISOTHERM OVER ALL BUT THE SRN END OF THE FORECAST AREA.  THIS
INDICATES  LITTLE CHANGE IN FORECAST SNOW LEVELS COMPARED TO EARLIER
MODEL RUNS. THIS WILL DROP THE SNOW LEVEL DOWN TO AROUND 1000
FEET...OR POSSIBLY A LITTLE LOWER IN HEAVIER SHOWERS IN THE N SF BAY
AREA LATER TODAY AND OVERNIGHT...AROUND 1000 TO 1500 FEET ELSEWHERE.
THIS WOULD PRODUCE SOME LIGHT SNOWFALL IN THE COASTAL RANGE...SKYLINE
DRIVE AND HIGHWAY 17 FOR EXAMPLE... BY THIS AFTERNOON EXTENDING INTO
TONIGHT. ALSO...A GOOD CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS AND SMALL HAIL IN THE
COLD - UNSTABLE AIRMASS BEHIND THE FRONT. 

...IN THE WAY OF WEATHER TRIVIA...THE RECORD LOW MAXIMUM FOR SAN
FRANCISCO FOR AN APR 8 IS 52...FORECAST FOR SAN FRANCISCO TODAY IS
53. YESTERDAY/S HIGH IN THE CITY WAS 55 ONLY 4 DEGREES WARMER THAN
THE RECORD LOW MAXIMUM...THE AVERAGE IS 63. IN 1989 ON APR 8...SAN
FRANCISCO HAD A HIGH OF 94.

AS INDICATED...SHOWERS SHOULD JUST ABOUT END BY MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...
POSSIBLY A FEW EARLY MORNING SHOWERS... THEN CLEARING AND ABOUT 5
DEGREES OF WARMING BY FRI AFTERNOON BEFORE ANOTHER...SIMILIAR SYSTEM
DROPS OVER THE AREA ON SAT. 

NEW MRF IS EVEN STRONGER WITH WEEKEND SHORTWAVE TROF THAN EARLIER.
COLD FRONTAL SYSTEM IS STILL TRENDED TO SWOOP DOWN OVER NRN CA SAT
AFTERNOON WITH MORE COLD SHOWERS - LOW SNOW LEVELS SAT NIGHT AND SUN.
MRF IS STRONGER WITH SYSTEM THAN OTHER MODELS ESPECIALLY NOGAPS...AND
MAY BE OVERDONE AS IS OFTEN THE CASE. HOWEVER...STILL APPEARS LIKELY
TO BE A CHILLY - WET WEEKEND AHEAD. THE GOOD NEWS IS...THIS MAY BE
THE LAST OF THESE UNSEASONABLY COLD STORMS...AT LEAST FOR AWHILE.
MRF TRENDS HIGHER H5 HEIGHTS WITH THE STORM TRACK REMAINING OVER FAR
NRN CA OR THE PACIFIC NW THROUGH NEXT WEEK. MODEL HAS BEEN OVERLY
OPTOMISTIC BEFORE BUT NOGAPS AND OTHER MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE

COLD FRONT ABOUT ON SCHEDULE...MOVING STEADILY SEWD TOWARD THE COAST. 
THERE IS NO PRECIP IN OUR AREA YET BUT THINGS SHOULD DEVELOP QUICKLY
AFTER MIDNIGHT.  EXPECT THE FRONT TO MAKE LANDFALL AT SFO NEAR 12Z
THU AND IT WILL RACE THRU THE ENTIRE FCST AREA BY ABOUT 17Z.  THERE
IS A SOLID AREA OF LOW CLOUDS AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND DONT EXPECT MUCH
PREFRONTAL CLEARING.  WE MAY SQUEEZE A FEW SHOWERS OUT OF THE LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE FRONT...BUT MOST PRECIP WILL COME WITH
THE FRONTAL PASSAGE AND THE VAST FIELD OF CELLULAR CLOUDS FOLLOWING
THE FRONT ONSHORE.  THE 700/850 MB OMEGA FIELD FCSTS INDICATE LITTLE
OMEGA REMAINING OVER OUR FCST AREA BY 18Z...BUT THE 950 MB LEVEL
SHOWS OMEGA AND ABUNDANT MOISTURE REMAINING OVER THE FCST AREA ALL
DAY...AND SHOWERS WILL BE WIDESPREAD IN THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND
STRONG ONSHORE FLOW.

THE NEW ETA FCSTS AN 850 MB TEMP OF MINUS 6 DEGREES C OVER OUR AREA
FROM MRY N BY 18Z THU.  THIS WOULD BE ECXCEPTIONALLY COLD FOR
MIDWINTER MUCH LESS APRIL...AND EVEN IF IT WINDS UP BEING A DEGREE OR
TWO TOO COLD...WHICH IS POSSIBLE GIVEN THE MODERATING INFLUENCE OF
THE OCEAN...THE FCST 1000 FOOT SNOW LEVEL IN THE BAY AREA LOOKS
REASONABLE.  UPDATED SPS TO INDICATE POSSIBLE ACCUMULATIONS OF AN
INCH OR TWO IN THE HILLS ABOVE 1500 FEET.  THOUGHT ABOUT ISSUING A
SNOW ADVISORY BUT IT APPEARS MOST PRECIP ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONTAL
PASSAGE WILL BE RAIN BELOW 2500 FEET...BEFORE THE COLDEST AIR ARRIVES
AT MIDDAY...SO SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IN THE HILLS PROBABLY WONT BE
WIDESPREAD.  STILL...WILL HAVE TO WATCH THE SITUATION.  THERE WILL
UNDOUBTEDLY BE AT LEAST A DUSTING AT TIMES OVER HIGHWAY 17 BETWEEN
SAN JOSE AND SANTA CRUZ...AND ON SKYLINE BLVD IN SAN MATEO CY.

LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL PERSIST WELL INTO THU NIGHT SO EXPECT EVENING
SHOWERS...BUT BY MIDNIGHT OR SO THE LOW LEVEL WINDS WILL BE PARALLEL
TO THE COAST...KEEPING MOST SHOWERS OFFSHORE WITH THE NOTABLE
EXCEPTION OF THE MONTEREY PENINSULA...WHICH IS ABOUT THE WETTEST SPOT
AROUND IN A COLD LOW LEVEL NWLY FLOW.  FRI SHOULD BE A BREAK DAY...
AND THEN YET ANOTHER COLD TROF WILL RACE INTO CA ON SAT.  AS USUAL
THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS DIVERGE ON THE OUTLOOK THIS FAR IN ADVANCE...
ESPECIALLY THE EURO WHICH KEEPS THE SYSTEM OFFSHORE...AND THE NOGAPS
WHICH DOES NOT CUT IT OFF AND KEEPS IT WEAK AND MOSTLY TO OUR N.  THE
MRF...UK...AND CANADIAN MODELS ARE IN BETTER AGREEMENT AND GIVEN THE
CONTINUING PATTERN OF THE MEAN W COAST TROF SEE NO REASON TO DISAGREE

MORNING. LOTS OF MID LEVEL CLOUDS ROTATING AROUND N SIDE OF LOW AND
OVER SRN TWO THIRDS OF OUR FORECAST AREA...EVEN A FEW SHOWERS. THESE
CLOUDS AND ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL MOVE TO THE SE TODAY. PRIMARY
CONCERN FOR SHORT TERM IS LOW CLOUD FORMATION AND ADVECTION. PATCHES
OF LOW CLOUDS HAVE ALREADY FORMED IN THE SFO BAY AREA AND LARGE
STRATUS DECK IS LURKING OFFSHORE. AS UPPER LOW MOVES INLAND AND LOW
LEVEL FLOW TURNS MORE ONSHORE TODAY...LOW CLOUDS MAY INCREASE. 

NEXT COLD SYSTEM IN GULF OF ALASKA WILL SWOOP SOUTH OVER NRN CA
TONIGHT. MODELS DIFFER AS TO TIMING OF PRECIP ONSET WITH ETA AND
NOGAPS THE SLOWEST...AS USUAL. FASTER AVN AND NGM HAVE HAD THE BEST
HANDLE ON PRECIP ONSET TIMING OF THESE COLD GULF OF ALASKA SYSTEMS AS
OF LATE AND WILL FOLLOW THEIR TIMING ONCE AGAIN. SO HAVE INCREASED
POPS OVER ENTIRE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT. MODEL QPF IS A LITTLE LESS
WITH THIS SYSTEM...AS COMPARED TO LAST ONE...AND FRONT DOES APPEAR
RATHER DRY ON SATELLITE. HOWEVER...A 100 KT JET WILL SWING INLAND
OVER CENTRAL CA LATE TONIGHT AND SHOULD ENHANCE THE FRONT AND PRECIP.
SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE ALL DAY THURSDAY ALONG WITH A BRISK AND COLD NW
WIND. THIS SYSTEM WILL BE EVEN COLDER THAN THE LAST. SNOW LEVELS WILL
FALL TO UNSEASONABLY LOW LEVELS...AROUND 1000 FEET IN THE N BAY ON
THURS AND 2000 FEET IN THE SRN PART OF OUR AREA. MOST PRECIP SHOULD
BE THROUGH BEFORE SNOW LEVELS FALL THAT LOW...BUT SNOW SHOWERS WILL
LIKELY OCCUR ON SOME HIGH ELEVATION ROADS. BECAUSE OF THE UNUSALLY

AN UPPER LEVEL LOW CENTERED ABOUT 125 MILES SOUTHWEST OF POINT ARENA
IS MOVING SOUTHWARD DOWN THE CA COASTLINE TONIGHT. IN THE COLD
UNSTABLE AIR ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW SCATTERED SHOWERS ARE
DEVELOPING. A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WITH SMALL HAIL HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED.
THIS SYSTEM IS QUITE COLD AND SNOW LEVELS HAVE DROPPED TO AROUND 2500
FEET WITH SNOW BEING REPORTED ON THE HIGH PEAKS AROUND THE BAY AREA.
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THROUGH THE NIGHT
INTO TUESDAY MORNING. THE LOW CENTER IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE TRACKING
DOWN THE COAST UNTIL IT REACHES POINT CONCEPTION TUESDAY AFTERNOON
AND THEN SWING EASTWARD. ETA/NGM INITIALIZED THE LOW A LITTLE TOO FAR
NORTH THIS AFTERNOON SO CLEARING MAY BE A BIT SOONER ON TUESDAY THAN
MODELS INDICATE. SO BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON THE LOW SHOULD BE FAR ENOUGH
SOUTHEAST TO ALLOW A RIDGE AND NVA TO DEVELOP AND PUT AN END TO THE
SHOWERS. THE RIDGE WILL WARM TEMPERATURES AND BRING CLEAR SKIES ON
WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER SYSTEM DROPS DOWN OUT OF THE GULF OF AK BY
MIDWEEK. ALL MODELS EXCEPT THE MRF HAVE THE TROUGH AXIS STILL OFF THE
COAST THURSDAY MORNING BUT THE MRF HAS IT ALREADY EAST OF NORTHERN
CA. MODELS DO AGREE THOUGH THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL A SHORT WAVE TROUGH
THAT MOVES THROUGH NORTHERN CA RATHER THAN AN UPPER LEVEL LOW THAT
MOVES SOUTHWARD THROUGH CA LIKE THE LAST FEW SYSTEMS. THIS WOULD MEAN
THAT SYSTEM WOULD NOT BRING AS MUCH RAIN AND NOT BE AS COLD AS OUR
CURRENT SYSTEM. SINCE LAST SEVERAL SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN FASTER THAN THE
MODELS HAVE PREDICTED...FOR NOW WILL GO WITH MRF TIMING WHICH MEANS
RAIN TO THE BAY AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

COLD FRONT OVER THE GOLDEN GATE AT THIS TIME...WITH MODERATE S WINDS
OF 15 TO 25 MPH AHEAD OF THE FRONT DECREASING AND BECOMING MORE WLY

MODERATE (ABOUT 1/4 IN 3 HRS) BEHIND IT. WITH THE ALREADY COLD AIR
IN PLACE...THUNDERSTORMS ARE NOT EXPECTED WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE.
HOWEVER...SOME AFTERNOON CLEARING BEHIND THE FRONT MAY PRODUCE AN
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM OR TWO AS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW APPROACHES. 
TEMPS TODAY WILL BE LUCKY TO BREAK 50 IN THE N SFO BAY AREA. LIFTED
INDICIES DECREASE FURTHER TONIGHT AND TUE AS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW
MOVES OVER THE CENTRAL COAST...SO WILL KEEP THUNDERSTORMS IN THE

FORECAST TO DROP TO -13 C OVER THE N BAY THIS AFTERNOON AND OVER THE
REST OF THE AREA TONIGHT AND 500 MB TEMPS DROP TO -30 OR LOWER.
RESULTANT INSTABILITY MAY PRODUCE SOME THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE BAY

WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DAY MAKES...FROM CHAOS YESTERDAY TO TRANQUILITY
TODAY. A SUNNY-MILD EASTER SUN ACROSS THE CENTRAL COAST THIS
AFTERNOON. STILL...A LITTLE BREEZY AT THE COAST BY MUCH CALMER THAN
ON SAT...WITH TEMPERATURES AROUND THE 60 MARK. UPPER LEVEL LOW
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNUSUAL WEATHER OF YESTERDAY HAS NOW MOVED INTO
NCENTRAL AZ AND HAS BEEN REPLACED BY A SHORTWAVE RIDGE. THIS HAS HAD
THE EFFECT OF WARMING THE ATMOSPHERE A LITTLE AND GREATLY REDUCING
THE STRONG NW-SE SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT...RESPONSIBLE FOR THE
INTENSE WINDS. THIS PLEASANT BREAK WILL BE SHORT LIVED...HOWEVER. YET
ANOTHER COLD GULF OF ALASKA UPPER LEVEL STORM SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO

SYSTEM IS SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY IN THE NERN GULF OF ALASKA NEAR

THROUGH THE CENTRAL COAST INTO SRN CA BY EARLY EVENING. LOTS OF COLD
AIR SHOWER ACTIVITY IS FORECAST BEHIND THE FRONT...ALSO SEEN IN

THE COLD FRONT ITSELF. UNLIKE THE PAST 2 STORMS TO MOVE INTO THE AREA
WHICH TRACKED FURTHER INLAND...THE UPPER LOW/TROF WITH THIS SYSTEM
ARE FORECAST TO DROP SWD NEAR THE COAST AND EVENTUALLY INTO SRN CA.
THIS INDICATES...AND MODELS TREND... MORE PRECIP WITH THIS SYSTEM BUT
MUCH LESS WIND. AS IS COMMON IN APRIL...THERE WILL BE CHANCE OF
THUNDERSTORMS MON AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH THE SHOWERS AFTER THE
FRONT MOVES THROUGH. AND...LATER MON NIGHT...SNOW LEVELS WILL LOWER
TO THE 2000 TO 3000 FOOT RANGE OVER THE AREA FOR MORE LIGHT SNOWFALL

DEVELOPS A 997 MB SURFACE LOW NEAR LAS VEGAS AS HIGH PRES BUILDS
ALONG THE NRN CA COAST. THE RESULTING 16 MB GRADIENT FROM SFO TO LAS
WILL GENERATE WINDS OF ADVISORY LEVEL THIS AFTERNOON AND EVE. A WEEK
AGO...SURFACE GRADIENTS A LITTLE LESS THAN WHAT IS FORECAST FOR TODAY
PRODUCED WINDS OF 37 MPH AT SFO. IN ADDITION TO STRONG SURFACE
GRADIENTS...A STEEP LAPSE RATE WILL ALLOW STRONG WINDS ALOFT TO MIX
TO THE SURFACE. A 130 KT JET IS FORECAST BY THE ETA TO LIE DIRECTLY
OVER THE SFO BAY AREA THIS AFTERNOON. THUS...ALL THE INGREDIENTS ARE
IN PLACE FOR WINDS IN THE 20 TO 35 MPH RANGE LATER TODAY WITH HIGHER
GUSTS AT THE COAST AND AT HIGHER TERRAIN. STRONGEST WINDS WILL KICK
UP AFTER PASSAGE OF VORT MAX. THIS FEATURE FORECAST TO PASS THE N BAY
BY NOON AND MONTEREY BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON. ALONG WITH STRONG
WINDS...THIS SYSTEM WILL BRING WINTER-LIKE TEMPERATURES. THE 850 MB
TEMPS ARE FORECAST BY THE AVN TO BE AT -4 C THIS AFTERNOON. SO EVEN
WITH A STRONG APRIL SUN...TEMPS WONT MAKE IT OUT OF THE 50S ACROSS
MOST OF THE AREA TODAY. LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES AND 850 TEMPS RECOVER
SOMEWHAT ON SUNDAY AND TEMPS WILL REBOUND. ALSO...SURFACE GRADIENTS
RELAX A BIT ON SUNDAY SO WINDS WILL NOT BE AS STRONG...ALTHOUGH IT

NEW ETA MODEL CONTINUES EARLIER TRENDS...MOVING NEXT IN SERIES OF
UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROFS THROUGH THE PACIFIC NW AND FAR NRN CA.
TROF SEEN IN SATELLITE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY THIS EVENING JUST OFFSHORE
WA/NRN ORE DIGGING E/SEWD AS IT APPROACHES COAST. TRACK SO FAR IS
CLOSE TO NEW ETA AND EARLIER TRENDS. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONTAL BAND IS
INTO WRN WA/ORE...JUST A FEW MILES OFFSHORE NRN CA AT THIS TIME.
LIGHT PRECIP IS A GOOD BET FOR FAR NRN CA FROM THIS WEAK FRONT AND
FROM COLD AIR SHOWERS WITHIN TROF. THIS ALL BUT SHOULD REMAIN WELL TO
THE N OF CENTRAL CA COASTAL AREA AS TROF AND FRONT SLIDE EWD INTO NRN
NEVADA THEN DIGS SWD INTO NV AND UT. THIS SYSTEM IS A SO CALLED...
INSIDE SLIDER...COMMON DURING THE SPRING. MOST OF THE WEATHER FROM
THESE SYSTEMS OCCUR IN THE INTERMOUNTAIN REGION OF THE W...WITH
MINIMAL EFFECTS ON CA. AS INDICATED...LIGHT PRECIP IS LIKELY FAR NRN
END OF STATE AND SOME SHOWER ACTIVITY ACROSS THE SIERRA IS LIKELY AS
THE SYSTEM TRACKS SEWD INTO THE GREAT BASIN. CENTRAL CA REMAINS WELL
TO THE W OF THE ACTION...PRETTY MUCH SHELTERED BY THE SIERRA. SOME
MID/HIGH CLOUDS ARE SHEARING SWD FROM THE NRN CA FRONTAL BAND AND
WILL BE OVER CENTRAL CA DURING THE NIGHT WITH SOME OF THIS HIGHER
MOISTURE HANGING AROUND ON SAT. MAIN WEATHER FEATURE FOR CENTRAL CA
WILL BE MORE STRONG-GUSTY NW WINDS. NGM MOS SHOWS SAT AFTERNOON AS A
BREEZY PERIOD WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVISORY LEVEL WINDS...WITH
GUSTS TO MID 30KT RANGE IN WINDIER LOCATIONS AROUND THE SF BAY AREA.
BY EASTER SUN...WINDS WILL SUBSIDE SOME AND DAYTIME TEMPERATURES WILL
RISE FROM THE MID 50S ON SAT TO THE LOW TO MID 60S WITH SOME

BEAUTIFUL DAY OVER CA AND TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED INTO THE 60S. A
FEW CUMULUS CLOUDS HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHERN
MONTEREY COUNTY BUT APPEAR TO HAVE LITTLE VERTICAL DEVELOPMENT AS
ATMOSPHERE IS STABILIZING...ELSEWHERE SKIES ARE CLEAR. CONTINUED
CLEAR EVERYWHERE TONIGHT EXCEPT NEAR THE COAST WHERE PATCHY COASTAL
STRATUS MAY DEVELOP DUE TO THE INCREASING ONSHORE FLOW AND A
DEEPENING INVERSION. THE FRONT NOW SEEN ON THE VISIBLE SATL OFF THE
PACNW COAST WILL MOVE SLOWLY EASTWARD. THIS FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH
EXTREME NORTHERN CA TONIGHT AND WEAKEN. BUT THE VORT MAX ASSOCIATED
WITH THIS FRONT DEVELOPS INTO A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT TRACKS
SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH NEVADA SATURDAY/SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS TRACK WILL
KEEP THE CA COAST DRY AND KEEP ANY SHOWERS TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF
THE AREA. MAIN CONCERN FOR THE COASTAL AREAS SATURDAY WILL BE WIND AS
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN AT THE SURFACE INCREASING THE PRESSURE
GRADIENT ESPECIALLY NEAR THE COAST. SO MOST OF THE WEEKEND WILL BE
MOSTLY SUNNY...BREEZY INLAND AND WINDY NEAR THE COAST. NEXT WEEK

MAX OF 120 KTS MOVING DOWN THE BACK SIDE OF THE TROF OFF THE
CALIFORNIA COAST. EXPECT CU TO QUICKLY DISSIPATE AFTER SUN GOES DOWN

12Z ETA/NGM SHOW GOOD NVA/SUBSIDENCE OVER THE SFO BAY AREA THROUGH
FRIDAY. SFC HIGH WILL BUILD ACROSS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE
PERIOD WITH SOME LIGHT TO MODERATE DIABLO WINDS THURSDAY NIGHT INTO
FRIDAY. THICKNESS VALUES REBOUND SOMEWHAT OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS SO
EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO REBOUND A LITTLE EACH DAY. OTHERWISE DRY.

THE 12Z AVN CONTINUES THE TREND FOR A DRY WEEKEND FOR SFO. (WOW...TWO

PATTERN WILL CONTINUE UNTIL AT LEAST MIDMORNING...BUT AFTER THAT THE
LOW LEVEL FLOW IS FCST TO BEGIN VEERING AND BY MIDDAY IT WILL BE
ROUGHLY PARALLEL TO THE COAST.  THIS SHOULD KEEP MOST IF NOT ALL
SHOWERS OFFSHORE THIS AFTN.  THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE TNGT/THU WITH

INCREASING AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE DECREASING FROM N TO S OVER THE

COOL.  EXPECT PATCHY FROST TNGT IN THE COLDER INLAND VALLEYS WITH

COLD UPPER LEVEL TROF IS ALREADY DROPPING INTO CA WITH SOME AUTHORITY
AS WE HAVE A LARGE FIELD OF COLD CELLULAR CLOUDS ON THE NRN CA COAST
WELL AHEAD OF THE MAIN MOISTURE FIELD AND JET DYNAMICS.  THE ETA AND
AVN BRING QUITE A BIT OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INTO THE N BAY TDA WITH
THE MAIN OMEGA FIELD EDGING INTO THAT AREA THIS AFTN...SO THE N BAY
SHOULD SEE SOME SHWRS AND THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF THEM ELSEWHERE IN
THE BAY AREA.  MOST OF THE RAIN IN OUR FCST AREA WILL FALL TNGT AS
THE COLDEST AIR MOVES IN ALONG WITH THE BEST DYNAMICS...MAINLY
ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLD NWLY JET.  ANOTHER FACTOR WILL BE
OROGRAPHICS.  BRISK W TO NW WINDS WILL BRING SHOWERS ONSHORE IN FORCE
TNGT...THIS FLOW IS ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR MRY AND EXPECT LOTS OF SHWRS
HERE DURING THE NEXT MID SHIFT.  THE AIR ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCOMING
TROF IS VERY COLD FOR THIS LATE IN THE SEASON AND SNOW LEVELS WILL
DROP TO THE 2500-3000 FOOT RANGE IN OUR FCST AREA.  THE STRONG
ONSHORE FLOW WILL MODIFY THE COLD AIR A LITTLE...OR THE SNOW LEVELS
WOULD BE EVEN LOWER.

THE MODELS MOVE VIRTUALLY ALL OMEGA OUT OF OUR FCST AREA BY 12Z WED
...BUT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL REMAIN ABUNDANT WELL INTO THE DAY
ALONG WITH NWLY LOW LEVEL WINDS SO SHOWERS SHOULD PERSIST WELL INTO
WED MRNG...ESPECIALLY FROM MRY BAY S.  THE NGM MOS ALWAYS HAS A
TERRIBLE TIME WITH THESE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SYSTEMS.  ITS POPS FOR
SFO THE NEXT 3 PERIODS (12/43/15) ARE WAY TOO LOW AND THE MUCH HIGHER
AVN POPS (68/83/72) WILL BE BETTER...ESPECIALLY TNGT/WED.  

THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS CONTINUE TO DIFFER...BUT NOT TOO SERIOUSLY
FOR OUR FCST AREA THRU FRI.  ALL TAKE THE TROF SE OF OUR FCST AREA BY
THU...SO SHOWERS WILL END OVER NRN/CNTRL CA FROM NW TO SE FROM WED
AFTN TO THU MRNG.  FRI WILL BE DRY AND BREEZY WITH MORE OF A NLY

SQUEEZE OUT SOME VERY LIGHT RAIN/DRIZZLE FROM WEAK FRONTAL BAND
ACROSS SONOMA/NAPA COUNTIES THIS EVENING. RAIN PRODUCING CLOUDS TOO
LOW TO BE SEEN BY RADAR AND MOST PLACES WONT GET ENOUGH PRECIP TO
MEASURE AS FRONTAL BAND PUSHES THRU THE REMAINDER OF THE BAY AREA AND
SOUTH TO MONTEREY. ON SATELLITE...FRONTAL BAND ALREADY SHOWING SIGNS
OF FALLING APART...BUT RESIDUAL LOW CLOUDS WILL LINGER THRU MUCH OF
THE NIGHT FROM MONTEREY N AND KEEP MIN TEMPS UP A BIT. SOME CLEARING
POSSIBLE NORTH SFO BAY AREA LATER TONIGHT AND SATELLITE SHOWS THAT
SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE AIR WITH CELLULAR CLOUDS WILL SPILL INTO THAT
REGION AND COULD PRODUCE AN ISOLATED SHOWER.

NEXT SHORTWAVE DROPPING DOWN BACK SIDE OF UPPER TROF...EVIDENT ON

NOT MUCH HAPPENING IN THE SHORT TERM AS ALMOST THE ENTIRE STATE IS
CLEAR THIS AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES JUST A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN
YESTERDAY AND THE PRESSURE GRADIENT HAS WEAKENED AND THERE WAS NOT
AS MUCH WIND AS YESTERDAY. THERE IS STILL THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME LOW
CLOUDS DEVELOPING TONIGHT BUT SHOULD ONLY BE PATCHY. MAIN POINT OF
CONCERN IS THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM NOW CENTERED NEAR 47N/138W. PREFER
THE SLOWER TIMING OF THE ETA WHICH MEANS RAIN DEVELOPING ON THE NORTH
COAST LATE TONIGHT AND SPREADING SLOWLY SOUTHWARD TO THE BAY AREA BY
TUESDAY. THE EXTENDED STILL A BIT IN QUESTION AS MODELS VARY ON
TIMING. PREFER THE MRF BECAUSE IT HOLDS ONTO THE LOW A BIT LONGER
THAN THE NOGAPS. THUS SHOWERS TO CONTINUE PROBABLY THROUGH THURSDAY
BEFORE CLEARING AND BECOMING BREEZY ON FRIDAY.

THE RIDGE CONTINUES OVER CA WHICH KEPT SKIES CLEAR OVERNIGHT AND
TEMPERATURES VERY COOL. WE TIED THE RECORD LOW IN DOWNTOWN OAKLAND
THIS MORNING WITH A TEMPERATURE OF 42. THE GRADIENT ALONG THE COAST
IS WEAKENING SO WINDS SHOULD BE A BIT LIGHTER TODAY THAN YESTERDAY
BUT STILL BREEZY EXCEPT CONTINUED FAIRLY STRONG ALONG THE CENTRAL CA
COAST SOUTH OF MONTEREY BAY. WITH SOME WARMING ALOFT AND CONTINUED
ONSHORE FLOW EXPECT SOME PATCHY LOW CLOUDS/FOG TO DEVELOP TONIGHT.
OTHERWISE TWO MORE CLEAR DAYS ON TAP FOR CA BEFORE THE NEXT SYSTEM
NOW SEEN DEVELOPING NEAR 48N/139W STARTS TO AFFECT CA. NGM/AVN BRING
RAIN DOWN TO THE BAY AREA ON MONDAY BUT BELIEVE THIS IS TOO FAST
CONSIDERING THE FAST BIAS OF THE MODELS AND THE SEVERAL DAYS OF
DRYING OF THE ATMOSPHERE WEVE HAD. PREFER THE TIMING OF THE ETA WHICH
KEEPS RAIN OUT OF THE BAY AREA UNTIL TUESDAY. THIS LOW WILL THEN MOVE
THROUGH NORTHERN CA ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY FOR SHOWERS THROUGHOUT

MRNG.  WATER VAPOR PIX SHOW LOW CLOUDS MOVING TOWARD THE N BAY AT

THE SHORELINE AND EXPECT MOSTLY SUNNY WEATHER OVER ALL OUR FCST AREA

IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD THE MODELS CONTINUE TO FLAIL ABOUT...DIVERGING
FROM ONE RUN TO THE NEXT AND WITH EACH OTHER.  THE EURO/MRF BRING A
STRONG TROF INTO CA ON TUE...WITH PLENTY OF COLD AIR AND MOISTURE
OVER NRN CA BY TUE AFTN AND SPREADING OVER CNTRL CA BY WED MRNG.  THE

ALSO BEGUN TO INCREASE AS THE FLAT HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE SETS UP FOR

WITH A BIT COOLER AIRMASS SETTLING OVER THE AREA EXPECT DAYTIME HIGHS
AT LEAST NEAR THE SAME SATURDAY AS TODAY WITH VERY LITTLE CLOUDINESS.
LOWS SHOULD BE A BIT COOLER THOUGH WITH RADIATIONAL COOLING. A DECENT
PRESSURE GRADIENT SETS UP FOR SATURDAY SO EXPECT NORTHWEST WINDY
CONDITIONS...MAINLY SAN FRANCISCO AREA SOUTHWARD AND PARTICULARLY
ALONG THE COAST. THAT ABOUT SUMS IT UP THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...VERY
NICE OVERALL.
IN THE EXTENDED THERE IS SOME DISSAGREEMENT. THE MRF MODEL DEVELOPS A

CHANCE OF RAIN UNTIL TUESDAY AND LIKELY BY WEDNESDAY. THE NOGAPS
MODEL ALSO DEVELOPS A SIMILAR TROF ON MONDAY THAT SUGGESTS INCREASING
CLOUDINESS AS WELL. HOWEVER IT DEEPENS THE TROF TO THE EXTENT THAT

ALL MODELS AGREE ON OFFSHORE SYSTEM EVENTUALLY CUTTING OFF INTO
CLOSED LOW CIRCULATION AND MOVING INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER -
MINOR DIFFERENCES IN MODEL SOLUTIONS HAVING RAMIFICATIONS ON WHICH
WAY TO GO ON FORECAST TONIGHT. ETA HAS THE SYSTEM MOVING FARTHER EAST
BEFORE CUTTING OFF AND KEEPS IT THE FARTHEST ONSHORE IN SOUTHERN CA
BY 12Z FRI. SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS SYSTEM STILL DIGGING MORE
SOUTHWARD THAN MOVING EASTWARD DUE TO 130 KT JET ON BACK SIDE OF TROF
SO GOING WITH THE NGM/AVN SOLUTIONS OF CUTTING OFF LOW OFFSHORE AND
SLIDING SLOWLY SOUTHEASTWARD DOWN THE COAST SEEMS MORE PLAUSIBLE.
12Z NOGAPS ALSO IN AGREEMENT WITH KEEPING SYSTEM FARTHER OFFSHORE.
MODELS HAVE A TENDENCY TO TRY AND RUSH CUTOFF LOWS INLAND ANYHOW SO
BELIEVE STAYING WITH THE OFFSHORE SOLUTIONS A BETTER PERCENTAGE
PLAY. A DECENT FRONTAL BAND STILL TO PASS THROUGH DISTRICT OVERNIGHT.
HEAVIEST RAIN AMOUNTS NORTH BAY 00Z TRENDING SOUTHWARD TO MONTEREY
COUNTY 06Z+. WITH DECENT OMEGA FIELD AND PVA ASSOCIATED WITH FRONT IN
ADDITION TO SWLY FLOW OF AROUND 30 KTS AT 850 MB WILL SEE ENHANCED
OROGRAPHIC PCPN IN COASTAL MOUNTAINS.

NEXT FORECAST QUESTION CONCERNS AMOUNT OF WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ON
THURSDAY AND HOW LONG SHOWERS WILL LINGER IN THE FORECAST AREA. WITH
CUTOFF MOVING ONLY VERY SLOWLY...THERE WILL ALSO THUS BE ONLY A SLOW
CLEARING TREND FROM NW TO SE ACROSS THE DISTRICT AS IT WILL TAKE A
WHILE FOR UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE H5 RIDGE BUILDING IN FROM THE WEST

SHOWERS TO LINGER A LITTLE LONGER ON THURSDAY...ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF
SAN JOSE.

EXTENDED...ALL MODELS CONCUR ON A RELATIVELY FLAT UPPER LEVEL RIDGE
OVER THE STATE ON FRI AND SAT WITH RISING H5 HEIGHTS FOR TEMPERATURES
RETURNING TO NORMAL UNDER MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. DIFFERENCES EMERGE FOR

HOWEVER...WEAK SURFACE CONVERGENCE ALONG THE FRONT HAS PRODUCED
SIGNIFICANT CLOUDS AND A FEW REPORTS OF LIGHT RAIN...ESPECIALLY IN
THE N BAY. WEAK MESO LOW OFF PT ARENA WILL LIKELY PRODUCE A FEW LIGHT
SHOWERS EARLY THIS EVENING AND KEEP CLOUDS AROUND IN THE N BAY MOST
OF THE NIGHT...BUT SOMEWHAT DRIER AIR ADVECTING IN FURTHER S SHOULD
ALLOW FOR CLEARING.

A CLOSED UPPER LOW IS CURRENTLY CENTERED NEAR 45N/140W. DEVELOPMENT
IS OCCURRING TO THE S OF THE LOW CENTER WHERE MAIN JET ENERGY IS.
NORMALLY...A CLOSED LOW SUCH AS THIS WOULD BE SLOW TO MOVE...AND
WOULD EXPECT ASSOCIATED FRONT AND PRECIP TO BE SLOW TO MOVE IN.
BUT...A STRONG SYSTEM MOVING QUICKLY ACROSS THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS WILL
PROVIDE THE KICK NECESSARY TO OPEN UP CLOSED LOW AND MOVE IT EAST.
OPPOSITE THE LAST COUPLE OF RAIN EVENTS...THE NGM IS NOW THE FASTEST
MODEL WHILE THE AVN AND ETA ARE SLOWER. WITH BLOCKING RIDGE OVER NRN
ROCKIES...BELIEVE THE SLOWER MODELS ARE CLOSER TO REALITY EVEN WITH
THE BIG ALEUTIAN LOW KICKER. THEREFORE...WILL KEEP POPS TO JUST A
CHANCE N OF SAN JOSE MON AFTERNOON WITH RAIN MOSTLY HOLDING OFF UNTIL
MONDAY NIGHT AS NEGATIVELY TILTED TROF SWINGS INLAND. AVN...MODEL OF
CHOICE...MOVES TROF INLAND QUICKLY BY TUES MORNING AND SHOWERS SHOULD
END BY MIDDAY. 

ALEUTIAN SYSTEM WILL FOLLOW PRETTY MUCH THE SAME STROM TRACK AND
BRING RAIN INTO NRN CA TUES NIGHT AND ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION BY
WED NIGHT. AFTER THAT...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS INDICATE AT LEAST A
TEMPORARY CHANGE IN THE PATTERN WITH A STRONG ZONAL FLOW INTO THE
PACIFIC NW AND AN END...AT LEAST FOR A WHILE...OF THESE COLD SYSTEMS

TODAY IS SUPPOSEDLY THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING...THOUGH THATS AN
ABSTRACT CONCEPT AROUND HERE.  THE CHERRY TREES HAVE LONG SINCE
BLOOMED...AND ON THE OTHER HAND THE WEATHER IS NO WARMER THAN IT WAS
IN JANUARY.  AND...THATS NOT GOING TO CHANGE SOON AS WE WILL CONTINUE
IN OUR NWLY FLOW PATTERN WITH COLD HIGH AMPLITUDE TROFS SWEEPING IN
EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS.  IN THE SHORT TERM THERE IS ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE IN OUR FCST AREA...AND THE WEAK SHORT WAVE APPROACHING THE
COAST IS STIRRING THE MOISTURE UP AND GENERATING EXTENSIVE CLOUDINESS
AS THE NIGHT GOES ON.  THE ETA FCSTS THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO REMAIN
ABUNDANT IN THE N BAY ALL DAY TDA WITH WEAK OMEGA AS THE SHORT WAVE
MOVES THRU THIS MRNG...SO THAT AREA COULD GET A FEW SHOWERS AND IS
LIKELY TO STAY MOSTLY CLOUDY ALL DAY.  FARTHER S THE LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE THIS AFTN AND WE SHOULD SEE SOME
CLEARING FROM SFO S.  EXPECT SOME AREAS OF CLOUDS TNGT...BUT NOT TOO
EXTENSIVE EXCEPT MAYBE IN THE N BAY...AS WE WONT HAVE ANY DYNAMICS TO
WORK WITH AND ONSHORE FLOW WILL BE NEGLIGIBLE.
  
THE NEXT SYSTEM...YET ANOTHER CUTOFF...IS MOVING SEWD WITH ITS CENTER
APPROACHING 45/140 AT THIS TIME.  ITS BEING DRIVEN BY A STRONG NWLY
JET ENHANCED BY RIDGING OVER THE ALEUTIANS AHEAD OF A VERY DEEP LOW
...AROUND 950 MB...W OF ADAK.  THE AVN FCSTS THIS SYSTEM TO REACH THE
BAY AREA BY MON AFTN WITH RAIN SPREADING S AS FAR AS SJC.  THE ETA IS
MUCH SLOWER...KEEPING THE RAIN NW OF OUR FCST AREA THRU 00Z TUE WITH
THE MAIN OMEGA FIELD STILL WELL OFFSHORE AT THAT TIME.  WITH CUTOFFS
...SLOWER IS BETTER...AND WILL UNDERCUT MOS POPS WITH JUST A CHANCE
OF RAIN MON AFTN FROM SFO N.  IT WILL RAIN IN THE BAY AREA AND
PROBABLY FARTHER S...BUT NOT TIL MON NGT.  WILL BREAK THIS PERIOD
OUT IN THE EXTENDED....WITH DRYING OVER NRN/CNTRL CA ON TUE.

FARTHER OUT...THE MRF/EURO/UK/CANADIAN ARE ALL IN FAIR AGREEMENT IN
BRINGING THE NEXT SYSTEM INTO OUR DISTRICT ON WED...WITH THE TROF

FARTHER S THAN NGM/AVN AND PROBABLY BETTER CONSIDERING ITS PRESENT

PROBABLY BETTER WELL INLAND BUT NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION IN OUR FCST

POSITIVE TDA...LESS UNSTABLE THAN EARLIER RUNS.  SHOWERS IN OUR FCST

THEN.  HOWEVER...THE ETA AND NGM DO RETAIN SOME DYNAMICS WITH THE

GUESS OF POSITION FROM SATELLITE WATER VAPOR THIS AFTERNOON PUTS
CENTER NEAR 35/125. SEVERAL VORTLOBES SPIRALING ABOUT LOW ARE CAUSING
THE WOBBLING EFFECT MAKING IT VERY DIFICULT LOCATING THE CENTER AND
EVEN HARDER TRACKING THE LOW. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION
SINCE THE MODELS DIFFER GREATLY ON THE TRACK OF THE LOW AND THEREFORE
HOW MUCH IN THE WAY OF SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS TO EXPECT
MAINLY FOR SAT. BELIEVE THAT NGM MOVEMENT OF LOW ACROSS SFO IS TOO
FAR N AND ETA...WHICH HAS BEEN PERFORMING VERY POORLY WITH THESE

OCCURRING THIS AFTERNOON AFTER DUMPING ABOUT 1.5 INCHES IN SRN

MOVES INTO THE SIERRA. A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS WILL PERSIST INTO
THE NIGHT HOURS SAT NIGHT THEN CLEAR BY EARLY SUN. NEW AVN MODEL AS
WELL AS NEW NOGAPS INDICATE A VERY WEAK SHORTWAVE TROF MOVING ACROSS

PRECIP WILL ACCOMPANY THIS WEAK IMPULSE INTO THE N SF BAY AREA.

SIMILIAR TO PAST FEW SYSTEMS EXCEPT MODELS DROP IT OVER THE STATE

AND CHANCES DECREASE TO THE NORTH AND EAST. SOUTH WINDS HAVE PICKED
UP OFFSHORE AND IN THE NORTH-SOUTH ORIENTED VALLEYS AND SHOULD
CONTINUE THROUGH THE MORNING. THE NGM FORECASTS THE LOW TO MOVE
INLAND OVER THE CENTRAL CA COAST ON SATURDAY. WITH THE COMBINATION OF
THE LOW CENTER...A MODERATE VORT MAX AND A SPRING ATMOSPHERE THERE 
SHOULD BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND A FEW

SATELLITE LOOP SHOWS SYSTEM APPROACHING CA COAST VERY SIMILIAR TO ONE
PAST WEEKEND. TROF IS ELONGATING N-S JUST W 130W THIS MORNING WITH
TWO CENTERS...NRN ONE IS UPPER LOW NEAR 41/131 AND SRN ONE IS A
MODERATE VORTMAX NEAR 34/131. FRONTAL BAND IS JUST E OF 130W ALSO
ALIGNING N-S. THIS PROCESS WITH UPPER LEVEL FLOW TENDING TO BECOMING
PARALLEL TO FRONT HAS SLOWED SYSTEMS EWD PROGRESSION...JUST AS WE SAW
LAST WEEKEND. AND...AS WITH PAST SYSTEM...MODELS MOVE PRECIP
ASSOCIATED WITH FRONT INTO CENTRAL CA AREAS MUCH TOO FAST. SLOWER NGM
MODEL MAY BE A LITTLE BETTER WITH TIMING AGAIN...HOLDING OFF MAIN
PRECIP EVENT UNTIL LATE EVENING OR AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. THIS
ENTIRE SYSTEM APPEARS LIKELY TO EVOLVE AS PAST ONE DID...WITH NEW
MODELS TRENDING THIS...UPPER LOW AND VORTMAX CONSOLIDATING AND
DROPPING SEWD TOWARD SRN CA. UPPER LOW WILL HEAD INTO LAX AREA SAT
MORNING BUT FRONTAL BAND WILL GRADUALLY PUSH FAR ENOUGH EWD TO
PRODUCE LIGHT-MODERATE PRECIP IN THE CENTRAL COASTAL SECTIONS FROM
LATE TONIGHT THROUGH MUCH OF FRI. MOST OF THE UNSTABLE COLD AIR WITH
THE UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM WILL DIVE INTO SRN CA...SHOWERS AND AN
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM ARE POSSIBLE FRI NIGHT AND MORE LIKELY SAT.
FOR TODAY...OAK SOUNDING SHOWS DEEP MARINE INVERSION...TOPS AROUND
3000 FEET. WITH HIGHER CLOUDS AHEAD OF OFFSHORE WEATHER SYSTEM
...WILL SEE A FAIRLY SLOW BURNOFF. THEN...MOSTLY CLOUDY AHEAD OF

THE UPPER LEVEL LOW IS CENTERED NEAR 37N/137W AND IS MOVING EAST
SOUTHEAST AT THIS TIME. LOTS OF HIGH CLOUDS MOVING IN AHEAD OF THIS
SYSTEM BUT THIS HAS NOT HINDERED THE LOW CLOUDS FROM DEVELOPING. BUT
THE LOW CLOUDS HAVE MAINLY BEEN CONFINED TO THE COAST AND COASTAL
VALLEYS THIS MORNING. TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM IS A BIT SLOWER THAN
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. SO THE RAIN COULD BE STARTING NEAR THE COAST LATE
THIS AFTERNOON BUT MORE LIKELY THIS EVENING. THIS SYSTEM IS FORECAST
TO HAVE GOOD DYNAMICS SO THUNDERSTORMS STILL A POSSIBLITY ON FRIDAY
BUT WILL DEPEND ON THE ACTUAL PLACEMENT OF THE LOW CENTER. THE LOW IS
FORECAST TO SLOWLY MIGRATE SOUTHWARD DOWN THE COAST KEEPING SHOWERS
IN THE FORECAST THROUGH SATURDAY. THIS LOW SHOULD THEN MOVE OUT OF

IF YOU LIKE CUTOFFS...THIS IS THE BEST TIME OF THE YEAR  CURRENTLY
THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM IN OR NEAR THE CONTINENTAL U.S...RANGING FROM
SRN LABRADOR TO OUR INCOMING SYSTEM NEAR 39/140.  THE MODELS HAVE
SLOWED THE ARRIVAL OF THE LATTER CUTOFF...WHICH LOOKS GOOD GIVEN THE
FRAGMENTED...COMPLEX JET PATTERN OVER NORTH AMERICA.  ODDLY...THE NGM
IS THE SLOWER MODEL.  THE NEW NGM FCSTS THE SYSTEM TO BE AROUND
37/127 AT 12Z FRI...THE OLD ETA HAD IT AT 36/125 AT THE SAME TIME. 
THUS THE AFTN FCST HOLDING OFF SIGNIFICANT PRECIP OVER OUR FCST AREA
UNTIL THU NGT LOOKS FINE.  WHEN THE RAIN FINALLY DOES REACH THE COAST
IT SHOULD LAST A WHILE...THE NGM MOVES THE CUTOFF CENTER VERY SLOWLY
SEWD PARALLEL TO THE COAST ON FRI WITH A GOOD COLD CORE CENTER AND
SOME DIFFLUENCE OF THE UPPER WINDS AND THICKNESS COUTOURS.  SO
DYNAMICS WILL BE GOOD.  NGM BACKS UP THE OLD AVN IN BRINGING NEGATIVE
LIFTED INDEX VALUES INTO THE BAY AREA BY MIDDAY FRI...IN FACT BY 00Z
SAT IT HAS A MINUS 4 VALUE OVER SFO...SO THE TSTMS CURRENTLY IN THE
FCST FOR ALL OUR ZONES ON FRI LOOK FINE.  

EXTENDED FCST DEPENDS ON THE SPEED WITH WHICH THE CUTOFF MOVES SEWD
THIS WEEKEND.  IT APPEARS IT WILL BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AT LEAST
THRU SAT BEFORE TRACKING EWD OUT OF SRN CA...SO EXPECT MORE SHOWERS
OVER CNTRL CA SAT...ESPECIALLY IN THE SRN PART OF THAT AREA.  BY SUN
WE SHOULD SEE A RETURN OF DRY WEATHER.

LOW CLOUDS HAVE CLEARED FROM MOST OF THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. BELIEVE
LOW CLOUD REDEVELOPMENT TONIGHT WILL BE LESS EXTENSIVE THAN LAST
NIGHT FOR TWO REASON. FIRST...THE LOWER LEVELS ARE DRIER THAN 24
HOURS AGO. SECOND...WITH OUR UPPER RIDGE HEADING EAST...LOW LEVEL
INVERSION WILL NOT BE AS STRONG. PRIMARY FORECAST PROBLEM IS TIMING
OF PRECIP WITH NEXT SYSTEM...CURRENTLY NEAR 135W. HIGH CLOUDS OUT
AHEAD OF IT WILL MOSTLY MISS OUR AREA TO THE N. YESTERDAY AT THIS
TIME...MAJORITY OF MODELS DEVELOPED RAIN OVER MOST OF OUR FORECAST
AREA DURING THE DAY ON THURSDAY. TODAY HOWEVER...ALL FORECAST OFFICES
IN NRN CA AGREE THAT THE SLOWEST MODEL...THE NGM...IS THE MODEL OF
CHOICE. THE REASON...THE NGM INITIALIZED BEST AT 12Z AND IT ALSO
HANDLED THE LAST COUPLE OF CUTOFF LOW SCENARIOS...WHICH THIS WILL
BE...BETTER THAN THE AVN OR ETA. IN ADDITION...ALL MODELS ARE
TRENDING SLOWER AND WITH A CUTOFF FORMING WELL OFFSHORE BY EARLY
THURSDAY...RAIN WILL BEGIN LATER RATHER THAN EARLIER.
THEREFORE...HAVE LOWERED POPS TO NO MORE THAN CHANCE IN THE NORTH BAY
AND ALONG THE COAST S TO SANTA CRUZ COUNTY THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND
WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF RAIN HELD OFF UNTIL THURS NIGHT. AS THE UPPER
LOW CUTS OFF...THE SURFACE FRONT WILL ASSUME A NEARLY N TO S
ORIENTATION AND RAIN WILL LIKELY START AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME ALONG
MUCH OF OUR COAST. ALL MODELS INDICATE THE MAIN FRONTAL BAND WILL
MOVE ONSHORE LATE THURSDAY EVENING AND THEN PRETTY MUCH STALL OUT AS
UPPER LOW SLOWS TO A CRAWL. WITH GOOD PRECIPITABLE WATER INDICATED BY
SSMI DATA AND SLOW MOVEMENT OF FRONTAL BAND...COULD SEE A REPEAT OF
THE SUNDAY/SUNDAY NIGHT STORM WHERE WE GET A LONG PERIOD OF MODERATE
RAIN. NEXT SYSTEM...CURRENTLY NEAR THE ALEUTAIN ISLANDS WILL PROVIDE
THE KICK TO MOVE OUR CUTOFF TO THE ESE FRIDAY AFTERNOON. AS IT DOES
SO...COOL POOL OF AIR ALOFT WILL MOVE OVER OUR AREA AND SPARK 
SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS FRI AFTERNOON AND EVE. UPPER LOW WILL BE SLOW
TO MOVE INTO SRN CA ON SAT SO EXPECT SHOWERS TO BE SLOW TO TAPER OFF
THAT DAY. THE WEEKEND IS NOT LOST THOUGH...CAUTIOUSLY OPTOMISTIC THAT
SUNDAY WILL BE A DRY DAY. STS 0499 SFO 0399 SJC/LVK 0199 MRY 0089

CLEARING TO OCCUR ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS YESTERDAY. SOONER IN SOME

NO UPDATES PLANNED THIS MORNING.

DEEP SURFACE LOW HEADED FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA THIS MORNING. ASSOCIATED
COLD FRONT IS VERY WEAK AT OUR LATITUDE AND IS DISSIPATING RAPIDLY AS
IT APPROACHES THE COAST. COMA CLOUD NEARING 140W IS THE SYSTEM THAT
WILL BRING RAIN TO OUR AREA BY LATE THURSDAY. ALL MODELS FORM A
CLOSED UPPER LOW NEAR 130W/40N BY MIDDAY THURSDAY. AS UPPER LOW
BECOMES CUTOFF FROM MAIN FLOW...EWD MOVEMENT WILL SLOW AND PRECIP
LIKELY WILL BE DELAYED. IT IS POSSIBLE RAIN WILL NOT DEVELOP IN THE
BAY AREA UNTIL THURSDAY EVENING. WILL LOOK AT SITUATION MORE CLOSELY
FOR AFTERNOON FORECAST PACKAGE...BUT THINKING NOW IS THAT PRECIP

CA BETWEEN SYSTEMS AT THIS TIME. THE UPPER LEVEL LOW THAT HUNG AROUND
CA FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS HAS MOVED EAST INTO AZ. A WEAK RIDGE LIES
OVER CA THIS MORNING WHICH ALLOWED LOW CLOUDS TO FILL BACK IN AND
THEY NOW COVER THE SFO BAY AREA AND MOST OF THE CENTRAL CA COAST. NOW
THAT THE FLOW HAS TURNED ONSHORE...WITH PLENTY OF AVAILABLE LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE AND A DEEP INVERSION...THE STRATUS WILL BE SLOW TO CLEAR
TODAY. THERE ARE TWO SYSTEMS READY TO AFFECT CA. THE FIRST IS LOCATED
NEAR 48N/134W AND IS MOVING NORTHWARD. A WEAK COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM
THIS LOW...ALONG THE OREGON COAST TO 450 MILES WEST OF SAN FRANCISCO.
THIS COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH NORTHERN CA TODAY BUT IS VERY WEAK
AND FALLING APART SO WILL JUST BRING HIGH CLOUDS. THE SECOND LOW IS
LOCATED NEAR 43N/150W. THIS LOW WILL CONTINUE TO DEEPEN AND TRACK
SOUTHEASTWARD AND WILL DEVELOP INTO A CUTOFF LOW TONIGHT. CURRENT
TIMING WITH THIS SYSTEM BRINGS RAIN TO NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CA ON
THURSDAY. THE LOW CENTER IS PROGGED TO STAY OFFSHORE...SO LIKE THE
LAST SYSTEM...MOST OF THE RAIN IS LIKELY TO BE NEAR THE COAST. BUT AS
ALWAYS WITH UPPER LEVEL LOWS THE ACTUAL MOVEMENT AND TIMING IS NOT
GUARANTEED. IN THE EXTENDED THE MODELS ARE SURPRISINGLY IN AGREEMENT
ON THE MOVEMENT OF THIS LOW AND MOVE IT TO NEAR PT CONCEPTION BY

LOW CLOUDS ARE COVERING A VAST AREA FROM THE I-80 CORRIDOR S...AND
WITH PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...A DEEP INVERSION...AND A WEAK
ONSHORE FLOW THEY WONT BE GOING ANYWHERE AND SHOULD BECOME EVEN MORE
EXTENSIVE OVERNIGHT.  WILL UPDATE THE ZONES TO PUT EVEN MORE CLOUDS
IN THAN CURRENTLY FCST...AND MAY HAVE TO MOVE A FEW MIN TEMPS UP TO
NEAR PRESENT LEVELS.  THE CLOUDS WILL HANG IN MUCH OF WED MRNG BEFORE
AN INCREASING SWLY FLOW AND COOLER TEMPS ALOFT MIX OUT THE CRUD...AT
LEAST MOST OF IT.  CLOUD COVER SHOULD BE LESS EXTENSIVE WED NIGHT
UNTIL LATE...WHEN THE NEXT STORM APPROACHES.  THIS SYSTEM IS ALREADY
WELL DEVELOPED...APPROACHING 150W CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF THE DEEP LOW
NEAR 47/137.  THE ETA FCSTS THE TRAILING STORM TO BE A CUTOFF SYSTEM
SPORTING EXCELLENT DYNAMICS BY THU MRNG AS IT PASSES 130 W WITH
STRONG UPPER WIND AND THICKNESS DIFFLUENCE...AND A POOL OF VERY COOL
AIR BEHIND THE STORM CENTER.  THE STORM IS FCST TO WEAKEN SLIGHTLY AS
IT MAKES LANDFALL...BUT THE ETA STILL BRINGS A GOOD OMEGA FIELD
ONSHORE AT 700/850 MB WITH THE AXIS NEAR THE GOLDEN GATE BY 00Z FRI. 
GIVEN THIS TIMING...AND THE FACT THAT WERE DEALING WITH A CUTOFF LOW
...THE CURRENT FCST OF RAIN LIKELY ALL THE WAY S TO MRY ON THU MAY
BE JUST A TAD FAST...BUT THE EVENT IS TOO FAR OUT IN THE FUTURE TO BE
MORE SPECIFIC WITH TIMING RIGHT NOW.  AT ANY RATE IT LOOKS LIKE OUR
FCST AREA WILL GET ANOTHER RESPECTABLE RAIN THU PM INTO FRI AM.

ONE THING TO WATCH IS THAT THE ETA SEEMS TO BE UNDERDOING THE SURFACE
LOWS.  THE WELL DEVELOPED...TIGHTLY WOUND SYSTEM NEAR 47/137 IS
INITIALIZED BY THE ETA AS ONLY A 1003 MB LOW WHILE THE NGM HAS IT AT
993 MB...OBVIOUSLY MUCH CLOSER TO THE TRUTH.  HOWEVER...BOTH MODELS
FCST THE NEXT SYSTEM AROUND 1005 MB BY 00Z FRI AS IT APPROACHES THE
CA COAST.  MODELS ALSO AGREE ON THE 00Z FRI POSITION OF THE CUTOFF...
NEAR 39/128.

IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...FRI SHOULD BE SHOWERY AS THE CUTOFF DROPS
SEWD JUST OFFSHORE.  WOULDNT BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOME TSTMS ON FRI
ESPECIALLY FROM I-80 S.  BY 12Z SAT THE MODELS DIVERGE AS USUAL WITH
THE MRF/UK BRINGING THE CUTOFF WELL INLAND INTO SOCAL WHILE THE
EURO/CANADIAN/NOGAPS STILL KEEP IT OFFSHORE.  AT ANY RATE FRI AND

WATER VAPOR SATPIX INDICATE OUR OFFSHORE STORM IS DEVELOPING INTO A
CUTOFF AS FCST.  ITS POSITION...NEAR 39/129 AS OF 21Z...IS A LITTLE
NW OF THE FCST AVN LOCATION.  ALTHOUGH THE STORM CONTINUES TO BE
RELUCTANT TO MOVE ONSHORE IT DOES HAVE SOME GOOD DYNAMICS AS
INDICATED ON RADAR BY THE BAND OF HEAVY RAIN JUST EDGING ONTO THE SAN
MATEO CY COAST.  HALF MOON BAY HAS BEEN UNDER THIS BAND FOR AWHILE
AND HAS HAD ABOUTN AN INCH OF RAIN ALREADY...WHILE AREAS 15 MILES
TO THE E HAVE HAD JUST A FEW SPRINKLES.  THE BAND IS GRADUALLY EDGING
SEWD AND SHOULD BRING A COUPLE HOURS OF HEAVY RAIN TO THE SANTA CRUZ
MTNS LATE THIS AFTN.  SURFACE OBS INDICATE THE ERN EDGE OF THE HEAVY
RAIN BAND IS ALSO THE WIND SHIFT LINE...WITH WINDS VEERING FROM SE TO
W AT THAT POINT.  THE BAND IS IN THE RIGHT REAR QUADRANT OF THE SSWLY
JET E OF THE TROF AXIS.  

IT STILL LOOKS LIKE OUR ENTIRE FCST AREA WILL GET WET...BUT AREAS
WELL INLAND AND IN SERN MRY COUNTY MAY NOT TIP THE BUCKET TIL AFTER
00Z.  THE STORM CONTINUES TO MOVE SLOWER THAN FCST BY THE MODELS...
BUT WOULDNT BE SURPRISED TO SEE IT PICK UP SPEED TNGT AS THE SUPPOSED
KICKER IN THE GULF OF AK APPROACHES 50/140.  WITH THE ONGOING
DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM AND THE FCST OF AN INCREASING
NEGATIVE TILT DIFFLUENT CONFIGURATION OF THE CUTOFF LATE TNGT/MON...
WILL LEAVE SHOWERS/TSTMS IN THE FCST ABOUT AS ON THE MORNING ZONES. 
BEST CHC OF TSTMS ON MON APPEARS TO BE INLAND MRY COUNTY...CLOSEST TO
THE CUTOFF CENTER AND THE ASSOCIATED CORE OF COLD AIR.  THE SHOWERS
WILL END FROM NW TO SE MON AFTN/NIGHT AS THE CUTOFF CONTINUES EWD
THRU SOCAL.  

IN THE WAKE OF THE CUTOFF...A DEEP NWLY FLOW IS FCST TO DEVELOP WITH
A RATHER STRONG ONSHORE SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT.  THIS WILL ENSURE
CONTINUING RATHER COOL WEATHER FOR OUR FCST AREA ON TUE DESPITE GOOD
WARMING ALOFT...AND WITH THIS MARINE INVERSION DEVELOPING EXPECT
AREAS OF MORNING STRATUS ON TUE...BURNING OFF IN MOST AREAS DURING
THE AFTN.

AS MENTIONED THIS MRNG THE EXTENDED OUTLOOK KEEPS WED DRY...THEN 3 OF
THE 5 MEDIUM RANGE MODELS FCST THE NEXT TROF TO MOVE INTO CA THU WITH
RAIN BECOMING LIKELY IN THE N...FOLLOWED BY DRYING AGAIN FRI.

SO FAR THE INCOMING WEATHER SYSTEM HAS BEEN SINGULARLY UNIMPRESSIVE. 
THERE HAS BEEN SOME LIGHT RAIN IN THE N BAY...AND THATS ALL.  RADAR
INDICATES THE RAIN WONT START IN SFO TIL LATE MORNING...PROBABLY NOT
TIL AT LEAST NOON HERE IN MRY...AND IT WILL BE LIGHT AFTER IT DOES
BEGIN.  UPDATED THE ZONES TO DELAY THE ONSET OF THE RAIN TDA.  IF ONE
BELIEVES THE ETA WE WONT GET MUCH RAIN...IF ANY...TNGT AND MON
EITHER.  HOWEVER...THE NGM ROTATES SHOWERS AROUND THE N SIDE OF THE
SYSTEM TNGT/MON AFTER IT BECOMES A CUTOFF LOW AND MOVES INTO SOCAL. 
THIS IS A FEASBLE SOLUTION AS THE CUTOFF IS FCST TO ASSUME A NEGATIVE
TILT DIFFLUENT CONFIGURATION TNGT...WHICH WILL ENHANCE UPWARD
VERTICAL MOTION AND SHOULD RESULT IN CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT...WHICH
WILL THEN ROTATE AROUND THE LOW CENTER INTO OUR AREA FROM THE SE TNGT
AND FROM THE E ON MON.  SO THE THEORY GOES.  WE HAVE BEEN BURNED ON
THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM BEFORE WHEN THE ADVERTISED FRONTAL RAIN FIZZLED
OUT...WE GAVE UP ON THE SYSTEM...AND THEN THE SHOWERS AND TSTMS COME
ROLLING IN AFTER WE TOOK THEM OUT OF THE FCST.  SO...WONT TAKE THEM
OUT OF THE FCST FOR TNGT/MON...AT LEAST NOT YET.  WE WILL MONITOR
DEVELOPMENTS TDA...CHECK OUT THE AVN RUN WHEN IT COMES IN...AND
EVALUATE THE SITUATION AGAIN THIS AFTN.

IN THE LONGER RANGE THE MRF HAS BACKED OFF ON THE STRONG FAST TROF IT
FCST TO MOVE INTO CA ON WED...AND NOW MOVES IT INTO OUR AREA IN
WEAKER FORM ON THU.  THIS IS STILL FASTER THAN THE UK/CANADIAN MODELS
BUT IS CLOSE TO THE EURO/NOGAPS SOLUTIONS.

EASTWARD MOVEMENT OF FRONTAL BAND IS VERY SLOW THIS EVENING. SIX
HOURS AGO EKA RADAR SHOWED RAIN JUST BEGINNING TO MOVE ONTO THE FAR N
COAST...AND NOW IT HAS MOVED INLAND OVER NW CA LESS THAN 100 MILES.
KMUX RADAR IS STARTING TO DETECT PRECIP ABOUT 70 MILES OFF THE SONOMA
COUNTY COAST...BUT WITH CURRENT SPEED OF FRONT IT WILL BE ABOUT
MIDNIGHT BEFORE RAIN FALLS IN THE NORTHWEST PORTION OF OUR FORECAST
AREA. UPPER FLOW PARALLEL TO SURFACE FRONT IS THE REASON FOR THE SLOW
EWD PROGRESSION AND UPPER TROF IS FORECAST TO CONTINUE TO MOVE VERY
SLOWLY EAST THRU THE NIGHT. LATEST ETA HAS SLOWED THINGS DOWN AND
HAVE DONE THE SAME WITH THE ZONES THIS EVENING. HAVE CUT BACK ON POPS
TONIGHT IN THE ZONES SOUTH OF SAN FRANCISCO AND CHANGED WORDING
EVERYWHERE TO DELAY ONSET OF PRECIP AND ALSO DELAY TRANSITION TO
SHOWERS ON SUNDAY. BOTH 00Z ETA AND NGM ENHANCE PRECIP SUNDAY
AFTERNOON AS VORT MAX SWINGS AROUND BASE OF UPPER TROF INTO CENTRAL
CA. UPPER LOW WILL CUTOFF OFF THE CENTRAL COAST SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND
THIS MAY DELAY SURFACE FRONTAL PASSAGE EVEN MORE. LARGE POOL OF COOL
AIR BEHIND FRONT WILL SPILL ACROSS OUR AREA SUNDAY NIGHT...
DESTABALIZING AIRMASS ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A FEW THUNDERSTORMS.
PREVALENCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON MONDAY WILL DEPEND ON HOW
QUICKLY THE CLOSED LOW MOVES TO THE SSE. MOST SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM
ACTIVITY ON MONDAY WILL BE IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE DISTRICT
NEAREST THE UPPER LOW.

MRF IS THE ODD MODEL OUT IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...DROPPING ANOTHER
SIGNIFICANT TROF INTO OUR REGION ON WEDNESDAY WITH AN UPPER LOW
CUTTING OFF OVER CNTRL CA WENDES NIGHT. ALL OTHER MEDIUM RANGE MODELS
ARE SLOWER AND WEAKER WITH THIS NEXT SYSTEM AND HAVE WORDED EXTENDED

THE WEATHER IS EVOLVING VERY SLOWLY...WITH RAIN REMAINING OFFSHORE
EVEN IN FAR NWRN CA.  THE FRONT IS ALMOST PARALLEL TO THE UPPER LEVEL
WINDS SO ITS NOT MAKING MUCH PROGRESS.  ETA/AVN INDICATE THAT IT WILL
BEGIN TO MOVE A LITTLE FASTER TNGT AS THE UPPER TROF AXIS REACHES 130
W LONGITUDE...AND THE RIGHT REAR QUADRANT OF THE SWLY JET WILL MOVE
OVER THE BAY AREA WHICH SHOULD ENHANCE UPWARD VERTICAL MOTION.  THERE
IS ALREADY PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IN PLACE JUST OFFSHORE AS 
EVIDENCED BY THE STRATUS FIELD BETWEEN THE COAST AND THE FRONT...SO
WHEN THE SYSTEM APPROACHES AND DYNAMICS KICK IN WE SHOULD START TO
SEE RAIN IN OUR FCST AREA...BUT NOT FOR AWHILE YET.  THE AXIS OF THE
ETAS 850/700 MB OMEGA FIELDS REACHES SFO ABOUT MIDNIGHT TNGT AND
WOULD EXPECT THE RAIN TO BEGIN ABOUT THEN...PROBABLY MID-LATE EVE IN
THE N BAY...JUST BEFORE 12Z IN THE S BAY...AND AROUND DAWN HERE IN
MRY.  SATELLITE PIX SHOW A VAST FIELD OF CELLULAR CLOUDS BEHIND THE
FRONT.  THE STEERING WINDS WILL RETAIN A WLY COMPONENT SUN AFTN/EVE
AND DRIVE THESE CLOUDS ONSHORE TO GIVE US NUMEROUS POSTFRONTAL
SHOWERS.  THE TROF AXIS ITSELF IS NOT FCST TO MOVE ASHORE UNTIL LATE
SUN NGT.  BY THAT TIME THE TROF WILL BECOME A CLOSED LOW...WINDING
UP AROUND PT CONCEPTION AT 12Z MON.  EXPECT THE SHOWERS TO DECREASE
LATE SUN NGT...ESPECIALLY IN THE N BAY...AFTER THE TROF AXIS PASSES
THRU AND THE CUTOFF HEADS S OF OUR AREA.  

MON PRESENTS A SOMEWHAT TRICKY FCST.  AVN FCSTS THE CUTOFF TO RAMBLE
LEISURELY EWD THRU SOCAL...WELL S OF OUR FCST AREA.  HOWEVER...THE
AIRMASS OVER US WILL REMAIN COOL...AND FAIRLY MOIST/UNSTABLE...
ESPECIALLY S OF SFO.  THE AVN FCSTS GOOD THICKNESS DIFFLUENCE OVER
OUR AREA IN AN ELY FLOW ALOFT OVER THE N SIDE OF THE CUTOFF.  THIS
IS A DECENT SETUP FOR SHOWERS/TSTMS DEVELOPING OVER THE SIERRA AND
CNTRL VALLEY TO TRACK WWD INTO OUR AREA IN THE LATE SUN NGT THRU MON
TIME FRAME...ESPECIALLY FROM SFO S IN AREAS CLOSEST TO THE LOW.  THE
BEST SETUP FOR THIS WILL BE LATE SUN NGT/EARLY MON MRNG WHICH REDUCES
THE CHANCE OF CONVECTION SOMEWHAT...TSTM LOVERS WOULD PREFER THE
PRIME CONDITIONS TO BE IN THE AFTN HOURS.  STILL...ITS WORTH
MENTIONING A CHANCE OF TSTMS IN THE ZONES SUN NGT/MON...ESPECIALLY
FROM S OF SFO.  

AS MENTIONED IN THE MRNG DISCUSSION...THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS BRING
ANOTHER FAIRLY DEEP TROF INTO CA BY MIDWEEK...WITH THE MRF THE

ETA IS A FEW HOURS SLOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS RUN...SPREADING THE BULK
OF THE MOISTURE/OMEGA OVER THE BAY AREA AFTER 00Z THIS AFTN WITH THE
LEADING EDGE OF THE RAIN ALMOST TO MRY BY 12Z SUN.  THIS CORRESPONDS
WELL WITH CURRENT FCST TIMING...WHICH ANTICIPATED THE PREVIOUS ETA
RUN BEING TOO FAST.  ON SUN THE OMEGA CONTINUES SE ACROSS MRY COUNTY
WITH A 700 MB MOISTURE DECREASING SHARPLY IN ITS WAKE...BUT THE ETA
FCSTS ABUNDANT MOISTURE CONTINUING AT 850/950 MB AND WITH THE
POSTFRONTAL AIRMASS BEING COOL AND UNSTABLE WE SHOULD SEE MANY
SHOWERS OVER OUR FCST AREA ON SUN.  THE NEW ETA IS CONSISTENT WITH
PREVIOUS RUNS IN DEVELOPING THE TROF INTO A CLOSED LOW AND MOVING IT
TO NEAR PT CONCEPTION BY 12Z MON...FAR ENOUGH S TO BRING A DRYING
TREND TO THE NRN BAY AREA BY THAT TIME.  HOWEVER...THERE WILL BE A
GOOD CHANCE OF WRAPAROUND SHOWERS MOVING FROM THE SE INTO OUR FCST
AREA FROM ABOUT SFO S ON MON AND THE AIRMASS COULD BE UNSTABLE ENOUGH
FOR A FEW TSTMS THAT AFTN.

AFTER A BREAK ON TUE...THE MRF NOW DRIVES ANOTHER DEEP TROF INTO OUR

OUR N ON THAT DAY.  THE OTHER MEDIUM RANGE MODELS FCST A SIMILAR
PATTERN BUT ARE ALL WEAKER...SLOWER...OR BOTH WITH THE TROF...

THE UPPER LEVEL LOW THAT MOVED DOWN THE COAST OVERNIGHT IS NOW
CENTERED NEAR SAN DIEGO AND IS CONTINUING TO MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD.
SKIES HAVE CLEARED OVER MOST OF THE BAY AREA AND CENTRAL COAST TODAY
AS THE RIDGE BUILDS AND NORTHERLY FLOW ALOFT DEVELOPS OVER THE STATE.
TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED A FEW DEGREES OVER YESTERDAY BUT REMAIN ON
THE COOL SIDE AND MOSTLY IN THE 50S. THE RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD
ON FRIDAY AND THICKNESSES INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY ALLOWING FOR SEVERAL
DEGREES OF WARMING ON FRIDAY. THIS WILL BRING TEMPERATURES UP CLOSER
TO NORMAL. A 974MB LOW CENTERED IN THE GULF OF AK WILL REMAIN FAIRLY
STATIONARY WHICH WILL KEEP THE FRONT...CURRENTLY OFF THE PACNW
COAST...OFFSHORE THROUGH FRIDAY. THIS FRONT WILL THEN SLOWLY SAG
SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH CA SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. THUS THE NEXT CHANCE
FOR RAINFALL IN THE BAY AREA WILL BE LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON.
DIFFICULT FORECAST FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD. MODELS IN AGREEMENT ON
DEVELOPING A TROUGH OR CUTOFF LOW WEST OF CA ON SUNDAY. THIS SEEMS
REASONABLE AS THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME OF YEAR FOR THESE TYPES OF
SYSTEMS TO DEVELOP. BUT MODELS ARE NOTORIOUSLY BAD AT PREDICTING THE
MOVEMENT OF THESE SYSTEMS. IF THE LOW SHOULD CUTOFF IT COULD REMAIN
OFFSHORE FOR SEVERAL DAYS WHICH WOULD GIVE CENTRAL CA WARM AND SUNNY
CONDITIONS. BUT IF THE LOW SHOULD MOVE INLAND THIS WOULD MEAN
UNSTABLE CONDITIONS WITH SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS AT THE
COAST BUT REMAINING DRY INLAND. TO EARLY TO TELL WHICH WAY SCENARIO
IT WILL BE SO WILL HAVE TO BROADBRUSH THE EXTENDED FORECAST.

DIVING SEWD TO AROUND 35/130 AT THIS WRITING.  THE NEW ETA HAS A
PRETTY GOOD HANDLE ON THE SYSTEM...MOVING AN AREA OF OMEGA THRU OUR

HOWEVER...THE COMMA IS GENERALLY TRACKING FASTER AND FARTHER W THAN
EARLIER ANTICIPATED.  SATELLITE LOOPS AND THE NEW ETA OMEGA FCSTS
INDICATE THAT LITTLE OR NO RAIN WILL FALL IN THE N BAY AND E OF THE E

PLEASANT-SUNNY DAY ACROSS COASTAL SECTIONS OF CENTRAL CA AND MOST OF
THE REMAINDER OF NRN/CENTRAL CA. FEW CU CLOUDS HAVE DEVELOPED OVER
THE COASTAL MOUNTAINS IN THE COOL-SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE WITH
MORE TO THE S AND OVER THE SRN SIERRA. SATELLITE SHOWS MORE SC-TYPE
CLOUDS ALONG SOME OF THE CENTRAL COAST BEACHES. THIS IS ALL OCCURRING
WITH A WEAK-TRANSITORY SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS THE AREA THIS
AFTERNOON FORECAST TO SHIFT EWD TONIGHT.

NEXT UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT HEADING RAPIDLY EWD TOWARD
OREGON/NRN CA COAST THIS AFTERNOON. SATELLITE SHOWS PATTERN AS
SOMEWHAT COMPLEX AT THIS TIME. MAIN COLD AIR MASS REMAINS N OF
FRONT...MOSTLY N OF 50N WHILE FRONT AND SRN PORTION OF TROF ARE
AROUND 40-45N. ALSO...MOST OF THE TROPICAL MOISTURE THAT WAS
ENTRAINED WITH THIS SYSTEM FROM W OF HAWAII HAS BEEN CUT OFF. IF COLD
AIRMASS N OF 50N REMAINED TO THE N AND WITH TROPICAL CONNECTION ABOUT
ENDED...SYSTEM WOULD ONLY BE IN THE WEAK-MODERATE INTENSITY RANGE AS
IT MOVED INTO THE SF BAY REGION. HOWEVER...COMPUTER MODELS HAVE BEEN
FAIRLY CONSISTENT IN PULLING SWD A POCKET OF COLD AIR FROM N OF 50N
AND MIXING IT WITH THE FRONT AS IT MOVES THOUGH FOR A MODERATELY
STRONG COLD FRONT. ETA MODEL...ESPECIALLY TRENDS STRENGTHENING OF THE
SYSTEM. BEST GUESS AT THIS TIME IS THAT ETA MODEL IS TOO STRONG-TOO
WET BUT STILL IN THE BALLPARK. EXPERIMENTAL MM5 MODEL HAS DONE WELL
WITH MANY OF THESE COLD FRONTS THIS LATE WINTER AND HAS SIMILIAR
TIMING BUT SLIGHTLY DRIER. WILL BASE FORECAST ON THIS SCENARIO...
TRIMING BACK ON ETA PRECIP A LITTLE. THUS...RAIN TRENDED TO SPREAD
SOUTHWARD OVER THE AREA FROM ABOUT MID MORNING IN THE N TO LATE
EVENING IN THE SOUTH. PRECIP AMOUNTS LIKELY SOMEWHERE IN THE INCH TO
1.5 INCH RANGE IN N SF BAY COUNTIES...AROUND AN INCH SAN FRANCISCO...
A HALF INCH OR SO SJC AND MRY AREAS WITH USUAL HIGHER AMOUNTS IN THE
SANTA CRUZ AND MONTEREY COUNTY MOUNTAINS. AS A COMPARISON...THE LAST
WEATHER SYSTEM WITH THIS AMOUNT OF PRECIP WAS ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF
AGO...THU..FEB 25.  

SHOWERS...POSSIBLY SOME FAIRLY HEAVY AND SNOW LEVELS DROPPING TO
AROUND 2500 FEET EXPECTED MON NIGHT BEHIND FRONT...AS NEG TILT UPPER
TROF MOVES THROUGH. AREA SHOULD GRADUALLY BEGIN CLEARING AROUND MID
MORNING ON TUE WITH RIDGING OVER THE AREA THROUGH WED NIGHT. 

ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TROF...SEEN IN SATELLITE NEAR THE DATELINE IS
FORECAST IN MEDIUM RANGE MODELS TO MOVE INTO NRN CA THU. MRF MODEL IS
QUITE STRONG WITH THIS SYSTEM...NOGAPS IS VERY WEAK. BOTH EUOR AND UK
MODELS ARE A LITTLE WEAKER THAN MRF BUT MUCH STRONGER THAN NOGAPS.

300 AM PST FRI MAR 5 1999

SATELLITE SHOWS ZONAL FLOW ACROSS CALIFORNIA WITH A WEAK BAROCLINIC
LEAF WEST OF CAPE MENDOCINO AND MONTEREY MOVING EAST AT ABOUT 60
KNOTS. A VERY WEAK LOW PRESSURE IS MORE EVIDENT ON THE SATELLITE
PICTURE THAN THE SURFACE ANALYSIS AT 46N 143W. COLD AIR IS FLOWING
SOUTH OVER THE ALASKAN PENINSULA BEHIND THIS LOW AND A WEAK FRONT IS
EVIDENT.

MODEL AGREEMENT IS BROAD IN THE GENERALITIES AND POOR IN THE
SPECIFICS...ESPECIALLY PRECIPITATION. THE ETA IS THE
DRIEST...BRINGING IN NO PRECIPITATION AT ALL FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO
FORECAST OFFICE ZONES. THE ETA INSTEAD DROPS THE LOW MORE
SOUTHEASTERLY UNTIL BY 00Z SUNDAY RAIN IS 150 MILES W OF SAN
FRANCISCO STRETCHING NEARLY THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE STATE...BUT
OFFSHORE. THE NGM BRINGS LIGHT RAIN OVER THE NORTHWEST THIRD OF THE
STATE FROM ABOUT MONTEREY NORTHWARD AND THE AVIATION MODEL SPREADS
RAIN OVER A WIDE AREA NORTH OF A LINE FROM OXNARD TO TONAPAH.  

SEVERAL CONSIDERATIONS LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE ETA MODEL
WILL VERIFY BEST.  FIRST THE MERIDIONAL FLOW WEST OF 160W IS LIKELY
TO KEEP THE TROUGH FROM ADVANCING AS QUICKLY AS THE AVIATION
SUGGESTS. THIS IN TURN WOULD HOLD THE LOW PRESSURE A LITTLE CLOSER TO
THE SOUTHEAST PATH FORECAST BY THE ETA.  SECOND THE LOW CIRCULATION
SUGGESTS THAT THE SPEED OF THE MODEL IS TOO FAST WITH THIS
SYSTEM. THIRD DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOW OVER NEVADA BY THE AVIATION AND
THE EXTENSION OF THE HEAT TROUGH OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ITS
CONVERSION INTO A DYNAMIC LOW BELOW 1000 MB SEEMS UNLIKELY IN THIS
PRESENT SCENARIO.

THIS CHANGES SEVERAL FORECASTS ON SATURDAY...THE PRECIPITATION WILL
BE LIMITED TO A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS IN ESSENTIALLY UNSTABLE AIR BUT
LESS THAN MOIST AIR.  THE LOW THAT REMAINS OFFSHORE IN THE ETA
SCENARIO WILL REDUCE THE ONSHORE FLOW ALONG THE CALIFORNIA COAST AND
FINALLY TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE WARMER THAN MOS DUE TO THE SUNSHINE
THAT FILTERS THROUGH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES...LACK OF COOLING FROM THE
RAIN AND THE LIGHT SEABREEZES RESULTING.

WITH SO MUCH DIVERGENCE BETWEEN THE MODELS BY 48 HOURS...MAKING A
72 HOUR FORECAST IS ONLY SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.  NEVERTHELESS RAIN
CHANCES APPEAR TO INCREASE SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...MAINLY
NORTH...WITH DRYER PERIODS SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...EXCEPT THAT THE
EXTREME NORTHWEST PART OF THE STATE WILL SEE RAIN BY MONDAY FROM THE
NEXT SYSTEM. IN THE WETTEST POSSIBLE MODEL THIS LAST SYSTEM IS
FORECAST TO BE CONSIDERABLY STRONGER...BRINGING A 988 MB LOW TO
VANCOUVER ISLAND BY 12Z TUESDAY AND SPREADING CHANCES OF LIGHT TO
MODERATE RAIN AT LEAST DOWN TO THE MONTEREY PENINSULA DURING THE DAY
TUESDAY.

CLOUDS.  EXPECT THE CRUD TO DISSIPATE BY MIDDAY AS LOW LEVEL
INVERSION IS VERY WEAK AND MODELS FCST SOME NLY OFFSHORE COMPONENT TO

IN DEVELOPING THE COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS IMPULSE AND MOVING
IT INTO NRN/CENTRAL CA COASTAL SECTIONS

THE SAME GENERAL AREA FRI-SAT. TIMING OF PRECIP EVENTS THAT FAR OUT
IS UNRELIABLE AND MRF HAS BEEN POOR BEYOND ABOUT 5 DAYS...MUCH TOO
WET. HOWEVER...CLIMATE PREDICTION CENTER AT NCEP IS INDICATING AS
MUCH AS 7-8 INCHES OF PRECIP CENTERED ON THE MENDOCINO COAST BETWEEN
WED-MON - 5-10 DAY OUTLOOK PERIOD...BASED ON THE MRF. EVEN IF THIS IS

A RISK OF HEAVY RAIN IN THE N BAY BY MIDDAY THU WHILE AREAS FROM MRY

SUBSIDENCE FROM RIDGING AHEAD OF NEXT SYSTEM PARTIALLY CLEARED SKIES
AND RESULTED IN A PLEASANT DAY TODAY WITH RELATIVELY WARM TEMPS.
RIDGING WILL ALSO ACT TO DELAY ONSET OF RAIN IN OUR AREA AND WILL
LIKELY MEAN RAIN WILL NOT DEVELOP AS FAR SOUTH AS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.
APPEARS THIS SYSTEM IS QUITE SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY/LAST NIGHTS AS FAR
AS LOCATION OF HEAVIEST RAIN...NAMELY THE NORTHERN SAN FRANCISCO BAY
AREA. ALSO...AS WITH LAST SYSTEM...WARM ADVECTION WILL BE THE PRIMARY
SOURCE OF PRECIP CREATION AND WE WILL NEVER REALLY SEE A COLD FRONTAL
PASSAGE. SO...PRIMARY FORECAST CONCERN WILL BE TIMING OF ONSET OF
PRECIP AND WHETHER RAIN WILL BECOME HEAVY IN THE NORTH BAY COUNTIES.
ETA HOLDS ONTO SURFACE RIDGE OVER CENTRAL CA LONGER THAN THE OTHER
MODELS AND AS A RESULT...WARM ADVECTION REALLY DOESNT GET GOING OVER
MOST OF THE BAY AREA UNTIL THURSDAY AND HEAVIEST RAIN WILL HOLD OFF
TIL THEN. AVN PUSHES SURFACE RIDGE S FASTER AND DEVELOPS RAIN AS FAR
S AS SAN JOSE TONIGHT. BASED ON CURRENT TRAJECTORY OF WARM FRONTAL
CLOUD MASS ON SATELLITE LOOP...BELIEVE THE ETA IS CLOSER TO REALITY
AND WILL LIMIT POPS AT CHANCE OR SLIGHT CHANCE FOR MOST OF THE BAY
AREA TONIGHT WITH RAIN DEVELOPING MOST EVERYWHERE ON THURSDAY. WITH
ONLY WEAK WARM ADVECTION FROM MONTEREY SOUTH AND NO COLD FRONT TO
PUSH RAIN BAND SOUTH...BELIEVE CHANCE POPS ARE SUFFICIENT FOR MRY
AREA THURS/THURS NIGHT. RAIN RATES WILL BE MOSTLY MODERATE TO LOCALLY
HEAVY IN NORTH BAY THURSDAY. WITH CURRENT SOIL SATURATION AND STREAM
LEVELS...SEVERAL HOURS OF MODERATE RAIN IS ENOUGH TO PRODUCE SHARP
RISES ON RIVERS THERE AND WILL NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THAT AREA
THURSDAY.

ITS A QUIET NIGHT IN THE CWA.  MAIN WEATHER ELEMENT AT PRESENT IS THE
MASS OF PREFRONTAL HIGH CLOUDINESS DRIFTING THRU OUR AREA.  THESE
CLOUDS WILL PRECLUDE EXTENSIVE FOG FORMATION...AND SHOULD COMBINE
WITH WARMER AIR ALOFT TO KEEP MIN TEMPS WELL ABOVE LAST NIGHTS

WILL STILL BE SOME PATCHES OF FROST THRU THE INTERIOR VALLEYS.

MOISTURE/OMEGA FOR OUR FCST AREA TIL EARLY SAT MRNG...THEN THE OMEGA

CONTINUES. NW FLO IS QUITE BRISK THIS AFTERNOON WITH GUSTS TO 33 KT

RELAXES. ALTHOUGH AIRMASS IS QUITE COOL...THE SLOWLY DECREASING WINDS

FORMATION UNTIL LATER TONIGHT. WEAK TROF HANGS BACK OVER OUR AREA ON

RAIN BAND IS MAKING ITS WAY STEADILY TOWARD OUR COAST AND RADAR WOULD
INDICATE RAIN WOULD BEGIN THE THE N BAY AT ANY TIME AND SPREAD S TO

WEAK UPPER LEVEL (U/L) RIDGE OVER THE STATE WILL GIVE WAY TO AN
INTENSIFYING TROF APPROACHING FROM THE WEST. THE RIDGE WILL KEEP MOST
HIGH CLOUDS N OF SFO BAY AREA AND ALLOW A WEAK SURFACE HIGH TO MOVE
INTO THE GREAT BASIN. FLOW WILL BE LIGHT OFFSHORE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS
UNTIL A COLD FRONT INCREASES THE SLY WINDS OVER THE AREA ON SAT.
FIRST PRECIP SHOULD MOVE INTO NRN SONOMA COUNTY SAT AM PER AVN AND
NOGAPS...WITH INCREASING AMOUNTS SPREADING E AND S THRU THE DAY.
TOTAL PRECIP WILL LIKELY BE 2-3 ACROSS NRN SONOMA AND NAPA COUNTIES.
LESSER AMOUNTS OF .5 TO 1.5 ARE EXPECTED IN THE VALLEYS AROUND SFO
BAY. STEADY RAINS WILL CHANGE TO SHOWERS SUN AS THE U/L TROF MOVES
INTO NV. NEXT FRONT SHOULD BE WEAKER AND AFFECT ONLY NRN CA N OF SFO
BAY TUE NITE OR WED PER NOGAPS. THE WETTER MRF BRINGS PRECIP TO MRY
BAY...ALONG WITH A BIT STRONGER SHORT WAVE. MRF FCSTS THE WLY POLAR
JET TO INTENSIFY TOWARDS THE END OF NEXT WEEK AND BRING MORE RAIN TO

BENIGN WEATHER PATTERN SET UP FOR REMAINDER OF FORECAST PERIOD. UPPER

MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND MILD - LATE JAN TEMPERATURES. SOME HIGH CLOUDS
FILTERING SWD FROM BAROCLINIC BAND OVER OREGON WILL BE OVER THE

TONIGHT AND THU. OTHERWISE...FOG IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY...ONE OR
TWO SMALL PATCHES OF FOG IN THE COASTAL VALLEYS AND FROSTY EARLY

FRI. 

BY FRI...INTO THE WEEKEND...UPPER RIDGE WILL PROGRESS EWD INTO GREAT

RIDGE DEVELOPING IN THE BERRING SEA. EARLIER AVN MODEL AS WELL AS
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS MOVE THIS HIGH AMPLITUDE TROF IN NEAR W COAST ON
SAT WITH A MODERATELY STRONG COLD FRONT TRENDED TO MOVE ACROSS MOST

OVER THE WEST. WEAK SURFACE GRADIENT KEEPING WINDS LIGHT ACROSS OUR
AREA...EXCEPT NEAR THE EAST BAY WHERE SOME NORTHERLY BREEZES HAVE
DEVELOPED AND ARE EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGH THE EVENING. OVER THE

STEADILY WITH TIME. THUS...WOULD EXPECT A WARMING TREND EXCEPT FOR
AREAS NEAR THE DELTA THAT MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY NIGHT/MORNING VALLEY
FOG. ALSO...LOOK FOR A GENERAL INCREASE IN HIGH CLOUDS BY DAY TWO AS
MOISTURE MOVES IN AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING TROUGH.

AS FAR AS THE EXTENDED FORECAST GOES...EXISTING FORECAST FOR RAIN
SPREADING ACROSS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY LOOKS
REASONABLE. THE 00Z MRF BRINGS THE EASTERN PACIFIC TROUGH JUST
OFFSHORE BY SATURDAY MORNING...AND QUICKLY MOVES IT EASTWARD ON
SUNDAY. LOOKING AT THE HEMISPHERIC SCALE...THE MRF AND THE 12Z NOGAPS
SEEM TO CORRECTLY INITIALIZE THE LARGE-SCALE LOW CENTER OVER THE SEA
OF OKHOTSK. BOTH MODELS KEEP THIS LOW AS AN ANCHOR POINT...AND BUILD
A RIDGE NEAR 175W. BY SATURDAY...THE PROGS INDICATE THAT THE WESTERLY
FLOW WILL UNDERCUT THIS RIDGE THUS AIDING THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF

WILL OCCUR CENTRAL OR SOUTHCENTRAL CALIF COAST.

LATEST MODEL RUNS A BIT MORE AGRESSIVE WITH PRECIP OVER CENTRAL
CALIFORNIA THAN THOSE FROM 12Z MONDAY...SHOWING BOTH EARLIER START
AND SOMEWHAT GREATER AMOUNTS.  AS THIS IS A COLD SYSTEM WITH LIMITED

OFFSHORE FROM SANTA BARBARA. IN THE MEANTIME THE COLD FRONT POWERED

THE SE AND MAY BE FELT IN SAN FRANCISCO AS EARLY AS 330Z TUESDAY. IT
IS IN A FAIRLY DRY AIR MASS AND MUCH OF THE SHOWERS EXPECTED FROM IT
HAVE YET TO DEVELOP.  

IT NOW APPEARS THAT THE MODEL MAY BE MOVING THE UPPER LEVEL LOW OUT
TOO EARLY AND THAT IT MAY BE JOINED BY THE IMPULSE FROM THE NW
FIRST...INSTEAD OF REMAINING AS TWO SEPARATE AND DISTINCT SYSTEMS
THAT ROTATE THROUGH THE LONG WAVE TROUGH CENTERED NEAR 115 W.  
A BAND OF UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS JUST BEGINNING TO DROP DOWN OVER OREGON
AND WASHINGTON OUTER WATERS APPEARS TO BE THE FEATURE THAT WILL GIVE
THE SAN FRANCISCO FORECAST AREA A SHOT OF RAIN. THIS WILL LIKELY
BEGIN BEFORE THE TONIGHT PERIOD IS OVER AND END BEFORE NOON TOMORROW. 
NEVERTHELESS...ALTHOUGH DYNAMICS ARE GOOD WITH STRONG MOVEMENT AND
FAIR VERTICAL MOTION...THE ATMOSPHERE IS TOO DRY AND COLD TO GIVE
GOOD PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS FROM THIS SYSTEM AND IT IS MOVING TOO
FAST. LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN INCH STILL SEEMS RIGHT...ALTHOUGH
MOUNTAIN AREAS MAY RECEIVE A LITTLE MORE. SNOW LEVELS WILL BE DOWN.
850-1000 MB THICKNESSES WERE RANGING FROM 1310-1330 M YIELDING SNOW
LEVELS OF 1500-3000 FEET.  IT IS LIKELY THAT ONCE THE RAPIDLY MOVING
SHORTWAVE JOINS THE LOW TOMORROW MORNING THAT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WILL
MOVE OUT RAPIDLY.  THUS THE COOL AIR WILL REMAIN THROUGH THE DAY BUT
THE SUN WILL BREAK THROUGH LATER IN THAT AFTERNOON. THE 18Z MESO ETA

HOWEVER...AND THE COLD AIR WILL BE SHOVED ASIDE BY ANOTHER WARMER AIR
MASS. 

DEPENDING ON THE MODEL CHOSEN...RAIN WILL AGAIN BE MOVING INTO THE

CLOUDY SKIES AND SHOWERS WERE THE LOT IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CWA TODAY
AND REDWOOD CITY REPORTED .01. SPRINKLES WERE FELT IN MANY PLACES AS
THE UPPER LEVEL LOW...NOW JUST SOUTH OF SANTA BARBARA...BEGINS TO
MOVE MORE NEARLY EAST. SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE MAIN LOW
PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE OF 1006 MB IS JUST EAST OF DAGGETT
CALIFORNIA...BUT ANOTHER SECONDARY LOW OF 1009 MB HAS FORMED IN THE
SACRAMENTO VALLEY. THE ETA MODEL HAS THIS LOW DEVELOPING OFFSHORE AT
18Z THEN REFORMING IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY BY 00Z.  SATELLITE
IMAGERY SUGGESTS THAT THE CLOUDY WEATHER BRINGING THE SPRINKLES WILL
SLOWLY MOVE OUT OF THE AREA AS HIGH PRESSURE RIDGES SHARPLY IN.  A
SECOND IMPULSE IN THE UPPER FLOW IS MOVING SE AT 39 KNOTS WHICH WOULD
BRING IT OVER SAN FRANCISCO BY 12Z TUESDAY.  

IT IS STILL UNCERTAIN HOW THE UPPER LEVEL IMPULSE WILL EFFECT THE
SURFACE. CLOSE STUDY OF THE ETA MODEL SUGGEST THAT MOST OF THE
COOLING WILL TAKE PLACE ALOFT AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE
INSTABILITY OVERNIGHT. THE MRF MODEL BRINGS DOWN EVEN LOWER
THICKNESSES THAN THE ETA. ETA COMPUTED LIFTED INDICES WILL FALL TO
NEAR 1 IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA BY 18Z TUESDAY...BUT APPARENTLY
NOT ALL THE INSTABILITY COINCIDES WITH THE MOISTURE AS THE ETA TENDS
TO FAVOR THE MONTEREY BAY AREA OVER THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA IN
PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS AND OMEGA VALUES AT 12Z.  NEVERTHELESS WE CAN
NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF THUNDERSTORMS IN THE AREA.  SINCE
THIS IS A FAST MOVING SYSTEM THAT IS NOT FAVORED BY A LOT OF
MOISTURE...AMOUNTS SHOULD BE LESS THAN ONE QUARTER INCH...AND A FEW
PLACES MAY BE MISSED ENTIRELY. ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH BAY.

IN THE EXTENDED THE MRF IS BRINGING RAIN IN EVERY SEVERAL DAYS...WITH
NOTABLY DRY DAYS IN THE BAY AREA BEING WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY.
HEAVIER RAINS ARE EXPECTED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE A FEW PLACES
HARDLY SEE A BREAK ACCORDING TO THE MODEL.

FCSTS STRONGER THICKNESS DIFFLUENCE OVER THE SFO/MRY BAY AREAS THIS
AFTN THAN THE ETA AND IF IT VERIFIES...THE AIRMASS WOULD CERTAINLY BE
UNSTABLE ENOUGH TO GENERATE SOME CONVECTION.  ETA IS MORE BORDERLINE
WITH WEAKER DYNAMICS.  ALL IN ALL...IT ADDS UP TO A CHANCE OF SHWRS/
TSTMS.  THE N BAY WILL DRY OUT BY LATE AFTN AS THE CUTOFF CENTER
MOVES TO THE S OF THAT AREA BUT THE SHOWER RISK WILL CONTINUE INTO

PROBABLY EARLY IN THE DAY.  THIS STORM IS NOT OVERLY WET BUT IT IS
COLD...SO WE WILL PROBABLY SEE A LOT OF SHOWERS THAT DAY WITH ANOTHER
RISK OF TSTMS...ESPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ALTHOUGH THE COAST

THE EURO/UK/MRF MOVE IT WELL OUT OF OUR DISTRICT TO THE E ON WED AND

PRECIP IN THE CENTRAL COASTAL ZONES HAS JUST ABOUT ENDED AT THIS TIME
WITH ONLY VERY LIGHT AMOUNTS REMAINING IN FRONTAL BAND OVER SRN
MONTEREY COUNTY COASTAL MOUNTAINS. A COUPLE OF REMOTE SITES IN THE
COASTAL/SANTA CRUZ RANGE REPORTED ABOUT 2.5 INCH STORM TOTALS BUT
MOST POPULATED LOCATIONS WERE IN THE 1/3-1/2 INCH RANGE. NO
SIGNIFICANT RISES ON ANY STREAM/RIVER GAGES NOTED. FOR THE SHORT

TOMORROW BUT MOST OF COLD AIR CONVECTIVE SHOWERS ARE WELL OFFSHORE
SPIRALING ABOUT UPPER LOW NEAR 41/125. NEW ETA/NGM MODELS SHOW LOW
DROPING SWD THROUGH SUN THEN MOVING EWD INTO SRN CA SUN NIGHT/MON.
MODELS ALSO KEEP ALMOST ALL ASSOCIATED PRECIP OUT OF CENTRAL COASTAL
ZONES THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...A BIT DRIER COMPARED TO EARLIER
VERSIONS. NEW NGM MOS GUIDANCE ALSO SUGGESTS ONLY SLIGHT CHANCES OF

DROPS THE LOW ALMOST DUE S AND KEEPS IT WELL OFFSHORE. ALL OTHER

BE HIGHER AND RAIN BAND WILL HANG UP OVER MONTEREY AND SAN LUIS
OBISPO COUNTIES TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING. INCREASING SUBTROPICAL
MOISTURE INTO BAND COINCIDING WITH DIGGING UPPER TROF MAY PRODUCE
SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN OVER THE SANTA LUCIA RANGE TONIGHT.
HOWEVER...IF OTHER MODELS VERIFY...ONLY SCATTERED SHOWERS EXPECTED IN

SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE OVER FROM SFO SWD ON SUNDAY AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE A
POSSIBILITY.

LOW...CURRENLY OFF THE CENTRAL OREGON COAST...MOVES SOUTH
TODAY...SOME ENHANCEMENT OF RAIN BAND IS POSSIBLE FROM THE SANTA CRUZ
MOUNTAINS SWD SO WILL KEEP POSSIBILITY OF HEAVY RAIN IN SRN ZONES
TODAY. PRIMARY FORECAST PROBLEM IS DECIDING WHICH MODEL IS HANDLING

HANDLE ON SITUATION. ALSO...WITH THE LATEST RUN...NGM APPEARS TO BE
COMING MORE IN LINE WITH ETA. IF ETA VERIFIES...A WEAK SURFACE LOW

COLD FRONT IS DROPPING SEWD THRU THE BAY AREA...PASSED SFO AT 0830Z. 
THERE HAS BEEN A BAND OF MODERATE/HEAVY RAIN JUST S OF THE FRONT AS
IT MOVES ALONG.  SO FAR THE RAIN HASNT BEEN EXCESSIVE...AND WITH
LITTLE ENHANCEMENT ON THE IR SATELLITE PIX THINGS DONT LOOK TOO
OMINOUS.  HOWEVER...THE ETA DEVELOPS A BAND OF STRONG OMEGA AT 850
AND 700 MB BY 18Z TDA RUNNING THRU THE SRN SFO BAY AREA AND ACROSS
MRY BAY...WHICH ISNT FEATURED ON THE EARLIER PANELS OF THAT MODEL. 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS BAND COINCIDES WITH THE SWD SHIFT OF THE JET
AND THE ARRIVAL OF THE RIGHT REAR JET QUADRANT IN OUR FCST AREA.  IF
THE MODEL IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK...THE ADDED LIFT PROVIDED BY THE JET
COULD INTENSIFY OUR RAIN BAND AS IT MOVES SWD TDA...BRINGING HEAVY
RAIN TO THE SANTA CRUZ MTNS LATER THIS MORNING AND TO THE SANTA
LUCIAS THIS AFTN AND EVE.  THE RAIN WOULD BE OROGRAPHICALLY ENHANCED
BY LOW LEVEL SWLY WINDS AHEAD OF THE FRONT...DECREASING AFTER THE
FRONTAL PASSAGE AS THESE WINDS SHIFT TO NWLY.  FOR NOW WILL SIMPLY
MENTION THE CONTINUING RISK OF HEAVY RAIN S OF SFO TDA BUT WILL WATCH
THE SITUATION CLOSELY.  STREAMS IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY ARE CURRENTLY
VERY LOW BUT THE AREA IS SATURATED AFTER THE HEAVY RAINS EARLIER IN
THE WEEK AND A RETURN OF THE DOWNPOURS WILL CAUSE RAPID RISES ON THE
COUNTYS WATERWAYS.

POSTFRONTAL WEATHER WILL CONSIST OF SHOWERS...WHICH SHOULD BE
NUMEROUS TDA IN THE CLOUD BAND BEHIND THE FRONT.  AS MUCH COLDER AIR
DROPS SWD INTO OUR AREA TNGT THE RESULTING INSTABILITY SHOULD KEEP
LOTS OF SHOWERS GOING.  THE MODELS FCST WIDELY DIFFERING TRACKS OF
THE ONCOMING CUTOFF LOW CURRENTLY DEVELOPING OFF THE PACNW COAST. 
THE ETA FCSTS IT TO BE ABOUT 200 MILES W OF MRY BY SUN AFTN.  THE AVN
FCSTS IT RIGHT OVER MRY BAY...WHILE THE NGM PUTS IT WELL INLAND
AROUND FRESNO.  CURRENTLY THE SYSTEM IS DROPPING ALMOST STRAIGHT S
ALONG 130W AND THINK THE ETA WILL PROBABLY BE MORE ACCURATE.  THIS
WOULD KEEP THE COLDEST AIR OFFSHORE...LIMITING SNOW IN THE BAY AREA
TO THE HIGHEST HILLS...BUT WOULD SET US UP IN A STRONGLY DIFFLUENT
FLOW ON SUN WHICH SHOULD ENHANCE ATMOSPHERIC INSTABILITY ENOUGH TO
SET OFF SOME TSTMS.  WILL GO WITH THIS SCENARIO FOR THE SUN FCST.  IF
ONE OF THE OTHER MODELS VERIFIED WE WOULD SEE LESS SHOWER ACTIVITY
AND COOLER TEMPS.

THE TROFY PATTERN SETTING UP FOR SUN WILL CONTINUE MOST OF NEXT WEEK. 
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS FCST THE SUN CUTOFF TO MOVE OUT OF CA ON MON...TO
BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER STRONG COLD TROF TUE...WHICH MOVES OUT ON WED. 
THERE ARE SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES AMONG THE MODELS BUT THEY ALL HAVE
THE SAME BASIC PATTERN.

COMPLEX WEATHER PATTERN IN PLACE OVER THE EASTERN PACIFIC AND NRN CA
THIS EVENING. BAROCLINIC BAND STRETCHES FROM NRN CA SW TO NEAR
30N/140W. A WAVE HAS DEVELOPED ALONG THIS BAND NEAR 40N/130W.
MEANWHILE...AN UPPER TROF OFF THE PACIFIC NW IS DROPPING S. BASED ON
BUOY AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS...AND CONTRARY TO SATELLITE DATA...IT
APPEARS THE INITIAL SURFACE FRONT HAS PASSED POINT ARENA AND UKIAH
AND IS HEADING SOUTH. RAIN IS ENHANCING OVER SONOMA COUNTY JUST AHEAD
OF THE FRONT WITH MODERATE TO LOCALLY HEAVY AMOUNTS IN THE LAST FEW
HOURS. HAVE UPDATED ZONES TO REFLECT A WIND SWITCH IN THE N BAY
TONIGHT AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. ON SATURDAY...THE WEAK SURFACE LOW
ASSOCIATED WITH THE WAVE OUT AT 40N/130W IS FORECAST BY THE ETA TO
RIDE ALONG THE BAROALINIC BAND AND BE JUST OFFSHORE THE BIG SUR
COAST. AS THIS LOW MOVES TOWARD THE COAST...IT MAY ACT TO SLOW AND
EVEN STALL THE BAND OF HEAVIEST RAIN SOMEWHERE OVER THE BAY AREA.
DIFFICULT TO SAY AT THIS TIME WHERE THIS POSSIBLE HEAVY RAIN BAND
WILL STALL BUT MODELS INDICATE IT WILL BE OVER THE SOUTH BAY SATURDAY
AFTERNOON AND OVER MONTEREY COUNTY SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL NEED TO PAY
PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO STREAMS IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY WHERE SOILS ARE
STILL QUITE SATURATED FROM HEAVY RAINS EARLIER IN THE WEEK. MODELS
DIFFER ON TRACK OF UPPER LOW. ETA HAS IT DROPPING S WELL OFFSHORE...
ABOUT 200 MILES OFF SAN FRANCISCO BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THIS WOULD
KEEP COLDEST AIR ALOFT OVER THE OCEAN AND DIMINISH OUR THUNDERSTORM
THREAT ON SUNDAY...AND ALSO RESULT IN HIGHER SNOW LEVELS. LATEST AVN
IS NOT YET AVAILABLE...BUT PREVIOUS RUN BROUGHT THE UPPER LOW
DIRECTLY OVER THE BAY AREA ON SUNDAY WITH -32 DEGREE C AIR AT 500 MB.
BASED ON THAT...WILL KEEP SUNDAY THUNDERSTORMS IN FORECAST FOR NOW.

IS A BIT STRONGER THAN FORECAST WHICH IS KEEPING THE NEXT SYSTEM
OFFSHORE LONGER THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. EVEN THOUGH THE RIDGE IS
STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP THE RAIN OFFSHORE IT IS A DIRTY RIDGE ALLOWING
MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS TO SPREAD OVER THE STATE. THIS WILL KEEP
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CA MOSTLY CLOUDY THROUGHOUT THE DAY. MODELS
VARY SIGNIFICANTLY ON TIMING AND AMOUNT OF NEXT RAIN EVENT. WHEN
ZONAL FLOW SETS UP OVER CA THE MODELS ARE USUALLY TOO SLOW IN
BRINGING RAIN IN...SO THE FASTEST MODEL IS USUALLY BETTER. BUT WHEN A
RIDGE LIES OVER THE STATE...MODELS TEND TO BE TOO FAST IN BREAKING
DOWN THE RIDGE. SO FOR THIS MORNINGS FORECAST WILL GO WITH THE SLOWER

TRACKS SOUTHWARD DOWN THE PACNW COAST. THIS LOW THEN FORECAST TO MOVE
SLOWLY SOUTHWARD DOWN THE CA COAST THROUGH MONDAY. AS THIS LOW MOVES

MOVING OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE...BUT IT IS RATHER TENUOUS WITH
LITTLE ENHANCEMENT IN THE MOISTURE STREAM BETWEEN 30/155 AND 40/140. 
ALL IN ALL...EVENTS ARE DEVELOPING SLOWLY.  WE SHOULD STILL SEE A
GOOD RAIN EVENT FOR OUR FCST AREA BUT ITS LOOKING LIKE IT WILL TAKE
SOME TIME TO KICK IN...SO UPDATED EVENING ZONES TO SLOW THE TIMING. 
THE NEW ETA IS GOING SLOW...AND USING IT FOR THE BASIC SCENARIO IT
APPEARS THAT THE MAIN RAIN EVENT WILL NOT DEVELOP IN THE N BAY UNTIL
FRI AFTN/EVE...SPREADING DOWN PAST SFO FRI NGT...AND REACHING MRY BY
MIDDAY SAT.  THIS TIMING CORRESPONDS WITH THE FCST MOVEMENT OF THE

A VERY STRONG WNWLY JET IS HOWLING THRU NRN CA...NEW ETA INITIALIZED
300 MB WINDS OVER CAPE MENDOCINO AT 180 KTS.  RIDGING IS ALREADY
DEVELOPING IN THE ERN PAC AND WILL CONTINUE TNGT THRU THU NGT...BUT
THE RIDGE WILL GET INCREASINGLY DIRTY AS A DEEP TROF W OF HAWAII TAPS
THE TROPICS AND SENDS MOISTURE OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE TOWARD THE W
COAST.  THRU MIDNIGHT THU...IT APPEARS FROM THE MOISTURE TRAJECTORY
AND FCST 500 MB HEIGHTS THAT THE BULK OF THIS MOISTURE WILL REMAIN N
OF OUR FCST AREA...THOUGH CLOUDS WILL BE ABUNDANT ESPECIALLY N OF
SFO.  ETA FCSTS OMEGA TO STAY N OF OUR DIST THRU THU EVE...AND
MOISTURE WILL DECREASE AT ALL LEVELS DUE TO THE RIDGING.  THUS WILL
TRIM POPS BACK THRU THU NGT IN MOST AREAS...ESPECIALLY FROM SFO S.

LATE THU NGT THE RIDGE IS FCST TO BEGIN FLATTENING AS MARITIME POLAR
AIR FROM THE GULF OF ALASKA BEGINS TO SURGE SWD.  THIS WILL GRADUALLY
DROP THE MOISTURE BAND BACK INTO OUR AREA.  THE EXACT TIMING OF THIS
IS UNCERTAIN...BUT BELIEVE THE EXISTING FCST OF RAIN IN THE N BAY ON
FRI IS OK AS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE/OMEGA ARE FCST TO DROP INTO THAT AREA
BY FRI AFTN...AND PROBABLY S TO SAN JOSE.  IT MAY TAKE UNTIL FRI NGT
FOR THE MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS TO REACH MRY.  ETA IS FCSTG STRONG
THICKNESS DIFFLUENCE INTO THE SFO/MRY BAY AREAS FRI NGT FOR GOOD
LIFTING.  WE WILL HAVE TO WATCH THE SITUATION CLOSELY FRI NGT/SAT...
THIS SYNOPTIC PATTERN OF A POLAR AIRMASS MERGING WITH A SUBTROPICAL
JET HAS PRODUCED BANDS OF VERY HEAVY RAIN IN SIMILAR CASES IN THE
PAST.  FRI NGT/SAT MAY BE VERY WET IN OUR REGION BEFORE THE COOLER
AIR DROPS INTO OUR FCST AREA AND THE BEST MOISTURE SAGS TO OUR S.

MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE ALL IN BASIC AGREEMENT ON THIS PATTERN...WITH
A LONG WAVE TROF SETTING UP OVER THE W COAST BY SUN.  HOWEVER...THERE
ARE SPEED DIFFERENCES WITH MRF THE SLOWEST MODEL...UK FASTEST...EURO/
NOGAPS IN BETWEEN.  AT ANY RATE NEXT WEEK LOOKS COOL AND UNSETTLED
BUT NOT UNUSUALLY WET.

300 PM PST WED JAN 20 1999

FRONTAL WAVE BLOWING RAPIDLY ACROSS CENTRAL CA THIS AFTERNOON. SYSTEM
HAS PRODUCED SOMEWHAT LESS PRECIP THAN EARLIER INDICATIONS
SUGGESTED...LESS THAT 1/3 INCH REPORTED PAST 6 HOURS SANTA CRUZ
MOUNTAINS. SEVERAL REASONS FOR THIS...SYSTEM IS MOVING VERY RAPIDLY
S/SEWD WITH A 170 KT JET OFFSHORE HELPING. ALSO...SYSTEM MOVING SEWD
DOES NOT PRODUCE THE GOOD OROGRAPHICS NEEDED FOR REALLY HEAVY RAINS
IN THE COASTAL MOUNTAINS. AND...SYSTEM IS IN AN OVERRUNNING FLOW
PATTERN WITH NOT ENOUGH OF A LOW/MID LATITUDE MOISTURE TAP NOR UPWARD
VERTICAL MOTION OR PVA FOR ANY HEAVY PRECIP. A BRIEF PERIOD OF
MODERATE PRECIP IS LIKELY THE BACK EDGE OF THE SYSTEM MOVES
THROUGH...NOW THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. 

MODELS SHOW MAIN JET FLOW...STORM TRACK SHIFTING NWD AFTER CURRENT
IMPULSE MOVES THROUGH. HOWEVER...MODELS SHOW OVERRUNNING PRECIP
CONTINUING...AT LEAST ACROSS NRN CA. ETA SHOWS IT/S NORMAL DRY BIAS
OVER CENTRAL CA SHOWING ALMOST ALL THE RAIN SONOMA COUNTY NWD THU
NGT/FRI WHILE WET BIAS AVN MODEL SHOWS AT LEAST LIGHT PRECIP OVER
ALL THE CENTRAL COAST SWD TO NEAR MORRO BAY. ALTHOUGH WEAK OMEGA
PATTERN AND FAIRLY HIGH HEIGHTS SUGGEST LOW POPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS
WETTER AVN MODEL...EXPECTING AT LEAST LIGHT PRECIP OVER ALL BUT FAR S
END OF DISTRICT ON FRI. THIS IS A FAIRLY TYPICAL SCENARIO IN AN
OVERRUNNING FLOW PATTERN. IF AVN MODEL VERIFIES CLOSE...N SF BAY AREA
COULD STILL SEE SOME MODERATE RAIN ON FRI - BUT MODEL MAY BE OVER
DONE.

IN THE EXTENDED...ALL MEDIUM RANGE MODELS INDICATE ANOTHER CHANGE IN
WEATHER PATTERNS FOR NEXT WEEK. UPPER TROF IS FORECAST TO DEVELOP OFF
THE W COAST LATE FRI THROUGH THE WEEKEND. AS TROF DEVELOPS
OFFSHORE... AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL DEVELOP AND MOVE N TO S
OVER THE DISTRICT ON SAT. TROF IS TRENDED TO CONTINUE DIGGING AS IT
MOVES INTO THE STATE SUN FOR A ENDING OF PRECIP...OVER SRN SIERRA AND
MUCH COOLER WEATHER. FURTHER OUT...MRF CONTINUES WITH A DEEP TROF...
ASSOCIATE LOW H5 HEIGHTS AND CHILLY TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE WEEK. IF
MRF IS CLOSE TO REALITY IN THE ..BEYOND.. EXTENDED PERIOD...A SHOT OF
COLD AIR WITH SHOWERS IS FORECAST TO DROP SWD OVER NRN/CENTRAL
COASTAL CA TUE NGT/WED FOR SNOW AT VERY LOW ELEVATIONS. ALL IN
ALL...PATTERN FOR THE WEEK LOOKS VERY SIMILIAR TO OUR COLD MID DEC

OFF QUICKLY.  NOT SURE WHY THE RAIN HAS BEEN SO PERSISTENT IN THIS
AREA.  CERTAINLY THE MORNING ETA/AVN WERE CLUELESS...BOTH FCST ONLY A
TENTH OF AN INCH OR SO IN THAT AREA TDA.  EVEN THE NEW EVENING ETA
FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXISTENCE OF THE CONTINUING MODERATE TO
HEAVY RAIN IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY.  LOW LEVEL OROGRAPHICS HAVE BEEN
GOOD WITH A SWLY FLOW INTO THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS...ACCOUNTING FOR
THE USUAL HEAVIER PCPN AT HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  ETA INDICATED A
SEMBLANCE OF JET MAX OVER THE AREA EARLIER TDA BUT ITS NOT WELL
DEFINED...AND THE MODEL IS FCSTG IT TO WEAKEN THIS EVE.  BUT THE RAIN
CONTINUES.  WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE NOW FCST TO REMAIN ABUNDANT THRU
WED...AND WITH SWLY WINDS PERSISTING AT LOW LEVELS...SEE NO REASON
WHY IT WILL EVER STOP COMPLETELY IN THE SANTA CRUZ MTNS THRU WED.

NEXT SYSTEM IS MOVING RAPIDLY EWD AND WILL SPREAD A NEW SHOT OF RAIN
ACROSS MOST OF OUR FCST AREA LATE TNGT/TUE MRNG.  ETA INDICATES THE
BEST MOISTURE N OF SFO BUT WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE PLENTIFUL SWD THRU
MONTEREY CY AND GOOD LOW LEVEL OROGRAPHICS...AND SAT PIX INDICATING 
ENHANCED CLOUDS HEADED FOR OUR ENTIRE FCST AREA...THERE WILL BE A
GOOD THREAT OF RAIN ALL THE WAY S THRU MRY COUNTY.  RAIN WILL LET
UP AGAIN LATE TUE BUT SHOULDNT STOP COMPLETELY IN OROGRAPHICALLY
FAVORED AREAS AS THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND SWLY LOW LEVEL ONSHORE
FLOW WILL CONTINUE.

THE BEST STORM OF THE BUNCH WILL BE THE ONE THAT ROARS IN LATE TUE
NGT/EARLY WED.  THIS ONE IS FCST TO HAVE VERY GOOD DYNAMICS WITH
STRONG UPPER LEVEL AND THICKNESS DIFFLUENCE...A HOWLING WLY JET...
AND A MASSIVE OMEGA FIELD ENVELOPING OUR ENTIRE FCST AREA FROM 500 MB
ON DOWN.  THIS STORM SHOULD BRING HEAVY RAIN TO OUR ENTIRE FCST AREA
LATE TUE NGT AND WELL INTO WED.  WE WILL HAVE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON
HYDRO CONDITIONS IN AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS WITH
THIS STORM.  THERE ARE NO FLOODING PROBLEMS THIS EVE DUE TO THE VERY
DRY ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS...BUT CORRALITOS AND SOQUEL CREEKS DID RISE
ABOUT 3 FEET THIS AFTN AND ANOTHER DOWNPOUR ON WED COULD SEND THEM
MUCH HIGHER.  OTHER AREAS HAVE HAD MUCH LESS RAIN TODAY AND CAN
ABSORB A LOT OF MOISTURE BEFORE A FLOODING THREAT ARISES.

EASTERN PACIFIC IR SATELLITE LOOP SHOWS THREE DISTINCT SYSTEMS MOVING
QUICKLY FROM W TO E WITH JET STREAM SUPPORT CENTERED AT ABOUT 40N
LATITUDE. THE FIRST SYSTEM IS BEGINNING TO MOVE ONTO THE N COAST AT
THIS TIME WITH A BAND OF MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN N OF CAPE MENDOCINO.
BANDS OF LIGHT PRECIP EXTEND WELL OUT AHEAD OF THE SURFACE FRONT INTO
THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA...WHERE LIGHT RAIN HAS BEEN FALLING OFF
AND ON ALL DAY FROM SAN FRANCISCO NWD AND OVER THE SANTA CRUZ
MOUNTAINS. RAIN RATES WILL BEGIN TO PICK UP EARLY THIS EVENING IN THE
NORTH BAY AS THE MAIN FRONTAL BAND APPROACHES AND COULD BE BRIEFLY
HEAVY JUST BEFORE FRONTAL PASSAGE IN THE N BAY. FRONT WILL PUSH S
INTO MONTEREY COUNTY BY EARLY MONDAY MORNING. BY THEN...THE UPPER
FLOW PATTERN BECOMES ZONAL AND FRONTAL BAND WILL STALL AND DISSIPATE.
MOIST ONSHORE FLOW WILL CONTINUE AND SHOWERS ARE LIKELY FOR MUCH OF
THE AREA THROUGH MONDAY EVENING. ALSO...ONSHORE FLOW AND PLENTY OF
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL KEEP A LOT OF CLOUDS AROUND THRU MONDAY
NIGHT. THEN...ON TUES...THE AVN RIPPLES A SHORTWAVE THROUGH THE ZONAL
FLOW AND INTO NRN CA...INCREASING PRECIP CHANCES ONCE AGAIN. THIS
FEATURE MOST LIKELY THE SYSTEM SEEN ON SATELLITE OUT NEAR 145W...AND
GIVEN ITS SPEED IT MAY ARRIVE IN THE BAY AREA BY LATE MONDAY NIGHT
AND MAY NEED TO ADJUST FORECAST FOR TIMING AS WE GET CLOSER. 

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD...THE MRF AND ECMWF MODELS
BRING A 140 KT JET INTO N-CENTRAL CA. THE ECMWF IS ABOUT 12 HOURS
FASTER WITH THIS FEATURE THAN THE MRF...BUT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THE
BEST CHANCE OF HEAVY PRECIP IN THE BAY AREA WILL BE SOMETIME
WEDNESDAY. THEN...THURSDAY THRU FRIDAY...SOME RIDGING OCCURS OVER
CENTRAL CA AND THE JET STARTS TO RETREAT TO THE N. SO IT LOOKS AS
THOUGH CENTRAL CA WILL BE WET ON WEDNESDAY...AND DRY OUT BY FRIDAY
WHILE THE NORTH STAYS WET THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

LOTS OF CI SPILLING INTO NRN/CENTRAL CA THIS MORNING BUT EVEN IN THE
NW WHERE CLOUD HEIGHTS ARE LOWER...NO PRECIP SO FAR. HOWEVER...AS
MAIN PORTION OF BAROCLINIC BAND...CURRENTLY SEEN IN SATELLITE OVER
NRN OREGON SHIFTS SWD...AS MODELS TREND...EXPECT RAINFALL TO BEGIN IN
THE FAR N LATER THIS MORNING. THIS NRN PORTION OF THE DISTRICT WILL
BE QUITE WET FOR QUITE A STRETCH BEGINNING TODAY ACCORDING TO VARIOUS
MODELS. ALL SHOW NEARLY ZONAL STORM TRACK CURRENTLY AT MID LATITUDES
OVER MUCH OF THE PACIFIC...INTO NRN OREGON/WASHINGTON GRADUALLY
SAGGING SWD AND PERSISTING OVER CENTRAL/NRN PORTION OF DISTRICT WELL
INTO NEXT WEEK ONCE IT GETS ESTABLISHED. THIS FIRST IMPULSE BRINGING
RAIN TO THE NW WILL NOT MAKE IT VERY FAR SWD BEFORE DRYING OUT IN
VERY DRY MID LEVEL ANTECEDENT AIRMASS. AVN AND IT/S PARTNER MRF ARE
VERY WET AS THEY HAVE BEEN ALL LATE FALL AND WINTER WHILE NGM/ETA ARE
DRIER AND NOGAPS IS VERY DRY EXCEPT FOR FAR N. VERY DIFICULT TO SAY
HOW FAR MEASUREABLE RAIN WILL FALL WITH AIRMASS SO DRY INITIALLY...
WILL STAY PRETTY CLOSE TO NGM/ETA SOLUTIONS BRINGING CHANCE OF LIGHT
RAIN INTO SF BAY AREA AND ONLY MENTION OF FEW SPRINKLES TO ABOUT MRY
BAY ON FRI. 

IN THE MEANTIME...LESS FOG/LOW CLOUDS REPORTED EARLY THIS MORNING IN
THE CENTRAL COASTAL ZONES. THIS IS A RESULT OF A WEAK OFFSHORE
SURFACE GRADIENT AND LITTLE FOG/LOW CLOUDS IN THE SRN SAC VALLEY
AND THICK CI MOVING ACROSS AREA INHIBITING COOLING. OTHERWISE...
VARIABLE HIGH CLOUDINESS WITH SEASONABLY MILD TEMPERATURES TODAY. A
BIT WARMER TONIGHT AS MORE MID/HIGH CLOUDS ROLL IN FROM BAROCLINIC
ZONE TO N WITH SOME VERY LIGHT PRECIP POSSIBLE IN THE N BAY FROM THIS
SYSTEM OVERNIGHT. AS INDICATED...LIGHT PRECIP IS LIKELY IN THE N SF
BAY AREA ON FRI WITH A FEW DROPS POSSIBLE SWD TO ABOUT MRY BAY/NRN
SNS VALLEY. PART OF THE FORECAST PROBLEM WITH THIS FIRST SYSTEM IS A
WAVE FORECAST TO DEVELOP ALONG BAROCLINIC BAND. ETA MODEL...
ESPECIALLY...SHIFTS PRECIP BACK TO N FRI MORNING...AS A WARM FRONT
JUST AS IT REACHES THE SF BAY AREA. 

IN THE EXTENDED...MORE RAIN MOVES ACROSS NRN CA FRI NIGHT AND EARLY
SAT WITH NEXT WAVE...MENTIONED ABOVE...WITH SOME CLEARING EXCEPT FAR
N LATER SAT. ANOTHER...POSSIBLY STRONGER SHORTWAVE TROF AND
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONTAL BAND IS TRENDED OVER NRN 2/3 OF DISTRICT IN
MRF SUN NIGHT AND YET ANOTHER MON NIGHT/EARLY TUE. MORE OF THESE
IMPULSES ARE TRENDED LATER IN THE WEEK WITH H5 HEIGHTS LOWERING OVER
THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE DISTRICT AS MAIN STORM TRACK SHIFTS SWD
FOR BETTER CHANCE OF SIGNIFICANT PRECIP WITH EACH OF THESE IMPULSES.
FOR WHAT IT/S WORTH...MRF HINTS AT A CHANGE FROM ZONAL FLOW TO A MORE
MERIDIONAL ONE LATE NEXT WEEK...BUT KEEPING STORM TRACK OVER NRN CA.

WE HAVE A MAJOR PATTERN CHANGE DEVELOPING FOR THE WRN U.S...BUT IT
WILL TAKE A WHILE BEFORE OUR FCST AREA IS AFFECTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY
IT...I.E. IT WILL STILL BE A FEW DAYS BEFORE ANY GOOD RAINFALL
REACHES THIS FAR S.  THE FIRST STORM IN A LONG SERIES IS MOVING ONTO
THE WA COAST.  THE ETA FOCUSES AN AREA OF STRONG THICKNESS
DIFFLUENCE/OMEGA/HEAVY PCPN OVER WRN WA LATE TNGT/EARLY THU MRNG. 
THE NEXT IMPULSE SETS UP SIMILAR CONDITIONS FARTHER S...IN WRN OR
LATE THU AFTN.  THE NEXT ONE IS FCST BY THE ETA TO BRING FAR NWRN CA
A GOOD SOAKING FRI AFTN.  BUT...NONE OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE FCST BY THE
ETA TO BRING STRONG DYNAMICS AS FAR S AS EVEN THE NRN SFO BAY AREA
ALTHOUGH THE N BAY IS FCST TO SEE A GOOD INFLUX OF MOISTURE THU
NGT/FRI.  500 MB HEIGHTS REMAIN VERY HIGH...576 DM OR MORE...UNTIL
FRI AFTN WHEN THEY COME DOWN TO 573 AT SFO UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE
THIRD SHORT WAVE MENTIONED ABOVE.  ITS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA TO CHOP
THE POPS A NOTCH OR TWO...LIMITING LIKELY POPS TO THE N BAY FRI AFTN
AND ELIMINATING THE MENTION OF RAIN ENTIRELY S OF SJC THRU FRI.  WILL
UPDATE ZONES TO REFLECT THIS.  

HAVENT SEEN MUCH FOG DEVELOP SO FAR BUT WITH WINDS LIGHT AND TEMP/DP
SPREADS SMALL...EXPECT IT TO MATERIALIZE OVERNIGHT AND WONT CHANGE
THAT PART OF THE FCST.  THE WEAK LOW LEVEL OFFSHORE FLOW SHOULD LIMIT
COASTAL STRATUS...ESPECIALLY AROUND MRY BAY.

IN THE LONGER RANGE...THE MRF IS STILL THE WETTEST OF THE MEDIUM
RANGE MODELS BUT THE EURO/UK ARE NOW IN GOOD AGREEMENT SETTING UP A
STRONG ZONAL FLOW SAT-MON WITH A SHORT WAVE HITTING SHORE FAR ENOUGH
S TO FINALLY BRING RAIN TO OUR FCST AREA ON SUN.  NOGAPS IS DRIEST
AND CONFINES RAIN TO NRN CA THRU MON...THOUGH IT DOES GIVE THE FAR N
MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD.  GIVEN THE TRACK

APPROACHING WEAK SHORT WAVE.  LOW CLOUDS HAVE PRETTY MUCH FILLED THE
BAY WITH A WEAK ONSHORE FLOW AND LIFTING/CONDENSATION OF LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE WEAK FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHORT WAVE. 
THIS MOISTURE IS NOT SHOWN ON THE NEW ETA 950 MB FCST WHICH KEEPS RH
FAIRLY LOW AT THAT LEVEL TNGT.  IT APPEARS WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE

COMPLETELY...SIMILAR TO TDA.  UPDATED ZONES AND CHANGED MAX TEMPS TO
NEAR TDAS LEVELS DUE TO THE EXPECTED CLEARING AND LITTLE CHANGE IN
WARMTH OF AIRMASS ON WED.  WED NGT A FLAT UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER

PROVIDING ENOUGH MIXING TO CLEAR MOST OF THE FOG FROM THE SAC VALLEY. 
PERHAPS THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WILL SEE SOME CLEARING ON WED AS UPPER
TROF SLIDES ACROSS THE SRN SIERRA NEVADA. 

IN THE EXTENDED...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE REASONABLY CLOSE ON THE H5

USUAL...NOGAPS IS WEAKER AND DRIER AS USUAL. BUT...ALL THE MEDIUM
RANGE MODELS INCLUDING THE EURO/UK CONTINUE TO INDICATE A CHANGE TO A
MORE ZONAL FLOW PATTERN ACROSS THE PACIFIC. SATELLITE ALSO SHOWS A
STRONG ZONAL FLOW PATTERN FROM JAPAN TO AROUND 160W IN THE BELT FROM
35-45N. THIS TRANSITION TO A WETTER MORE ZONAL FLOW WILL TAKE SOME
TIME. DEPENDING ON MODEL OF CHOICE...SOME CHANCE OF PRECIP WILL BEGIN
IN THE FAR N WED/THU WITH A BETTER CHANCE OF PRECIP SPREADING OVER

EASTPAC SURFACE HIGH RIDGING INTO PACNW IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE DENSE FOG WHICH HAS SPREAD INTO SFO BAY AREA OVERNIGHT. THE LOW
LEVEL PUSH OF AIR FROM THE N HAS MOVED THE ST/FG IN THE SAC VALLEY
SWD INTO THE ONLY EASY OUTLET...THE WEST DELTA AND CARQUINEZ STRAIT.
THAT MOISTURE THEN SPREAD SWD INTO S SFO BAY AND THE SANTA CLARA
VALLEY. YESTERDAYS COASTAL ST/SC HAS PUSHED OFFSHORE BUT SOME OF THE
RESIDUAL MOISTURE HAS FORMED A RATHER LARGE AREA OF ST/FG IN THE SRN
SNS VALLEY. THE DENSE FOG IN THE SFO BAY AREA WILL LIKELY REMAIN THRU

LOW LEVEL INVERSION HAS NOW DEEPENED WITH FORT ORD PROFILER AND OAK
RAOB SHOWING IT AT LEAST 3000 FEET DEEP.  SURFACE PATTERN IS
CURIOUSLY SPLIT BETWEEN A NWLY ONSHORE FLOW ON THE IMMEDIATE COAST
AND A CONTINUING OFFSHORE FLOW FROM SFO BAY INLAND.  THE END RESULT
OF ALL THIS IS THAT THERE ARE LOW CLOUDS AND FOG ALMOST EVERYWHERE AT
LOW ELEVATIONS OF OUR FCST AREA.  DENSE FOG IS WIDESPREAD IN THE
CNTRL VALLEY BUT THE DEEP INVERSION IN OUR AREA APPEARS TO HAVE
DISPERSED THE MOISTURE ENOUGH TO PRECLUDE DENSE FOG IN MOST PLACES.
THE MODELS FCST A STRENGTHENING NWLY CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT TDA...WITH
INCREASING NW-SW SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENTS.  THEORETICALLY THIS
SHOULD CAUSE MOST OF THE CRUD TO DISPERSE THIS AFTN OVER OUR FCST
AREA.  THE EARLY VISIBLE SAT LOOP MAY BE SHOWING SOME EVIDENCE OF THE
BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS IN THE CLEAR AREA MOVING SEWD DOWN THE
COAST N OF SFO.  

TNGT/FRI THE WINDS FROM 700 MB ON DOWN WILL VEER THROUGH NLY TO NNE. 
THIS OFFSHORE FLOW WILL RESULT IN WARMER TEMPS ALONG THE COAST ON FRI
...AND THE NE WINDS IN THE E BAY HILLS WILL INCREASE.  EFFECTS ON THE

DISPERSES FROM THE SRN SAC VALLEY TDA. WE WILL KNOW MORE BY MID AFTN.

WEATHER FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS. UPPER RIDGE REMAINS FIRMLY IN CONTROL 
THROUGH TUESDAY WITH OFFSHORE FLOW KEEPING TEMPS ABOVE

DELTA WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP SECTIONS OF THE NORTH AND EAST BAY 
COOLER THAN THE REST OF THE REGION. 

THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS RETROGRADE THE RIDGE AND DROP A FEW 
SHORTWAVE TROFS SOUTH OUT OF WRN CANADA THROUGH THE EXTENDED

HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES OVER CA WITH STRONG OFFSHORE FLOW AT THE
SURFACE. THIS HAS LEAD TO SUNNY SKIES THROUGHOUT CA EXCEPT THE
CENTRAL VALLEY WERE WIDESPREAD FOG WILL REMAIN FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL
DAYS EXTENDING INTO THE DELTA DURING THE NIGHTS AND MORNINGS. THE
OFFSHORE FLOW HAS KEPT THE NORTHEAST WINDS OVER THE EAST BAY HILLS
BLOWING FROM 15 TO 25 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 45 MPH TODAY. THE WINDS WILL
DECREASE OVERNIGHT AS THE SURFACE HIGH MOVES SOUTHEASTWARD TOWARD THE
GREAT BASIN. IN ADDITION TO THE GUSTY WINDS THE OFFSHORE FLOW ALSO
WARMED THE BAY AREA TEMPERATURES. SEVERAL RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES
HAVE ALREADY BEEN BROKEN. ALL EXTENDED RANGE MODELS FORECAST THE
RIDGE TO BEGIN WEAKENING BY WEDNESDAY AND HINT AT A SHORT WAVE MOVING

RIDGE CONTINUES OVER OUR DISTRICT WITH GOOD OFFSHORE FLOW.  THE WATER
VAPOR PIX SHOW A DRY SLOT DROPPING SWD THRU THE WRN GREAT BASIN...
INDICATING A SWD SURGE OF HIGH PRESSURE THRU THE BASIN.  THIS WILL
INCREASE OUR OFFSHORE GRADIENT AND WE ARE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE
WINDS IN THE E BAY HILLS THIS MRNG.  SO FAR PREVAILING SPEEDS REMAIN
IN THE 15-30 MPH RANGE WITH GUSTS TO AROUND 45...AS FCST IN THE
EVENING ZONES.  WILL LET THIS FCST RIDE AND STOP SHORT OF A WIND
ADVISORY FOR NOW...THE PREVAILING WIND FLOW INTO OUR REGION WILL VEER
FROM NE TO SE TDA AS THE SURFACE HIGH CONTINUES SWD AND THIS VEERING
PATTERN NORMALLY CAUSES THE WINDS IN THE HILLS TO DECREASE AS THEY
SHIFT OUT OF THE OPTIMUM NE DIRECTION.  

THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS NOW FILLED WITH CRUD FROM MARYSVILLE S WITH
WIDESPREAD DENSE FOG...AND THE ELY SURFACE FLOW IS ADVECTING THE FOG
WWD INTO THE DELTA AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE HAS CROSSED SAN PABLO BAY
AND CONGEALED INTO RATHER THICK FOG AT SANTA ROSA.  WITH THIS PATTERN
CONTINUING...EXPECT RATHER COOL TEMPS IN CITIES IN THE PATH OF THIS
FLOW INCLUDING CONCORD...NAPA...SAN RAFAEL...AND SANTA ROSA.  WILL
CONTINUE MENTION OF AREAS OF DENSE FOG IN THESE AREAS BUT OBS AND
SATELLITE PIX INDICATE ITS FAIRLY LOCALIZED...FOR EXAMPLE IT HAS NOT
GOTTEN OVER ALTAMONT PASS INTO LIVERMORE AND DOESNT APPEAR TO HAVE
REACHED THE DIABLO VALLEY.  DUE TO THIS LIMITED EXTENT OF THE FOG
WONT ISSUE A DENSE FOG ADVISORY AT THIS TIME BUT WILL HAVE TO WATCH
DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY.  

ELSEWHERE IN THE FCST AREA...THE WARM AIR JUST ABOVE THE SURFACE IS
MIXING NICELY DOWN TO SEA LEVEL IN SOME PLACES BUT NOT IN OTHERS.  AT
2 AM THE TEMP WAS 57 AT MOFFETT FIELD AND 39 AT SAN JOSE...JUST A FEW
MILES AWAY ACROSS FLAT TERRAIN.  WILL GENERALLY KEEP TDAS MAXES NEAR
YDAS READINGS...ANTICIPATING DECENT MIXING CONTINUING WITH THE
SLIGHTLY STRONGER OFFSHORE FLOW TDA.  WITH THE LOW LEVEL WINDS
TENDING MORE SELY ON MON THE MIXING SHOULD DECREASE AND MOST SPOTS
AROUND SFO BAY SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER.

THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE STILL ERRATIC.  THE MRF/UK BRING A SHORT
WAVE UNDER THE RIDGE AND ONTO THE CA COAST BY WED WHILE THE EURO
MAINTAINS A STRONG W COAST RIDGE.  EVEN IF THE MRF/UK VERIFY...THE
SHORT WAVE WILL PROBABLY BE WEAKENED SUFFICIENTLY BY ITS BATTLE TO
BUST THRU THE RIDGE TO POSE NO PRECIP THREAT TO THE DISTRICT.  AFTER
A LONG DRY PERIOD SUCH AS THE CURRENT ONE THE FIRST INCOMING SYSTEM
USUALLY FIZZLES OUT IN THIS WAY...PERHAPS SOFTENING UP THE RIDGE SO
THE NEXT SYSTEM CAN MAKE IT THRU WITH SOME PRECIP.  SO...WILL COOL

UPPER RIDGE AXIS HOLDING IN PLACE JUST OFFSHORE. LARGE CIRRUS SHIELD 
RIDING UP OVER RIDGE IS DISSIPATING AS IT MOVES INTO AREA OF 
SUBSIDENCE ON EASTERN SIDE OF RIDGE...BUT SOME THIN CIRRUS WILL 
CONTINUE TO DRIFT OVERHEAD. DEEP UPPER TROF OVER THE MIDWEST. IN 
BETWEEN OUR RIDGE AND MIDWEST TROF IS A FAST MOVING SHORTWAVE MOVING 
THROUGH THE NWLY FLOW. WATER VAPOR SATELLITE LOOPS SHOWS THIS 
FEATURE NICELY AS IT MOVES OVER NEVADA THIS EVENING. THIS 
SHORTWAVE WILL HAVE SOME IMPACTS ON WEATHER IN OUR AREA. FIRST...AS 
IT PASSES...THE SURFACE HIGH OVER THE GREAT BASIN WILL STRENGTHEN 
LATER TONIGHT. THIS WILL LIKELY CAUSE AN INCREASE IN THE EASTERLY 
WINDS OVER THE EAST BAY HILLS BY SUNDAY MORNING. SECOND...THE 
SHORTWAVE WILL USHER IN A SLIGHTLY COOLER AIRMASS OVER NRN AND 
CENTRAL CA THE NEXT FEW DAYS. MODELS SHOW SLOWLY DECREASING 
THICKNESSES AND TEMPS THROUGH MONDAY. SO TREND OF CURRENT FORECAST 
TO COOL HIGHS SOME SEEMS GOOD. BY SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...THE 
GREAT BASIN SURFACE HIGH WEAKENS AND MOVES FURTHER SOUTH. THIS WILL 
RESULT IN A SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW ALONG THE COAST WHICH WILL 
GENERALLY DECREASE TEMPS EXCEPT IN PLACES LIKE MONTEREY WHERE A 
SOUTHERLY FLOW RESULTS IN DOWNSLOPE WARMING.
DEWPOINTS IN THE BAY AREA ARE A BIT HIGHER THIS EVENING THAN LAST 
EVENING SO EXPECT A LITTLE MORE VALLEY FOG. POTENTIAL FOR DENSE FOG 
ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT NEAR THE DELTA. FOG WILL PERSIST THROUGH MUCH OF 
THE MORNING IN AND NEAR THE DELTA AND THE OFFSHORE BREEZES WILL 
ADVECT THE FOG-COOLED AIR INTO THE NORTH BAY THROUGH THE DAY 
SATURDAY. WILL MAKE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS TO ZONES THIS EVENING FOR FOG 
AND TEMPS.

INTO THE REGION ALOFT.  AS OF 1 AM THERE WAS LITTLE FOG IN THE
VALLEYS OF OUR CWA...BUT DENSE FOG WAS BECOMING EXTENSIVE IN THE
CNTRL VALLEY...MORE SO IN THE SAC VALLEY THAN LAST NIGHT.  WITH THE
CONTINUING ELY OFFSHORE FLOW AT THE SURFACE...THE COOL DAMP AIR
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FOG WILL ADVECT WWD THRU THE CARQUINEZ STRAIT
TDA...HOLDING TEMPS DOWN AT CITIES IN ITS PATH LIKE NAPA AND SAN
RAFAEL...AND IN THE CITY AND AT SFO.  WILL SLIDE MAXES DOWN A LITTLE
FROM YDAS READINGS IN THOSE AREAS.  STILL EXPECT TEMPS TO BE NEAR
NORMAL OR ABOVE AS THE INVERSION IS VERY SHALLOW AND ANY FOG WILL
BURN OFF TO HAZY SUNSHINE BY MIDDAY AT THE LATEST.  AS USUAL IN THIS
PATTERN THE BEST WEATHER WILL BE ON THE COAST FROM MRY BAY SWD...WITH
BALMY TEMPS APPROACHING 70.  MODELS INDICATE THE OFFSHORE FLOW WILL
BECOME A LITTLE STRONGER TNGT/SUN AS HIGH PRESSURE DROPS INTO THE
INTERMOUNTAIN REGION AND GREAT BASIN IN THE WAKE OF THE STRONG STORM
MOVING INTO THE OHIO VALLEY.  THIS WILL ENHANCE THE ELY FLOW THRU THE
CARQUINEZ STRAIT...AND MAY STOKE UP THE NE WINDS OVER THE E BAY HILLS
